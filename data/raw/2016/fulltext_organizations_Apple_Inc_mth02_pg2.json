        "title": "Google Joins Race to Speed Up Mobile Delivery of News Articles",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you conduct a Google search on your smartphone for a newsy topic \u2014 say, \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2014 the results starting on Wednesday will include a horizontal carousel of news articles, each with a little lightning bolt icon and the letters AMP at the bottom. Click on any one of the articles, and it will come up immediately, with no wait.\nThe fast-loading format,developed by Google with input from a wide range of publishers, is the latest effort by online publications to solve a problem that is the bane of smartphone users everywhere: Most mobile web pages take too long to load.\nThe sluggishness is due in part to how websites tend to be built \u2014 old and new technologies are often mixed together on a page.\nBut it is also because publishers have filled their pages with more and more widgets that deliver advertising and collect data on their users as media companies try to find ways to make money in a world where ad revenue is quickly shrinking.\nGoogle\u2019s approach, called AMP, or Accelerated Mobile Pages, strips out much of that invisible bloat while preserving the look of the web page and most of the ads.\nThe company\u2019s push to make AMP a new mobile standard comes as Facebook is expanding a competing program, calledInstant Articles, to speed the display of news articles and videos on its social network. Starting in April, Facebook\u2019s new format can be used by anyone with a web page.\nBoth Internet companies see fast-loading, high-quality content as important to keeping people searching the web and scrolling through their social news feeds.\n\u201cWe have said for a long time, speed matters,\u201d said Richard Gingras, who heads news products at Google. \u201cThere is very powerful common cause between Google and publishers. It\u2019s crucial to have a healthy, open web.\u201d\nFor publishers, which are dependent on Google and Facebook for much of their traffic, working with the companies could hold the key to their future customers. Major media companies, including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Vox Media, BuzzFeed, The Guardian and The New York Times, are participating in both projects as they try to figure out how best to increase traffic and find new loyal readers, while also bringing in revenue from the new formats.\n\u201cWe want to be where our readers are,\u201d said Kimberly Lau, vice president and general manager of The Atlantic\u2019s digital properties.\nThe Atlantic was one of the first partners in the Instant Articles project with Facebook, whichbegan public testing in May. Ms. Lau said that about 10 percent of the magazine\u2019s overall web traffic was now coming from Instant Articles and 25 percent from other Facebook referrals.\nBut Facebook has not shared enough information about the Instant Articles viewership for her to have determined if it was worth giving up the extra ads that are forbidden with Instant Articles.\n\u201cThe assumption is that the better user experience will deliver more for us. But the jury is still out,\u201d she said.\nMs. Lau and other publishing executives have high hopes for Google\u2019s approach, which is more open than Facebook\u2019s and allows for more types of ads and more data collection about users.\nGoogle worked for months with content publishers, advertising companies and other partners to develop a new open standard for creating mobile web pages that use as little as one-tenth the data of traditional pages and load up to four times faster.\nFrom the start, preserving the ads while speeding them up was a priority. That meant bringing in advertising technology companies and pushing them to improve their load times.\nOutbrain, which offers an ad product used by many news sites that refers readers to articles by other publications, was blocked by Instant Articles, but the company jumped at the chance to retool its technology so it would work with AMP.\n\u201cGoogle has definitely done a good job of skinnying up the page,\u201d said Matt Crenshaw, Outbrain\u2019s vice president for product marketing.\nPublishers have generally praised Google\u2019s open approach, and many said the company was responsive to their particular concerns.\nThe Times, for example, relies heavily on digital subscriptions, with close to 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, and has a corporate goal of doubling its digital revenue by 2020. Google worked closely with The Times to track how many articles visitors were viewing and to prompt them to subscribe when they hit their monthly limit of free articles.\n\u201cThe way that the meter works is really similar to our current mobile experience,\u201d said Kate Harris, The Times\u2019s director of product who oversees mobile platforms and heads the AMP project. \u201cIt\u2019s truly been a company-to-company collaboration. They flew in a bunch of engineers last week, and we were in a room for many hours,\u201d working on final details.\nFacebook has been working on a subscription option for months, but still has not offered a solution to publishers that rely on that model.\nWill Cathcart, the Facebook vice president for product management who oversees Instant Articles, said that hundreds of publishers were participating in the project.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really pleased with how it\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing consumers read more, and they are more likely to share articles they read with their friends.\u201d\nHe said Facebook was working with publishers to solve specific problems like subscriptions and to share more data while also protecting the privacy of its users.\nMelissa Bell, vice president of growth and analytics at Vox Media, which is using Instant Articles and AMP, said Vox is overhauling the mobile performance of all its sites, which include Vox.com, SB Nation and Curbed.\nInteractive graphics, for example, can weigh down a page. \u201cWould it be better to have three graphics that are side by side?\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cYou have to think about this with every story you create.\u201d\nJulia Beizer, director of product at The Washington Post, said that her publication was an eager participant in all of the experiments, including the nascent News app from Apple, which highlights articles from various publishers on the company\u2019s iPhones and iPads.\nShe said Apple News had sent The Post an unexpected surge of new readers to its science, health and food articles. She credits Instant Articles with sending The Post more repeat visitors. And AMP has cut the time it takes to load a Post mobile web page from three seconds or four seconds to just over half a second.\nNot all of The Post\u2019s ads transfer properly to the other platforms, she said, and each project takes up valuable time and resources. But right now, publishers need to try it all.\n\u201cOur interest in going so aggressively at these platforms is learning as much as we can,\u201d Ms. Beizer said. \u201cAnd we have something to offer those companies as well.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response",
        "fulltext": "After a federal court orderedApple to help unlock an iPhoneused by an attacker in a December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, penned apassionate letterwarning of far-reaching implications beyond the case.\nThe response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets.\nLate on Wednesday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google,said on Twitterthat law enforcement demands to hack customer devices and data \u201ccould be a troubling precedent.\u201d Not long afterward, Reform Government Surveillance, a coalition formed by Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook,released a broad statementthat did not mention the Apple case or Mr. Cook\u2019s letter but said technology companies should not be required to put \u201cback doors\u201d \u2014 the equivalent of a tech entryway \u2014 into their products.\nIt took almost another 24 hours for Facebook and Twitter to weigh in. On Thursday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive,postedthat the company stands with Mr. Cook and Apple. Facebook issued a statement that did not mention Apple but said it would \u201cfight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems.\u201d\nAsked about Apple\u2019s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.\nThe range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies\u2019 responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said.\n\u201cThe issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. \u201cThose companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it\u2019s not them in the spotlight.\u201d\ntranscript\nna\nMr. Cook vowed to fight a federal court order that the company help the F.B.I.bypass security measures on the iPhonebecause he fears complying could seriously weaken privacy protections for Apple\u2019s customers. If the government is successful, lawyers and privacy advocates warn, other tech companies could be approached to provide back doors into their products for law enforcement.\nSome Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook\u2019s position on privacy.\n\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,\u201d Mr. Koum wrote. \u201cToday our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\u201d\nBut behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance.\nAll of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\nIn its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201d\nThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.\nIf Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.\nPrivacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.\nMarc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201d\nPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.\n\u201cA few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer,\u201d Mr. Cook wrote ina letter on privacyposted on Apple\u2019s site in 2014. \u201cYou\u2019re the product.\u201d\nApple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\n\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201d"

        "title": "In the Government vs. Apple, Who Wears the Black Hat?",
        "fulltext": "THE dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over access to the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen in the San Bernardino massacre, comes down to this question: Shouldn\u2019t the government have more legal and moral authority to weigh complicated issues of privacy and national security than a company that makes phones?\nIt should. After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security.\nApple had obeyed a demand to provide the government with the information in Mr. Farook\u2019s iCloud account. But then it was asked to undermine the phone\u2019s security system so the F.B.I. could try as many passcodes as possible to open the phone without erasing the stored data. Apple refused. On Friday, the Justice Departmentfiled a motionsaying that Apple\u2019s objections had little to do with security but appeared \u201cto be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d\nThe government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn\u2019t done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly.\nIn one project, revealed in October 2013 by journalists tipped off by Edward Snowden, the N.S.A., along with its British counterpart, essentially hacked into fiber-optic cables that connected the data centers of Google and Yahoo outside the United States. Under American law, the agency already had access to some of the information, but it tapped the lines anyway.\nSilicon Valley companies love to celebrate the hacker spirit, but they don\u2019t like being on the receiving end. By November 2013, both Google and Yahoo announced that they were encrypting data traveling between its server centers. By the following September, Apple announced that its new phones would by default encrypt data stored on the device in such a way that even the company itself couldn\u2019t get at it.\nAt the time, this seemed like a hopelessly geeky version of Mad magazine\u2019s \u201cSpy vs. Spy,\u201d with opponents one-upped with algorithms rather than cartoon bombs. But the fight led directly to Tuesday\u2019s ruling by a federal magistrate judge in California that Apple must help the F.B.I. unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. The laws governing online privacy are woefully out-of-date. To compel Apple to help execute a warrant, the judge cited the All Writs Act of 1789, enacted before there was electricity.\nIn Apple\u2019s public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.\u2019s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones.\nBy analogy, the company doesn\u2019t have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It\u2019s hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple\u2019s phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death.\nThe United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora\u2019s box that can\u2019t be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions.\nWhat we really need is a robust public conversation around strong privacy laws that would apply to the government and private companies alike and clear limits on what should be done with data. Important choices about the future of technology and privacy should be made by the American people and their representatives, not by Silicon Valley, where even the noblest intentions are mixed with huge financial stakes. If the government wants the power to compel companies to undermine their own security systems, it should go to Congress and ask for it.\nUntil then, we are left with Silicon Valley executives making engineering decisions that could determine what information the government can and can\u2019t have. That\u2019s both bad policy and fundamentally undemocratic.\nBut the current choice is between a government that doesn\u2019t seem to recognize limits to its own power to access personal information and a technology company that does. It\u2019s a bad choice, but an obvious one. While nobody elected Mr. Cook to protect our privacy, we should be glad someone is."

        "fulltext": "Q.How can I transfer files from a 10-year-old Dell PC to a MacBook Pro?\nA.Crossing platforms from a Windows machine to a Mac can be as simple as copying folders and files from the PC onto an external USB drive, and then connecting the drive to the Mac and copying the files there. OS X can easily handle most common formats, like .jpg photos, .mp3 music files, text documents and browser bookmarks. You may need to invest in the Mac equivalents of certain programs, like Microsoft Office, if you want to use Office files in familiar surroundings, but you can also find inexpensive or free equivalents likeOffice Online,Google Docsor Apple\u2019siWork for iCloudto work with the documents.\nMoving files between the two computers over a network connection is another approach. You canset up the Windows PC to share files with the MacBookover a network connection orconnect the two computersto copy files.\nManually relocating your files can be tedious, and you may have to do a lot of digging around on the PC to find everything you want to transfer, but Apple has a free piece of software that may simplify the moving process.\nTheWindows Migration Assistant tool, available to download from Apple\u2019s site, works with PCs running Windows XP and later. When the PC and the Mac are connected to each other on the same network (or linked directly to each other with an Ethernet cable), the Windows Migration Assistant can transfer email accounts, browser bookmarks, contacts, calendars, certain system settings, photos, videos, iTunes content and other files from the home directory on the PC \u2014 and put everything in the right place on the Mac.

Today I will have cheesecake for lunch, and tonight I am in search of the best cannoli for dinner.\nFarhad:I assume you\u2019ll be making a visit to some sidewalk hot dog vendors and greasy-spoon halal carts? And what about the Times Square Olive Garden? It sounds like you\u2019re in for some gastric distress.\nMike:Well, I\u2019m saving Guy Fieri\u2019srestaurant for last. It\u2019ll be an excellent trip to \u201cflavortown, U.S.A.,\u201d as it were.\nOn with the show! If you haven\u2019t noticed, this week is all about Apple, Apple, Apple. The company is in the midst of astandoff with the F.B.I.on whether or not it will help the agency gain access to an iPhone used by attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings in December. It\u2019s a tricky mess, and we\u2019reunpacking new facetspractically by the hour.\nFarhad:Beyond the legal and national security implications of this story, I found the tech-industry dynamics interesting. Apple\u2019s position is far more impassioned than I can ever recall seeing from a tech company; it really seemslike Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is personally animated by the privacy debate. That position is also, of course, compatible with Apple\u2019s business model, which does not rely on data-mining and ad sales,as Mr. Cook is quick to remind people.Reactionfrom the rest of tech was mixed. Google\u2019s response to the case was muted, I thought \u2014 in a series of tweets, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, offered what sounded likehalfhearted support for Apple\u2019s position. Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile,sided more clearly with Apple.\nI\u2019m curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple\u2019s side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.\nMike:That\u2019s pretty much par for the course for you, yeah?\nIn other security news, a Los Angeles hospital paid a ransom of about $17,000 \u2014 in the form of 40 Bitcoin \u2014 to a gang ofhackers who unleashed malwareon the hospital\u2019s network. The most shocking part of this story was hearing that people still use Bitcoin.\nYahoo continues to lay off people, and itaxed a bunch of verticalsit promoted heavily under Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s chief. And Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product is going wide, which could spawn a whole newgeneration of underpaid bloggers.\nFarhad:Hey, Mike, you did it again. You forgot Zenefits! This week there was lots more news about this once highflying insurance start-up. In a column, I argued that the company wasplagued by an obsession with hypergrowth, one that was spurred by its huge investment rounds. And Will Alden of BuzzFeed reported on awhole bunch of frathouse shenanigansat the company. Also, David Sacks, the new C.E.O., banneddrinking on the job!\nMike:Sorry, but I have a setting in my brain that lets me sleep with my eyes open when hearing the phrase \u201chighflying insurance start-up.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.\nKanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.\nSo does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?\nBefore you answer that, I want to note that the new album is good, and Kanye is totally nuts onTwitter. Like, worse than you and I.\nFarhad:I have taken a bold stance on this:Kanye is bad at Twitter. Really bad.\nAbout Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).\nThis is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.\nThat\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.\nI chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.\nMike:The structure for consumers is bad. I, personally, would love one subscription to get everything \u2014 all my favorite shows, all that jazz \u2014 without having to pay for 19 plans. It would be wonderful.\nBut there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.\nAnd that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.\nThat\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.\nThe big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.\nIn sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.\nOr maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.\nFarhad:And did I mention he\u2019s bad at Twitter? He is.\nMike:O.K., tonight I leave in search of the ultimate ramen shop. Do you know of any good ones in Brooklyn?\nFarhad:You know what? I\u2019ve never been to Brooklyn. Honestly. And hopefully I never will. Bye!"

        "title": "Justice Department Calls Apple\u2019s Refusal to Unlock iPhone a \u2018Marketing Strategy\u2019",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department, frustrated by its inability to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino killings, demanded on Friday that a judge immediately order Apple to give it the technical tools to get inside the phone.\nApple\u2019s refusal \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy\u201d rather than a legal rationale, prosecutors said in a court filing that further escalated the confrontation between the Obama administration and Apple.\n\u201cThis is not the end of privacy,\u201d the Justice Department declared, a mocking reference to Apple\u2019s rationale for contesting the court order prosecutors obtained from a judge directing Apple to help them break into the phone.\nThe sharply worded, 25-page motion to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation seemed aimed as much at swaying public opinion as influencing the federal magistrate judge in Riverside, Calif., who issued the order to Apple.\nA blistering open letter this week from Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, had rallied many privacy advocates behind the company, and law enforcement officials said that the latest volley from the Justice Department on Friday was meant largely to rebut Mr. Cook\u2019s arguments and buttress the government\u2019s own case.\nApple executives, speaking with reporters after the filing on the condition that they not be identified by name, said they were puzzled by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to rush back into court before the company even had a chance to respond to this week\u2019s court order.\nThey reiterated their concerns that the government\u2019s novel demands would endanger the privacy and security of all of their iPhone customers in the future, and said they remained determined to fight the government\u2019s demands.\nApple has until next week to respond to an order by a California magistrate this week compelling it to provide the technical assistance that the F.B.I. says it needs to get into the phone.\nBut the Justice Department sought to pre-empt Apple\u2019s response with its own filing on Friday, saying Apple has already made its opposition publicly known and that the \u201curgency of this investigation\u201d demands faster action.\n\u201cRather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court\u2019s order,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cApple has responded by publicly repudiating that order.\u201d\nThey went on to accuse Apple of exaggerating how difficult it would be for the company\u2019s computer engineers to come up with a way to get into the phone and to disable an \u201cauto-erase\u201d feature that permanently deletes the data inside after 10 failed password attempts.\nThe Justice Department filed this motion on Friday asking a federal judge to immediately force Apple to help open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.\n\u201cAt no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the order or that the order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging software development task,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cOn this point, Apple\u2019s silence speaks volumes.\u201d\nThe Justice Department wants to force Apple to write software that would allow the government to try millions of random password combinations to get into the phone.\nApple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company\u2019s engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.\nThe Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone \u2014 something the company does regularly.\nApple executives acknowledged on Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.\nIn his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Mr. Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a \u201cchilling\u201d attack on privacy and Internet security.\nApple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Mr. Cook\u2019s strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company\u2019s business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple\u2019s business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.\nWith this week\u2019s dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to Apple and the F.B.I. on inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a hearing.\nThe lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the public debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations \u201chas now come to a critical juncture\u201d with this week\u2019s order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s latest filing on Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.\nAmong other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the F.B.I concluded, none of those options would work. Among other problems, the default system that backed up the phone on the iCloud had been disabled \u2014 apparently by Mr. Farook \u2014 in October, six weeks before the shootings.\nIn its filing, the Justice Department suggested repeatedly that Apple has put its \u201cmarketing concerns\u201d above its corporate responsibility to comply with a lawful order to assist law enforcement.\n\u201cApple is not above the law in that regard,\u201d the filing said."

        "fulltext": "Q.Do they still make USB television tuners for Mac? I can\u2019t seem to find any that work in this country. What are other options for cord-cutters and people without TVs to watch live television on a Mac?\nA.Mac-friendly television tuners on USB sticks have become hard to find, especially since Elgato, one of the major manufacturers,stopped selling the devices in North America last year. Elgato alsodiscontinued its EyeTV Lite softwarefor the tuners and does not support it on the current version of Mac OS X. (For Mac owners who bought Elgato EyeTV tuner hardware before the company abandoned the continent, Elgato does offera $30 upgrade to its EyeTV 3 softwarefor recording and managing television shows on the computer.)\nIf you hunt around online long enough, you may be able to find some of Elgato\u2019s discontinued USB tuners for Mac (as well as the also defunctPCTV for Mac HD Mini Stickor theAVerTV Hybrid Volar M) on reseller sites or eBay. Be warned that the markup on outdated models from some resellers is exorbitant, especially when the tuners originally cost around $150 or less. As some TV tuner devices are designed to work with international broadcast television standards, make sure any device you are considering can receive theA.T.S.C.orClear Q.A.M. digitalsignals used in North America.\nIf you cannot find a discontinued or used Mac-compatible USB TV tuner, you have other options for watching live TV on your computer. For instance,Hauppauge, which makes a number of TV tuner add-ons forWindowsand Microsoft\u2019sXbox One game console, sells theBroadway box\u2014 a $150 gadget that connects to adigital TV antennaand your home network to pull in over-the-air broadcasts that can be watched on the Mac. (TheBroadway\u2019s user guide is onlinefor those who want to know what to expect in terms of setup and configuration.)\nWebsites that collect live streams from television stations worldwide (likeFilmOn,StreemaandwwiTV.com) can be another source of content, and the apps and sites for local channels may also have live streams available.SlingTV, a $20-a-monthpackage of live TV channels, hasan app for the Macand is yet another way to watch real-time broadcasts on your computer."

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Backs Apple in Its Refusal to Unlock iPhone",
        "fulltext": "BARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg on Monday threw his support behind Apple in its bitter battle with the United States government over attempts to gain access to information protected by the company\u2019s sophisticated encryption technology.\nSpeaking at the Mobile World Congress, an annual tech and telecommunications conference here, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would play its part in the fight against global terrorism, but that weakening the digital security of technology companies was a bad idea.\nA federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department\u2019s request, recentlyordered Appleto bypass security functions on the phone of a gunman in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. But the company has refused to comply with that order, fearful that it could be forced to create a so-called back door to its encryption technology that could be misused by government agencies.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, in reference to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments mirror previous statements that Facebook and other global tech companieshave madein support of Apple\u2019s standoff with the government.\nWhile these companies have said they would comply, when legally obliged to, with handing over information on their users, they say they believe that creating technological back doors to their digital systems can lead to potential abuse by governments worldwide.\nFor Facebook, which has almost 1.6 billion global users, the encryption debate is only one of the growing number of policy hurdles that the company needs to overcome as it expands its global presence.\nIn India, one of the company\u2019s largest markets, the country\u2019s national regulators this monthbannedfree mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. Facebook had introduced Free Basics, which offered people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the company\u2019s social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services.\nSpeaking on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company wanted to offer Internet connectivity to the developing world that did not have digital access and that Facebook would look for ways to continue doing that in India and beyond.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to the mission that we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said about the recent decision in India that outlawed Free Basics. \u201cWhat works in one country may not work in another.\u201d\nDespite his attempts to downplay the setback, the recent decision by Indian regulators has put Facebook and its 31-year-old chief executive in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality.\nInternet giants like Facebook and Google can expect more scrutiny around the world as they continue to expand, said Pierre Louette, a deputy chief executive of Orange, the former French telecommunications monopoly. When confronted with this scrutiny, he added, tech companies may look to build bridges with traditional telecom operators that have faced similar regulatory challenges for decades.\n\u201cThey need more friends than before,\u201d said Mr. Louette, in reference to global tech companies."
