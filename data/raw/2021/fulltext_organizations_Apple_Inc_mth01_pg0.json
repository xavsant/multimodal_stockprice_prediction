        "title": "How Parler, a Chosen App of Trump Fans, Became a Test of Free Speech",
        "fulltext": "From the start, John Matze had positionedParleras a \u201cfree speech\u201d social network where people could mostly say whatever they wanted. It was a bet that had recently paid off big asmillions of President Trump\u2019s supporters, fed up with what they deemed censorship on Facebook and Twitter, flocked to Parler instead.\nOn the app, which had become a top download on Apple\u2019s App Store, discussions over politics had ramped up. But so had conspiracy theories that falsely said the election had been stolen from Mr. Trump, with users urging aggressive demonstrations last week when Congress met to certify the election of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\nThose calls for violence soon came back to haunt Mr. Matze, 27, a software engineer from Las Vegas and Parler\u2019s chief executive. By Saturday night, Apple and Google hadremoved Parler from their app storesand Amazon said it would no longer host the site on its computing services, saying it hadnot sufficiently policed poststhat incited violence and crime.\nEarly on Monday morning, just after midnight on the West Coast, Parler appeared to have gone offline.\nThose moves had set off a furious effort to keep Parler up. Mr. Matze said on Sunday that he was racing to save the data of Parler\u2019s roughly 15 million users from Amazon\u2019s computers. He was also calling company after company to find one willing to support Parler with hundreds of computer servers.\n\u201cI believe Amazon, Google, Apple worked together to try and ensure they don\u2019t have competition,\u201d Mr. Matze said on Parler late Saturday. \u201cThey will NOT win! We are the worlds last hope forfree speechand free information.\u201d He said the app would probably shut down \u201cfor up to a week as we rebuild from scratch.\u201d\nParler\u2019s plight immediately drew condemnation from those on the right, who compared the big tech companies to authoritarian overlords. Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that \u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d and asked his followers to text him to stay in touch. Lou Dobbs, the right-wing commentator, wrote on Parler that the app had a strong antitrust case against the tech companies amid such \u201cperilous times.\u201d\nParler has now become a test case in arenewed national debate over free speechon the internet and whether tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon have too much power. That debate has intensified sinceMr. Trump was barred from posting on TwitterandFacebooklast week after a violent mob, urged on by the president and his social media posts, stormed the Capitol.\nFor years, Facebook and Twitter haddefended people\u2019s ability to speak freelyon their sites, while Amazon, Apple, Google and others had stayed mostly hands-off with apps like Parler. That allowed misinformation and falsehoods to flow across online networks.\nThe tech companies\u2019 actions last week to limit such toxic content with Mr. Trump and Parler have been applauded by liberals and others. But the moves also focused attention on the power of theseprivate enterprises to decidewho stays online and who doesn\u2019t. And the timing struck some as politically convenient, with Mr. Biden set to take office on Jan. 20 and Democrats gaining control of Congress.\nThe tech companies\u2019 newly proactive approach also provides grist for Mr. Trump in the waning days of his administration. Even as he faces anotherpotential impeachment, Mr. Trump is expected to try stoking anger at Twitter, Facebook and others this week, potentially as a launchpad for competing with Silicon Valley head on when he leaves the White House. After he was barred from Twitter, Mr. Trump said in a statement that he would \u201clook at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future.\u201d\nBen Wizner, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said it was understandable that no company wanted to be associated with the \u201crepellent speech\u201d that encouraged the breaching of the Capitol. But he said Parler\u2019s situation was troubling.\nThat was because Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s removal of Parler from their app stores and Amazon\u2019s halting its web hosting went beyond what Twitter or Facebook do when they curtail a user\u2019s account or their posts, he said. \u201cI think we should recognize the importance of neutrality when we\u2019re talking about the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d he said.\nInearlier statements, Apple, Amazon and Google said that they had warned Parler about the violent posts on its site and that it had not done enough to consistently remove them. The companies said they required sites like Parler to systematically enforce their rules. They declined to comment further on Sunday.\nTech companies pulling support for certain websites is not new. In 2018, Gab, another alternative to Facebook and Twitter that is popular among the far right, was forced offline after it lost support from other companies, including PayPal and GoDaddy, because it had hosted anti-Semitic posts by a man whoshot and killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.Gab later came backonline with the help of a Seattle company, Epik, which hosts other far-right websites.\nEven with Parler going dark, right-wing personalities like Mr. Nunes who have built followings on the app do not lack other communication channels. Many still have ample followings on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which welcome any user who doesn\u2019t violate their rules, which prohibit threatening violence or posting hate speech.\nParler was founded in 2018 by Mr. Matze and a fellow programmer, one of several social-media upstarts that aimed to capitalize on the growing anger of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters with Silicon Valley. But Parler had a significant advantage: money. Rebekah Mercer, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest donors, helped bankroll the site. Other investors includeDan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and Fox News pundit. It plans to eventually make money by selling ads.\nThe app is essentially a Twitter clone. It enables people to broadcast messages \u2014 known as \u201cparleys,\u201d not \u201ctweets\u201d \u2014 to followers. Users can also comment on and \u201cecho\u201d \u2014 not \u201cretweet\u201d \u2014 other users\u2019 posts. When signing up for a new account, people are asked to select their favorite color and are urged to choose from a list of conservative voices to follow, including Mr. Nunes, the Fox News host Sean Hannity and the actress Kirstie Alley.\nThese \u201cinfluencers\u201d dominate the experience on the site. On Sunday, the Parler newsfeed was a stream of their angry \u201cparleys,\u201d railing at Big Tech and pleading with their followers to follow them elsewhere.\n\u201cPlease sign up for my daily newsletter today, before the tech totalitarians ban everything,\u201d wrote Mr. Bongino, who also controls one ofFacebook\u2019s most popular pages.\nParler grew slowly until early 2020, whenTwitter began labeling Mr. Trump\u2019s tweetsas inaccurate and some of his supporters joined Parler in protest. After November\u2019s election,Parler grew even more quicklyas Facebook and Twitter clamped down on false claims that the vote had been rigged. So many users signed up that, at times, they overloaded the company\u2019s systems and forced it to pause new registrations.\nIn total, people downloaded Parler\u2019s app more than 10 million times last year, with 80 percent in the United States, according to Sensor Tower, the app data firm.\nLast Wednesday, Mr. Trump encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol to pressure lawmakers to overturn his election loss, leading to a rampage that left five people dead. The rally was planned on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere. On Parler,people postedadvice on which streets to take to avoid the police; some posted about carrying guns inside the Capitol.\nIn an interviewwith The New York Times hours after the mob stormed the Capitol, Mr. Matze said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we\u2019re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law.\u201d\nBut on Friday, Apple and Google told Parler that it needed to more consistently remove posts that encouraged violence. By Saturday, Apple and Google had removed Parler from their app stores, limiting its ability to reach new users on virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones.\n\u201cThere is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,\u201d Apple said in a statement. Google said, \u201cWe do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.\u201d\nLate Saturday, Amazon told Parler that it would need to find a new place to host its site. Amazon said it had sent Parler 98 examples of posts on its site that encouraged violence, but many remained online.\n\u201cWe cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,\u201d Amazon said.\nAmazon said it would preserve Parler\u2019s data so it could move it to other computer servers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Mr. Matze told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just these three companies. Every vendor, from text message services to email providers to our lawyers, all ditched us, too, on the same day.\u201d He said he was struggling to find another company to host Parler\u2019s website.\nBut Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview that the app had heard from several companies that wanted to help. He declined to name them.\n\u201cWhat Parler will look like a month from now, I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Parler will not be gone.\u201d"

        "title": "Your App Knows You Got Your Period. Guess Who It Told?",
        "fulltext": "\u2014 Carolyn Witte, chief executive and co-founder of the women\u2019s health clinic Tia\nIn Her Words is available as a newsletter.Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.\nEvery day, Flo, a women\u2019s health app, invites its more than 100 million users to enter intimate details about their bodies that they might not share even with their closest friends or family: the color and consistency of vaginal discharge, the length of their periods, whether they had protected or unprotected sex, whether they feel frisky or have a low libido.\nFor many, this level of detail helps keep track of and demystify the reproductive cycle from its most fertile days to its least.\nUsers with privacy concerns might have found comfort inFlo\u2019s promiseto keep select information collected through its app secret, noting that, even as it might share some personal data with other companies, it would not disclose details about \u201ccycles, pregnancy, symptoms notes and other information that is entered by you.\u201d\nIt turns out that promise was misleading, regulators say.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the company behind Flo, which was founded in 2015, passed on certain intimate health details of its users to marketing and analytics companies like Facebook and Google, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which fileda complaintin January saying it had reason to believe that the company had misled its users.\nThe agency said that Flo\u2019s data-sharing practices had allowed third-party companies to use that \u201cpersonal health information expansively,including for advertising,\u201d though both Flo and Google said last week that the information had not been used for advertising. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnd here lies the crux of the problem with women\u2019s consumer health technology, or \u201cfemtech\u201d as it is known in investor speak: The sheer volume of data collected in apps like Flo is ripe for privacy violations, but that same data may also open the door to unraveling some ofthe biggest, understudied riddles of female health.\n\u201cWith the data collected by these products, we have huge opportunities to improve our collective understanding of female health and well-being in really powerful ways,\u201d said Carolyn Witte, chief executive and co-founder of Tia, a membership-based women\u2019s health clinic, nodding to the shallow understanding of women\u2019s bodies and reproductive health.\nBut, Ms. Witte added, there is now an unregulated gray area surrounding the health data users provide in these apps that, were it shared with a doctor, would be protected by strict patient privacy law.\nIn the United States, about one in five women between the ages of 18 and 49 currently use health apps \u2014 those that track fitness, nutrition, sleep and other health-related metrics \u2014 according toa Gallup pollconducted in November. And femtech in particular, including medical devices,by some estimates, could become a $50 billion market by 2025 \u2014 a small slice of the broader global digital health market (including telemedicine, wearable devices and so on), which is expected to reach$600 billion by 2024.\nBut as long as health apps make only general wellness claims \u2014 like meditation apps marketed to soothe you to sleep \u2014 they do not need to be vetted by federal health regulators. Moreover, and to the surprise of many users, those consumer health apps also generally do not have to comply with a federal privacy law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, which specifically covers patient data collected by and shared among doctors, hospitals, labs and health insurers.\nIn other words, the personal health data you enter into consumer apps \u2014 even apps that you have to pay for \u2014 are not protected by federal safeguards for patient privacy.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, which enforces fair business rules, may crack down on apps that break their privacy promises, which is what regulators charged in the Flo case.\nFlo agreed to settle the F.T.C. charges. The proposed settlement prohibits Flo Health, the company that owns Flo, from misleading users about its data-handling practices. It also requires Flo to obtain users\u2019 consent before sharing their health details and to obtain an independent review of its privacy practices.\nIn settling the case, Flo did not admit to any wrongdoing. The company said in a statement that it had used third-party analytical tools in the past \u201cto gain a better understanding of how our users interact with our app and ultimately enhance\u201d their experience and that users\u2019 data had been used \u201csolely for analytical purposes.\u201d The company added that the app does not share information about users\u2019 health without their permission.\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users\u2019 personal health data is absolutely paramount,\u201d the company statement added.\nPrivacy experts said the Flo case could cause wider user mistrust of women\u2019s health apps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become even more cynical than just \u2018buyer beware,\u2019\u201d Deven McGraw, the chief regulatory officer of Ciitizen, a company that helps people gain access to and control their health information, said of consumer health apps. \u201cYou did your homework. You read this app\u2019s privacy policy. You thought you were putting your data in a trusted place. And turns out that the company didn\u2019t take its obligation seriously.\u201d\nFlo certainly isn\u2019t the only app accused of mishandling intimate data. In 2019, Privacy International, a nonprofit group in Britain, studied a number of popular period-tracking apps s andreported that two of themtransmitted sensitive information \u2014 such as details on users\u2019 symptoms and contraceptive use \u2014 to Facebook and other companies.\nOver the last two years,lawmakersandstate attorneys generalin the U.S. have begun scrutinizing period-tracking and fertility apps. Last March, several members of Congress sent letters to Apple and Google asking the companies to remove any period trackers that collected users\u2019 health data without obtaining their explicit permission, in an attempt to place more responsibility on the gatekeepers.\nIn the European Union, the onus is squarely on app developers, giving consumers broad rights to control their data. In particular, a comprehensive E.U. law \u2014 called the General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 typically requires companies to obtain explicit permission before collecting or sharing sensitive personal information like health details.\nDeceptive data mining, misleading privacy policies and other troubling practices do not negate the need for women\u2019s health apps. But regulators going after leaky apps, one by one, doesn\u2019t give consumers much confidence or clarity either.\nWhat\u2019s needed, experts suggest, is a new regulatory framework that enables health care providers and researchers to work with consumer apps to better understand women\u2019s health, whether it\u2019s symptoms, medications or different responses to disease.\nUntil recently,women have been underrepresentedin medical research, clinical trials for drugs and vaccines, and even biology textbooks, leaving health care providers with large blind spots in their understanding of and ability to care for women\u2019s bodies, which often have very different needs and responses than men\u2019s bodies.\nFemtech not only presents researchers with a new opportunity to access real and authentic data from millions of users that until recently has been difficult to gather, but also helps women take greater control of their health, saidIda Tin, co-founder and chief executive of Clue, another cycle-tracking app that was founded in 2013, based in Germany.\n\u201cI have always seen the app as a facilitator for conversation,\u201d said Ms. Tin, who in fact coined the term femtech. \u201cThe more people know about their bodies and themselves, the more they will know when something\u2019s off, and they\u2019ll go seek help.\u201d\nClue, which has over 12 million monthly active users, provides scientific institutions with information from its app, she said, stripping that data of unique identifiers that could be traced back to users, all on a noncommercial basis. Its privacy policy clearly states that the company works with scientific researchers and offers users the option to opt out of sharing their data or even delete their data. The company also, according to its privacy policy, publishes the results of its academic, clinical or internal research with its users.\n\u201cActually we find that that\u2019s something that many users are quite excited about \u2014 the idea that you literally move science forward every time you type in a data point,\u201d Ms. Tin added, an indication that users may be open to the idea of their data being put to good use.\nApple, too, is using its tools \u2014 such as its iPhone, Apple Watches and apps built specifically for research surveys \u2014 to advance women\u2019s health research, working with Harvard School of Public Health onan ambitious study that aims to enroll a million women over a decade. And women who participate in the study may choose which types of information \u2014 such as heart or physical activity data \u2014 they share with researchers.\nTia clinic offers a different example of how medicine and technology can work together. The company started out as a digital platform offering sexual health and gynecological advice \u2014 \u201ca WebMD for women\u2019s health,\u201d as Ms. Witte described it \u2014 then evolved into a period cycle-tracker app and then into a full blown brick-and-mortar medical practice in 2019.\nPatients can add daily updates into the Tia app, which is covered by HIPAA, and can control whether their doctor can view that information.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in the market between consumer app data \u2014 so things that are in your Apple Watch or a Fitbit or sleep tracker or a cycle tracker \u2014 and the health data that a typical doctor has, and there\u2019s actually immense value when that data can be shared between them,\u201d Ms. Witte said."

        "title": "4 Ways to Do More With Your Smartphone Camera",
        "fulltext": "Even if you don\u2019t have the latest and greatest smartphone, the tools for your photography can go beyond the more commonly used ones likethe portrait and lowlight modes. With a reasonably up-to-date operating system, you can have voice-activated photo sessions, create wide-screen images, record video at different playback speeds and visually search the internet.\nThe exact feature set depends on the camera software you\u2019re using as well as your phone hardware. Here\u2019s a quick tour of the things you can do with default apps likeGoogle Camerafor Android and Apple\u2019sCamera appfor the iOS system on its iPhones.\nYour phone\u2019svirtual assistantcan handle part of your camerawork to quickly get the shot. For example, with theGoogle Assistant, just say, \u201cOK, Google, take a picture\u201d or \u201cOK, Google, take a selfie\u201d \u2014 and Google Camera pops up, displays a countdown and snaps the picture. You can also tell the Assistant to share the photos, start recording a video and do more. Google Assistant is available forAndroidandiOS.\nApple\u2019sSiriassistant alsoresponds to many requests. The software opens the iPhone\u2019s Camera app if you say, \u201cHey, Siri, take a photo,\u201d but leaves the actual press of the shutter button to you. Phones running iOS 12 or later can use Apple\u2019s freeShortcutsapp to create routinesthat Siri can runwhen instructed \u2014 like opening the camera and then automatically emailing the picture after you snap it.\nBixby,the assistant software on many of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones, takes photos and videos on command as well.\nWant to take a picture that\u2019s too wide to fit on the camera\u2019s screen? You don\u2019t need an extra app or a phone with a wide-angle lens. You just need to use the camera\u2019s panoramic mode, wherein you take a series of photos and the software combines them into one big picture.\nOpen Google Camera and swipe to the left along the horizontal menu at the bottom of the screen. Tap the Modes button, selectPanoramaand press the shutter button while you slowly move the phone to capture the shot. In Apple\u2019s Camera app, swipe to the left, selectPanoand follow the instructions onscreen. You can also ask the Google Assistant or Siri to open the camera directly in the panoramic mode.\nGoogle Camera\u2019s Modes menu also includes aPhoto Sphereoption for going full circle and capturing a scene in 360 degrees. On the Photo Sphere screen, tap the shutter button and let the software guide you. (While the iOS Pano mode doesn\u2019t go the full 360 degrees, theGoogle Street Viewapp bringsPhoto Sphere to the iPhone.)\nGoogle and Apple\u2019s camera software include modes for adding cinematic effects to your video. Thetime-lapsesetting speeds up the playback of slow events like sunsets or storms rolling in. Theslow-motionsetting records normally and then decreases the speed of the action in the clip, which adds drama to video of sports scenes and animal antics.\nTo get to the settings in Google Camera, swipe to the left on the horizontal menu to Video and select therecording mode\u2014 Slow Motion, Normal or Time Lapse \u2014 along withthe speed you want; smaller rates like 5x are usually better for shorter recordings. In Apple\u2019s Camera app, swipe to the right on the menu until you get to Time-Lapse or Slow-Mo; tap the quick-toggle button in the upper cornerto adjust the resolution and speed.\nKeeping the phone steady makes for a better time-lapse video, so consider a tripod if you don\u2019t have a solid place to prop up the device. And slow motion typically works best outdoors, away from certain types of indoor lighting that can cause flickering in the video.\nGoogle Lensis image-recognition software powered by artificial intelligence. And it may already be on your phone, as it\u2019s included on the Modes menu in Google Camera, inGoogle Photosand in theGoogle Lens appfor Android. Those with iOS devices can find it inGoogle Photosor theGoogle app. (Samsung has a similarBixby Visionapp for its phones.)\nWhen you point your camera at something (or open a photo you\u2019ve already taken) and tap the squarish Google Lens icon, the software analyzes the image and searches for related information over its internet connection. Google Lens can identify animals and plants, look up products, recognize landmarksand do more.\nGoogle Lens can also translate text in an image and uses augmented reality to show the words in your preferred language. It\u2019s not quite the\u201cuniversal translator\u201dof science-fiction lore, but it\u2019s getting there."

        "title": "What We Learned From Apple\u2019s New Privacy Labels",
        "fulltext": "We all know thatapps collect our data. Yet one of the few ways to find out what an app does with our information involves reading a privacy policy.\nLet\u2019s be real: Nobody does that.\nSo late last year,Appleintroduced a new requirement for all software developers that publish apps through its App Store. Apps must now include so-calledprivacylabels, which list the types of data being collected in an easily scannable format. The labels resemble a nutrition marker on food packaging.\nThese labels, which began appearing in the App Store in December, are the latest attempt by tech designers tomake data security and digital privacy,which are linked, easier for all of us to understand. You might be familiar with earlier iterations, like the padlock symbol in a web browser. A locked padlock tells us that a website is more secure, while an unlocked one suggests that a website can be more susceptible to attack.\nThe question is whether Apple\u2019s new labels will influence the choices people make. \u201cAfter they read it or look at it, does it change how they use the app or stop them from downloading the app?\u201d asked Stephanie Nguyen, a research scientist who hasstudied user experience design and data privacy.\nTo put the labels to the test, I pored over dozens of apps. Then I focused on the privacy labels for the messaging apps WhatsApp and Signal, the streaming music apps Spotify and Apple Music and, for fun, MyQ, the app I use to open my garage door remotely.\nI learned plenty. The privacy labels showed that apps that appear identical in function can vastly differ in how they handle our information. I also found that lots of data gathering is happening when you least expect it, including inside products you pay for.\nBut while the labels were often illuminating, they sometimes created more confusion.\nTo find the new labels, iPhone and iPad users with the latest operating system (iOS and iPadOS 14.3) can open the App Store and search for an app. Inside the app\u2019s description, look for \u201cApp Privacy.\u201d That\u2019s where a box appears with the label.\nApple has divided the privacy label into three categories so we can get a full picture of the kinds of information that an app collects. They are:\nData used to track you.This information is used to follow your activities across apps and websites. For example, your email address can help identify that you were also the person using another app where you entered the same email address.\nData linked to you:This information is tied to your identity, such as your purchase history or contact information. Using this data, a music app can see that your account bought a certain song.\nData not linked to you:This information is not directly tied to you or your account. A mapping app might collect data from motion sensors to provide turn-by-turn directions for everyone, for instance. It doesn\u2019t save that information in your account.\nNow let\u2019s see what these labels revealed about specific apps.\nOn the surface,WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, appears to be nearly identical toSignal. Both offerencrypted messaging, which scramble your messages so only the recipient can decipher them. Both also rely on your phone number to create an account and receive messages.\nBut their privacy labels immediately reveal how different they are under the hood. The first one below is forWhatsApp.The next one is the one forSignal:\nThe labels immediately made it clear that WhatsApp taps far more of our data than Signal does. When I asked the companies about this, Signal said it made an effort to take less information.\nFor group chats, the WhatsApp privacy label showed that the app has access to user content, which includes group chat names and group profile photos. Signal, which does not do this, said it haddesigned a complex group chat systemthat encrypts the contents of a conversation, including the people participating in the chat and their avatars.\nFor people\u2019s contacts, the WhatsApp privacy label showed that the app can get access to our contacts list; Signal does not. With WhatsApp, you have the option to upload your address book to the company\u2019s servers so it can help you find your friends and family who are also using the app. But on Signal, the contacts list is stored on your phone, and the company cannot tap it.\n\u201cIn some instances it\u2019s more difficult to not collect data,\u201d Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal, said. \u201cWe have gone to greater lengths to design and build technology that doesn\u2019t have access.\u201d\nA WhatsApp spokeswoman referred to the company\u2019s websiteexplaining its privacy label. The website said WhatsApp could gain access to user content to prevent abuse and to bar people who might have violated laws.\nI then took a close look at the privacy label for a seemingly innocuous app: MyQ from Chamberlain, a company that sells garage door openers. The MyQ app works with a $40 hub that connects with a Wi-Fi router so you can open and close your garage door remotely.\nHere\u2019s what the label says about the data the app collected. Warning: It\u2019s long.\nWhy would a product I paid for to open my garage door track my name, email address, device identifier and usage data?\nThe answer: for advertising.\nElizabeth Lindemulder, who oversees connected devices for the Chamberlain Group, said the company collected data to target people with ads across the web. Chamberlain also has partnerships with other companies, such as Amazon, and data is shared with partners when people opt to use their services.\nIn this case, the label successfully caused me to stop and think: Yuck. Maybe I\u2019ll switch back to my old garage remote, which has no internet connection.\nFinally, I compared the privacy labels for two streaming music apps: Spotify and Apple Music. This experiment unfortunately took me down a rabbit hole of confusion.\nJust look at the labels. First is the one forSpotify.Next is the one forApple Music.\nThese look different from the other labels featured in this article because they are just previews \u2014 Spotify\u2019s label was so long that we could not display the entirety of it. And when I dug into the labels, both contained such confusing or misleading terminology that I could not immediately connect the dots on what our data was used for.\nOne piece of jargon in Spotify\u2019s label was that it collected people\u2019s \u201ccoarse location\u201d for advertising. What does that mean?\nSpotify said this applied to people with free accounts who received ads. The app pulls device information to get approximate locations so it can play ads relevant to where those users are. But most people are unlikely to comprehend this from reading the label.\nApple Music\u2019s privacy label suggested that it linked data to you for advertising purposes \u2014 even though the app doesn\u2019t show or play ads. Onlyon Apple\u2019s websitedid I find out that Apple Music looks at what you listen to so it can provide information about upcoming releases and new artists who are relevant to your interests.\nThe privacy labels are especially confusing when it comes to Apple\u2019s own apps. That\u2019s because while some Apple apps appeared in the App Store with privacy labels, others did not.\nApple said only some of its apps \u2014 like FaceTime, Mail and Apple Maps \u2014 could be deleted and downloaded again in the App Store, so those can be found there with privacy labels. But its Phone and Messages apps cannot be deleted from devices and so do not have privacy labels in the App Store. Instead, the privacy labels for those apps are inhard-to-find support documents.\nThe result is that the data practices of Apple\u2019s apps are less upfront. If Apple wants to lead the privacy conversation, it can set a better example by making language clearer \u2014 and its labeling program less self-serving. When I asked why all apps shouldn\u2019t be held to the same standards, Apple did not address the issue further.\nMs. Nguyen, the researcher, said a lot had to happen for the privacy labels to succeed. Other than behavioral change, she said, companies have to be honest about describing their data collection. Most important, people have to be able to understand the information.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine my mother would ever stop to look at a label and say, \u2018Let me look at the data linked to me and the data not linked to me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d"

        "title": "Parler Pitched Itself as Twitter Without Rules. Not Anymore, Apple and Google Said.",
        "fulltext": "Parler is one of the hottest apps in the world, a social network that has attracted millions of far-right conservatives over the past year with its hands-off approach to policing users\u2019 posts. And with the news that President Trumphad been kicked off TwitterandFacebook, Parler was the odds-on bet to be his next soapbox.\nBut just as it has been gaining new clout, Parler is now suddenly faced with an existential crisis.\nOn Friday,Appletold the company that it had to step up its policing of the conversation on its app \u2014 undercutting its flagship feature \u2014 or lose its platform on iPhones. Several hours later, Google suspended Parler from the Play Store, the main way to download apps on Android devices, until it better polices its app.\nIn an email to Parler, Apple said it had received complaints that people used the Parler app, which mimics Twitter, to plan Wednesday\u2019s deadly riot in Washington. Apple said it had determined that Parler was not \u201cremoving content that encourages illegal activity and poses a serious risk to the health and safety of users.\u201d\nA day earlier, John Matze, Parler\u2019s chief executive, hadsaid in an interviewwith The Times about Wednesday\u2019s melee that he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we\u2019re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law.\u201d\nIn its letter, Apple referenced his stance and added, \u201cWe want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users.\u201d\nApple gave Parler 24 hours to comply before the app would be removed from Apple\u2019s App Store.\nGoogle said in a statement that it had pulled the app because Parler was not enforcing its own moderation policies, despite a recent reminder from Google, and because of continued posts on the app that sought to incite violence.\n\u201cWe recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content,\u201d Google said.\nBuzzFeed Newspreviously reportedApple\u2019s email to Parler.\nParler did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Matzetold The Wall Street Journalon Friday that he was confident that \u201cwe can retain our values and make Apple happy quickly.\u201d\nThe edicts from Apple and Google were a stark illustration of the power of the largest tech companies to influence what is allowed on the internet, even on sites and apps that are not their own. The moves were also likely to inflame anger among those on the right who believe that Silicon Valley is muzzling conservative voices, particularly when paired witha series of other actionsby tech companies against Mr. Trump and his supporters since Wednesday.\nIn the eyes of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, Parler was a safe haven from so-called Big Tech censorship \u2014 a place where they could espouse conspiracy theories, make threats and even plan violent rallies without worrying about getting banned. It had been one of the most downloaded apps in recent months just as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram increasingly cracked down on hate speech and misinformation.\nBut it is now clear that Parler will not be able to maintain its free-for-all status if it wants to be able to keep its wide reach. Apple and Google make the operating systems that back nearly every smartphone in the world, and they roughly split the market in the United States.\nIf Apple pulls Parler from the App Store, people would not be able to download the app to their iPhones or iPads. People who had already downloaded the Parler iPhone app would still be able to use it, but the company would not be able to update the app, meaning it would eventually be rendered obsolete as Apple updated the iPhone software.\nGoogle\u2019s suspension is problematic for Parler, but people with Android devices will still be able to get the app, just with a bit more work. Google allows other app marketplaces on Android, and its decision applies only to its flagship Play Store.\nAnd people will also still be able to use Parler via web browsers on their phones or computers.\nParler\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 10 million times on iPhones and Android devices, with more than 80 percent of the downloads in the United States, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. On Thursday, the day after the riot in Washington, people downloaded Parler 39,000 times, more than twice as much as the day prior.\nThat success had put Parler in the pole position among a number of social-media upstarts trying to attract people on the far right who were fed up with the actions of the tech companies or who had been banned themselves from the mainstream platforms.\nParler quickly drew some of the biggest names. Upon signing up for an account, Parler prompted new users to follow people like Sean Hannity, the Fox News pundit, and Phil Robertson, star of the reality television series \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d\nParler had a major advantage: money. Rebekah Mercer,one of Mr. Trump's largest donorsand an investor in Breitbart, said on Parler in November that she had started the company with Mr. Matze, a self-described libertarian, \u201cto provide a neutral platform for free speech, as our founders intended.\u201d\nAfter Twitter announced it had banned Mr. Trump on Friday, he posted a message under the official Twitter account for the U.S. president that said his team had been \u201cnegotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will not be SILENCED!\u201d\nThe notion of Mr. Trump\u2019s starting his own platform suggested that Silicon Valley\u2019s struggles with the president could be far from over. Apple and Google\u2019s stance of ensuring that social-media apps are enforcing their rules could set the companies up for a series of fights as the president\u2019s supporters search for a new digital gathering place.\nWhile explaining their decisions on Friday, Apple and Google shared images of posts on Parler that they said had crossed the line. They included a post fromLin Wood, the defamation lawyer who sued to overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s election loss, that said Vice President Mike Pence should be executed for not helping the fight to overturn the election results. The post was shared thousands of times.\nAnother post they cited said 20 coordinated assassinations were all that would be needed to \u201ctake back our country.\u201d It had been shared nearly 200 times and stayed up for at least two days.\n\u201cIf people are breaking the law, violating our terms of service, or doing anything illegal, we would definitely get involved,\u201d Mr. Matzetold The Times this week. \u201cBut, you know, for the most part, I haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of illegal activity.\u201d"

        "title": "Amazon, Apple and Google Cut Off Parler, an App That Drew Trump Supporters",
        "fulltext": "Parler, a social network that pitches itself as a \u201cfree speech\u201d alternative toTwitterand Facebook, is suffering from whiplash.\nOver the past several months, Parler has becomeone of the fastest-growing appsin the United States. Millions ofPresident Trump\u2019ssupporters have flocked to it as Facebook and Twitter increasingly cracked down on posts that spread misinformation and incited violence, includingmuzzling Mr. Trumpby removing his accounts this past week. By Saturday morning, Apple listed Parler as the No. 1 free app for its iPhones.\nBut, by Saturday night, Parler was suddenly fighting for its life.\nFirst, Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores because they said it had not sufficiently policed its users\u2019 posts, allowing too many that encouraged violence and crime. Then, late Saturday, Amazon told Parler it would boot the company from its web-hosting service on Sunday night because of repeated violations of Amazon\u2019s rules.\nAmazon\u2019s move meant that Parler\u2019s entire platform would soon go offline unless it was able to find a new hosting service on Sunday.\n\u201cBig tech really wants to kill competition,\u201d John Matze, Parler\u2019s chief executive, said in a text message. \u201cAnd I have a lot of work to do in the next 24 hours to make sure everyone\u2019s data is not permanently deleted off the internet.\u201d\nIn astatement online, Mr. Matze added that the tech giants had acted in a \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to \u201ccompletely remove free speech off the internet.\u201d Parler, he said, would probably be unavailable on the internet for up to a week, starting at midnight on Sunday. But, he went on, the company had \u201cprepared\u201d by not relying on Amazon\u2019s proprietary infrastructure and was looking for a new hosting provider.\nA day earlier, Parler appeared poised to capitalize on growing anger at Silicon Valley in conservative circles and was even a logical choice to become Mr. Trump\u2019s next megaphone after he waskicked off Twitter. Now its future is looking bleak.\nIn a letter to Parler on Saturday, Amazon said that it had sent the company 98 examples of posts on its site that encouraged violence and that many remained active. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with\u201d Amazon\u2019s rules, the company said in the letter. Amazon \u201cprovides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler\u2019s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.\u201d\nOn Friday, Apple gave Parler 24 hours to clean up its app or face removal from its App Store. Parler appeared to take down some posts over that period, but on Saturday, Apple told the company its measures were inadequate. \u201cWe have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\u201cThis is very huge,\u201d Amy Peikoff, Parler\u2019s policy chief,told Fox Newsafter Apple gave its warning on Friday. Without access to the App Store, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re toast.\u201d\nSeveral Parler executives accused the tech companies\u2019 moves as being politically motivated and anticompetitive.\nMr. Matze pointed to the fact that Twitter had recently promoted the phrase \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as a trending topic. (The majority of the discussion on Twitter was about rioters chanting the phrase about the vice president on Wednesday.) \u201cI have seen no evidence Apple is going after them,\u201d Mr. Matze said. \u201cThis would appear to be an unfair double standard as every other social media site has the same issues, arguably on a worse scale.\u201d\nThe actions against Parler were part of a wider crackdown by tech companies on President Trump and some of his most extreme supporters afterWednesday\u2019s deadly riot in Washington. But unlike Twitter and Facebook, which make decisions about the content that appears on their own sites, Amazon, Apple and Google weighed in on how another company was operating.\nAmazon Web Services supports a large share of the websites and apps across the internet, while Apple and Google make the operating systems that back nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones. Now that the companies have made it clear that they will take action against sites and apps that don\u2019t sufficiently police what their users post, it could have significant side effects.\nSeveral upstarts have courted Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters with promises of \u201cunbiased\u201d and \u201cfree speech\u201d social networks, which have proven to be, in effect, free-for-all digital town squares where users hardly have to worry about getting banned for spreading conspiracy theories, making threats or posting hate speech. The tougher enforcement from the tech companies could preclude such apps from becoming realistic alternatives to the mainstream social networks. They now face the choice of either stepping up their policing of posts \u2014 undercutting their main feature in the process \u2014 or losing their ability to reach a wide audience.\nThat may reinforce the primacy of the social-media incumbents, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It also gives those companies\u2019 decisions more teeth. If they ban a pundit for violating their rules, that person will lack a strong alternative.\nAmazon, Apple and Google\u2019s moves could also spur other apps to strengthen their enforcement.\nDLive, a livestreaming site that rioters storming the Capitol used tobroadcast the moment, said on Friday that it hadindefinitely suspended seven channelsand permanently removed over 100 previous broadcasts of the mob. It added that the \u201clemons,\u201d a DLive currency that can be converted into real money, sent to the suspended channels would be refunded to donors in the next few days.\nOther platforms that host posts by right-wing influencers, including CloutHub and MyMilitia \u2014 a forum for militia groups \u2014 adjusted their terms of service recently to ban threats of violence.\nDLive was pressured by Tipalti, a payment company that helps it operate.Tipalti said in a statementthat it had suspended its service until DLive removed the accounts that had broadcast the riots on Wednesday.\nSuch third-party companies that help apps and websites function, from payment processors to cybersecurity firms to web-hosting providers like Amazon, have used their positions to influence how their customers handle extremist or criminal activity. In 2019, Cloudflare, a company that protects sites from cyberattacks, effectivelydelivered the death knellto 8chan, an anonymous online message board that hosted the manifesto of a mass shooter, by halting its protections for the site. After Cloudflare backed away from 8chan, the site struggled to find other service providers that could keep it active.\nParler could have the same problem now that it lacked a way to host its website, particularly as the company suddenly became a pariah after Wednesday\u2019s riot, which was partially planned on Parler. Amazon had faced pressure from its own employees and at least one member of Congress before it pulled its support for Parler, and other companies could fear unwanted attention if they took its business.\nBuzzFeed Newsfirst reportedAmazon\u2019s decision to pull its support for Parler.\nIf Parler is able to find a provider and resume its service, it will still have an uphill journey to find new users without a place in the major app stores. Apple\u2019s decision blocks iPhone owners from downloading the Parler app. People who already have the app will still be able to use it \u2014 if it comes back online \u2014 but their versions of the app will soon become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.\nGoogle cut Parler out of its flagship Android app store, but it also allows apps to be downloaded from elsewhere, meaning Android users would still be able to find the Parler app, just with a bit more work. If Parler finds a new web-hosting provider, its website would also be available via web browsers on phones and computers.\nAfter Apple had given the company 24 hours to improve its moderation to avoid removal from the App Store, it appeared that Parler had tried to remove some posts that seemed to call for violence.\nFor instance, L. Lin Wood, a lawyer who had sued to overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s election loss, posted on Parler on Thursday morning: \u201cGet the firing squad ready. Pence goes FIRST.\u201d The post was viewed at least 788,000 times, according to a screenshot on the Internet Archive. By Saturday morning, the post had been removed.\nIn a text message, Mr. Matze said the post had been removed \u201cin compliance with Parler\u2019s terms of service and rules against incitement of violence.\u201d\nIn a notice to Parler on Saturday, Apple said that it had \u201ccontinued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action\u201d on the app. Apple told the company its app would not be allowed on the App Store until \u201cyou have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.\u201d\nIn an interview, Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, blamed \u201ca cancel culture\u201d at the tech companies for his company\u2019s dimming prospects. He said he would advise other platforms not to try to compete on Apple\u2019s App Store. \u201cBecause if you raise money and get investors and end up like Parler, what\u2019s the point?\u201d he said.\nApple and Google said they would remove Parler from its App Stores. Amazon said it would no longer host Parler on its web hosting service."

        "title": "The Tech That Will Invade Our Lives in 2021",
        "fulltext": "This year, the technologies that we will most likely hear the most about won\u2019t be fancy devices like smartphones or big-screen television sets. It will be the stuff we don\u2019t usually see: workhorse software andinternetproducts that are finding their moment now.\nBefore the coronavirus transformed our lives, the lists of tech to watch each year were often dominated by whiz-bang gizmos like smart speakers and curved televisions. But the pandemic has pushed us toembrace useful technologythat was often overlooked. Once lame or gimmicky apps on our devices suddenly became central tools.\nTake mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Square. While these have been around for years, some people stuck with credit cards and cash. But new germaphobia finally pushed more of us to try the contact-free phone payments as opposed to a card swipe.\nThen there\u2019s augmented reality. The technology, which lets us interact with digital objects superimposed on our physical world, has been more than a decade in the making. For years, it seemed more futuristic than useful. But now that we can\u2019t easily go to a physical store to try things on,snapping a selfie to see a digital renderingof makeup on your face sure seems like a better idea.\n\u201cAll those things we started to see a need for during Covid,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies. \u201cThink about how neglected video calling has been for so long. Finally, we get it. It\u2019s not sexy, but it does make a difference.\u201d\nWith that in mind, here are four tech trends that are set to invade our lives this year.\nYou may not have noticed it as you shop online, but the experience is changing.\nClicking through a navigation bar of a website to find an item has become pass\u00e9. A search bar that allows you to look up a specific product is faster. In some cases, chatting with a bot may be even more efficient.\nWe haveexperimented with chatbotsfor years.Facebook has offered toolsfor merchants to make bots that engage with customers. Retailers like Amazon have used chatbots to answer customers\u2019 questions, and when the bots can\u2019t help, a person can hop in to take over.\nNow that visiting a physical retail store has largely become impractical in the pandemic, we can expect such conversational technologies to gain momentum, said Julie Ask, a technology analyst for Forrester Research.\n\u201cThis notion of going online and searching and clicking and using a navigation window is very dated,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next after that? A lot of it is going to be conversational, whether it\u2019s text or voice.\u201d\nThere are already plenty of examples. Recently, I shopped for a pair of shoes at Beckett Simonon, an online fashion brand, and asked an employee via a chat box about the correct shoe size for my feet.\nMore companies are also using augmented reality to help people with online shopping, Ms. Ask said. Jins Eyewear, which sells prescription glasses, lets you take a photo of your face to virtually try on glasses before deciding whether to buy them. Snap, the parent company for Snapchat, has teamed up with luxury brands like Gucci and Dior to offer virtual try-ons.\nAugmented reality is poised to become especially popular this year because the technology keeps improving. New high-end Apple and Android smartphones include sensors for detecting depth, which makes it easier for augmented reality apps to place objects like virtual furniture in physical spaces.\nExpect to see a wave of new ads that take advantage of the format. This year, advertisers are expected to spend about $2.4 billion on augmented reality advertising, up 71 percent from $1.4 billion last year, according to the research firmeMarketer.\nOne home technology problem that the pandemic underscored was our sluggish, unreliable internet connections. Last year, as people hunkered down to contain the spread of the coronavirus,average internet speeds all over the world slowed,in part because broadband providers were crushed by the heavy traffic.\nThankfully, Wi-Fi technology keeps getting better. This year, we will see a wave of new internet routers that include Wi-Fi 6, a new networking standard. Unlike past wireless upgrades, Wi-Fi 6 will focus not on speed but rather on efficiency by sharing bandwidth across a large number of devices.\nHere\u2019s what that means. Let\u2019s say your family owns smartphones, several computers and a game console. If all of them are being used to consume heavy amounts of data \u2014 to stream video, for example \u2014 Wi-Fi 6 does a better job at providing bandwidth to all the devices at the same time as opposed to letting one device hog most of it.\nEfficiency is especially important because more of our stuff connects to the internet, from watches to television sets to bathroom scales to thermostats. On average, the number of internet-connected devices owned per person is expected to climb to about four by 2023, up from two in 2018, according toresearch by Cisco.\nLast year was an inflection point for mobile payments. For safety reasons, even cash-only die-hards, like farmers\u2019 market merchants and food trucks, started accepting mobile payments.\nOver all, 67 percent of American retailers accept touchless payments, up from 40 percent in 2019, according to a survey byForrester. Among those surveyed, 19 percent said they made a digital payment in a store for the first time last May.\nHands-off technology doesn\u2019t end with mobile wallets. So-called Ultra-Wide Band, a relatively new radio technology, may also find its moment this year. The technology, which uses radio waves to detect objects with extreme precision, has not been used much since its debut on smartphones about two years ago. But the need for contact-free experiences could change that, said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.\nSo how might Ultra-Wide Band be used? Let\u2019s say you have a smartphone and a coffee shop has a tablet, and both are equipped with the radio technology. If you\u2019re standing in front of the tablet, it can sense your phone and accept a payment from you (and not the person behind you in line). The technology could also be used to allow employees into buildings and start up cars without physical keys.\nThe pandemic has made it clear that virtualized experiences, like video meetings and Zoom yoga, are viable substitutes for the real thing, whether you embrace them or endure them. In 2021, expect more products to offer to digitize the way we work and stay healthy.\nOne example: Some tech companies are experimenting with recreating the office conference room with virtual reality.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AltspaceVR, for example, lets you and your colleagues wear headsets to have meetings in hologram form. Facebook\u2019s Oculus, the virtual reality division of the social network, said it was hastening its plan to bring virtual reality to offices. It plans to bundle its latest headset, theOculus Quest 2, with business-ready software that helps companies train employees and collaborate, for about $800.\nWith gyms shut down, we are also increasingly turning to tech to keep an eye on our health.\nLast year, Amazon introduced its first wearable for fitness tracking, which includes software that scans your body fat. Apple recently introduced Fitness+, a copycat ofPeloton, the video service that offers instruction for at-home workouts. Ms. Ask said this trend would continue into other aspects of health, like self-care and mental health, with video apps that offer guided meditation or therapy.\nAs is always the case, some of these trends will stick with us while others may fizzle out. All of these technologies have to survive the test of remaining relevant after life returns somewhat to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\u201cBuying a Peloton, yoga mats, Apple Watches \u2014 how much of that behavior is a permanent shift versus a 12-month to 24-month shift as we go through the pandemic?\u201d Ms. Ask said. \u201cConsumers will always default to what is convenient.\u201d\nThat means digital payments are probably here to stay because they save time. But if we return to gyms, lots of our health-related tech purchases may lead tobuyer\u2019s remorse."

        "title": "Facebook Said to Consider Suing Apple Over App Store Practices",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has considered filing an antitrust lawsuit againstApple, two people familiar with the deliberations said, a move that could escalate tensions between two of the world\u2019s most powerful technology companies.\nFacebook executives discussed accusing Apple of anticompetitive actions inits App Store, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The social network planned to say in a lawsuit that Apple gave preferential treatment to its own apps, while forcing restrictive rules onto third-party app developers like Facebook, the people said.\nFacebookdiscussed filing the suit as recently as December, the people said. It is unclear if the company will move forward with any legal action.\nThe company declined to comment on a potential lawsuit. \u201cWe believe Apple is behaving anti-competitively by using their control of theApp Storeto benefit their bottom line at the expense of app developers and small businesses,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment. The Informationearlier reportedthe possibility of a suit.\nTensions between Apple and Facebookhave been growing for months, rooted in how the companies are diametrically opposed on how they make money. Apple, which has made privacy a key tenet, prefers that consumers pay for their internet experience, leaving less need for advertisers. In contrast, Facebook relies on data about its users to fuel its digital advertising business.\nOver time, the Apple chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have increasingly taken thinly veiled shots at each other to underline their distaste for the other\u2019s philosophies on advertising, targeting and privacy.\nThe friction ratcheted up after Apple announced changes last year to its upcoming software for iPhones that could harm Facebook\u2019s business. Apple said that it would clamp down on some data collection practices by developers and that it would allow iPhone owners to choose whether to allow companies to track them across different apps. That would likely hurt Facebook\u2019s ability to collect user data to target ads.\nApple also recently began requiring developers to include privacy labels for their apps in the App Store, which detail an app\u2019s information collection practices. Ina recent analysis, The New York Times found that the privacy label for Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging app showed that it gathered far more information from people than another messaging app, Signal.\nIn response, Facebook has publicly pushed back against Apple. In December, Facebookcreated a websitethat slammed Apple\u2019s moves as potentially harmful to small businesses. (It did not mention that the changes could hurt itself.) Facebook also took out full-page print ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times to declare that it was \u201cstanding up to Apple.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s line of attack against Apple echoes that made by other companies. Apple wields near absolute power over its App Store, deciding which apps make the cut and which don\u2019t, and taking a 30 percent cut of their sales. In 2019,Spotify, the streaming music company, filed a complaintwith European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash companies that compete with its services, including Apple Music.\nIn August, Epic Games, the creator of the popular game Fortnite,sued Applefor forcing developers to use its payment systems, accusing it of anticompetitive practices in the App Store. Facebook has said it wouldprovide information to Epic in its lawsuit, so that the court would understand \u201cthe unfair policies that Apple imposes.\u201d Epic, Spotify and others have also organized a nonprofit group,the Coalition for App Fairness, to push for changes in app stores and to \u201cprotect the app economy.\u201d\nThis week, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Cook continued trading barbs.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts that he viewed Apple as one of Facebook\u2019s \u201cbiggest competitors.\u201d He cited iMessage, Apple\u2019s iPhone-specific texting service, as an existential threat to Facebook\u2019s social networking services.\nHe added that Apple had \u201cevery incentive to use their dominant platform position\u201d to interfere with Facebook and other apps. Apple regularly treats its own apps more favorably in the App Store, he said.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cook, speaking at an European data protection conference, said Apple\u2019s new tracking features for apps and the new privacy labels were necessary because of a \u201cdata industrial complex\u201d that has compromised consumer privacy.\n\u201cIt seems no piece of information is too private or personal to be surveilled, monetized and aggregated into a 360-degree view of your life,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cSome may think that sharing this degree of information may be worth it for more targeted ads. Many others, I suspect, will not.\u201d"
