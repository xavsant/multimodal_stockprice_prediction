        "title": "\u2018Crucial Time\u2019 for Cloud Gaming, Which Wants to Change How You Play",
        "fulltext": "Imagine video gamers, untethered from their computers and consoles, playing crystal-clear versions of their favorite games anywhere. They might traverse the futuristic world of the sci-fi shooter game Halo on their mobile phones while riding the subway, or dust off old MacBook computers and hop straight into the jungle of the battle arena gameLeague of Legends.\nThat\u2019s the rosy future promised by cloud gaming, a nascent technology that could reshape how people play games. And depending on whom you ask, that future might have arrived already.\nOn Thursday, Facebook announced that it had expanded the reach of its cloud gaming platform, which was released last fall, to cover 98 percent of the mainland United States. Also this week,Microsoft made its cloud gaming serviceavailable on more devices. AndAmazonbroadened access to its burgeoning cloud service, giving Prime members a free trial version during its Prime Day last month.\nIt has been a busy period for the small but growing cloud gaming industry, which is expected to surpass $1 billion in revenue and 23 million paying customers by the end of this year, according to Newzoo, a gaming analytics firm. Revenue is projected to grow to more than $5 billion by 2023 as the technology improves.\n\u201cAfter years of development, now is a crucial time for cloud gaming to gain mainstream prominence,\u201d said Rupantar Guha, a gaming analyst at the analytics company GlobalData.\nCloud gaming, at its core, is the ability to separate the technical power required to play avideo gamefrom the device it is being played on. That is accomplished by using remote data centers, which harness a company\u2019s processing power and stream a game directly to a user\u2019s device.\nThat means games will no longer be tied to specific platforms or devices, so Halo could be played not only on an Xbox console but on a mobile phone or streamed directly to a television. Someone could use the power of the cloud to play a high-quality, graphics-intensive game on an older or weaker device.\nThat could lead people to spend less time and money on expensive video game consoles from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, and to turn away from pricey gaming computers. They could theoretically play new games instantaneously on any device anywhere.\nIt sounds great in theory. But cloud gaming, which is still in an experimental phase, is sometimes bogged down by glitches that frustrate users. And it requires a strong local internet connection.\nCloud gaming could also shake up the supremacy that Sony, Microsoft and otherhardwaremanufacturers have enjoyed in video games. Instead, tech giants like Google andAmazonare barreling in and \u201csee this as a breakthrough opportunity to get into the global games market,\u201d said Guilherme Fernandes, Newzoo\u2019s cloud gaming expert.\nThe road has not been smooth.\n\u201cBig Tech has a sense of arrogance that they can take over an industry segment and disrupt it entirely,\u201d said Joost van Dreunen, a New York University professor who studies the business of video games. \u201cSo far in gaming, they all suck at that.\u201d\nGoogle was first big tech company off the mark in cloud gaming, releasing itsStadiasubscription service in November 2019. For $10 a month, subscribers could play the initial library of 22 games on their phones, Google Chrome web browsers or televisions, with a controller. People who chose free access to Stadia could buy games individually.\nThe service was immediately criticized for poor performance and a scarcity of games. Jack Buser, Stadia\u2019s director of games, said the service had stabilized over time and now had more than 180 titles.\n\u201cThere hadn\u2019t been a new major entrant in the gaming space in 20 years,\u201d Mr. Buser said. \u201cIt does give us an advantage to do something different in this industry and push it forward in a way that consoles can\u2019t.\u201d\nStadia has since gone through other ups and downs. While the blockbuster game Cyberpunk 2077, released in December, turned into abuggy mess on many older consoles, users reported smooth sailing on Stadia. But in February, Google announced that it would stop designing its own exclusive games for Stadia, and the service\u2019s top games developer, Jade Raymond, left the company.\nMr. Buser declined to comment on February\u2019s changes.\nAmazon also unveiled a cloud service, Luna, in September. It is so far available only to invitees, who pay $6 a month to play the 85 games on the platform. The games can be streamed from the cloud to phones, computers and Amazon\u2019s Fire TV.\nLike Google, Amazon has struggled to assemble a vast library of appealing games, though it does offer games from the French publisher Ubisoft for an added fee. Amazonhas also had trouble developing its own games, which Mr. van Dreunen said showed that the creative artistry necessary to make enticing games was at odds with the more corporate style of the tech giants.\n\u201cThey may have an interesting technological solution, but it totally lacks personality,\u201d he said.\nAmazon said it remained dedicated to game development: It opened a game studio in Montreal in March and, after a long delay, is releasing a game called New World this summer.\nEven console makers have jumped into cloud gaming. Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, released a cloud offering, xCloud or Xbox Cloud Gaming, last fall. For a $15 monthly subscription, users can play more than 200 games on various devices.\nSony also has a cloud gaming service, PlayStation Now, where games can be streamed to PlayStation consoles and computers.\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview last month that he did not think it was possible to be a gaming company \u201cwith any level of big ambition\u201d without cloud gaming. Sony declined to comment.\nOther companies have waded in, too. Nvidia, the chip maker that produces gaming hardware, has a $10-a-month cloud program, GeForce Now.\nPhil Eisler, a Nvidia vice president who leads GeForce Now, said the service was still not as fast as a powerful gaming computer.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s the way of the future,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe don\u2019t know exactly when the future\u2019s going to come in terms of everybody\u2019s going to switch over.\u201d\nFacebook has also dabbled. Unlike other companies, it has eschewed a subscription service and focused on making games load instantly within the Facebook app and website. That way, people may spend more time on the social media platform.\nFacebook also used cloud technology to test a twist on video gaming: From December to March, it hosted a type of interactive reality television game, Rival Peak, where millions of viewers could vote on how characters should act and interact.\nVivek Sharma, the vice president of Facebook Gaming, said cloud gaming made it easier for people to immediately jump into games with their Facebook friends.\n\u201cThe whole point of cloud is, \u2018Dude, let\u2019s chill out, now!\u2019\u201d Mr. Sharma said. \u201cIf things are easy and simple and fast, people will do it.\u201d\nMany of the cloud programs have not been as easily available because Apple has essentially barred them from its App Store. Apple, which prohibits apps that offer a library of games, declined to comment.\nElijah Dolosa, a professional video game player for the e-sports organization XSET, has tried Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service and said he was \u201cexcited and optimistic\u201d about cloud gaming.\nOther gamers were more cautious. Patrick Riley of Cincinnati, who has used Stadia, xCloud and Luna, said technical glitches would keep many people from embracing cloud gaming for several more years.\n\u201cI have not had any luck finding any of the services playable at this moment,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "Applewill start requiring employees and customers to wear masks regardless of their vaccination status in more than half of its stores in the United States, it said on Wednesday, a new sign that shopping in the country may soon resemble the earlier days of the pandemic.\nApple said that it was choosing stores based on the rate of coronavirus cases in the area, and that its policy followednew guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAfter lifting mask requirements in American stores earlier this year, Apple in recent weeks had begun requiring store employees in some regions to wear masks again as coronavirus cases rose, fueled by the Delta variant. Now it has extended that requirement to customers in some places.\nApple has continued to require masks in its stores in most places outside the United States, and that policy hasn\u2019t changed.\nApple also told its employees on Tuesday that they would soon have to wear masks when inside the company\u2019s main offices in the United States, regardless of whether they were vaccinated. Last week, Apple delayed its timeline on requiring workers to return to the office.\nBloomberg earlierreportedApple\u2019s decision to require masks in its stores."
