        "title": "Apple, IBM and Japan Post See Profit in the Old-Age Market",
        "fulltext": "Japan is an incubator of aging. More than other countries, it is a graying nation. Twenty-five percent of its population, or 33 million people, is age 65 or older, more than double the global average.\nIBM, Apple and Japan Post Group, a giant postal service, bank and insurer, declared on Thursday that they were joining to deliver a new technology service to the fast-growing market of older Japanese adults. The service\n                                        involves equipping Japan\u2019s silver generation with iPads loaded with software apps to help them communicate with family and friends, monitor their health, and buy goods and services.\nFor IBM and Apple, the initiative is another step inthe partnership they formed last year,\n                                        mainly to create mobile apps for corporate workers. The project with Japan Post goes beyond the workplace into homes.\nQuality-of-life services for aging populations will certainly be a big, if broad and diverse, marketplace. And Japan is a prime test bed.\nCiting the nation\u2019s geriatric demographics, Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of Japan Post, said, \u201cMany countries will be facing the same issue soon.\u201d\nBut what was most striking about the announcement was the ceremony itself, as the chief executives of all three companies appeared together in New York for a corporate collaboration that will only begin the pilot-project\n                                        stage in the second half of the year. Thenews releasesaid the goal was to have four million to five million\n                                        customers using the iPad service by 2020. That would be a respectable number of iPads, but that projection is five years from now and that wouldn\u2019t seem to loom too large for Apple, a company that has yearly\n                                        revenue that now runs at the rate of $240 billion a year, based on the recent quarter.\nTimothy D. Cook, chief executive of Apple, said the collaboration represented a \u201cgroundbreaking initiative\u201d that would be \u201cscalable around the globe.\u201d\nPerhaps, but Japan is a fairly distinctive market. A video demonstration of the iPad-based offering underlined that fact. It showed one of Japan Post\u2019s 400,000 workers presenting a boxed iPad to an older woman\n                                        and helping show her how it works. This member of what would be a vast Japanese geek squad wore a company jacket and perfectly knotted necktie, bowing upon entering the woman\u2019s home. The iPad and software\n                                        apps will be offered as an add-on to Japan Post\u2019s Watch Over service, which involves postal workers regularly visiting elderly customers.\nStill, regardless of whether it succeeds in Japan and can be replicated abroad, the venture points to crucial strategic designs for all three companies.\nThe chief executives spoke to those issues, even if they were not at the top of the day\u2019s agenda.\nToward the end of the question-and-answer portion of the event, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe want to change how people work and live. We don\u2019t want to just sell stuff.\u201d\nFinancially, Apple looks like an iPhone company. More iPad sales, which have flagged lately, would be nice, but what Apple really needs to do is expand its broader platform of hardware, software and services. That will\n                                        help it become more of a subscription business, and less of a business known for its hardware hits. Besides, the software and services tend to lock customers into Apple hardware \u2014 that\u2019s how things\n                                        worked for IBM for decades, in the heyday of the mainframe business.\nIBM is engaged in a footrace. It is trying to accelerate a strategic transition to depend more on new businesses like data analytics, cloud computing and specialized mobile apps, and the Japan Post project involves\n                                        all those, as does its partnership with Apple.\nVirginia M. Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, observed that the joint work with Apple had so far created 22 enterprise apps in 11 industries, and the app count should reach 100 by the end of this year. The Japan\n                                        Post project, she said, \u201cbuilds on a remarkable partnership.\u201d The message: The new stuff is going gangbusters.\nMr. Nishimuro was asked by a Japanese reporter if the corporate announcement was timed to coincide with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s state visit to the United States this week. No, Mr. Nishimuro replied. But the\n                                        announcement, he said, meshed nicely with a spring tour of America that he had planned to speak to institutional investors. Japan Post, which was privatized in 2007, intends to make an initial public offering of\n                                        shares this year.\nMr. Nishimuro, a former chairman of Toshiba, will have to persuade potential investors that a company named Japan Post is not a financial sinkhole, the plight of postal services in many Western nations. Japan Post is,\n                                        in fact, solidly profitable these days. And the announcement with two American high-tech giants \u2014 Mr. Nishimuro flanked on the dais by the leaders of Apple and IBM \u2014 might well add an aura of innovation\n                                        to the Japanese company."

        "title": "One-Tap Giving? Extra Steps Mire Mobile Donations",
        "fulltext": "On Monday, perhaps it was a Memorial Day parade that moved you. The sight of veterans marching might have touched off a desire to make a donation right then and there to the American Legion.\nOn Tuesday, the news stories about people losing their lives and homes to floods could have set off the urge to give.\nNearly every new day presents tales of woe tugging at something deep within us. But even in 2015, when we can quickly summon a masseuse or a bottle of wine with our phones or tablets, it is much harder than it should be to hit a button while on the go and give money to people who need it.\nYour phone, after all, has to know how to pay before it can help you act on your generous urges. So unless you\u2019re engaging in the rare text-to-give campaign, you\u2019ll need to use an app or platform that already has your credit or debit card number stored. And onAppledevices, the company has maintained a longstanding rule banning in-app donations, one it hasnever fully explainedand declined to discuss with me this week.\nAs a result, we\u2019re often left with a handful of small companies that are gamely developing various mobile workarounds that require extra steps for donations. And you have to cast your lot (and your payment information) with unfamiliar entities.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. So why are we stuck here?\nApple\u2019s rulesare short and simple: If you want to collect money for a cause, do it by text message or in the Safari mobile browser. But there are practical ramifications to that rule for organizations that can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, deal with the complexities of text message giving campaigns. Any app that a nonprofit group uses to solicit money must bounce people out to a separate website for payment. If you\u2019re not already registered at that site, then you\u2019re fumbling with your credit card and typing numbers, often on a tiny screen. At that point, it\u2019s easy to lose your will and put off the donation until a later point that never actually arrives. The moment is lost precisely because it takes so much longer than a moment.\nWhy does Apple do this? It is probably a combination of factors. It may not want to be in the business of figuring out which nonprofit groups are legitimate. That said, the ratings siteCharity Navigatorseems well-suited for this task, and its vice president for marketing, Sandra Miniutti, told me this week that it would be happy to help.\nApple would also have to figure out what percentage of the donation, if any, to keep as a fee. It probably wouldn\u2019t look too good to take the 30 percent it normally takes from app store sellers, but if it offered a much better deal, cheaters might try to disguise themselves as nonprofit groups. It isn\u2019t easy to sort this out, but there are already people involved with the approval of apps, and presumably a company that is close to having$200 billionin cash on its books can train them to screen out the fakers.\nThen, there is the data on donors. Nonprofit groups would want to be able to send gifts of thanks or solicit in the future, but Apple might not want to share their contact information. \u201cApple is going to have high loyalty to users and their privacy, as we would want them to,\u201d said Tim Olson, vice president for digital media and education at the public radio station KQED in San Francisco. \u201cBut could they have opt-in options?\u201d\nWe can only speculate. Or turn to Android, the mobile operating system that has no such restrictions. But that means having different specifications for different apps, which is a pain for cash-starved nonprofit groups and even giants like PayPal, which does not allow in-app donations on its Android app. That\u2019s so it can maintain feature parity between its Android app and its app for Apple devices, where the Apple donation ban applies.\nMany public radio executives say they believe that Android users have not downloaded and used apps as much as iPhone users have. In a station\u2019s app, it would be easy enough to put in a \u201cPay for this program with a donation\u201d button, but because Android users are less active or have not registered their credit cards, stations like KQED don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the effort yet to build in-app giving for Android devices.\nWhich brings us to the workarounds. More than 1,000 churches use a service calledeChurchGivingto help draw in new donors. \u201cI\u2019ve got no cash on me, my wallet is in my car and I haven\u2019t seen my checkbook in five years, but I have my phone,\u201d eChurchGiving\u2019s co-founder, Eliot Crowther, said in describing the challenge that churches face. \u201cPeople use Instagram, Uber and Dropbox Monday to Saturday, and then they come to church and have a Windows 95 experience.\u201d\nThe company asserts that once parishioners register their credit cards, pick a home church and download its app, called Pushpay, they can then give spontaneously in about 10 seconds, even though iPhone users are sent to a web browser to complete the transaction.\nA new company calledPledgelinguses a similar approach with its app for Apple devices and aims to help users consolidate all of their charitable giving in one place. Other start-ups have tried this before with various degrees of success, but Pledgeling hopes that its dead-simple interface and social tools will give it traction.\nA Pledgeling co-founder, Lee Fentress, said the idea for the service had been percolating for years, driven by a single question: Why is donating not an easy thing to do? (Sensing an echo here? There is no shortage of people who feel this way and want to use an app that quickly and spontaneously helps a nonprofit organization, much as they use an app to summon a car and driver.)\nPledgeling donors and nonprofit groups currently pay nothing for the service. The start-up hopes that recipients and some companies will eventually pay for its services and the ability to reach users willing to hear from them. One quirk worth noting: If you don\u2019t click the \u201cAnonymous\u201d button when giving through its site, Pledgeling willpost on its website that you donated(though not the amount).\nBut even now, years into the app age, the questions about Apple linger. Can it simply not be bothered with figuring out how to make one-tap donations work? The company and chief executive, Tim Cook, care enough about its reputation thatit is nowmatching employee contributions to charities and increasing corporate giving itself. It recentlyused iTunesto raise money for earthquake victims in Nepal. \u201cI have had hope, and still do, that Tim Cook will bring more of a philanthropic orientation to the company,\u201d said Jake Shapiro, chief executive of the public radio distributor PRX,who has writtenabout the issue himself.\nMr. Fentress of Pledgeling claims no inside knowledge, but he\u2019s still willing to predict that Apple will make one-tap giving inside apps a reality. \u201cYou can call me na\u00efve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s been long enough that some type of change will occur. At the end of the day, it would ultimately mean that more money would be unlocked for charity.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple TV Remote Expected to Add Touch Pad in Redesign",
        "fulltext": "Apple has long ridiculed remote controls for being too complex. Now after eight years of a minimalist design for its Apple TV remote, the company is revising the device\u2019s design.\nWhen Apple introduces its new TV box this summer, the remote control will gain a touch pad and also be slightly thicker than the current version, according to an employee briefed on the product, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the device was confidential. The touch pad can be used for scrolling around and there will also be two physical buttons, the person said. The remote\u2019s thicker size is comparable to the remote control for Amazon\u2019s wireless speaker, the Echo, the person added.\nTom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment on the product.\nThe current Apple TV remote has been an important case study for Apple\u2019s employee training program,Apple University. In one course, instructors compared the Google TV\u2019s remote control, which had 78 buttons, with the Apple TV remote, a thin piece of metal that in its current version has three buttons. The Apple remote was used to show how the company\u2019s product designers started out with an idea and debated until they had just what they needed for the device to be usable and easy to understand, according to people who have taken the course.\nSteve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, had long emphasized simplicity in product design, an aesthetic that had long permeated the company\u2019s offerings. One of his core values was making complex computer technologies feel understandable and natural.\nAdding a touch pad to the Apple TV remote would bring it in line with Apple\u2019s other accessories. Apple\u2019s wireless mouse, the Magic Mouse, and Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad both have touch controls.\nThe redesign for the new remote will be the first big change to the Apple remote since the Apple TV\u2019s introduction in 2007. The Apple TV is essentially a set-top box that connects to a television, allowing people to stream content over an Internet connection. The first Apple TV included a plastic white remote with a few buttons. The following version was metal with minor changes to the buttons.\nThe new Apple TV is expected to be introduced this June during Apple\u2019s annual conference for software developers, according to the employee briefed on the remote. Apple has held talks with a number of leading television groups to offer an Internet-based TV service this year for its Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.\nThe service will offer a bundle of channels that is smaller and cheaper than the broad catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription, according to these people."

        "fulltext": "For many of the largest Silicon Valley technology companies, location software undergirds numerous applications and features in their products.\nFor Apple, it has been a game of catch-up.\nTo that end, Apple confirmed on Sunday that it had purchased Coherent Navigation, a Bay Area global positioning company, further bolstering Apple\u2019s location technology and services.\n\u201cApple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,\u201d the company said in an email.\nFounded in 2008, Coherent Navigation was a small firm that focused on creating commercial navigation services based on partnerships with companies like Boeing and Iridium, the satellite network operator, according to\n                                        a description on the LinkedIn page of Paul Lego, the company\u2019s former chief executive.\nSince its start, the importance of its technology has only grown.\nCoherent Navigation worked on high-precision navigation systems, technology that is far stronger than many consumer-grade global positioning systems, which are typically accurate to within three to five meters. In the\n                                        past, Coherent Navigation has also worked on autonomous navigation and robotics projects, according to previous company job listings, as well as projects for the Defense Department.\nIt is unclear exactly how Apple will use the company\u2019s services or technology, or if the company will incorporate its prior work into Apple\u2019s current products.\nTerms of Apple\u2019s acquisition of Coherent Navigation were not disclosed.\nThe acquisition, which was first reported by the technology siteMacRumors, is another in a string\n                                        of location technology service acquisitions made by Apple over the past six years. The purchase of Placebase, a small mapping service, in 2009 represented Apple\u2019s transition to building its own mapping technology.\n                                        Over the following years, Apple bought a string of companies in much the same vein, including Locationary and Hopstop.\nMany of these acquisitions were part of a broader strategy to move away from reliance on Google Maps, Google\u2019s widely used navigation service. In 2012, Apple released its own mapping service using in-house technology\n                                        as well as some licensed from TomTom, a Dutch digital mapping company. That replaced Apple\u2019s old mapping application, which was based on Google Maps.\nCompetition for location-based services has been intensifying, as some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech companies vie for more control over such technologies.\nIn February, Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, announced it had opened an institute for autonomous car research in Pittsburgh, where the company will work with the National Robotics Engineering Center and fund a series\n                                        of robotics fellowships and professorships in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University.\nMore recently, a coalition of German automakers has been competing with Uber to acquire Nokia Here, the digital mapping arm of Nokia, the Finnish technology company. If Uber is successful, the move will help lessen\n                                        its reliance on Google\u2019s mapping service, which currently underlies a significant part of Uber\u2019s navigation technology.\nA version of this article appears in print on 05/18/2015, on pageB6of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Apple Buys Coherent Navigation, a GPS Company, to Bolster Its Location Technology."

Mr. Ive will still oversee overall design, but with the\n                                        new title of chief design officer, he will also focus on broad projects like Apple\u2019s retail operations.\n\u201cRichard, Alan and Jony have been working together as colleagues and friends for many years,\u201d said Timothy D.

Mr.\n                                        Dye, who was a former design director at Kate Spade, started at Apple in 2006 designing product boxes for its marketing department, before taking the reins for the human interface group. He became deeply involved\n                                        in the Apple Watch and Apple\u2019s mobile operating system, iOS.\nSo what\u2019s left for Mr. Ive and his fancy new title? The chief design officer who was once described by Mr. Jobs as a \u201cspiritual partner,\u201d will still oversee overall design, but will travel more\n                                        and focus on projects like Apple\u2019s retail stores, he told The Telegraph, whichfirst reportedMr. Ive\u2019s promotion."

        "title": "How to Use Siri, Google Now and Cortana Voice Commands",
        "fulltext": "Q.I ask the Google app on my phone only about the daily weather forecast, but how does it compare to the Siri program for the verbal instructions it understands?\nA.Personal assistant apps that respond to spoken-word commands \u2014 likeGoogle Nowwith voice search, Apple\u2019sSiriand Microsoft\u2019sCortana\u2014 handle many of the same requests, especially those related to apps or services on your mobile device. By asking aloud, you can have the assistant send mail or messages to people in your contacts list, make phone calls, log appointments, get directions on a map, track specific flights and look up information online.\nYears ago, before Google created its Google Now service, the company began developing itsvoice-enabled searchsoftware as a way to make finding information on the web easier. The speech-recognition technology is a part of theGoogle app for Android and iOS, and the Chrome desktop browser also supports Voice Search. A voice-activated search begins with the words, \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d and the company\u2019s site hasa set of suggestions for what you can askon the Android, iOS or Chrome versions.\nWhen you have theGoogle Now feature turned onwithin the Android or iOS app, the service brings you the information it thinks you might need instead of your having to ask for it. This can include estimated times for your daily commute, reminders about new episodes of your favorite television shows or places to visit near your scheduled vacation destination.\nGoogle Now works most fully on phones or tablets running Android, particularly when it hooks up with many of the standard system apps. The virtual assistant also deliversupdates and notificationsfrom other programs on your device, andrecently integrated 70 new appsinto its workings. If you want suggestions for how to talk to Google Now, sites likeGreenbotandTrendbloghave compiled lengthy lists of the voice commands found to work with the service. (In addition to the actions meant to help your productivity, Google has included responses to more frivolous requests, like \u201cRoll dice,\u201d \u201cFlip a coin\u201d and \u201cWhat is the loneliest number?\u201d)\nSpoken-word commands are particularly helpful on mobile devices, whose keyboards are small. Apple\u2019sSiri app for iOSarrived in 2011with the iPhone 4Sand has been improving its usefulness ever since. To see a list of queries and commands you can use with Siri in iOS 8, tap the small question-mark icon at the bottom-left corner of Siri\u2019s main screen. And for those with Windows Phones who are curious about conversation with Cortana, Microsoft\u2019s site hasa list of sample questions and commandsto use with the program, which isalso coming to Windows 10.\nPreparing for a Speed Test\nQ.Why do I get different results on my tablet and my computer when I use the same web-based test to check my broadband connection speed \u2014 and why do I never get the speed advertised in my monthly plan?\nA.The typical web-based broadband speed test, which measures the time needed to download and upload a small amount of data, can be affected by a number of external factors. Most test sites state that you see faster test times over wired connections to the network, so if the computer is physically connected to the network router with an Ethernet cable, you are likely to get faster data transfer speeds than on a tablet that can only use a wireless link.\nSignal strength issues, distance and interference can slow wireless connections. The capabilities of the computer and tablet hardware can also affect the test results, as can the software running on either device, even if you are testing both over a Wi-Fi connection.\nSpeed-test websitesare meant to give you a general idea of your connection speed, but Internet congestion \u2014 as well as the sites\u2019 own software and hardware issues \u2014 can hamper them. The time of day that you test your connection might be a factor as well, as your Internet provider\u2019s network could be slower during peak usage times when other customers are all online.\nInternet service providers advertise their connection speeds as \u201cup to\u201d a certain amount, and if you are not seeing numbers remotely close to what you are paying for, first try improving your testing conditions. Most speed-test sites advise that you test your service on a wired connection when nobody else on the home network is downloading or uploading files, streaming audio or video or playing online games.\nYou should also turn off computers or other devices on the network that are not being used for testing because online backups, automatic downloads and other services that use the Internet connection could interfere. If your speed-test results are still well below the advertised rate of your connection plan, speak with your provider\u2019s technical-support department."

        "title": "Appeals Court Upholds Apple\u2019s Patent Victory Over Samsung",
        "fulltext": "An appeals court on Monday upheld the bulk ofApple\u2019s patent victory against Samsung Electronics in 2012, but overturned part of the decision and said that a lower court should reduce the total amount that Samsung would have to pay.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which deals with patent lawsuit appeals, said that the overall aesthetic of the iPhone \u2014 a rectangular product with rounded corners, black borders and a flat, clear surface \u2014 could not be protected and part of the damages would have to be recalculated.\nApple had accused Samsung of diluting its brand by copying the overall look of its iPhones. But the court said Apple failed to prove that the iPhone aesthetic was not \u201cfunctional.\u201d In other words, giving Apple protection for the overall look and shape of a smartphone would essentially grant it a perpetual monopoly over making smartphones work better, and the three-judge panel decided not to go in that direction.\n\u201cWe therefore vacate the jury\u2019s damages awards against the Samsung products that were found liable for trade dress dilution and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\u201d the appeals court wrote inits decision.\nJosh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, lauded the decision as having \u201cconfirmed Samsung blatantly copied Apple products.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a victory for design and those who respect it,\u201d he said.\nSamsung said in an email statement, \u201cToday\u2019s decision shows that Apple\u2019s claims over trade dress and damages lack merit and are grossly exaggerated.\u201d\nIn 2012, a jury unanimously decided that Samsung had violated a series of Apple patents and needed to pay more than $1 billion in damages, an amount that was recalculated to $930 million by another jury in a separate trial in 2013. Thelawsuit was prominent, pitting two of the world\u2019s top smartphone makers against each other.\nThe two companies have gone on to duel in other legal entanglements, before calling something of a truce. Last year,in a separate case, a federal jury found that Apple and Samsung had infringed on each other\u2019s patents in some mobile devices and awarded most of the damages to Apple. In August, however, the companies said theyagreed to drop suits against each otheroutside the United States.\nSeparately on Monday, Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, published an open letter to Apple. In the2,200-word letter, he said Apple\u2019s shares were still \u201cdramatically undervalued,\u201d and urged Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, to buy back more of Apple\u2019s stock because the company was sitting on too much cash."

        "title": "Apple Watch: A Test Run for Travelers",
        "fulltext": "Should Apple Watch, the latest smartwatch to hit the streets, be as much a part of your travels as your passport and toothbrush?\nThe Internet is awash inreviews for technophilesbut not travelers. And so I donned a stainless steel model and roamed Manhattan, testing apps and visiting hotels, landmarks and restaurants to glean how useful the watch may be for frequent fliers and road warriors. (I\u2019ll be writing about other smartwatches in the coming weeks.)\nOften, I was charmed. When I raised my wrist and said sotto voce into the watch, \u201cHey Siri, is there a public bathroom nearby?\u201d up popped a polite note: \u201cI don\u2019t see any public toilets. Sorry about that.\u201d When I ordered an Egg McMuffin at a McDonald\u2019s, I never reached for my wallet. Rather, I paid instantly by double-clicking the side button on Apple Watch (bringing up an image of my credit card), then holding it to a reader by the cash register. Glad I wasn\u2019t in Barneys.\nOccasionally, I was baffled. Like when I was trying to use the Uber app, which was seemingly frozen \u2014 until it wasn\u2019t. Suddenly it was ordering me car after car in what seemed like a digital-age version of the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d candy factory episode. (Frantically tapping the watch face, I was ultimately able to cancel the vehicles.)\nLike its competitors, Apple Watch ($349 for a silver aluminum Watch Sport model to $17,000 for an 18-karat yellow or rose gold Watch Edition model) mitigates a modern travel anxiety: fear of setting down your smartphone \u2014 in a cab, on a cafe table, in an airplane seat pocket \u2014 and kissing it goodbye. Your iPhone can remain in your bag or pocket while your Apple Watch hugs your wrist, subtly zapping it when a text message arrives, or flashing an alert when you pay for museum admission with your credit card (handy for budget trackers). It\u2019s one less thing to hold (and drop) when you\u2019re laden with luggage and trying to unearth a hotel confirmation number, or message the person picking you up at the airport.\nSetting up the watch, which you can order online for shipping in June, is easy if you\u2019re familiar with Apple products. It took me about six minutes to get it going, and even less time to load a dozen or so travel-related apps \u2014 including TripAdvisor, American Airlines, Expedia, Hotel Tonight, TripIt and OpenTable \u2014 onto my iPhone, which I paired with the watch using Bluetooth technology. For the uninitiated: You use your iPhone to add and set up the watch\u2019s apps, including Apple Pay (the contactless payment technology).\nIn general, your iPhone (which must be an iPhone 5 or higher) has to be within about 30 feet of your watch for it to be fully functional. Also, to complete certain tasks (mainly to answer the kinds of questions for which you would search the Internet), you must transfer them to the iPhone, a process known as a \u201chandoff.\u201d For example, when I asked Siri when the Museum of Modern Art opened, she found the answer, but for me to see it there had to be a handoff. So I pulled out my iPhone where, by swiping on an icon on the home screen, I could read the museum\u2019s hours.\nNot ideal, as technology writers have noted. But that aside, you can use the watch to perform all sorts of tasks without ever reaching for your iPhone; you can dictate text messages, answer phone calls, see emails and calendar alerts, pay for dinner, possibly open your hotel room door. If you\u2019re already an Apple customer, it\u2019s fairly intuitive. I figured out how to use many of the watch\u2019s travel features without the online instructions. (The main thing to learn, which I did look up, is that some actions require the same gesture you would use with any touch screen, while others require pressing down on the watch face.)\nAmong Apple Watch\u2019s most useful tools for travelers is Siri, the virtual assistant that can feel extraneous on iPhones. It\u2019s startlingly accurate when it comes to taking dictation (much more so than on my iPhone) and feels like a natural feature for a device that lives on your wrist. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said, raising an arm to my face. In return I received a vibration: Siri was ready to take orders. \u201cI want to write a text,\u201d I continued. A message appeared: \u201cWho would you like to text?\u201d So begins a swift way for anyone rushing to, say, an airport shuttle, to send an \u201cI\u2019ve landed; be there by 9\u201d text without having to fish out a phone, open the messages app and type (Apple Watch is all about talking, not typing).\nSiri was particularly inspiring one midnight, when I asked her to find pizza joints near Times Square. She pulled up a list faster than I could say \u201cgarlic knots.\u201d After I selected Ray\u2019s Pizza (not an endorsement but a matter of geographical convenience), she produced a map. You can use Apple Watch\u2019s digital crown (the knob on the side) to zoom in and out along your route, though reading a 1-inch-by-1-inch screen while walking is not easy.\nTravel apps that help you discover local restaurants and activities, like AroundMe and Yelp, worked smoothly, though Siri was more effective at uncovering what I wanted. Not that she\u2019s perfect. Now and then she ignored me. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I would begin, very solicitous. No response. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I would say again, this time slightly more crisp. Still nothing. \u201cHey. Siri,\u201d I eventually hissed. She was most giving when I spoke in a slow, sultry tone. But I\u2019ve since learned that you don\u2019t have to cajole Siri into action. Simply press and hold the digital crown for the \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d message. Then speak your request.\nOther popular travel apps such as TripIt, TripAdvisor and OpenTable also worked, though the Apple Watch versions are far more basic given the smaller screen. OpenTable, for example, merely displays your next restaurant reservation. You can\u2019t book a new one or see other reservations down the road (not very helpful). The Uber app is similarly no frills. You can\u2019t select whether you want an SUV or black car, for instance, the way you can on the smartphone version of the app. But, hey, you can request a car (or five), which is all you need on a rainy or late night.\nI had less success with Starwood\u2019s SPG app, which allows members of its loyalty program to check in and unlock their door at certain hotels using a mobile device. I was registered and cleared for keyless check-in at the W New York Times Square, only to be thwarted on arrival. The reservationist at the welcome desk couldn\u2019t have been nicer as he tried to divine why the app said, \u201cYour mobile key has been temporarily deactivated.\u201d He theorized that there might be a problem with the hotel\u2019s server. Whatever the cause, it wasn\u2019t an Apple Watch hitch \u2014 the SPG app didn\u2019t allow me to go keyless on my iPhone either. Instead I was given a plastic key card that on the front promised, in my case ironically: \u201cMy days as a key are numbered.\u201d\nThe Apple Watch is fun, and frequent travelers who take time to familiarize themselves with it can streamline some of their routine behaviors on the road. Is it essential? No. Do I want one? Yes. Because I like being able to read email, text, pay for things, and find nearby garlic knots from my wrist rather than having my smartphone in hand at all times.\nBut I\u2019ll probably wait for the next version (the watch I\u2019m sporting is a loaner). That\u2019s because there was one major letdown for this traveler: the Maps app, which offers both walking and driving directions. Since I was in Manhattan, I tried only walking directions. Sometimes the app couldn\u2019t find an address. Other times I was told, \u201cdirections not available.\u201d On several walks there were no vibrations, sounds or comprehensible shorthand directions between the starting point and my destination.\n\u201cHey, Siri, I\u2019m lost,\u201d I said into Apple Watch one breezy spring afternoon.\nShe replied, as is her way, with a note: \u201cYou\u2019re on 10 W 83rdStreet.\u201d\nClose. But not quite. I tried again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on 115 W 86thStreet,\u201d she wrote.\nNope. I asked once more.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on 147 W 87thStreet.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said. \u201cYou keep giving me the wrong location.\u201d\nShe responded in her usual polite manner.\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly entitled to that opinion, Stephanie.\u201d"
