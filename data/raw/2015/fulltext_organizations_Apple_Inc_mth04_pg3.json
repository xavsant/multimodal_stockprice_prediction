        "fulltext": "Big corporations likeWalmart,Apple,Salesforce.comandGeneral Electricand their executives have done the right thing by calling on officials in Indiana and Arkansas to reject \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws designed to give businesses and religious groups legal cover should they deny service to gay couples. But the business response to these laws raises a larger issue about the role companies play in the political process. If corporate leaders are serious in opposing discrimination, they should refuse to finance the campaigns of lawmakers who want to deny civil rights to gays and other minority groups.\nCorporations and their executives have long supported right-wing lawmakers who back their favored economic policies; the businesses looked the other way when those politicians pursued divisive culture-war campaigns against marginalized groups. This marriage of convenience has been extremely beneficial for both sides.\nThe controversy over the Indiana and Arkansas laws exposes the seams of that bargain. Some large companies are simply reacting to the change in public opinion about same-sex marriage. A majority of Americans now support it, compared with 57 percent who opposed it in 2001, according to thePew Research Center. Corporate executives realize they cannot afford to alienate their employees and customers. Most Fortune 500 companies prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation, and a majority provide domestic partner benefits, according to theHuman Rights Campaign.\nIn recent days, public statements from businesses like Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, have played a big part in getting the Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, and the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, to reconsider their previous support for the religious freedom laws as passed by their Legislatures. On Thursday, lawmakers in Indianaadopted changesto clarify that its law does not authorize discrimination. And Arkansas legislators changed their law so it closely mirrors a federal law.\nJust issuing corporate statements against such a law is relatively easy and actually doesn\u2019t provide protection against discrimination. If corporations and their executives care about civil rights, they should make clear that they will not donate to or support the campaigns of politicians who back such regressive legislation. They certainly shouldn\u2019t back lawmakers like SenatorTed Cruz, Republican of Texas, who is running for president and who has been a vocal supporter of the initial versions of the Indiana and Arkansas laws, and SenatorTom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who suggested on Wednesday that gays have it pretty good in the United States because they are not executed here as they are in Iran.\nAnother thing businesses can do is to make clear that they want lawmakers in all states to pass anti-discrimination protections for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people. More than three dozen chief executives oftechnology companiesdid just that in a statement released on Wednesday.\nCorporations have big and influential voices on the political stage, voices that been made bigger by Supreme Court decisions that allow businesses and executives to spend vast sumssupportingpolitical campaigns and through directdonations to candidatesand political parties. If they are embarrassed by religious freedom laws, they should think carefully about the people they are helping to put into office."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.I want to convert some old lectures on cassette tapes to MP3 files, but my MacBook seems to have only a headphone port. Many of the USB cassette gizmos for copying the recordings to the computer have software on CD \u2014 and my laptop doesn\u2019t have a CD drive either. What can I do?\nA.Although some MacBook models once had acombination audio port that you could manually switch in the settingsto accept sound input, this feature is not available on all of Apple\u2019s hardware. But you have other options, like getting an inexpensive adapter that links a standard audio cable from the cassette player to the Mac\u2019s USB jack.\nA dedicated USB-to-MP3 cassette converter can cost as little as $25. In most cases, it is one of the easier and least expensive solutions for transferring tape, because you do not have to find a working portable tape player, invest in a more expensive dubbing deck or cable the computer to the stereo components in the living room. This type of converter, which looks like a portable tape player with a USB cable for connecting to the computer, is usually sufficient for transferring spoken-word audio and other standard recordings.AGPTekandGGIare among the companies that make this sort of hardware and distribute it through major retailers like Best Buy and Amazon.\nEven if your Mac laptop did not come with a CD player to install the software, though, there are ways to make some USB-to-MP3 cassette converters work. If you cannot buy or borrow an external USB disc drive to use with the laptop, check the system requirements on the tape converter. Some models can work with thefree Audacity audio-editing programthat you candownload right to your Macfrom the Internet, which lets you skip the installation from a disc.\nMost Macs already come with the freeGarageBand recording softwarethat can also be used to import audio played through a device connected to the USB port. Just select the connected USB device as the input source in theGarageBand settingsbefore you push Play on the tape player and the Record button in GarageBand. Once you record a tape in GarageBand (or Audacity), you can use the program to clean up some of the noise and hiss from the tape and then save the file as a MP3 track.\nClearing Files on an Android Tablet\nQ.My Android tablet is almost full, and I don\u2019t have room to download a movie. Where do I look to see how much space I really have left?\nA.You can see a breakdown of your tablet\u2019s storage space \u2014 and what types of files are eating it up \u2014 in the Settings area. If you are not there already in Android 5.0, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settings box. Tap the bar at the top of the screen, and when the box expands, tap the cog-shaped icon.\nWhen you land on the Settings screen, go to the Device area and tap Storage. The next screen displays a color-coded graphic that shows how much total space your tablet has left, how much space you have filled, and what types of files (like Pictures or Audio) are taking up that space. Tap a category to see the list of files or programs included within it.\nIf you need to make room on the tablet immediately, you can delete items right from these screens. Weeding out things like bad photos or old files in the Downloads area can reclaim significant space.\nWhen you tap the Apps category on the Storage settings screen, Android displays a list of all the apps on the tablet and how much space each one occupies. To make more room by deleting little-used programs, tap an app in the list. On the next screen, you can tap buttons to clear the app\u2019s cache and other data eating up your megabytes. You can also delete the entire app from the tablet by using the Uninstall button."

        "fulltext": "ByKELLY COUTURIERUPDATEDDecember 20, 2016\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Related Article\nEuropean antitrust regulators recentlyorderedIreland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple as part of a broader crackdown on tax avoidance.\nThe move was the latest attempt by officials on the Continent to aggressively stamp out sweetheart tax deals that countries strike with multinational companies, including American tech giants. Along with Apple, the campaign has alsoensnaredAmazon and its operations in Luxembourg.\nTaxation is one of many issues that have put American technology companies in the cross hairs of European officials. In recent years, companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have faced many regulatory challenges over antitrust, privacy and tax matters.\nIn July, European officialsapproveda new agreement, known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, to regulate how American tech giants and thousands of other businesses move people\u2019s digital data \u2014 including social media posts, search queries, and information about workers\u2019 pensions and payroll \u2014 back and forth across the Atlantic. The new safeguards, among other things, provide a greater say for Europeans on how their information is used.\nHere is a breakdown of European inquiries involving American tech companies:\nAntitrust:European antitrust authoritiesannouncedin July a new round of charges against the company \u2014 the third set since early 2015 \u2014 claiming that some of the company\u2019s advertising products had restricted consumer choice.\nGoogle vigorously denied any wrongdoing in two previous European antitrust caseslinked to Android, its popular mobile operating system, and some of itsdominant online search services.\nGoogle could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules.\nEuropean regulatorsbegan formally investigatingthe tech giant in 2010 over antitrust issues regarding search results. Over the years, competitors like Microsoft have alsofiledformal complaintsagainst Google, as have media and telecommunications companies likeDeutsche Telekom.\nRight to Be Forgotten:Europe\u2019s highest court, the European Court of Justice, ruled in May 2014 that citizens had a so-called right to be forgotten, and that search engines, including Google, must honor some requests from users to delete links to personal information.\nEuropean regulators have since called on Google to apply the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d ruling beyond the borders of the European Union. In March, France\u2019s data protection watchdogfinedGoogle $112,000 for failing to comply with demands to extend the ruling across its global domains, including Google.com in the United States. Google filed anappealin May to overturn the fine.\nAs of April, almost two years since the court ruling, Googlehad passed judgmentin over 417,000 cases \u2014 roughly 571 a day \u2014 from people wanting linkstocertain search resultstobe removed, according tothe company\u2019s records. It approved fewer than half of those requests, all behind closed doors, raising questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people\u2019s privacy.\nTaxation:Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief who has become the bloc\u2019s chief tax inquisitor, said in January that she might look into the 130 million pound, or $175 million, settlementreachedbetween Google and the British government over back taxes. Spanish authorities in Juneopeneda new investigation into possible tax evasion by Google, and in late May, French tax authorities raided Google\u2019s offices there as part of an investigation for aggravated financial fraud. Google is also in discussions with Italy over back taxes.\nAntitrust:European competition officialsconfirmedin April 2015 that they had sent questionnaires to music labels and music streaming companies in an attempt to gather evidence and decide whether to open an antitrust investigation into Apple\u2019s new music service.\nTaxation:European antitrust officialsopened an investigationin June 2014 into whether Ireland gave preferential tax treatment to Apple. In August 2016,Margrethe Vestager, the European Union commissioner for competition,orderedIreland to collect as much as \u20ac13 billion from Apple because of what she said were illegal tax breaks.\nAntitrust:The European Commission opened an investigation in June 2015 into whether the company used its dominant position in the region\u2019s e-books market tomake it harder for rivals to offer lower prices.\nAs part of the investigation, the commission said it was evaluating the legality of clauses that Amazon had used with European publishers, which required them to inform the e-commerce giant of more favorable terms for books that were offered to other digital retailers. Officials added, however, that the opening of the investigation did not yet indicate that Amazon had broken the region\u2019s competition laws.\nTaxation:The European Union\u2019s antitrust office released a preliminary finding in January 2015 that a tax deal between Amazon and Luxembourg appeared to amount to unfair state aid that might have enabled the company to underpay its taxes.Antitrust officialshad openedthe investigation in October 2014.\nIn May 2015,Amazon revealedthat it was changing its tax structure. Previously, it had recorded nearly all of its sales in Luxembourg, but the company said it would start paying taxes in several European countries. An Amazon spokesman declined to say whether the changes were because of growing pressure from European policy makers.\nRight to Be Forgotten:Microsoft, which operates the Bing search service,signaledin July 2014 that it planned to follow the lead of Google, which responded to the high court ruling that May bycreating an online formto let individuals request removal of links to material they say violates their online privacy.\nAntitrust:In a long-running antitrust case involving Microsoft\u2019s software and interoperability, the company paid almost \u20ac2 billion in European fines over a decade, including apenalty in 2013for failing to adhere to an earlier settlement.\nData Privacy:European competition officialsfiled chargesin December against Facebook, accusing it of making misleading statements to receive regulatory approval for itspurchase of WhatsApp. Facebook, which faces a potential fine of up to 1 percent of its yearly revenue, denies the allegations. Facebook announced in August that it wouldstart sharingsome people\u2019s digital information between the two services. Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, said the potential of such linking was not explained when Facebook sought regulatory approval for the purchase.\nA regulator in Hamburg, which has authority over Facebook\u2019s activities across Germany,orderedFacebook in September to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany. The regulator also called on the social network to delete all information already forwarded from WhatsApp on roughly 35 million German users.\nIn late June, Facebookwonan appeal of a Belgian courtruling that found the company inappropriately collected digital information on users and nonusers.The appeals court said the Belgian regulator had no international jurisdiction over Facebook, whose international headquarters are in Ireland.\nFrench and Spanish privacy officialsannouncedin April 2015 that they had opened investigations into the social network\u2019s privacy policies; similar inquiries had already been started by Dutch, Belgian and German officials. The regulators asked whether Facebook received sufficient approval from users when the company gained access to their online data.\nAntitrust:The German competition authorityopened an investigationin March into whether Facebook misused its dominant position to collect people\u2019s digital information.\nTaxation:After Britain made changes in its tax laws that were aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there, Facebookannouncedin March that it would soon alter how it paid tax in Britain. The changes will potentially lead to the company\u2019s paying millions of dollars more on its operations in the country.\nAntitrust:TheEuropean Commissionfiledantitrust charges againstQualcommin December 2015, saying that it had abused its dominant market position in Europe by offering financial incentives to smartphone and tablet manufacturers that agreed to buy equipment solely from Qualcomm.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated when European antitrust officials opened an inquiry into Apple\u2019s tax arrangement with Ireland. It was in June of 2014, not September.\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated when France\u2019s privacy watchdog fined Google for failing to comply with demands to extend a European privacy ruling across its global domains. It was in March of this year, not March 2015.\nAdvertisement"
