        "title": "Tech\u2019s Biggest Companies Discover Austerity, to the Relief of Investors",
        "fulltext": "For much of last year, tech companies stumbled. Digital ad sales plunged. E-commerce sputtered. IPhone production stalled. And investors lost faith.\nIt was the worst year that the tech industry had experienced on Wall Street since the financial crisis of 2008. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta lost a combined $3.9 trillion in market value.\nNow chastened, many tech companies have begun the year by championing a new and unfamiliar business strategy: austerity.\nIn recent months, several companies have said they are looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate futuristic projects that have become money pits. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have each announced plans to lay off more than 10,000 workers.\nIt is an abrupt turn for an industry that became famous for its big salaries, extravagant offices and lavish perks, from free shuttle buses tofree laundry servicesfor employees. But as a boom that lasted 15 years comes to an end, shrinking profits are making tech executives rethink what they believed were important tools in an industrywide competition to hoard tech talent.\nOn Thursday, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, said it was \u201ccommitted to investing responsibly, with great discipline.\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, assured investors that the company would be \u201cthoughtful and deliberate.\u201d And Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, made his first appearance on a call with analysts since taking over from Jeff Bezos about 18 months ago and underscored how hard the company had worked to corral what looked like runaway costs.\nTheir message built on the tone thatMark Zuckerberg set for the industryon Wednesday when he called 2023 \u201cthe year of efficiency.\u201d During a call with analysts, in which \u201cefficiency\u201d was said more than 30 times, Mr. Zuckerberg talked about spending less on infrastructure, removing layers of management and killing dead-end projects.\nInvestors are cheering tech\u2019s new faith in financial discipline. Shares of Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp,jumped more than 23 percenton Thursday, its biggest daily gain in nearly a decade. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple all rallied, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 3 percent.\n\u201cPeople wanted to get back in, and they wanted to figure out when the water is safe to wade into,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment firm. He added that theFederal Reserve\u2019s decisionon Wednesday to increase interest rates by a modest quarter-point helped tech companies as well, because it suggested that the central bank was getting inflation under control.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need much good news for the stocks to outperform,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.\nBut shares of several of those companies dropped in after-hours trading on Thursday evening after they reported disappointing results for the most recent quarter, making it clear that tech\u2019s business challenges remain.\nOn Thursday,Googlereported its second decline in advertising, ever.Amazon said that its lucrative cloud computing businesshad slowed and that sales in its core e-commerce business had declined.AndApple posted its biggest declinein Christmas season iPhone sales since 2018.\nOn Wednesday,Metareported that its sales in the final three months of last year had fallen 4 percent. Last week,Microsoftsaid spending on cloud computing was weakening.\nThe market\u2019s reaction to lackluster tech earnings could be an indication of what is to come for the broader economy. Economists are trying to assess whether the economy can avoid a deep recession and achieve what some are calling a soft landing. If tech, as the most prominent industry to weaken last year, finds a bottom and begins to rebound, it would be an illustration of the relative strength of the broader economy, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist.\n\u201cSix months ago, the economy was contracting and interest rates were rising, and there was a rebalance away from the pandemic,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cThat perfect storm,\u201d he added, \u201cisn\u2019t true any more.\u201d\nAlphabet, Amazon and Apple all reported quarterly results that largely fell short of Wall Street expectations on Thursday. Alphabet posted its fourth consecutive decline in profit as it grappled with a slowdown in digital advertising. Advertising sales at YouTube, Google\u2019s video platform, dipped nearly 8 percent to $7.96 billion, below the $8.2 billion expected by analysts.\nAs Google\u2019s sales slow, Mr. Pichai said, the company is making various efforts to tame expenses. They include improving the financial performance of its phones and other gadgets, trying to make its cloud division profitable and strengthening YouTube\u2019s business.\n\u201cI see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company\u2019s cost base in a durable way,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.\nAt Amazon, Mr. Jassy has been pushing to trim costs for the past year. The company has been working through plans to lay off 18,000 corporate and tech workers, it added fees for grocery deliveries that had once been free, and it cut back from a breakneck warehouse expansion that left it with too much space.\nStill, Amazon barely eked out a profit, producing just $278 million in net income during the December quarter, as sales rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $149.2 billion.\nDuring the call with analysts, Mr. Jassy said he had been focused on reducing the costs associated with fulfilling and delivering packages. The company vastly expanded its warehouses and hiring during the pandemic to keep pace with demand. Even after almost a year of pulling back expansion, he said, \u201cthere is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient.\u201d\nApple lost an estimated $7 billion in iPhone sales during the December quarter when its largest iPhone factory in China was locked down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. The company offset those losses with strong sales of iPads, which increased 30 percent, and services such as subscriptions to Apple Music.\nMr. Cook said macroeconomic factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine, had contributed to the company\u2019s struggles. In the face of those challenges, the company said, it is reining in spending, which will help improve its profit margins.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work around costs,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cThat is paying off.\u201d\nThere are still regulatory efforts to curb the industry\u2019s power, including a lawsuit that the Department of Justice brought last month against Google, claiming it has abused its position as an advertising technology monopoly. But the impacts of those actions are far in the future.\nThe tech industry has been relatively effective at holding regulators at bay. On Wednesday, a federal judgerejected the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s requestto stop Meta from buying a virtual reality start-up. Last year, Washington lobbyists effectively stymied bills in Congress that aimed to open up competition on app stores and prevent tech companies from giving their own products preference on their platforms.\n\u201cSome of the pressure has come off because these guys have been hit so hard and had to lay off so many people,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president of Technalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. \u201cThere\u2019s a realization that they\u2019re not omnipotent after all.\u201d"

        "title": "Value Stocks? Growth Stocks? Markets Last Year Turned Everything Topsy-Turvy.",
        "fulltext": "It is impossible even to talk about the long bull market that ended in January 2022 without sayinghigh-growth tech stockspropelled the market higher.\nCompanieslikeAlphabet (Google),Amazon,Apple,Meta (Facebook),Microsoft,Netflix,Nvidia andTesladominated the headlines for years. Tech stocks and growth stocks were virtually synonymous.\nBut not anymore.\nThe new growth stocks, in the estimation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, an influential market analysis firm, now include fossil-fuel energy companies.\nThe world has changed radically in the last year or two, and traditional categories, like growth and value, are topsy-turvy.\nS&P Dow Jones Indiceshandles the plumbing behind the two most famous American stock market indexes \u2014 the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 and many other important world market benchmarks.\nIn an annualreviewof the S&P 500 index, it has found that the seemingly immutable connections between tech and growth, and between energy and value, in the stock market have weakened, if not snapped entirely.\nInvestors have often viewed growth and value stocks as two essential categories. Basically, growth stocks promise a lot in the future but deliver less right now. Value stocks, on the other hand, aren\u2019t usually trendy. They are priced well below what their advocates consider to be their real worth.\nBut which stocks belong in each category? The answer seemed obvious, until the stock market collapsed in 2022. The prices of tech companies were shriveling, and they pulled the entire market down.\nNow, using strictly mathematical measures, S&P Dow Jones Indices has found that Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft are no longer \u201cpure growth\u201d stocks. They have been replaced in the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index by an unlikely group: fossil-fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.\nThese conclusions are a startling sign of how much the world and its financial markets have been battered in the last year or two.\nUntil the S&P Indices findings, for example, Exxon and Chevron had been almost universally classified as value stocks. In the thinking that prevailed a couple of years ago, an urgent need to address global warming impaired the long-term viability of fossil fuel companies. Even among investors who favored their shares, these firms were presumed to be a good value precisely because they were so unfashionable.\nLast year, at least, those assumptions about growth and value stocks were overturned, along with many other presumptions about the world.\nRussia\u2019s yearlong war in Ukraine set off a series of unanticipated shocks that elevated world oil and gas prices. Energy prices have come down a bit, but still remain high.\nPublicly traded energy companies had outsize gains in sales, profits and stock prices.Exxon and Chevronhave both reported record profits for last year. The S&P 500 dropped more than 18 percent in 2022, but energy was the only sector to rise, with an eye-popping total return of almost 67 percent, including dividends. The sector\u2019s sales, price and earnings momentum transformed its biggest components into growth stocks, at least in the backward-looking lens used by S&P 500 Indices.\nAt the same time, the eight big tech companies stumbled, for idiosyncratic reasons, as well as systemic ones.Tesla, for example, faces serious competition in the market for electric vehicles, even as the Twitter escapades of its proprietor, Elon Musk, may be turning off some would-be car buyers. Metareporteda continuing decline in sales and earnings on Wednesday, though its stock soared on plans for further share buybacks, amid a broad stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases were abating. Still, the scale of its unprofitable investments in virtual reality have worried many investors.Netflix, which once said it competed only with sleep for the attention of its subscribers, now jousts with a horde of streaming companies.\nBut, in broad terms, two real-world factors are responsible for their reclassification this year. First, while the initial, lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic generally increased tech firms\u2019 sales and profits in 2020 and 2021, it set them up for a sharp decline in their growth rates in 2022 as the economy recovered.\nSecond, soaring inflation and rising interest rates \u2014 theFed raisedshort-term rates again on Wednesday \u2014 hurt the tech companies, too. Why? Basically because tech companies that entice investors with the mere promise of future sales and profits are worth less when the costs of waiting for those promises rise.\nIn short, the abrupt reversal of the eight big tech companies\u2019 momentum last year changed their profiles, according to the S&P Indices algorithms. Now, the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index includes just one: Apple. Despite periodic setbacks like the decline in sales and earnings it announced on Thursday, it has for the most part kept growing.\nHow are the others classified? The answer isn\u2019t simple. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft now reside in both of the two, more inclusive, S&P 500 growth and value indexes: subsets of the S&P 500 that welcome stocks near the middle of the growth-value spectrum. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla are only in the broad growth index, implying that they have retained more growth characteristics than Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.\nThe shifts are dizzying. They amount to a wholesale transformation of nearly a third of the market weight of the S&P 500 growth and value indexes. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest turnover since the start of current measurement methods in 2009,\u201d Hamish Preston, director of U.S. Equityfor S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview.\nIn decision-making, it helps if you know what you\u2019re talking about. But when it comes to growth and value stocks, it\u2019s not easy to know.\nGrowth funds based on the S&P 500 indexes now contain fossil-fuel energy stocks, and if you thought that by holding those funds you were owning tech stocks, you may be disappointed. Funds based on other indexes, like theRussell 1000 Growth index, haven\u2019t yet rebalanced their holdings this year, and they still look more like traditional growth stock funds. Buyer beware.\nBe careful in evaluating the horse races that have gone on for decades. Depending on the index, a stock that had been a growth champion may suddenly be running under the livery of value. These shifting labels raise questions, to say the least, about the enduring worth of such distinctions.\nAt the level of individual companies, finer distinctions can be made. There is a well-tested, disciplined value-investing approach used in analyzing stocks, one taught byBenjamin Grahamat Columbia, and practiced by his star student, Warren Buffett.\nBut unless you make a living with this method, I\u2019d say that this year\u2019s exercise by S&P Indices is invaluable in pointing out the pitfalls of choosing value or growth or any sector in broad bets on the markets. If fossil fuel energy stocks are growth companies in a warming world, what do those words even mean?\nAs an investor, I try to sidestep such judgments entirely. You can do that, too, by owning a piece of the entire stock and bond markets through broad, low-cost index funds that don\u2019t give a greater weight to one style or sector. If you have enough money to pay the bills, just let these investments mature over decades.\nWith that approach, you can observe the ever-changing spectacle of the markets without worrying about their sometimes tenuous relationship with common sense.\nFor my own peace of mind, I don\u2019t worry about shifting growth and value distinctions. I hold the entire market, and get on with other things."

        "title": "Apple Revenue and Profit Down as iPhone Sales Slow",
        "fulltext": "Whena Covid-19 outbreak in China forced a lockdown of Apple\u2019s largest iPhone factoryin November, the world\u2019s most valuable company warned investors that it would lose sales. The question was: How much?\nOn Thursday, Apple reported that revenue fell 5 percent to $117.15 billionduring the three months that ended in December,the company\u2019s first quarterly sales decline since before the pandemic. Profits decreased 13 percent to $30 billion.\nApple\u2019s results are the latest evidence of the challenges buffeting the tech industry.After recording double-digit sales gains during the early pandemic, companies have recently shifted to cost cutting and mass layoffs, with Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 each eliminating at least 10,000 jobs.\nA less severe whiplash has hit Apple. From 2020 to 2022, the company increased its annual revenue by nearly $125 billion. But demand for iPhones, iPads and Macs has slowed, causing investors to sour on the company. Over the course of a year, Apple lost $1 trillion in market value, a stunning reversal for the only U.S. company to ever reach a valuation of $3 trillion.\nThe company\u2019s shares declined about 4 percent in after-hours trading, reversing most of the gains from earlier in the day when tech shares rallied following Meta\u2019s earnings report on Wednesday. Wall Street had expected $122 billion in sales and $31 billion in profit.\nThough its business has slowed, Apple hasn\u2019t moved to cut jobs. Unlike some of its peers, such as Google and Meta, which aggressively hired during the first years of the pandemic to keep up with demand, Apple remained disciplined, adding 24,000 new workers, just 3,000 more than it added in the three years before 2020.\nStill, many investors have reduced their stakes in Apple out of concern its business will be hit by the slowing economy. Consumer spending in the United States, Apple\u2019s largest market, has declined, posing a potential challenge to sales of pricey iPhones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impacting the higher end consumer\u2019s willingness to spend and that\u2019s going to impact the most valuable company in the world,\u201d said Dave Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has about $5 billion under management and an investment in Apple.\nApple recorded $65.78 billion in iPhone sales, an8 percent decline from the previous year. The modest decline testified to the company\u2019s supply chain acumen. After the company shut down its biggest iPhone factory in November, it shifted some production to other factories, according to Counterpoint, a market research firm.\nOn the sales front, Apple benefited as more iPhone buyers chose its more expensive Pro models, lifting the average selling price 9 percent to $936, according to Counterpoint.\nApple offset its iPhone struggles with increased sales of its iPads and services. The company said its iPad business recorded $9.4billion in sales, a 30 percent increase. It increased sales of apps and subscription services such as Apple Music to $20.77 billion, about 6 percent from the previous year.\nThe company\u2019s biggest challenge remains its concentrated supply chain in China. The faltering of U.S.-China relations has accelerated, with Congress creating a special committee this year to evaluate competition with Beijing. Concerns are also mounting in Washington thatChina could soon take military action against Taiwan.\nAmid the rising tensions,Apple has shifted production from China to Vietnam and India. But a vast majority of its revenue continues to come from products made in China. And Chinese consumers count for about a fifth of total sales.\nDuring the December period, sales in China fell 7 percent to $23.9 billion. Apple\u2019s business there should improve in the current period as China\u2019s economy reopens after years of strict Covid-19 restrictions. Analysts predict sales in the current quarter will decline about 4 percent."

        "title": "\u2018My Watch Thinks I\u2019m Dead\u2019",
        "fulltext": "FRISCO, Colo. \u2014 On a recent sunny\u00a0Sunday morning, following a night of fluffy snowfall, tens of thousands of skiers flocked to the resorts of Summit County. Just minutes after the lift lines opened, sirens began blaring in the 911 emergency service center, where\u00a0four staff members were taking calls and dispatching help.\nEach jarring alert was a new incoming call, heralding a possible car crash, heart attack or other life-threatening situation. Often, the phone operators heard a chilling sound at the far end of the line: silence, perhaps from a caller too incapacitated to respond.\nAt 9:07 a.m., one dispatcher, Eric Betts, responded to such a call. From the map on one of the seven monitors on his desk, he could see that the distress call originated from a slope at the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area. Mr. Betts tried calling back. A man picked up.\n\u201cDo you have an emergency?\u201d Mr. Betts asked. No, the man said, he was skiing \u2014 safely, happily, unharmed. Slightly annoyed, he added, \u201cFor the last three days, my watch has been dialing 911.\u201d\nWinter has brought a decent amount of snowfall to the region\u2019s ski resorts, and with it an avalanche of false emergency calls. Virtually all of them have been placed by Apple Watches or iPhone 14s under the mistaken impression that their owners have been debilitated in collisions.\nAs of September, these devices have come equipped with technology meant to detect car crashes and alert 911 dispatchers. It is a more sensitive upgrade to software on Apple devices, now several years old, that can detect when a user falls and then dial for help. But the latest innovation appears to send the device into overdrive: It keeps mistaking skiers, and some other fitness enthusiasts, for car-wreck victims.\nLately, emergency call centers in some ski regions have been inundated with inadvertent, automated calls, dozens or more a\u00a0week. Phone operators often must put other calls, including real emergencies, on hold to clarify whether the latest siren has been prompted by a human at risk or an overzealous device.\n\u201cMy whole day is managing crash notifications,\u201d said Trina Dummer, interim director of Summit County\u2019s emergency services, which received 185 such calls in the week from Jan. 13 to Jan. 22. (In winters past, the typical call volume on a busy day was roughly half that.) Ms. Dummer said that the onslaught was threatening to desensitize dispatchers and divert limited resources from true emergencies.\n\u201cApple needs to put in their own call center if this is a feature they want,\u201d she said.\nHer call center and others have alerted Apple to the issue. In mid-January, the company sent four representatives to observe Ms. Dummer and her team for a day; she said they had plenty of examples to show off.\nIn a written statement, Alex Kirschner,an Apple spokesman, said, \u201cWe have been aware that in some specific scenarios these features have triggered emergency services when a user didn\u2019t experience a severe car crash or hard fall.\u201d The company noted that when a crash is detected, the watch buzzes and sends a loud warning alerting the user that a call is being placed to 911, and it provides 10 seconds in which to cancel the call.\nApple also said that updates to the software late last year had been intended to \u201coptimize\u201d the technology and reduce the number of false calls. Mr. Kirschner added, \u201cCrash Detection and Fall Detection are designed to get users help when they need it most, and it has already contributed to saving several lives.\u201d\nApple maintains a collection of incidents in which the two technologies have come to the rescue. In one case, an Apple Watch alerted the authorities after a driver in Indianapolis had crashed into atelephone poleand the device dialed for assistance. In another, a watch called for help after aNew Jersey man fell downa steep cliff while hiking.\nIn Colorado, call dispatchers had trouble recalling an instance in which a watch had saved a skier in distress. (Ms. Dummer added that her team had \u201cvery rarely\u201d received false 911 calls from other companies\u2019 devices, such as Android phones.)\nThe problem extends beyond skiers. \u201cMy watch regularly thinks I\u2019ve had an accident,\u201d said Stacey Torman, who works in London at Salesforce and also teaches spin classes. She might be safely on the bike, exhorting her class to ramp up the energy, or waving her arms to congratulate them, when her Apple Watch senses danger.\n\u201cI want to celebrate, but my watch really doesn\u2019t want me to celebrate,\u201d she said. Oh great, she thinks, \u201cnow my watch thinks I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nRecently she fell while racing to catch a bus in the rain. \u201cI went down hard, really hard,\u201d she said. Her watch did not call 911, however. \u201cWhen I did actually fall running for the bus?\u201d she said. \u201cCrickets.\u201d\nJon Baron, who works in real estate in Golden, Colo., has an Apple Watch that has twice dialed the authorities. Once, he was at an amusement park playing the strongman game, in which the goal is to hit a lever with a hammer firmly enough to ring a bell. Mr. Baron swung, the bell rang, his wife and children seemed duly impressed \u2014 until \u201cmy watch started making this noise like an air-raid siren,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was trying to show I was physically able, which I thought I\u2019d demonstrated fairly aptly, but my watch thought different,\u201d he added.\nAnother time, Mr. Baron was in the Tampa airport when the intercom summoned him to a white paging telephone. An emergency services operator at the other end told him his device had dialed 911 for help. Was he OK? \u201cI\u2019m doing all right,\u201d he said he had told the operator. \u201cBut I have a plane to catch.\u201d\nApple introduced fall detection technology in 2018 after developing an algorithm based on the trajectory of a wrist wearing a watch and acceleration at time of impact. Its crash-detection technology, introduced in September, was tested in crash tests and labs on iPhones and Apple Watches.\nBut something about the way skiers accelerate and stop, or jostle, seems to set the technology on edge. And skiers, in helmets and layers of clothing, often do not to detect the warning, so they may not cancel the call or respond to the 911 dispatcher.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t feel it or hear it,\u201d said Brett Loeb, emergency services communications director in Pitkin County, Colo., home to Aspen Mountain. Or, he proposed, even when they feel the vibration, \u201cthey think, \u2018I don\u2019t want to answer my phone right now \u2014 I\u2019m having a great time; my phone is killing my buzz.\u2019\u201d\nHe noted that Aspen Mountain had recently posted signs at lift lines and ticket offices alerting Apple Watch and iPhone 14 users to the problem and encouraging them to upgrade to the latest software version or disable the service, to \u201cprevent unnecessary trips to the slopes\u201d by 911-dispatched ambulances.\nAt the Summit County call center on Sunday morning, Ms. Dummer was training a rookie dispatch supervisor, Jeff\u00a0Fitch, to field 911 calls, while Mr.\u00a0Betts and another dispatcher, David Benson, handled the overflow and communicated with ambulances and the police.\nThe siren went off, and Mr. Fitch picked up the call. \u201c911,\u201d he said into his headset. \u201cHello?\u201d A monitor displayed the caller\u2019s location on the ski slope; another displayed the caller\u2019s number. Mr. Fitch leaned forward into the silence: \u201cHello?\u201d\nThe watch calls kept coming; the siren kept blaring. Amid it all, Ms. Dummer and Mr. Fitch fielded a genuine distress call from a 78-year-old driver who was having trouble breathing. Traffic was bad, hindering ambulance access, and the dispatch team was calling two nearby counties for help.\nJust before noon, Mark Watson, a sergeant with the sheriff\u2019s office, walked into the dispatch room looking glum. \u201cThis is not a good day,\u201d he said.\nOrdinarily, he had other duties, including patrolling the backcountry on snowmobile, but the ghost calls had kept him at his desk. Whenever the 911 operators were unable to reach the owner of the watch or phone, the case was referred to Sergeant Watson, who would try calling and sending a text; if he didn\u2019t hear back, he forwarded the issue to the ski patrol.\nSo far that day, Sergeant Watson had fielded seven referrals from 911, four of which he forwarded to the ski patrol. He turned to Ms. Dummer: How many crash-detection calls had come in overall? Eleven, she said, out of 30 calls total.\n\u201cI wanted to check the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cI was writing a letter to Apple.\u201d He described his basic message to the company: \u201cI\u2019m struggling to get my daily job done. I don\u2019t have all day to do Apple products.\u201d\nIn Grand County, home to a busy mountain called Winter Park, Sheriff Brett Schroetlin decided in late December to devote less attention to the crash-detection calls. Now if a 911 operator receives one from the slopes and no one is on the other end of the line, they know to ignore the call; no more referrals or follow-ups. None of the ghost calls so far have been real emergencies, Sheriff Schroetlin reasoned, and he couldn\u2019t afford to waste limited resources. Besides, he said, there was a better technology: human beings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that someone falls on the mountain and there\u2019s not a passer-by,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get an actual 911 call from the person or someone on the scene.\u201d"

        "title": "Tech Earnings Give a Wake-Up Call to Investors",
        "fulltext": "Shares in tech companies are in retreat after investors got sobering news on Thursday about three of the industry\u2019s giants \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Apple \u2014 including slowing demand for everything from iPhones to digital ads to cloud services.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing that from,I would think, everybody,\u201d Tim Cook of Apple said of the challenging environment on CNBC. That outlook is largely responsible for Nasdaq 100 futures being down 1.4 percent this morning, eroding Thursday\u2019s big tech stock gains after investors hoped that the Facebook parent Meta had shown tech how to operate in leaner times.\nPlenty of headwinds are hitting the tech sector.Central bankers this week reiterated that they\u2019re not done raising interest rates (even if market participantsdon\u2019t fully believe it). Together with a slowing economy, that has led companies and consumers alike to spend less \u2014 a move toward austerity that tech companieshave now embraced, after years of rocketing head counts and cushy perks to retain employees.\nAll three tech titans that reported earnings on Thursday made sure to talk about cost cuts, after Metaadded roughly $100 billion in market valuein the wake of an earnings report in which its C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, touted 2023 as a \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d\nHere are the big takeaways from Thursday\u2019s earnings reports:\nAlphabetdisclosed its fourth consecutive decline in profit, as ad sales at YouTube fell below $8 billion, falling short of analyst forecasts. On expense-cutting efforts, its C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, said: \u201cI see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company\u2019s cost base in a durable way.\u201d\nAmazonsaid its cloud business had slowed, as had its e-commerce operations. In his first earnings call with analysts since taking over as C.E.O., Andy Jassy said \u201cthere is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient.\u201d\nApplereported its worst holiday season since 2018, in large part because of Covid lockdowns that disrupted its largest iPhone factory in China. The company emphasized its efforts to spend less: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work around costs,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s C.F.O. \u201cThat is paying off.\u201d\nMeanwhile, doubts are growing about the durability of January\u2019s market rally.Michael Hartnett, Bank of America\u2019s chief investment strategist, warned clients this morning that while investors are snapping up risky assets like cryptocurrencies and high-yield bonds, he sees a looming \u201cbear risk\u201d for stocks as recession appears likely later this year.\nAnd Michael Burry, the investor whose bet against the housing market was memorably chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201dtweeted one word on Wednesday\u2014 \u201cSell\u201d \u2014 and then deleted his account.\nJob growth has cooled, economists forecast.Investors will be closely watching Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report, scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Theconsensus estimateis that 187,000 new jobs were created last month. Investors will also be watching wage data for signs of the labor market\u2019s effect on inflation.\nA top economic aide to President Biden will step down.Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council and an architect of many of Biden\u2019s sweeping economic policies, will leave the White House this month. His potential successors include Lael Brainard, the Fed\u2019s vice chair, and Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary.\nA Democratic lawmaker calls on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores.Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first member of Congress to urgean immediate banof the Chinese-owned video app from leading smartphone platforms, calling TikTok \u201can unacceptable threat to the national security of the United States.\u201d It\u2019s the latest sign of pressure on TikTok from all corners in Washington.\nA former Goldman Sachs president is reportedly in talks to become Carlyle\u2019s next chief.Harvey Schwartz, who lost the race to become Goldman\u2019s C.E.O. to David Solomon, is a top candidate to lead the private equity giant, according to Semafor. Carlyle has been looking for a permanent C.E.O. since August, when Kewsong Lee resigned following a power struggle with the firm\u2019s founders.\nShares in Nordstrom jumped 30 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday following a report by The Wall Street Journal that the activist investor Ryan Cohen hadtaken a significant stakein the department store chain. (DealBook has confirmed his investment.)\nMr. Cohen has shaken up companies before, having focused on so-called meme-stock companies like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond, bringing with him flurries of supportive online traders. But it\u2019s unclear how Nordstrom will respond to its newest gadfly.\nMr. Cohen hasn\u2019t made many demands yet.He has asked Nordstrom to replace at least some of its board; one clear target is Mark Tritton, whose compensation as C.E.O. of Bed Bath & Beyond was a target of his criticism. But it\u2019s not clear at the moment what Cohen thinks Nordstrom should do to better navigate the challenging environment for clothing retailers.\nHis activism history doesn\u2019t give Nordstrom much to go on.While investors usually know what to expect when veteran activist shareholders like Elliott Management target a company, Mr. Cohen has less of an obvious playbook:\nThough he became chairman of GameStop and changed up its board and management team, some analysts have said hehasn\u2019t fundamentally improvedthe video game retailer\u2019s operations.\nAt Bed Bath & Beyond, Cohen called for a board revamp and urged the sale of the retailer\u2019s Buy Buy Baby subsidiary \u2014 but the latter hasn\u2019t happened. He has since sold off his stake, and Bed Bath & Beyond is now likely to file for bankruptcy.\nNordstrom has some protections, including a founding family that owns about 30 percent of its stock. For now, the company is striking a cordial tone: \u201cWhile Mr. Cohen hasn\u2019t sought any discussions with us in several years, we are open to hearing his views, as we do with all Nordstrom shareholders,\u201d a company representative said in a statement.\nInvestors again dumped shares this morning in some companies tied to the Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, as his business empire has shed over $100 billion in market value since an American short seller accused its leaders of market manipulation and fraud.\nNevertheless, some good news for the Adani Group has emerged \u2014 even if the long-term prospects for the conglomerate remain cloudy.\nThe positive developments:The ratings agency Fitch said it hadno immediate plans to downgradethe bonds of the Adani companies it follows; that led to a modest rally in those notes. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have reportedly told some clients that Adani-related debtcould still be a good investment. And the Adani Group said it was in talks toprepay some of its outstanding loansto restore confidence in its finances.\nAll this may come as a relief to Adani investors, a group that\u2019s surprisingly global. BlackRock and TIAA are amongthose that own Adani bonds; Total, the French energy giant, told investors that it has about$3.1 billion worth of stakesin Adani Group companies.\nNot everything is looking up, however.S&P Dow Jones said on Friday that it was removing the flagship Adani Enterprises from its sustainability index, citing the allegations by the short seller, Hindenburg Research. Meanwhile, shares of Adani Green Energy and Adani Total Gas again fell sharply on Friday, and Adani Enterprises\u2019 stock finished down 2.2 percent on the day.\nAnd while the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s, like Fitch, didn\u2019t downgrade any Adani debt, it warned that further stock slides in Adani Group companies couldhurt their ability to raise moneyover the next one to two years.\n\u2014The combined 2022 revenue ofChevron,ConocoPhillips,Exxon MobilandShell, as the oil industry enjoyed a record year amid higher energy prices.\nChatGPT has become one of the biggest breakout technologies in years, with its ability to write poems (and, somewhat controversially,news reports), generate code and more having captured the popular imagination. It has stoked ever-growing enthusiasm about the possibilities of A.I.:Bill Gates recently told Forbes, \u201cThis is every bit as important as the PC, as the internet.\u201d\nBut ChatGPT\u2019s public debut wasn\u2019t part of an intricately planned rollout by its parent company, OpenAI. Instead, thestart-up\u2019s employees were surprisedwhen its leaders directed them to release a public version of their chatbot technology in two weeks, according to The Times\u2019s Kevin Roose in his latest column:\nSome were worried that rival companies might upstage them by releasing their own A.I. chatbots before GPT-4, according to the people with knowledge of OpenAI. And putting something out quickly using an old model, they reasoned, could help them collect feedback to improve the new one.\nSo they decided to dust off and update an unreleased chatbot that used a souped-up version of GPT-3, the company\u2019s previous language model, which came out in 2020.\nThirteen days later, ChatGPT was born.\nThe results are hard to argue with.ChatGPT has more than 30 million users and gets roughly five million visits a day, Roose writes, citing two sources. That makes it one of the fastest-growing software products in recent memory.\nDeals\nTrian called on Disney toreplace an existing board member, Michael Froman, with the activist investor\u2019s co-founder, Nelson Peltz.

        "title": "Investors Cheer Meta\u2019s Slimmed-Down Ambitions",
        "fulltext": "Ahead of a mammoth day for tech earnings, investors already like what they see.\nMeta shares are popping in premarket trading this morning \u2014 up nearly 20 percent at 7 a.m. Eastern \u2014 after the social networking giant reported revenues above analysts\u2019 expectations and detaileda $40 billion stock buyback plan.\nComments by Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s C.E.O., about 2023 being the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d also appear to be reassuring investors that Big Tech companies, which have announced a string of layoffs recently, are serious about rethinking their spending priorities in an uncertain economy.\nUp today are Apple, Amazon and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet.Shares of all three were trading higher in premarket; Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.3 percent as of 7 a.m. Eastern. Wall Street hopes that Meta\u2019s earnings will prove part of a wider trend that the digital advertising market, the lifeblood of so many tech firms, is beginning to rebound.\n\u201cMeta\u2019s solid 4Q22 results/1Q23 guide is a big relief for the stock but also for the digital ad market at large, showing that ad demand has not fallen off of a cliff amid macro headwinds as feared,\u201d analysts at Truist Securities wrote to investors on Wednesday. After falling 64 percent last year, Meta shares have risen more than 27 percent this year, based on Wednesday\u2019s close.\nStill, Meta\u2019s bet on the metaverse remains expensive.Costs rose by 22 percent for the quarter, compared with last year, and the company has had to trim elsewhere partly to compensate for its spending on virtual reality. It took a $4.2 billion restructuring charge for the fourth quarter, including the cost of severance for employees it laid off last year.\nMeta isn\u2019t backing off on the metaverse. \u201cI think it would be a mistake for us to not focus on any of these areas, which I think are going to be fundamentally important to the future,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told investors last year. Another key to Meta\u2019s future: further investments in artificial intelligence to improve business operations.\nMeta also scored a big legal win.A federal judgerejected the F.T.C.\u2019s requestto stop the company acquiring a virtual reality start-up called Within \u2014 a decision seen as a blow to the Biden administration\u2019s merger enforcement strategy under Lina Khan as F.T.C. chair. The case is the first developed entirely under Ms. Khan, a Biden appointee who hassought to expand the boundaries of antitrust law.\nThe F.T.C. relied on a little-used legal argument that the deal would threaten future competition in a nascent sector.The ruling is still under seal, but that hasn\u2019t stopped legal experts from speculating on the fallout. William Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman,told The Timesthat it would be particularly problematic for the F.T.C. if the judge has panned the arguments underpinning the challenge. A better result would be that those theories were considered plausible, but the facts came up short.\nInvestors are on central bank watch after the Fed\u2019s modest rate increase.The Fed raised interest ratesby a quarter percentage pointyesterday, the smallest increase since March, as it acknowledged that inflation has cooled. The Bank of England raised its prime lending rate by half a percentage point; the European Central Bank is forecast to do the same later on Thursday.\nShell joins oil giants in reporting record profit.The British oil producer earned roughly $40 billion last year,its highest profit in 115 years, as fuel demand after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring. Chevron and Exxon Mobil reported similarly rosy figures earlier in the week.\nThe E.U. reportedly advances its inquiry into Microsoft\u2019s deal for Activision Blizzard.The European Commissionsent Microsoft its objectionsto the $69 billion takeover proposal on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. Next come negotiations over potential remedies; the commission is considered less opposed to the transaction than the F.T.C., which has sued to block it.\nThe F.T.C. accuses GoodRx of leaking users\u2019 health data.The popular drug discount app shared sensitive information about customers\u2019 prescriptions and illnesseswith companies like Facebook and Googlewithout authorization, according to the F.T.C. GoodRx settled the charges without admitting wrongdoing.\nA new, paid version of ChatGPT is announced.OpenAI, which created the A.I. chatbot, said it was introducing a$20-a-month appoffering round-the-clock access; the free version is frequently overwhelmed by demand. Microsoft reportedly plans to soon update its Bing search engine witha faster version of ChatGPT, according to Semafor.\nShares in companies tied to the Indian tycoon Gautam Adani fell again today, after his flagship company unexpectedlypulled a $2.5 billion stock offeringdespite securing support from investors. And comments by the billionaire today defending his business empire failed to stop the financial bleeding.\nAdani companies have now shed some $108 billion over the past eight days, with the flagship Adani Enterprises falling nearly 29 percent today alone. That carnage began after the American short seller Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and fraud. Among Hindenburg\u2019s central accusations is that the conglomerate inflated its companies\u2019 share prices through a maze of offshore tax shelters.\nMr. Adani himself, until last week ranked as Asia\u2019s wealthiest man, has personally lost an estimated$48 billionin wealth in the past month.\nInvestors may be spooked by the pulling of Adani Enterprises\u2019 offering.The sale, which ended on Tuesday and would have set a fund-raising record for an Indian company, was meant to lower the company\u2019s debt burden while drawing new top-flight investors, especially from abroad.\nAdani Enterprises has described withdrawing the offering as the \u201cmorally correct\u201d thing to do given its volatile stock price: By this morning, its shares traded at just 1,565.30 rupees ($19), around half the offering\u2019s floor price. And in afour-minute video addressposted online today before Indian markets opened, Mr. Adani said pulling the deal would insulate the company\u2019s investors from steep losses: \u201cThe interest of my investors is paramount.\u201d\nBut scrutiny of the Adani empire is growing.India\u2019s Securities and Exchange Boardis reportedly looking into Adani Enterprises\u2019 stock drop and potential issues with the now-withdrawn offering, according to Reuters.\nAnd investors are looking into both the Adani Group\u2019s corporate governance \u2014 given the tight control that Mr. Adani and his family exert \u2014 and the conglomerate\u2019s debt load, including over $2 billion in debt payments that are owed this year andmore than $700 milliondue this quarter alone.\n\u201cThe biggest risk is that the matter escalates such that onshore banks and investors lose confidence in the group, and that it impacts their access to financing,\u201d Leonard Law, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics in Singapore, told DealBook. He added that could most affect highly indebted parts of the Adani universe, including Adani Green Energy, whose shares have fallen 10 percent this morning, and have halved over the past three weeks.\n\u2014 Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece calling on U.S. lawmakers toban cryptocurrencies.\nChina\u2019s reopening last month and itsswift market turnaroundhave stoked hopes for a worldwide economic recovery, and prompted cautious renewed interest from global business players.\nBut geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the West, and lessons drawn from sanctions imposed on Russia during the Ukraine war, have some policymakers and investors alike warning that the U.S. should be minimizing exposure to China over the long term.\nSome investors are seeking to capitalize on that tension.Strive Asset Management, the investment firm co-founded by the self-described anti-woke campaigner Vivek Ramaswamy, recently set up a $100 million exchange-traded fund that focuses on 24 emerging markets but excludes China.\nMr. Ramaswamy told DealBook that China was an underappreciated geopolitical risk, and that few big institutional investors had been willing to risk offending its authoritarian government by making criticisms \u2014 even as many of them embrace the environmental, social and corporate governance movement that he has attacked. That said, he argued Strive\u2019s new fund was not aimed specifically at conservatives, citing bipartisan wariness about China.\nConcerns over Beijing are indeed widespread.Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have called on President Biden to create a way tooversee American investmentsin China, much as it already reviews foreign investment in the U.S. The White House is reportedlyworking on an executive orderalong those lines, and is deliberating abouthow broadly to apply it.\nE.U. governments are alsoconsidering restrictionson companies\u2019 investments abroad, driven largely by worries about China. And pension funds around the world are reconsidering, or withdrawing, their investments in the country.\nAmerican deal making in China has dried up.Only about 0.4 percent of global private equity investment from the U.S. went into China last year, according to the American Investment Council, down from 1.2 percent in 2017.

        "title": "Senator Calls on Apple and Google to Ban TikTok in App Stores",
        "fulltext": "Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, called on Apple and Google Thursday to remove TikTok from their app stores because of national security concerns, as bipartisan pressure on the Chinese-owned company escalates.\nMr. Bennet, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent the chief executives of Apple and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, a letter saying no company subject to \u201cChinese Communist Party dictates should have the power to accumulate such extensive data on the American people or curate content to nearly a third of our population.\u201d\nTikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, has faced questions about its data practices and whether it is transmitting information about Americans collected from its app to the Chinese authorities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for us to make it available the way we have, and I hope that Apple and Google will take this as an opportunity to lead in this debate,\u201d Mr. Bennet said in a phone interview.\nHis letter to Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet \u2014 the latest shot against TikTok in what has become anational frenzy among lawmakers\u2014 shows that Democrats are eagerly joining a campaign that was largely led by Republicans until recently. Mr. Bennet\u2019s call harks back to theTrump administration\u2019s effortto bar TikTok and WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, from U.S. app stores in September 2020, a move that met legal resistance and ultimately failed.\nLawmakers andregulatorshave increasingly criticized TikTok as it waits for the Biden administration to respond to the company\u2019s plan, submitted in August, detailing how it will prevent the Chinese government from having access to data on U.S. users, and how it will offer the U.S. government oversight of the platform.\nBrooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said the letter relied on \u201cmisleading reporting about TikTok, the data we collect and our data security controls.\u201d She added that it also ignored the company\u2019s substantial investment in its plan, known as Project Texas, \u201cto provide additional assurances to our community about their data security and the integrity of the TikTok platform.\u201d\nGoogle and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\nMore than two dozen states, including several led by Democratic governors, have banned TikTok in some fashion in the past two months. A bipartisan bill that was introduced in Congress in December would ban the app for everyone in the United States. Somecollege campusesand cities have also adopted bans.\nLawmakers have expressed concern about a Chinese media law that allows the government to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens and TikTok\u2019s content recommendation system.\nTikTok has said its plan will \u201cmeaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level.\u201d Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s chief executive, has agreed toappear before a House committeein March."
