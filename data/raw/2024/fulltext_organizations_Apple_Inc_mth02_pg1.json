        "title": "Vision Pro Review: Apple\u2019s First Headset Lacks Polish and Purpose",
        "fulltext": "About 17 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod, a phone and an internet browser.\n\u201cThese are not three separate devices,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.\u201d\nAt $500, the first iPhone was relatively expensive, but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge. There were flaws \u2014 including sluggish cellular internet speeds. But the iPhone delivered on its promises.\nOver the last week, I\u2019ve had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: theVision Pro, a virtual reality headset thatresembles a pair of ski goggles. The $3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos.\nApple calls it a \u201cspatial computer\u201d that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games.\nApple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $3,500with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $200 carrying case, $180 AirPods and $150 prescription lens inserts.) After using the headset for about five days, I\u2019m unconvinced that people will get much value from it.\nThe device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I\u2019ve used. It\u2019snot better for doing workthan a computer, and the games I\u2019ve tried so far aren\u2019t fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature \u2014 the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer \u2014 terrified children during a family FaceTime call.\nThe headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video, including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3-D that let you immerse yourself in past memories, which is both eerie and cool.\nIn the last decade, companies likeMeta, HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsetsto mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear, their apps were limited and they looked uncool.\nThe Vision Pro has a superior user interface, better picture quality, more apps and higher computing power than other headsets. But it\u2019s slightly heavier thanMeta\u2019s cheaper Quest headsets, and it plugs into an externalbattery packthat lasts only two hours.\nThe ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past. But the videos posted by early adopterswalking aroundoutside with the headset \u2014 men I call Vision Bros \u2014 confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles, even when they are designed by Apple.\nThe Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I\u2019ve tested in making an immersive 3-D interface simple for users to control with their eyes and hands. I let four colleagues wear the headset in the office and watched all of them learn to use it in seconds.\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone or a similar smartphone. You\u2019ll see a grid of app icons. Looking at an app is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to click on it, you tap your thumb and index finger together, making a quick pinch. The pinch gesture can also be used to move around and expand windows.\nThe Vision Pro includes a knob called the Digital Crown. Turning it counterclockwise lets you see the real world in the background while keeping digital windows of your apps in the foreground. Turning it clockwise hides the real world with an opaque background.\nI preferred to see into physical reality most of the time, but I still felt isolated. The headset cuts off part of your periphery, creating a binoculars-like effect. I confess that it was hard at times to remember to walk my dogs because I didn\u2019t see them or hear their whining, and in another session, I tripped over a stool. An Apple spokeswoman referred to the Vision Pro\u2019s safety guidelines, whichadvise users to clear away obstacles.\nWhen using the headset for work, you can surround yourself with multiple floating apps \u2014 your spreadsheet can be in the center, a notes app to your right and a browser to your left, for example. It\u2019s the 3-D version of juggling windows on a computer screen. As neat as that sounds, pinching floating screens doesn\u2019t make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them.\nI could tolerate juggling a notes app, a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated.\nThe least joyful part of the Vision Pro is typing with its floating keyboard, which requires poking one key at a time. I had planned to write this review with the headset before realizing I wouldn\u2019t make my deadline.\nThere\u2019s an option to connect a physical keyboard, but at that point I\u2019d rather use a laptop that doesn\u2019t add weight to my face.\nThe Vision Pro can also work with Mac computers, where you can mirror the screen into the headset as a virtual window that can be expanded to look like a large display. In my tests, there was a consistent lag \u2014 each keystroke took a fraction of a second to register virtually, and the mouse cursor moved sluggishly. I also instinctively wanted to control the Mac with pinches, even though it\u2019s not set up to work that way, which was frustrating.\nNext I tried the headset in the kitchen, loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients. Moving around while looking through the camera, I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset. The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated. Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness.\nVideo calling is now an essential part of office life, and here the Vision Pro is especially inferior to a laptop with a camera. The headset uses its cameras to snap photos of your face that are stitched into a 3-D avatar called a Persona, which Apple has labeled a \u201cbeta\u201d feature because it is unfinished.\nPersonas are so cringe that people will be embarrassed to use these in a work call. The Vision Pro produced an unflattering portrait of me with no cheekbones and blurred ears. In a FaceTime call with my in-laws, they said the blur conjured 1980s studio portrait vibes.\nOne of my nieces, a 3-year-old, turned around and walked away at the sight of virtual Uncle Brian. The other, a 7-year-old, hid behind her father, whispering in his ear, \u201cHe looks fake.\u201d\nVideo is where the Vision Pro shines. When streaming movies through apps like Disney+ and Max, you can pinch the corner of a video and drag it to expand it into a jumbo high-resolution TV; some movies, like \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d and \u201cAvatar 2,\u201d can be viewed in 3-D. The picture looks much brighter and clearer than the quality in Meta\u2019s Quest products. Audio quality on the Apple headset is excellent, but the speakers are loud, so you\u2019ll need AirPods if you want to use them in public spaces.\nThe headset\u2019s two-hour battery life is not long enough to last through most feature-length movies, but in my experience, this turned out to be moot because I couldn\u2019t watch movies for more than 20 to 30 minutes before needing to rest my neck and eyes from the heavy headset.\n(A caveat:The Netflix and YouTube appsare not available on the Vision Pro, but their websites work OK for streaming content.)\nI prefer watching movies on my flat-screen TV because it can be shared, but there are scenarios where a headset would be useful as a personal television, like in a small apartment or on a plane, or on the couch when someone else is watching a TV show that you\u2019d like to tune out from.\nVideos shot on an iPhone 15 Pro camera or with the Vision Pro\u2019s cameras can be viewed in 3-D on the headset, a feature called spatial videos. While watching a video of my dogs eating snacks at home, I could reach out and pretend to pet them. The videos looked grainy but were delightful.\nNot many games have been made for the headset yet. I tried some new Vision Pro games such as Blackbox, which involves moving around a 3-D environment to pop bubbles and solve puzzles. It looked nice, but after the novelty wore off, my interest fizzled out. It\u2019s tough to recommend the Vision Pro for virtual-reality gaming whenMeta\u2019s $250 Quest 2and$500 Quest 3 headsetshave adeeper library of games.\nThe Vision Pro is the start of something \u2014 of what, exactly, I\u2019m not sure.\nBut the point of a product review is to evaluate the here and now. In its current state, the Vision Pro is an impressive but incomplete first-generation product with problems and big trade-offs. Other than being a fancy personal TV, it lacks purpose.\nMost striking to me about the Vision Pro is, for such an expensive computer, how difficult it is to share the headset with others. There\u2019s a guest mode, but there\u2019s no ability to create profiles for different family members to load their own apps and videos.\nSo it\u2019s a computer for people to use alone, arriving at a time when we are seeking to reconnect after years of masked solitude. That may be the Vision Pro\u2019s biggest blind spot."

        "title": "Behind Apple\u2019s Doomed Car Project: False Starts and Wrong Turns",
        "fulltext": "For the last decade, many Apple employees working on the company\u2019s secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.\nThroughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped andrebootedseveral times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google\u2019s Waymo.\nBy the time of its death \u2014 Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence \u2014 Apple had burned more than $10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla\u2019s, according to a half dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.\nThe car project\u2019s demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs\u2019s death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.\nApple declined to comment.\n\u201cWhen it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. \u201cA decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain.\u201d\nWhen Applelaunched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Googlebegan testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn\u2019t want to be left behind.\nAt the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project\u2019s origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.\nApple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $200 billion business.\nDespite having a vote of confidence from Apple\u2019s chief executive, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.\nThe company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.\nMr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nFrom its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.\nApple, which by then had $155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company\u2019s culture.\nThe car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed racecars for Porsche.\nThe group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.\nTo bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Mr. Ive and the head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several start-ups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.\nMr. Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri.\nOne day, in the fall of 2015, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook met at the project\u2019s headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for a demonstration of how the car might work. The two men sank into the seats of a cabinlike interior. Outside, a voice actor read from a script of what Siri would say as the men zoomed down the road in the imaginary car. Mr. Ive asked Siri what restaurant they passed and the actor read an answer, said two people familiar with the demonstration.\nBut by 2016, it was clear that the car effort was in trouble. Mr. Zadesky left Apple, and his successor, Mr. Mansfield, told the team working on the project that they would be shifting their focus from building a car to building self-driving car software, said three people familiar with the shift.\nApple secured permits from California to begin test-driving Lexus sport utility vehicles outfitted with sensors and computers. It held discussions with car makers such as BMW, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz beforestriking a deal with Volkswagento provide Transporter vans for self-driving shuttles on Apple\u2019s campus.\nTwo more leaders took over the car effort in the years that followed. Doug Field, a former Tesla executive,laid off more than 200 employeeson the project as he leaned into efforts to build its self-driving system. Then Mr. Lynch, who succeeded him in recent years, reversed the company\u2019s plans and went back to its original idea of making an electric vehicle.\nMr. Mansfield and Mr. Field didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nAt the start of this year, Apple\u2019s leadership decided that it was a better use of the company\u2019s time to work on generative A.I. rather than the car,the company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday. The company said some members of the Project Titan team would be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence.\nIn interviews on Wednesday with The New York Times, people who worked on the project praised the decision to shutter it, saying the technology behind generative A.I. could be invaluable to the future of the company\u2019s all-important iPhone business.\nApple\u2019s dead car project will be survived by its underlying technologies. The company plans to take what it has learned about artificial intelligence and automation and apply it to other technologies that are being researched, including A.I.-powered AirPods with cameras, robot assistants and augmented reality, according to three people briefed on the projects.\nThough the engineers working on automation software will get to work on artificial intelligence projects, others on the car team have been told they will need to apply for different roles at the company.\nCade Metzcontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple Kills Its Electric Car Project",
        "fulltext": "Apple has canceled its plans to release an electric car with self-driving abilities, asecretive product that had been in the works for nearly a decade.\nThe company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday that it had scrapped the project and that members of the group would be shifted to different roles, including in Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence division, according to a person briefed on the discussion, who requested anonymity because the announcement was not public.\nAs part of the restructuring, Kevin Lynch, an executive who had been involved in the car project, will report to John Giannandrea, the company\u2019s head of artificial intelligence strategy, the person said.\nApple declined to comment. The news that Apple was ending its car plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg.\nThough Apple had not unveiled its car to consumers, the product had for many years been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst-kept secrets because it was being tested on public roads. The cancellation is a rare move by Apple, which typically doesn\u2019t shelve such public and high-profile projects.\nThe company has struggled in recent years to find new avenues for growth as its all-important iPhone has saturated the market and people are upgrading their phones less frequently than they used to.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, haspublicly hintedthat Apple was interested in entering the car space. The company had also beentesting hundreds of vehiclesequipped with autonomous driving technology in public for many years. The car, internally code-named Titan and Project 172, was a challenging product to develop, as parts of thedivision were shuttered, plans were scrapped and restarted, and dozens of workers were laid off along the way.\nThe car, which Apple spent billions of dollars researching, had been intended as a rival to Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles, which include autonomous driving features.\nThe product was important for Mr. Cook\u2019s legacy as it would have countered the perception that Apple had lost its ability to innovate and come up with the next big thing. Under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, the company has introduced a small number of new hardware products, including theApple Watch, which now leads the smart watch market; theHomePodsmart speaker, which flopped; and the Vision Pro, the$3,500 gogglesthat it released this month to rival Meta\u2019s virtual reality headsets.\nThe company has invested heavily on developing new technologies. In the last five years, it spent $113 billion on research and development."

        "title": "Stop Wearing Vision Pro Goggles While Driving Your Tesla, U.S. Says",
        "fulltext": "Videos being shared across social media this week depict an almost dystopian, futuristic scene: drivers of Teslas in Autopilot mode while wearing Apple Vision Pro headsets, seemingly unaware of the road in front of them.\nThe videos led federal transportation officials to issue warnings.\nBut are people really mindlessly riding around in Teslas in Autopilot mode, wearing Apple\u2019sfuturistic new goggles? Or is it all just a bit? Part of a never-ending cycle of people doing silly things for clicks, likes, views and clout?\nThe new goggles have a feature that merges digital apps and one\u2019s surroundings into one immersive space, and videos of people wearing them in strange settings have started to crop up across the internet since they were released on Feb. 2.\nSeveral of the videos taken in cars appear staged, and in many, it is clear that someone other than the driver is recording. The videos are not widespread. Still, they seemed reckless enough for Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, to weigh in on social media.\n\u201cReminder \u2014 ALL advanced driver assistance systems available today require the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times,\u201dMr. Buttigieg said in a post on Xthat included a video of a driver using a headset in what appeared to be a Tesla Cybertruck pickup.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also chimed in on Tuesday. The agency said in a statement that \u201cdriving while wearing a V.R. headset is reckless and disregards the safety of everyone on the road.\u201d\nDante Lentini, 21, who posted avideo of himself behind the wheel of a moving Tesla while wearing a Vision Pro headset, said in an interview, \u201cIt was all just for content.\u201d\nIn the video, Mr. Lentini appears to be typing while wearing the headset as introspective piano music plays in the background.\n\u201cThink different,\u201d Mr. Lentini wrote on X, in an apparentnod to a famous Apple advertising campaignfrom the late 1990s. His video has been viewed more than 24 million times. (One commenter wrote, \u201cI genuinely hope you get arrested for this.\u201d)\nLater in the video, Mr. Lentini appears to have been pulled over in a parking lot, and there are police vehicles in the background with their lights on. The way the video is edited, it suggests that Mr. Lentini was pulled over for driving while wearing the headset.\nBut Mr. Lentini said in the interview that the police were responding to something else in the area at the time, and that he and someone else recorded them in the \u201cright time, right moment.\u201d\nHe also said that, despite how it appears in the video, he did not have any apps turned on in the headset and he wore it for only about 30 seconds.\n\u201cThat was just for the video,\u201d he said.\nAcross social media, videos and images have circulated not just of people driving while wearing the Vision Pro headset, but also whiledining at restaurantsandworking out at the gym.\nIs this the future? A world in which people can\u2019t step away from the digital realm long enough to focus solely on everyday tasks such as socializing or exercising?\nEric Decker, a YouTube and TikTok creator who goes by the name Airrack, posted avideopoking fun at an \u201caverage day for an Apple Vision Pro owner,\u201d showing him wearing the headset while lifting weights at the gym, getting his hair cut, going through airport security, walking down a street and even showering. (The Vision Pro is not waterproof.)\n\u201cI truly feel most of these videos are skits,\u201d Mr. Lentini said. \u201cYou can just tell.\u201d\nStill, skit or not, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday that distracted driving is no joke. In 2021, more than 3,500 people in the United States were killed in crashes involving distracted driving, and more than 360,000 were injured, the agency said.\n\u201cThere are no fully autonomous vehicles available for sale today,\u201d the agency said.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Apple declined to comment about the videos, but referred tosafety guidance on its website about how to properly use Vision Pro.\n\u201cNever use the device while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety,\u201d the company says.\nMr. Lentini said that the Vision Pro headset has a driving mode feature intended for passengers that disables the use of many apps.\nApple has billed Vision Pro as a \u201cspatial computing\u201d device that allows users to watch videos, send emails and surf the internet in a immersive virtual reality. The headsets start at $3,499."
