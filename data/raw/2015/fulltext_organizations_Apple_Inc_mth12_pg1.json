        "title": "Choosing an iPad Pro Keyboard",
        "fulltext": "Q.The $169 keyboard that Apple sells for its iPad Pro looks nice, but is it worth the money? What does it do that other iPad wireless keyboards can\u2019t?\nA.Apple\u2019sSmart Keyboardis expensive, but it wasdesigned specificallyfor use with the company\u2019s newer, larger iPad Pro tablet. The keyboard is flexible and can serve as a kickstand to prop up the iPad Pro for watching video when you are not using it for typing, and it can also function as a screen cover for the device when you are not using either part. The Smart Keyboard\u2019s typing surface is seamless, so debris and spilled liquids cannot get under the keys (as can happen with traditional keyboards), and the finish is stain- and moisture-resistant. Some keyboard shortcuts that work on the Mac can also work on the Smart Keyboard.\nThe iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard are linked via the Smart Connector interface, which has three small, round magnetic contacts on the edge of each device. The Smart Connector passes data and power back and forth between the tablet and keyboard \u2014 and frees the iPad Pro\u2019s Bluetooth radio for use with another peripheral device.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s keyboard is not the only one that can make use of the Smart Connector. Logitech makes aBacklit Keyboard Casethat can also link with the iPad Pro\u2019s Smart Connector and, as the product\u2019s name suggests, offers illuminated keys. Special iOS shortcut keys for things like screen brightness and volume are included, and costs a bit less, at $150.\nIf price is more of a factor than connector or industrial design, a regularBluetooth keyboardpaired to the iPad Pro is probably the least expensive option for adding real keys. For example,Zagg\u2019s Messenger Universal for iPad Proconnects via Bluetooth and costs $70. Apple\u2019s olderBluetooth Wireless Keyboardis also priced around $70 (or less) andpairs easilywith any iPad model; the company\u2019s newer $99Magic Keyboardis also Bluetooth-equipped."

        "fulltext": "Apple is introducing its mobile payments platform, Apple Pay, in China early next year, a move that will significantly broaden the service\u2019s audience.\nThe companyannounced a partnershipon Thursday with China\u2019s primary credit card network, China UnionPay,\n                                        and 15 Chinese banks. Chinese consumers will be able to upload their UnionPay card information to Apple Pay and use their iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, Apple said.\nApple Pay will become available to China UnionPay cardholders \u201cas soon as early 2016 after relevant tests and certification required by Chinese regulators,\u201d the company, which is based in Cupertino, Calif.,\n                                        said.\n\u201cChina is an extremely important market for Apple and with China UnionPay and support from 15 of China\u2019s leading banks, users will soon have a convenient, private and secure payment experience,\u201d\n                                        said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services.\nThe deal may give a boost to Apple Pay, which lets users pay for goods by holding a mobile device near a credit card reader; Apple Pay can now support credit, debit, store and loyalty cards. The service was begun in\n                                        the United States in September 2014.Apple recently added Starbucks, KFC and Chili\u2019sto the merchants that support Apple Pay, which is now accepted in 1.5 million locations in the United States.\nMany American consumers are still getting accustomed to mobile digital payments. Internationally, many consumers are more habituated to mobile payments, especially in countries where smartphone usage became the norm\n                                        first instead of PCs. In China, many consumers are used to mobile payments, and the country is one of the world\u2019s largest digital markets.\n\u201cThis deal is significant because of the massive number of people in Apple\u2019s demographic who have a UnionPay credit card, which is accepted everywhere in China,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at\n                                        Creative Strategies. \u201cThis deal says that we, Apple, embrace that China is moving toward a new payment terminal infrastructure. Like in this country the transition will take some time.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many stores in China will accept Apple Pay when the service begins in early 2016. China is in early days when it comes to installing the types of terminals that can accept Apple Pay.\n\u201cChina UnionPay is dedicated to promoting payment innovations and providing secure, convenient mobile payment experiences for its hundreds of millions of cardholders,\u201d said Chai Hongfeng, executive vice\n                                        president of China UnionPay.\nElsewhere, Apple Pay was introduced in over 250,000 locations in Britain in July. American Express said in October that it would bring Apple Pay to card members in global markets including Spain and Singapore; and American\n                                        Express members can already use Apple Pay in Canada and Australia."

        "title": "Apple Settles Tax Dispute With Italian Authorities",
        "fulltext": "Apple has reached a deal with Italian tax authorities over a dispute about how much tax the American technology company should have paid in the European country.\nA spokesman for Italy\u2019s tax authority declined to comment on the amount of owed taxes, though local news reportssuggestedthat the figure could reach as much as $350 million.\nThe investigation, which dates to 2013, examined whether Apple had moved roughly $1.1 billion in revenue from its Italian operations through an Irish subsidiary to lower the taxes that the company was obliged to pay in Italy.\nThe country\u2019s investigation into Apple\u2019s activities is the first time that an individual European country has focused on the company\u2019s complicated corporate tax structure, though policy makers in countries like France have previously looked at other tech companies\u2019 tax arrangements, including those of Google.\nThe move by Italian authorities comes as officials look to strengthen tax revenue from both local and multinational companies to offset the country\u2019s lagging economy.\nA representative for Apple was not immediately available for comment.\nApple\u2019s issues in Italy are the latest problem that the company has faced in Europe. The authorities are also investigating whether it had received anoverly generous tax dealin Ireland, where the company has large operations.\nThat separate investigation by theEuropean Commission, the executive arm of the European Union,is expectedto make its judgment in early 2016. The Irish government is likely to appeal any decision that would force the country to recover any owed taxes from Apple in order to protect a low tax regime that has enticed many international companies to set up operations in the country.\nApple\u2019s agreement in Italy is not expected to alter the company\u2019s tax arrangements in the European Union. Apple executives have repeatedly stated that they pay the required amount of tax in the countries where they operate.\nEurope\u2019s increased focus on Apple, though, forms part of a growing crackdown by European officials on the tax dealings of many American international companies operating in the 28-member bloc.\nIn October, for instance, Europe\u2019s antitrust authoritiesorderedthe Dutch government to recover money from Starbucks after accusations that the Netherlands gave the coffee retailer illegal state aid by letting it shift profits and pay lower tax rates than those available to other companies. Starbucks is appealing the ruling.\nAmazon and McDonald\u2019s, whose European operations are based in low-tax Luxembourg, are also facing similar inquiries into their tax dealings. The companies have denied any wrongdoing.\nApple, which has denied accusations that it does not pay enough tax in certain countries where it generates significant revenue, is just one of a number of American companies that have used Ireland as a base for its international headquarters.\nIreland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the Western world, compared with 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States, though Irish officials deny that the low-tax structure represents unfair competition."

        "title": "A Protest App Rises to the Top in Taiwan",
        "fulltext": "In a sign of the political mood in Taiwan, the top free application in Apple\u2019s App Store there for much of last week wasn\u2019t a mobile game or a social network, but a tool of protest.\nNamed Bingdela \u2014 after a Taiwanese phrase associated with overturning a table in rage \u2014 the software allows users to check whether food or drink products are associated with Ting Hsin International, a\n                                        conglomerate that last year was the center of afood safety scandal involving its cooking oil.\nThough the app first appeared last year, downloads spiked during the past week after a court in Taiwan ruled that the chairman of Ting Hsin was not guilty of a charge accusing him of violating Taiwan\u2019s food safety\n                                        law \u2014 even though his company knowingly imported products intended for animal feed and used them to make low-quality oil. The app\u2019s creator, Sky Lin, said it had gotten the bulk of its 260,000 downloads\n                                        during the past two weeks.\n\u201cPeople couldn\u2019t find a place to vent their anger, and that\u2019s where our product came in to play a role,\u201d said Mr. Lin, who added that he originally made the app not for profit or self-promotion,\n                                        but instead out of raw political anger.\nThe power of social media as an implement of political expression is well known. But Mr. Lin\u2019s product shows how apps can be specifically designed to solve more complicated problems of protests. In this case,\n                                        widespread calls for boycotts of Ting Hsin\u2019s products proved difficult because the conglomerate has several subsidiaries and sells its oil to other companies for use in their products.\nThe ability to tackle more complex problems gives people the ability to do more in situations where regulators or governments do not do their jobs effectively, according to Mr. Lin.\n\u201cThere are structural issues creating these types of food safety problems in Taiwan. It\u2019s a deeper issue with Taiwanese law and government. It\u2019s not an isolated case. We have seen it happen again\n                                        and again,\u201d he said.\nMr. Lin said he expected more of this type of protest to come to the fore in Taiwan as activists gain stronger programming abilities. He and his team, who normally work on an app that is a guide to Taiwan\u2019s bars,\n                                        were able to create the protest app in just two weeks, mostly by reusing code they had already developed.\nThe most labor-intensive part, according to Mr. Lin, was researching the products linked to Ting Hsin and photographing them to assemble a graphical database of items that should be flagged. Friends pitched in to provide\n                                        other photos and research.\nWith the app now doing well, a new question facing Mr. Lin is whether to fund it.\n\u201cThe second day after it happened, I was contacted by an advertising agent, and they argued that we\u2019ll need advertising if we want long-term development. But for me personally, I don\u2019t want to see\n                                        ads when using this app,\u201d he said.\nOffers for sponsorships have also come in, but Mr. Lin said those, too, were problematic, because large sums from different organizations or companies could ultimately compromise the fairness of the app down the line.\nMr. Lin is still trying to figure out what to do with Bingdela. Some have suggested that his team should add other brands that have had past issues, but he said that for now he was still trying to figure out how to\n                                        round up funding.\n\u201cWe have received a lot of encouragement, some of which actually were quite touching. It gave me the motivation to do more. My wife said, \u2018That\u2019s not your expertise.\u2019 I think Taiwan needs\n                                        such a platform to do this, whether it be the government or a nongovernment entity. We need this to fundamentally fix some damages caused by economic development,\u201d he said.\nA version of this article appears in print on 12/14/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Scandal in Taiwan Drives Downloads of Protest App."

        "title": "Why Do I Have to Call This App \u2018Julie\u2019?",
        "fulltext": "RECENTLY, I signed up for a \u201cvirtual inbox assistant\u201d service. I gave the assistant, Julie, access to my email and calendar over the Internet.\nHere\u2019s what Julie said on the first day of work:\n\u201cI am now at your disposal to process any calendar-related task you may delegate to me \u2026 I am thrilled we can start working together. I cannot wait to respond to your first request!\u201d\nIf the words in that message sound too perky and supplicating to be believed, well, you are right. Julie isn\u2019t a real person. Julie is an app. Not human. Software. It is artificial intelligence that a start-up has dressed up with a woman\u2019s name and feminine pronouns.\nJulie isn\u2019t the only imaginary woman in my digital life. Driving in an unfamiliar city, I will put my iPhone in the cup holder and listen to Siri\u2019s calm voice guiding me through new streets. If I had a Windows phone, I would get turn-by-turn directions from its Cortana app, with a voice that is similarly pleasant and feminine.\nInstead of Julie, I might have triedClara, another virtual inbox assistant. The company describes it as \u201chighly responsive, empathetic, and learning more every day.\u201d There\u2019s alsoAmyfrom the start-up X.ai, who will \u201cdo all the tedious email ping pong that comes along with scheduling a meeting.\u201d Other voice, text and inbox apps have names likeCrystal,JeannieandCloe.\nDag Kittlaus, who helped create Siri,has saidthe app gets its name, in part, from a woman he knew in Norway. Cortanawas namedafter a feminine artificial intelligence agent in the video game franchise Halo, and Microsoft even hired the same voice actress for its service. Founders of two virtual assistant apps said they were inspired by helpmates on TV:Dawngets its name from Don Draper\u2019s assistant on \u201cMad Men,\u201d andDonnaafter an assistant on \u201cThe West Wing.\u201d It seems like developers decided on Julie, Amy and Clara only because these are common women\u2019s names. These products, representing new technological possibilities, play into old stereotypes about what gender is best suited for administrative work.\nWhile Apple introduced a male voice option a year after Siri\u2019s launch, I don\u2019t know anyone who uses it. The two assistant apps with masculine pronouns I have come across,JarvisandJeeves, share their names with butlers in Marvel comics and P. G. Wodehouse novels. The year after Amy debuted, X.ai announced its \u201ctwin,\u201dAndrew. Still, the masculine named option is scarcely mentioned on the company\u2019s website.\nAnd why does artificial intelligence need a gender at all? Why not imagine a talking cat or a wise owl as a virtual assistant? I would trust an anthropomorphized cartoon animal with my calendar. Better yet, I would love to delegate tasks to a non-binary gendered robot alien from a galaxy where setting up meetings over email is respected as a high art.\nBut Julie could be the name of a friend of mine. To use it at all requires an element of playacting. And if I treat it with kindness, the company is capitalizing on my very human emotions.\nThere appears to be just one woman among the 12 combined co-founders of Siri, Julie Desk, X.ai and Clara Labs. That\u2019s slightly worse than thenearly 17.9percent of venture-funded companies founded by women, according to data from last year on CrunchBase. Women may be the imagined persona or voice of a product, but rarely are they the people making executive decisions.\nTechnologies speak with recorded feminine voices because women \u201cweren\u2019t normally there to be heard,\u201dHelen Hester, a media studies lecturer at the University of West London, told me. A woman\u2019s voice stood out. For example, an automated recording of a woman\u2019s voice used in cockpit navigation becomes a beacon, a voice in stark contrast with that of everyone else, when all the pilots on board are men.\nMs. Hester lives in London, where the spectral sound of robotic women is piping from nearly every corner. Enter the Underground and you hear a disembodied woman announcing \u201cthe next station is Mornington Crescent\u201d and the train\u2019s signature canned message, \u201cplease mind the gap between the train and the platform.\u201d\nA similar voice \u2014 emotionless, timeless, with an accent difficult to place \u2014 emits from clocks and traffic lights, and inside elevators and supermarkets. The \u201ccoldness, the forthrightness of the voice\u201d is what Ms. Hester finds striking. What human speaks with such emotionless authority? And, as Ms. Hester points out: \u201cIt\u2019s not real authority. There\u2019s a maternal edge to all of it. It is personal guidance rather than definite directions.\u201d\nAnd, she says, these voices can even play into people\u2019s expectations of male authority because they aren\u2019t actual women. People hear a woman\u2019s voice, realize it is robotic, and \u201cimagine a male programmer\u201d did the actual work.\nNo one seems to market tech products in the image of the most famous virtual assistant in film history. Hal from \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was so brilliant and manly that it attempted to kill off the crew of the spacecraft it was built to manage. Instead, people build what I call \u201cStepford apps.\u201d These are the Internet\u2019s answer to those old sci-fi robots in dresses mopping floors with manufactured enthusiasm.\nThe Amazon Echo voice-activated home-automation system is another Stepford-style device, with a woman\u2019s voice and name, Alexa. Of course consumer reviews on the website either praise or complain about \u201cher\u201d with the feminine pronoun. A friend of mine who owns the device told me, \u201cSometimes I wish she\u2019d just shut up.\u201d If my friend says \u201cweather\u201d in the middle of a conversation, the device might interject \u2014 \u201cRight now in New York it is 45 degrees \u2026\u201d\nAlexa sounds like a nag. Now I\u2019m using sexist language to dismiss a gadget. Imagine if the plug-in devices that made housework more efficient were, like Alexa, sold with women\u2019s names and talked about with female pronouns. \u201cCould you hand me the Amanda? She\u2019s in the hall closet.\u201d \u201cPlease clean the Sarah when you\u2019re finished with the onions.\u201d \u201cThe Emily is broken.\u201d That could easily lead to characterizing an overflowing dishwasher as a \u201cbubbly,\u201d garrulous woman, or a microwave slowing down because of \u201cher\u201d age.\nI used Julie only once, sending an email to a friend, copying the app email, with a time and date to meet for coffee. Julie emailed back promptly confirming the appointment, and it added the meeting to my calendar. The product is an interesting idea and easy to use, but interacting with a fake woman assistant just feels too weird. So I shut \u201cher\u201d off. This Stepford app, designed to make my work more efficient, only reminds me of the gendered division of labor that I\u2019m trying to escape."

        "title": "Samsung to Pay Apple $548 Million in Patent Dispute",
        "fulltext": "Samsung agreed to pay Apple $548 million to settle a smartphone patent dispute, but the payment won\u2019t put an end to the long-running legal battles between the two companies.\nIn a joint statement filed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Thursday, the two companies said that Samsung had agreed to make the payment in accordance with a partial judgment\n                                        in Apple\u2019s favor handed down in September.\nBut Samsung also said in the statement that it wants to be able to get all or some of that money back if \u201cthe partial judgment is reversed, modified, vacated or set aside on appeal.\u201d Samsung also raised\n                                        the possibility that it might take the case to the Supreme Court, writing that it would ask for reimbursement if the partial judgment changed as a result of any petition filed with the Supreme Court.\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the court has agreed to proceed with Apple\u2019s grossly exaggerated damages claims regardless of whether the patents are valid,\u201d Samsung said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhile\n                                        we\u2019ve agreed to pay Apple, we remain confident that our products do not infringe on Apple\u2019s design patents, and we will continue to take all appropriate measures within the legal system to protect\n                                        our products and our intellectual property.\u201d\nIn a filing to the court, Apple disputed Samsung\u2019s assertion that it had any right to be reimbursed. Apple reiterated in a statement that the ruling \u201creinforces what courts around the world have already\n                                        found: that Samsung willfully stole our ideas and copied our products.\u201d The company also thanked the court for \u201csending a loud and clear message that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nThe payment stems from one of two outstanding lawsuits between Apple and Samsung, which are fierce rivals in the smartphone market. This case began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for $2.5 billion in damages for infringing\n                                        on some technology and packaging patents for devices.\nApple won in 2012, but was awarded only about $1 billion. After years of appeals, some parts of the case have been dismissed by the court. Samsung is now paying $548 million to settle the technology patent allegations."

        "title": "Apple Makes Shifts in Senior Management",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, is continuing to make over the company\u2019s executive ranks.\nOn Thursday, Apple made several shifts in its senior management team, including the promotion of a longtime executive, Jeff Williams, to the job of chief operating officer, a position that had gone unfilled since 2011.\nApple also expanded the role of Philip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, to include oversight of the App Store. The store had been overseen by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Internet software and services.\n\u201cWe\u2019re recognizing the contributions already being made by two key executives,\u201d Mr. Cooksaid in a statement.\nThe changes, which include new leadership in the company\u2019s hardware and marketing divisions, are the latest executive moves by Mr. Cook, who became chief of Apple in 2011. Early in his tenure, Mr. Cook shook up the management team that had been put in place by his predecessor, Steven P. Jobs, bypushing out Scott Forstall, the mobile software head.\nLast year, Mr. Cook hired a new retail chief,Angela Ahrendts, the former head of the British luxury fashion company Burberry, to revitalize Apple\u2019s retail stores.He also promoted Luca Maestri, who joined Apple in 2013 as vice president of finance and corporate controller, to chief financial officer, after the retirement of Peter Oppenheimer, then C.F.O.\nThe changes announced on Thursday reflect what Mr. Williams and Mr. Schiller had already been doing and are not seen as large shifts in strategy.\nThe chief operating officer position at Apple was once held by Mr. Cook, who ran operations at the Cupertino, Calif.-based company for many years under Mr. Jobs. Mr. Cook was elevated to chief executive shortly before Mr. Jobs died from pancreatic cancer.\nMr. Williams, 52, joined Apple in 1998 as head of worldwide procurement and became vice president of operations in 2004. Six years later, he was put in charge of Apple\u2019s supply chain, a large global operation that secures components and parts for products such as the iPhone and iPad. Apple\u2019s supply chain is one of the company\u2019s great strengths. Its army of contract workers can be mobilized quickly to produce huge volumes of the company\u2019s best-selling products.\nThe supply chain has also been scrutinized for worker rights violations. Apple has pressured suppliers to change their practices, and Mr. Williams has overseen Apple\u2019s social responsibility initiatives to protect more than one million employees worldwide.\n\u201cJeff is hands-down the best operations executive I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the statement. Mr. Williams is also supervising the development of the Apple Watch, which Apple started selling in April.\nMr. Schiller has already been one of Apple\u2019s main liaisons with the app developer community. Mr. Cue, who oversees software and services, helped create the App Store in 2008 and has added responsibilities over time, including the addition of Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s new streaming music service and efforts to start a television service.\nThe moves give executives the freedom to pursue other important tasks that they face in their roles, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt seems like Eddy Cue could have a pretty full plate with trying to negotiate TV rights at the moment, for example,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.\nApple also said that Johny Srouji, who led the development of Apple\u2019s A4 chip, had joined the executive team as senior vice president for hardware technologies.\nTor Myhren will join as vice president of marketing communications early next year, reporting to Mr. Cook. Mr. Myhren, who will oversee Apple\u2019s advertising efforts, was previously chief creative officer and president of Grey New York, a part of the Grey Group."
