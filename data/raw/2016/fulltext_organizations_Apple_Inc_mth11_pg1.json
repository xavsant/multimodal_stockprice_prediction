        "fulltext": "President-elect Donald J. Trump said during the campaign that he would push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Henamed one tech company in particular\u2014 Apple \u2014 which is the world\u2019s largest public company and makes many of its gadgets overseas.\nApple does make one product domestically: The Mac Pro desktop computer is assembled in Austin, Tex., through the contract manufacturer Flex. So Vindu Goel, a New York Times tech reporter, recently visited Austin to see what having tech manufacturing domestically has wrought for Apple and the area.\nWhat he found wasa more nuanced pictureshowing that manufacturing is far from the only way for a tech company to provide good jobs and career paths for Americans.\nIt turns out Apple has a campus in Austin where the number of jobs has grown rapidly, reaching about 6,000 jobs now, up from around 2,100 seven years ago. The roles that Apple has created there are varied, including fielding tech-support calls, overseeing logistics with suppliers and updating Apple\u2019s Maps software. The average salary of Apple\u2019s Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.\nThe manufacturing jobs at Flex\u2019s Austin location, located about a mile from the Apple campus, are also important, of course. Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Mac Pro desktop. But clearly, they are not the only kinds of jobs a tech company can now create."

        "fulltext": "Q.MacBooks and iMacs have built-in microphones, but how do you use Siri on a Mac Mini?\nA.Siri, the virtual assistant thatarrived on the iPhone 4s in 2011and nowcomes with the new macOS Sierraoperating system, must hear your commands to work.Apple suggeststhat for microphoneless Mac models (like the boxyMac Miniand the cylindricalMac Pro), you should connect an external microphone to the jack on the back.\nYou can usethe earbuds-and-microphone headsetthat Apple ships with its iPhones, orbuy a set separately for $29. Webcams and USB-based microphones can also work to communicate with Siri. If you plug in the microphone and get no response when you test it, click the System Preferences icon in the desktop dock and select the Sound icon. In the Sound preferences box, click the Input tab and select the name of your microphone.\nOnce you get the microphone working, you can summon Siri by either clicking the round Siri icon in the desktop dock (or in the Mac\u2019s menu bar). When Siri responds, ask your question or say your command.\nYou can also hold down the Command key and Space bar on the keyboard to make Siri ask how to help you. Clicking the microphone icon in a search result area brings up Siri for more questions.\nAs with Siri on iOS devices, you can ask the software to find specific files on your drive, play songs in your music library, start FaceTime calls with people, announce the current weather conditions, search the web and update your calendar \u2014 among other things. Several sites around the web, includingOS X DailyandHey-Siri.io, have lists of Siri commands that work on the Mac.\nYou can also just pose the question to the program itself. Simply summon Siri and ask, \u201cWhat can you do for me?\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WITH Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Google\u2019snew Pixel phonesputting such an emphasis onpowerful camera technology, smartphone photography is more robust than ever. And while phones typically have great built-in photography apps, many other options can be easier or expand your range.\nProCamerais an excellent option for iOS devices. Using this app feels like raising a single-lens reflex camera to your eye: The first thing you see is a view through the camera lens, superimposed with many controls and information like the exposure and whether the flash is activated.\nWith a few taps on the screen, you can display a grid to help compose a shot properly and a guide to warn if your composition is tilted (great for getting those tricky horizons straight). You can also control the white balance and the ISO setting and bring up a live histogram that shows how saturated the colors in the final photo will be. There are quick-access buttons to shoot in video, photo, high dynamic range or other modes and there\u2019s even a bar code scanner option.\nMost impressive is ProCamera\u2019s anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter. In the settings menu, you can control most of the app\u2019s features and select how much compression is applied to the final saved images. In other words, the app gives users professional-level control of an image.\nBecause of its complexity, ProCamera takes awhile to get used to, and the exact features depend on which iPhone you have.The app costs $5and some features, like a low-light mode to help shoot better pictures at night, are upgrades that cost a few dollars each. It\u2019s definitely worth it.\nOn Android, one equivalent to ProCamera isCamera FV-5. This app also feels like using a single-lens reflex camera, with similar manual control. Camera FV-5 includes features like a live histogram, burst-mode shooting, exposure bracketing and time-lapse imagery. It also offers choices over the kind of files it saves to your device, and has a comprehensive settings page.\nUnlike some other Android camera apps, Camera FV-5 has a professional-looking and easy-to-use interface.It costs $4.\nTo edit that perfect portrait or landscape photo, Adobe\u2019s software is the choice of professional photographers. There is a version for mobile devices too \u2014Adobe Photoshop Fix\u2014 which lets you heal an image\u2019s blemishes, adjust shadow intensity, fix the contrast or add effects like vignetting. There is also a powerful liquefy tool that can distort the image in a smooth way to pull off some shape-modifying effects.\nMastering the features of Photoshop Fix so your final images don\u2019t look too artificial will take time. Its interface is sometimes confusing, and I have found myself getting lost in its menus and submenus, but the app has built-in help and, best of all, is free for bothiOSandAndroid.\nFor those who find Photoshop too complex,Darkroom Photo Editoris a slightly simpleralternative for iOS. This free app offers speedy edits before sharing that selfie on social media (note that more advanced editing features like color curve correction cost $2 and up each).\nOnAndroid, the freeFotor Photo Editorapp is roughly equivalent to Darkroom in terms of image-editing features, and it comes with an elegant, minimal interface. It is alsoavailable for iOS devices.\nPolaroid, once a huge name in instant photography, is also on the try-it list. The company is now trying to teach the smartphone generation how to take photos with its Polaroid University app. This app starts with photography basics like how to compose a good shot. It also has videos on how to achieve more complicated goals, like slow-motion video or low-light photography. The videos are professional, friendly and interesting.\nWhile the app is free, a year\u2019s subscription to the full video content costs $20. The app isiOS-onlyfor now, though an Android edition is in the works.\nGoogle has a new solution for those physical photos that you have tucked away in a drawer or jammed in a forgotten album:PhotoScan. This app helps you \u201cscan\u201d a paper photo and then uses automatic techniques to find the edges and straighten the shot. It could be a great way to breathe new digital life into your family photo collection. PhotoScan isfree on iOSandAndroid."

        "fulltext": "After a bruising presidential campaign, more than a few of us might be looking forward to a festive holiday season. But the holidays are bringing their own problems, including a proliferation of fake retail apps that may be trying to trick you.\nThe counterfeit apps have popped up in abundance in Apple\u2019s App Store in recent weeks,writes Vindu Goel. They are often disguised as the bona fide apps of luxury-goods makers like Christian Dior or discount stores like Dollar Tree.\nConsumers may be deceived into entering their credit card numbers or Facebook login information into these apps, which would expose them to financial or information security risks. Some of the fake apps may even contain malware that could steal people\u2019s information.\nFor Apple, the question is how so many of these apps, which appear to have originated in China, slipped past the company\u2019s vetting process. The problem is not new \u2014 counterfeit apps have been around for a while \u2014 but their recent surge shows how intractable the issue can be. Apple has removed many of the fake retail apps after inquiries from reporters."
