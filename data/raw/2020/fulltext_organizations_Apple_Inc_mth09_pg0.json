        "title": "America\u2019s Tech Billionaires Could Help Protect the Election. If They Wanted To.",
        "fulltext": "Irecently wrotethat Mark Zuckerberg is the most powerful unelected man in America. His and Facebook\u2019s efforts to try to combat election-related disinformation on its platform, however comforting, were merely \u201can admission of a great power that should make Americans uncomfortable,\u201d I said.\nSome readers argued I had it wrong. First, criticizing the helpful efforts of Silicon Valley is counterproductive at a time when we need all hands on deck, they wrote. Second, I was too narrowly focused on one man. Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook are far from the only powerful entities who could, with a few executive decisions, meaningfully affect the 2020 election. In other words, what is notable is how much power and influence America\u2019s plutocrats have and how little they seem to be using it.\nSo what could the tech giants and big business do to help secure a free and fair election, if they wanted to?\nSome ideas are simple: Turn Election Day into a company holiday. Facebookrecently tooka version of this step, giving paid time off to its tens of thousands of U.S. employees to vote and to volunteer as poll workers. It\u2019s a meaningful step and one that all large companies should adopt. Apple, which has over 90,000 U.S. employees,did something similarbut only offered employees four hours of paid time off. With more than 500,000 full- and part-time U.S. employees, Amazon, especially, could take its cue from Best Buy androughly 1,000 other companiesthat have pledged to give some time off to those who volunteer to work at the polls.\nThe companies ought to go much further, making the day a company holiday. As Marketplacereported in 2018, the day is already a huge productivity drain for Americans. Plenty of workers sneak away from the office to vote anyhow. And the anxieties and excitements of the day are a distraction. One estimate in 2018 from Challenger, Gray & Christmas suggested that the election could cost the U.S. economy up to $3.5 billion per hour. It\u2019s a good argument to cut the losses altogether and give people the space to exercise a fundamental right of citizenship.\nUber and Lyft will offer discounts to those riding to the polls, but they could do more to prioritize subsidized or free, safe rides to polling places. They could incentivize their contract workers to pick up individuals in remote areas by subsidizing them for the trip out. Another possibility is to pair drivers with riders who have the same polling place, and once they arrive, the companies could pay for the drivers\u2019 time as they wait to vote.\nThose are the straightforward solutions. But if we\u2019re daydreaming, the options are endless. Companies could pledge to pay for adequate personal protective equipment at all polling stations for anyone who needs it. Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and other browser builders could make useful voting information and validated updates from secretary of state websites the default home page in their browsers. Facebook\u2019s election dashboard could replace users\u2019 home screen, forcing users to click away from it to engage with standard news feeds or groups and pages. As returns come in on election night, that crucial internet real estate could be prominently displayed all night with only validated election results, offering a sober look at \u201cWhat we know\u201d before users have a chance to enter the chaotic frenzy of their algorithmic feeds.\n\u201cAnyone who influences your physical or mental space, anyone who has the ability to place news or content in those spaces \u2014 or take it out \u2014 that\u2019s real power,\u201d Aviv Ovadya, the founder of theThoughtful Technology Project, told me. \u201cJeff Bezos has great influence over our physical space, while Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and others take up the physical space on our screens.\u201d\nMr. Ovadya was one of the people who suggested thinking bigger about tech\u2019s influence. He\u2019s athoughtful critic of Big Techwho also wants to incentivize the industry to make systemic changes. \u201cJeff Bezos could probably decide and then use his company\u2019s infrastructure to help ensure that mail-in ballots are reliably delivered,\u201d he said, though he admitted it would be logistically tricky and, arguably, far too late for such an endeavor. \u201cTim Cookand Apple could shove \u2018I registered to vote, on this site\u2019 as a suggested message into iMessage, encouraging people to share it in natural conversations with those you\u2019re texting.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t want to limit participation to tech giants. He mused that most S & P 500 companies could use their power to try to bake some stability into our currently unstable politics. \u201cBeyond voting,\u201d Mr. Ovadya said, \u201cyou could imagine the companies coming together with a pledge that others could sign that said something to the effect of \u2018I agree upfront to abide by the results of the election as certified by the Electoral College and Supreme Court\u2019\u201d (a scenario that has grown even more complicated in recent days).\nMr. Ovadya\u2019s argument is compelling. With tensions and anxiety about potential claims of voter fraud and postelection unrest mounting, surely it makes sense to do anything possible to ensure a fair, free, transparent and universally accepted election. Mr. Ovadya notes that encouraging corporate involvement also has the added benefit of not alienating the nation\u2019s most powerful unelected individuals.\nThe skeptic in me still bristles. I want a smooth and fair election as much as the next person, and yet any entreaty feels a bit to me like begging the person who pushed you into the deep end of the pool to save you from drowning.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the billionaire class and the tech robber barons to ask the question \u2018What can I do for the country?\u2019\u201d Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d told me recently. \u201cThey need to ask, \u2018What have I been doing to the country and what could I stop doing?\u2019\u201d He argued that our understandable desire to have benevolent billionaires and corporations step in to help during periods of instability is part of an abusive relationship between the plutocrats and the rest of us, and that their perceived heroics would only be exploiting a moment of weakness to further entrench their power.\nBut in moments of desperation it may be hard for anxious Americans to hear that argument. I asked Mr. Giridharadas what he\u2019d say to those willing to hold their nose and make the trade-off. \u201cYou are being sold a fraudulent promise that the people who caused this mess can lead us out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the people most responsible for an age of inequality and collapsing social mobility are our salvation. That the arsonists of opportunity in America can come back as firefighters.\u201d\nThis is a debate about how to harness power at a critical time. About whether Americans should use the moment to pressure power to exert itself for a favorable outcome for democracy or whether its more important to use the moment to dismantle and decenter power (or whether that\u2019s a false choice altogether). And then there\u2019s the powerful themselves. It\u2019s notable that given all the possible ways America\u2019s elites could help secure a free and fair election, few have stepped up in a truly meaningful way.\nIt takes courage to accept help in a desperate moment. Just as it takes courage to turn away from tainted charity in a time of need. And for those who have power, it takes courage to expose it and exercise it for the greater good, rather than hide and conserve it for one\u2019s own benefit.\nTo get through the next few months, we\u2019ll need a lot of courage from everyone.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Europe Feels Squeeze as Tech Competition Heats Up Between U.S. and China",
        "fulltext": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Lacking a powerful technology sector of its own, the European Union has instead tried to carve out a space in the digital economy as the world\u2019s regulatory superpower, leading the charge on privacy rights and data protection by leveraging its enormous single market against Goliaths like Google and Facebook.\nBut a number of recent examples have made it clear that for Europe, increasingly, that is not enough. The rapid pace of technological change \u2014 including artificial intelligence and facial recognition \u2014 is mingling ever more with national security concerns that European leaders have been slow to grasp and respond to, analysts say.\nAs global technology shapes up into a battleground betweenChina and the United States, Europe is finding it harder to set the rules of the road while others in Beijing and Washington are in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u201cEurope needs to get its act together,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, international policy director at theCyber Policy Centerof Stanford University and a former member of the European Parliament. \u201cI worry the tempo is too slow for the pace at which changes are forthcoming.\u201d\nThe most recent example is TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese short video app, which the Trump administration has challenged by using many of the same national security arguments it employed against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and its bid to become the globe\u2019s dominant 5G provider.\nTime and again, such disputes have left European leaders, regulators and industries squeezed between Beijing and Washington, risking retaliation against carmakers, financial services firms or agriculture companies if they choose one side over the other.\nIn response, European leaders have belatedly embarked on a generational project toward \u201cdigital sovereignty,\u201d mixing tougher rules against foreign tech companies with efforts to boost local innovation.\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission vice president in charge of digital issues, has called it a \u201cnew phase\u201d fortechnology policyin the region.\nBut those policies will take years to shift the balance meaningfully in Europe\u2019s favor, analysts say, and many question whether they are really enough to close the technology gap with the United States and China.\nOne reason Brussels risks falling behind is that security remains the responsibility of individual member nations, not one ceded to the European Union, Ms. Schaake said.\n\u201cTikTok confronts Europe with the weaknesses of its digital and national security policies,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope is na\u00efve about certain of the technologies coming from China and the United States, and just says that anyone doing business in Europe has to respect our rights and regulations.\u201d\nAfter months of debate, some European leaders are coming around to views closer to those held in Washington, where President Trump has moved totry to force the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operationsto an American company, charging that the company\u2019s Chinese ties present a national security threat.\nIt has used the same argument againstHuawei, the telecommunications giant, though both companies deny any explicit link to the Chinese government.\nIn Europe, the American point of view on Huawei, backed by the threat of secondary sanctions, has gained ground, most recently in Britain, wherea ban was adopted in July.\nBut most Europeans mostly still see TikTok not as a security threat, but as a risk to privacy. Even if the White House-orchestrated TikTok sale goes through, the European operations will remain under the ownership of the Chinese parent company, ByteDance.\nTikTok uses both facial recognition and artificial intelligence, important technologies that are not regulated by the United States or the European Union. \u201cWith the combination of competition, artificial intelligence and security, it makes sense why some policymakers are concerned,\u201d said Andreas Aktoudianakis, a digital policy analyst with the European Policy Center, a research institution in Brussels.\n\u201cEurope wants to regulate artificial intelligence and other technologies, but it\u2019s slow and there\u2019s no real timeline,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re late to catch the train.\u201d\nGerard de Graaf,director for the digital single marketfor the European Commission, said that the European Union needed \u201ca lot more cooperation among member states on the issue of security.\u201d\nEurope has no major social media platforms, he conceded in a seminar at Bruegel, a Brussels research institution, but is doing well in financial technology, robotics and 5G. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the E.U. is way behind everyone else,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have challenges.\u201d\nBut Francesca Bria, chair of theItalian National Innovation Fund, argued that Europe risked being squashed between the Chinese state model \u2014 which is represented by Huawei, WeChat, Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok, with their state subsidies \u2014 and the \u201cbig company, big tech surveillance\u201d of the American giants.\n\u201cIf we fail to regain digital sovereignty,\u201d she said, \u201cwe risk becoming a colony caught between the U.S. and China,\u201d with risks to democracy.\nAmerican tech shares alone aremore valuablethan the whole European stock market, Ms. Bria said. \u201cEurope needs to remain relevant as a global economic power, not just a regulatory power,\u201d she said.\nThe weaknesses are stark. The world\u2019s most popular smartphones are made in China, South Korea and the United States. The biggest social media and online shopping platforms come from American and Chinese companies, as do the largest providers of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.\nEurope has been missing from the list of the world\u2019s most influential technology companies sincethe fall of Nokiaabout a decade ago. For reasons including lack of venture capital, language barriers and a cultural aversion to risk, European companies have struggled to match the entrepreneurial pace in a technology industry now dominated by mobile devices, internet services and online communication tools.\nEurope has attempted to influence the digital economy through regulation,adopting tough data protection rulesand aggressively enforcing antitrust laws.\nBut European leaders are realizing the limits of those efforts, particularly as its citizens depend on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in the absence of European alternatives. The biggest European technology company is Germany\u2019s SAP, a business software provider that competes with American companies like Microsoft and Oracle.\nAlong with privacy and security issues, TikTok also raises questions about disinformation and about censorship exercised by the company on issues of sensitivity to China. The European Data Protection Board said in June that it wouldset up a task forceto assess TikTok\u2019s activities across the bloc.\nBut it is not clear what European agency would take the lead, especially since TikTok in July shifted data protection functions to Dublin. That might give the Irish Data Protection Commission oversight of the company when it comes to privacy issues. But the agency has faced criticism in the past for not being more aggressive.\nNoah Barkin, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said Europe\u2019s lack of influence ultimately stemmed from its dearth of influential tech businesses. Europe will face these difficulties for years as China and the United States battle for tech supremacy.\n\u201cEurope hasn\u2019t developed its own global digital companies to compete with the big U.S. and Chinese firms, and ultimately that\u2019s what digital sovereignty is all about,\u201d Mr. Barkin said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be a regulator.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s plans for \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d are still vague, said Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.\n\u201cThis is a talking point, but it is a long way before Europe can develop its own digital champions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be too late.\u201d\nFabrice Pothier, chief strategy officer at the Rasmussen Global consulting firm in Brussels, said American pressure was forcing Europe to recalibrate its relationship with China, particularly on technology matters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call to Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a benign technology and network operator from China.\u201d\nOn this matter, the Trump administration is \u201cnot necessarily wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is generally behind the curve.\u201d\nSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Adam Satariano from London.

        "title": "Apple Watch Is a Private Road",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIf you\u2019re reading this right now on your iPhone or on a Windows laptop, that\u2019s good for Apple and Microsoft.\nIt\u2019s also good for Amazon, Zoom, Candy Crush and this newsletter, which can reach you because smartphones, tablets and personal computers created by others gave them a route to billions.\nThink about the last quarter-century of computers and the internet like a highway. The companies that made gadgets and software systems controlled the roads, and cars made by other companies drove (with some restrictions) on those roads. Computer devices would be meh if we couldn\u2019t have access to a diversity of apps, websites and software \u2014 and vice versa.\nBut newer technologies for interacting online \u2014 smart watches like the Apple Watch, voice activated speakers, internet-connected televisions and robot-piloted cars \u2014 mostly pull us into digital features the device maker creates or tightly controls. They are more like private roads than the open highways of the smartphone and PC eras.\nThese developing technologies could change, and I hope they do. I worry that we\u2019ll miss the next Amazon or Zoom if the future is private roads without a diversity of cars.\nApple plans toshow off on Tuesday the latest versions of its Apple Watch. Since it was first sold more than five years ago, the device remains mostly a place for people to live in Apple\u2019s world.\nYes, people do track calories with the MyFitnessPal app and look at the Weather Channel on their Apple Watches. But the watch is mostly a way for people to glance at their iPhone messages, use Apple\u2019s activity tracking feature and listen to Apple Music. Other cars are allowed, but in practice it\u2019s a road mostly of Apple vehicles.\nDitto for Amazon\u2019s Echo. If you ask it to play Anita Baker songs or tell a joke, Amazon pulls from its own computer systems for the music or response unless you specify otherwise. Again, people do ask to listen to NPR and order a Domino\u2019s pizza on their Echo speakers. Butmost people use their Echo devices for functions that Amazon built.\nClosed or tightly controlled internet access points are becoming the norm rather than the exception. If you have a Roku or Vizio TV set, you can\u2019t watch theHBO Maxvideo app orApple\u2019s TV appunless there\u2019s a business contract with the TV maker. (That\u2019s not how computers and smartphones work.)\nIf internet-connected eyewear and autonomous cars get more prevalent, they\u2019re also shaping up to be less open and more of a creation in which one company controls the physical equipment and what we do with it.\nThis might make sense for complicated tech like cars. And private roads could be a temporary condition. The iPhone started out closed to non-Apple apps before the company changed its mind. I also don\u2019t want to overstate how open our smartphone and computer highways are. Apple still approves or denies every iPhone app, for example.\nStill, I think even the iPhone is more open to other software than TVs and the Apple Watch. The proof is in how people use them. Certainly by 2013 \u2014 five years after Apple opened the iPhone app store \u2014 apps from companies other than Apple were already a big thing. Not so five years into the Apple Watch.\nIt\u2019s hard to predict how this will all shake out. But I worry that there would be no future Instacart or Netflix if we lost the relatively open highway system that has defined our digital lives for decades or if the companies that make our internet gateways confined them mostly to themselves.\nI have wrestled, as many people have, with whether Facebook makes people and the world worse. This may have been my breaking point.\nA relatively junior data scientist who was fired from Facebook wrote a memodetailinghow politicians, political parties and others in various countries including Honduras, Bolivia, Ukraine, Brazil and Azerbaijan used automated accounts and other means to mislead people or harass their opponents.\nIt\u2019s not news that Facebook isused to mislead or bully. But even I was surprised by the scale of the manipulation campaigns that the former employee, Sophie Zhang, described \u2014 both the number of countries involved and the amount of manipulation taking place.\nBuzzFeed Newsand my colleague Sheera Frenkelwroteabout her memo.\nThis is the view of one person. It\u2019s also hard to know what impact these misinformation campaigns and abuses had in these countries. Ethnic violence and manipulative politicians were problems long before social media existed. Facebook told Sheera that it removed coordinated influence campaigns, and that it had a large team working on security.\nBut Zhang\u2019s memo resonated with me because you can feel her torment at how little she was able to do, and how she felt unsupported by her bosses. It made me wonder: Should Facebook be essential communications in much of the world?\nZhang wrote that she believed the Facebook bosses meant well but couldn\u2019t deal with all but the highest profile misuses of the site outside the United States and Western Europe.\nShe also echoed what we already knew. It\u2019s relatively easy to sow chaos on Facebook, but harder to rein it in, with sometimesdeadly effects.\nNow what? Is such a toxic stew of misleading information an inevitability? Is any gathering spot of billions of people too sprawling and dangerous to exist \u2014 is Facebook \u201ctoo big to govern responsibly\u201d as my Opinion colleague Charlie Warzelwrote? I don\u2019t know. I need to sit with this one for a while.\nThey use technology to make technology better and less exclusionary:Young people who work in technology are teaming up to counterbalance what can be an insular industry, and combat abuses of technology products, my colleague Taylor Lorenzwrote.\nOne teenager built a tool to protect people from harassment on Twitter. A group built an online bulletin board aimed at spreading positivity. The goal of this loose collective, one person told Taylor, is to \u201cbuild a more positive internet, things that help people.\u201d\nThis was all rather pointless:The latest on the tug-of-war over the Chinese video app TikTok from my colleagues: People involved in the companydecided on a compromise that didn\u2019t involve ownership moving to the United Statesor a change to TikTok\u2019s contentious software, as the White House previously insisted on. In short, not much happened after months of drama and wasted time and money.

        "title": "Stocks Slide Again as a Promising Week Turns South",
        "fulltext": "The searing monthslong rally in the stock market has been a clear sign that investors expected the country\u2019s giant tech firms to help lead the pandemic-hit economy out of the doldrums.\nNow investors appear to be having second thoughts.\nAfter a big drop on Thursday, stocks fell Friday, leaving the S&P 500 stock index down 4.3 percent since Wednesday, when it hit the latest in a series of highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has fallen 6.17 percent since its peak on Wednesday \u2014 its worst two-day performance since March.\nOver the two days, Apple was down nearly 10 percent \u2014 and that\u2019s after it was up slightly on Friday. The two-day tumble also hit Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet (down 7.9 percent), Microsoft (7.5 percent) and Amazon (6.7 percent).\nIt could have been worse: The S&P 500 was down as much as 3 percent on Friday morning, but rallied in the afternoon and finished down just 0.8 percent.\nMarket watchers had been anticipating some kind of sell-off, given that the S&P 500 has soared over 50 percent from its low in March. \u201cYou knew you had one of these coming at some point, perhaps more than one,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. \u201cThe moves upward, especially in the last few days, were something.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 is up 6 percent for the year and 60 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president in 2016. But the wild ride at the end of week is prompting questions about some of the underpinnings of the rally.\nOne of the drivers has been confidence that the economy, injected with government stimulus, could steadily recover as coronavirus outbreaks waned. But employment data released Friday showed that the pace of rehiring has slowed, and the economy may find it harder to heal if a standoff over further stimulus persists in Washington.\nSome analysts say rampant speculation in a handful of large tech stocks had pushed the market so high that it became divorced from the still-grim economic reality on the ground.\n\u201cIn the past five months, there\u2019s been no correlation between the stock market and the economy,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research & Associates.\nThe form that speculation has taken may have added to the fragility in the market.\nIn recent months, investors have bought large amounts of a financial instrument that enables them to bet on stock prices without investing as much money as when buying actual stocks. Analysts say the greater use of these instruments, known as options, helped push tech stocks to new heights.\nThe Financial Timesreported on Friday that SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate that has a history of making large, risky investments, had been a big buyer of options linked to the rising tech stocks. SoftBank declined to comment to The New York Times.\nIn fact, many investors have been buying up these options in recent months, said Matthew J. Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. That causes the financial firms which arrange the options trades to buy the underlying shares to hedge their risks.\nAs a result tech stocks kept moving higher, convincing investors that they were a sure bet. \u201cPeople got too confident,\u201d Mr. Maley said. \u201cIt was a kind of can\u2019t-lose situation.\u201d\nThe question now is whether falling prices could prompt options investors to liquidate their bets, setting off more selling. Since the stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook have accounted for a large share of the stock market\u2019s gains this year, a rout in their shares could pull down the market over all.\nStocks can be more at risk of a plunge if investors perceive them to be overvalued. On a valuation yardstick known as the price-to-earning ratio, which compares the price of stocks to companies\u2019 profits, the stock market looks expensive. Combined, the companies in the S&P 500 index are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio that is well above the average of the last 30 years, Mr. Paulsen said.\nThe appearance of overvaluation has occurred in the past, he noted, when earnings were depressed by a weak economy. And instead of falling into a prolonged slump, stocks rallied. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to happen here,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said.\nBut other analysts think there is a lot more trouble ahead.\n\u201cThe market is buckling under the weight of its own egregious complacency, overvaluation and market concentration,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the economist and strategist."

        "title": "Wall Street Has Its Worst Day in Months",
        "fulltext": "The S&P 500 had its worst day on Thursday since June 11, falling 3.5 percent, and the same big tech companies that have driven the recent rally were the culprits.\nA day after stocks marched to another record high, Apple tumbled 8 percent, its worst drop since March. Amazon fell almost 5 percent, Microsoft more than 6 percent and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, 5 percent.\nWilliam Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird, a financial firm in Milwaukee, said investor optimism had driven share prices up \u2014 perhaps higher than investors were comfortable with, considering the serious economic challenges still posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\nDespite continued high unemployment and a weak outlook for corporate profits, stocks on Wednesday had posted their ninth gain in 10 trading sessions, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index joined the S&P 500 in reaching an all-time high.\n\u201cThe market had gotten ahead of itself and had gotten ahead of the economy, and I think this is a little bit of a reflection of that,\u201d Mr. Delwiche said.\nStocks fell from the opening bell on Thursday, dragged down by the tech companies that holdsignificant sway over the indexby virtue of their size. What started as a slight slump soon accelerated \u2014 partly because of some of the speculation and options trading that had helped send shares upward.\nBy the time the market closed, more than a week\u2019s worth of gains had been erased.\nInvestors have been optimistic about the tech companies, whosemarket dominance and online business modelsappear poised to benefit from the prospect of a work-from-home world. Before Thursday\u2019s tumble, Amazon was up more than 90 percent this year, Apple more than 80 percent, Microsoft and Facebook nearly 50 percent, and Alphabet nearly 30 percent.\nThe eagerness of new investors to get in on those gains ended up contributing to Thursday\u2019s fall.\nTherace to pick up tech shareshas pulled inmillions of new small investors. Many of them have opted not to buy actual shares but instead to make options trades, which are essentially leveraged bets on where share prices will go.\nSuch traders make these bets \u2014 mostly they have been \u201ccalls,\u201d or bets that the tech share prices would rise \u2014 with options dealers, who then have to hedge their risks. Dealers who sell calls are essentially then short, or betting that the stock price will fall. To neutralize that risk, they often try to buy the underlying shares as well, amplifying the upward momentum on the stocks.\nBut the system also amplifies downturns: Analysts said dealers rushed on Thursday to increase their bets on falling shares, which may have added momentum to the sell-off.\n\u201cI think today for tech stocks, you\u2019re seeing that dynamic play out \u2014 you have a sell-off that is being chased by dealers,\u201d said Yousef Abbasi, director of U.S. institutional equities at StoneX, a brokerage firm.\nTech shares have been a cornerstone in the recovery of financial markets since late March, when bond-buying programs by the Federal Reserve and lawmakers\u2019 enactment of the largest economic rescue plan in U.S. history put a floor under collapsing financial markets.\nSince then, the S&P 500 is up more than 50 percent, erasing all of the losses seen during the chaotic days of February and March, when the index fell nearly 34 percent, putting a stake in the heart of what had been an 11-year bull run.\nIn recent months, the rally has gathered steam and broadened as investors have focused on flickers of life in the economy, including slightly better-than-expected corporate profits and continuing support from the Fed. There were also expectations that Congress and the White House would cobble together another stimulus package that sent more dollars to small businesses and households that remained imperiled by the economic downturn.\nAt the same time, many analysts have been warning that the stock market\u2019s gains were becoming increasingly detached from reality. The outlooks for corporate profits and economic growth are far from rosy, and lawmakers in Washington have been unable to come to an agreement on another relief package.\nWhile reports on corporate profits for the second quarter of 2020 were solid, corporate profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to be down nearly 20 percent this year. And recent economic updates have shown signs that the pandemic-related shutdowns this year have created persistent problems for the labor market, a key issue for the consumer-centric American economy. A fresh report on the job market due Friday morning should provide additional clarity on that point.\nWidespread expectations for another round of fiscal stimulus from the federal government pushed such concerns into the background. But consensus about another round of government support has been hard to find: Negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats have been stalled for weeks.\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 7 percent for the year, but lingering uncertainty has those gains looking more vulnerable than they did just a couple weeks ago.\n\u201cThere is a long list of things for investors to worry about this fall, from a fraught election, to the ability to restart schools without prompting another surge in Covid-19 cases and further economic impairment,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman, an investment bank."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, complaints from tech companies against Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s power have grown louder.\nSpotify, the music streaming app, criticized Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company BasecampattackedApple\u2019s \u201chighway robbery rates\u201d on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite,sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.\nNow these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and \u201cprotect the app economy.\u201d The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and Hinge.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve collectively decided, \u2018We\u2019re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be \u201ca voice for many.\u201d\nScrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected tofile an antitrust case against Googleas soon as next week, focused on the company\u2019s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in ahigh-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened aformal antitrust investigationinto Apple\u2019s App Store tactics and are preparing to bringantitrust charges against Amazonfor abusing its dominance in internet commerce.\nFor years, smaller rivals were loath to speak up against the mammoth companies for fear of retaliation. But the growing backlash has emboldened them to take action.\nSpotify and others have become more vocal. And on Monday, Epic and Apple are set to meet in a virtual courtroom in the Northern District of California to present their cases for whether Fortnite should stay on the App Store, before a trial over the antitrust complaint next year.\nAt the heart of the new alliance\u2019s effort is opposition to Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both alsocharge a 30 percent feefor payments made inside apps in their systems.\nApp makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they arecompeting with Apple\u2019sand Google\u2019s own apps and their unfair advantages.\nApple has argued that its fee is standard across online marketplaces.\nOn Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles,outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.\nEach of the alliance\u2019s members has agreed to contribute an undisclosed membership fee to the effort.\n\u201cApple leverages its platform to give its own services an unfair advantage over competitors,\u201d said Kirsten Daru, vice president and general counsel of Tile, a start-up that makes Bluetooth tracking devices and is part of the new nonprofit. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for consumers, competition and innovation.\u201d\nMs. Daru testified to lawmakers this year that Apple had begun making the permissions around Tile\u2019s app more difficult for people to use after it developed a competing feature.\nApple did not immediately have a comment on the coalition; Google didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe coalition came together in recent months after discussions among executives at Tile, Epic, Spotify and Match Group, the four companies that have been most vocal in their opposition to the big tech companies, Ms. Maxwell said.\nSome of the conversations took place after Apple and Google booted Fortnite from their app stores last month for violating their payment rules. As Epic\u2019s fight with Apple and Google escalated, Spotify and Match Group spoke out in support of the video game company.\nApple hasarguedthat Epic\u2019s situation \u201cis entirely of Epic\u2019s own making.\u201d\nThe new coalition could spur more companies to publicly voice longstanding complaints, its members said. Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain.com, said his cryptocurrency finance company had joined the group partly because it offered strength in numbers.\n\u201cCan they ban us all?\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d\nApple has blocked Blockchain\u2019s apps several times, Mr. Smith said. Some customers were so frustrated by the blockages that they posted videos of themselvesdestroying iPhones with machetes.\n\u201cThese app stores have gotten so big that they are effectively deciding what customers get access to,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\nTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive, said his company had received \u201cvast, vast amounts of communication\u201d from app developers who supported it after it sued. But many are afraid to speak up publicly, he said.\n\u201cApple and Google have infinite ways of retaliating without it being obvious to the outside world\u201d by slowing down apps, reinterpreting rules in negative ways or saying no to new features, Mr. Sweeney said in an interview this week.\nHe said Epic had ahistory of standing up for what it thought was right. \u201cBut of course,\u201d he added, \u201cit is very stressful to go through, you know, a fight with two companies that are over 200 times our size.\u201d\nAdam Satariano contributed reporting from London."

        "title": "The New Apple Watch Measures Your Blood Oxygen. Now What?",
        "fulltext": "Thenew Apple Watchcan be summed up in two words: blood oxygen.\nThe ability to measure your blood\u2019s oxygen saturation \u2014 an overall indicator of wellness \u2014 is the most significant new feature in the Apple Watch Series 6, which was unveiled this week and becomes available on Friday. (The watch is otherwise not that different from last year\u2019s Apple watch.) The feature is particularly timely with thecoronavirus, because some patients in critical condition with Covid-19 have had low blood oxygen levels.\nBut how useful is this feature for all of us, really?\nI had a day to test the new $399 Apple Watch to measure my blood oxygen level. The process was simple: You open the blood oxygen app on the device, keep your wrist steady and hit the Start button. After 15 seconds, during which a sensor on the back of the watch measures your blood oxygen level by shining lights onto your wrist, it shows your reading. In three tests, my blood oxygen level stood between 99 percent and 100 percent.\nI wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with this information. So I asked two medical experts about the new feature. Both were cautiously optimistic about its potential benefits, especially for research. The ability to constantly monitor blood oxygen levels with some degree of accuracy, they said, could help people discover symptoms for health conditions like sleep apnea.\n\u201cContinuous recording of data can be really interesting to see trends,\u201d said Cathy A. Goldstein, a sleep physician at the University of Michigan\u2019s Medicine Sleep Clinic, who has researched data collected by Apple Watches.\nBut for most people who are relatively healthy, measuring blood oxygen on an everyday basis could be way more information than we need. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said he was concerned that blood oxygen readings could upset people and lead them to take unnecessary tests.\n\u201cIt can be positive and negative,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cIt could keep people out of doctors\u2019 offices and at home and give them reassurance, but it could also create a lot of anxiety.\u201d\nThat\u2019s important to remember as smart watches gain new health-monitoring features that give us information about ourselves that we have to figure out how to use. When the Apple Watch Series 4introduced an electrical heart sensorfor people to take electrocardiograms in 2018, it was useful for people with known heart conditions to monitor their health \u2014 but doctors warned that it was also a novelty that should not be used to jump to conclusions or for people to self-diagnose heart attacks or other conditions.\nAnd so, here we are again.\nA healthy person will usually have blood oxygen levels in the mid- to high 90s. When people have health conditions such as lung disease, sleep disorders or respiratory infections, levels can dip to the 60s to the low 90s, Dr. Goldstein said.\nIf you buy the Apple Watch and have access to information about your blood oxygen levels all the time, it\u2019s important to have a framework for thinking about the data. Most importantly, you should have a primary care physician with whom you can share the measurements so that you can place it into context with your overall health, like your age and pre-existing conditions, Dr. Goldstein said.\nBut when it comes to medical advice and diagnosis, always defer to a doctor. If you notice a big dip in your blood oxygen level, it is not necessarily a reason to panic, and you should talk to your doctor to decide whether to investigate. And if you have symptoms of illness, such as fever or a cough, a normal blood oxygen reading shouldn\u2019t be a reason to skip talking to a medical professional, Dr. Goldstein said.\nLet a medical expert \u2014 not your watch \u2014 create the action plan.\nBlood oxygen monitoring may be more useful for people who are already known to have health problems, Dr. Weiss said. For example, if someone with a history of heart failure saw lower saturation levels in their blood oxygen during exercise, that information could be shared with a doctor, who could then modify the treatment plan.\nThe information could also be used to determine whether a sick person should go to the hospital. \u201cIf a patient called me and said, \u2018I have Covid and my oxygen level is at 80 percent,\u2019 I would say, \u2018Go to the hospital,\u201d\u2019 Dr. Weiss said.\nIn the end, health data on its own isn\u2019t immediately useful, and we have to decide how to make the best use of the information. Apple doesn\u2019t recommend what to do or how to feel about the information, just as a bathroom scale doesn\u2019t tell you you\u2019re overweight and give you a diet plan.\nIf you find that the data makes you more anxious, you could simply disable the feature, Dr. Goldstein said.\nBut even if blood oxygen measurement sounds gimmicky today, it\u2019s important to keep an open mind about how new health-monitoring technologies might benefit us in the future. Both Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Weiss pointed to sleep apnea as an area where wearable computers might benefit people. The condition, which causes breathing problems during sleep, affects millions of Americans, but most people never know that they have it.\nIt\u2019s a bit of a catch-22. If you had symptoms of sleep apnea, which include lower blood oxygen levels, your doctor would order a test. But you probably wouldn\u2019t catch the symptoms while you were asleep, so a study would never be ordered.\nThe Apple watch will periodically measure your blood oxygen level in the background, including when you are asleep. So if we gather data about ourselves while we\u2019re slumbering, we might discover something unknown about ourselves \u2014 or not.\n\u201cUntil we start doing it, we don\u2019t know whether or not this information can be valuable,\u201d Dr. Goldstein said."

        "title": "Apple and Epic Games Spar Over Returning Fortnite to the App Store",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Appleand Epic Games, the maker ofFortnite, sparred in federal court on Monday over whether to reinstate the popular game in Apple\u2019sApp Store, raising antitrust arguments that may reshape a key part of the internet economy and the way people use smartphones.\nIn a three-hour videoconference hearing in the Northern District of California, Epic laid out its allegations that Apple had abused its power.Their fight began last monthwhen Epic tried collecting its own payments for Fortnite without going through the App Store, breaking Apple\u2019s rules. Apple then booted Fortnite from the App Store; Epic responded by suing Apple, accusing it of violating antitrust laws.\nOn Monday, Epic said Apple\u2019s unwillingness to let it use its own payment system was anticompetitive and monopolistic. Apple countered that Epic had created a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d by not complying with its payment policy. Apple also said Epic had plenty of alternative ways to distribute its games.\nJudge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded the hearing by recommending a jury trial in the case in July. In the coming days, she is expected to rule on whether Apple must allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic\u2019s software development tools, in the interim.\nThe battle is playing out as scrutiny of the power of the tech giants ramps up. Lawmakers, regulators, academics and activists are increasingly taking issue with the reach of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google in people\u2019s lives. For months, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and House lawmakers have investigated the clout of the companies and whether they stifle competition and harm consumers.\nThose inquiries are set to come to a head soon. TheJustice Department is poised to sue Googleon claims of anticompetitive search practices, while Congress is expected to release a report of a yearlong antitrust investigation into the big technology platforms.\nMuch of the scrutiny of Apple has centered on the power it holds over developers in its App Store. Apple and Google control access to apps on virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones through their iOS and Android operating systems. The companies chargea 30 percent feefor purchases made inside apps in their app stores. And they make their own apps that compete with those of independent developers.\nApple has long said that all app developers are subject to the same rules, and that its commission is fair. But Epic has said Apple\u2019s power creates an unlevel playing field and is unfair. Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of fees, for instance, is too high a tax on commerce, the games maker has said. It is seeking the option to use its own payment method and publish its own app store within Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s systems.\nLast week, Epic joined with Spotify, Match Group and other independent developers toform a nonprofit coalitionto push for changes in the app stores and to \u201cprotect the app economy.\u201d\nBut by taking on Apple so directly and publicly, Epic \u2014 a 29-year-old privately held company worth $17.3 billion and based in Cary, N.C. \u2014 may be in for the fight of its life. Apple has a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion and almost unlimited resources. Last month, it cut off its support for Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine, a software development tool that thousands of developers use. That took the smaller company by surprise.\n\u201cWe recognized the theoretical possibility in advance, but thought it would be so foolish of\u201d Apple to cut off Unreal Engine, Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s founder and chief executive, said in an interview last week.\nIn court on Monday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers sharply criticized Epic\u2019s decision last month to break with Apple\u2019s payment rules. \u201cThere are plenty of people in the public who consider you guys heroes for what you did, but it\u2019s still not honest,\u201d she said.\nEpic argued that Fortnite\u2019s removal from the App Store had caused it irreparable harm. But Judge Gonzales Rogers noted that Epic\u2019s publicity campaign around the fight, including a parody video of Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d ad and a hashtag, #FreeFortnite, had probably increased good will toward the company.\nEpic\u2019s attorney, Katherine B. Forrest, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, defended the publicity campaign.\n\u201cWhen you are taking on the biggest company in the world and you know it\u2019s going to retaliate, you don\u2019t lie down in the street and die,\u201d she said. \u201cYou plan very carefully.\u201d\nApple said it would reinstate Fortnite to its App Store only if Epic complied with its rules.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need this court\u2019s emergency help \u2014 they have the keys to free Fortnite right there in their pocket,\u201d said Apple\u2019s attorney, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a partner at Gibson Dunn.\nApple also repeated a longstanding argument that it maintains tight control over its App Store to keep customers\u2019 data secure and private.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers encouraged both companies to consider a jury trial. \u201cIt is important enough to understand what real people think,\u201d she said. \u201cDo these security issues concern people or not?\u201d\nThe battle over the power of app stores has sharpened recently. Even Facebook, which is also under antitrust scrutiny, has piled on. On Friday, the social media giant said Apple had temporarily waived its 30 percent fee on apps that provide virtual events for three months. Facebook lamented that starting next year, it wouldhave to \u201cyet again pay Apple the full 30 percent App Store tax.\u201d\nOn Monday, Google also said it wouldno longer allow companies to circumventits app store fees, as companies like Spotify and Netflix have done in recent years.\nIn the interview last week, Mr. Sweeney said Epic was \u201call in\u201d on the fight against Apple. \u201cWe\u2019re staking our business on a battle in which we feel is right,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nMark Zuckerberg is the world\u2019s most powerful unelected person, and it drives me bonkers when he misrepresents what\u2019s happening on Facebook.\nIn aninterview that aired on Tuesday, Zuckerberg was asked big and thorny questions about his company: Why are people sometimes cruel to one another on Facebook, and why doinflammatory, partisan posts get so much attention?\nZuckerberg told \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d that Americans are angry and divided right now, and that\u2019s why they act that way on Facebook, too.\nZuckerberg and other Facebook executives consistently say that Facebookis a mirror on society. An online gathering that gives a personal printing press to billions of people will inevitably have all the good and the bad of those people. (My colleague Mike Isaac hastalked about this view before.)\nIt\u2019s true but also comically incomplete to say that Facebook reflects reality. Instead, Facebook presents reality filtered through its own prism, and this affects what people think and do.\nFacebook regularly rewrites its computer systems to meet the company\u2019s goals; the company might make it more likely that you\u2019ll see a friend\u2019s baby photo than a news article about wildfires. That doesn\u2019t mean that wildfires aren\u2019t real, but it does mean that Facebook is creating a world where the fires are not in the forefront.\nFacebook\u2019s ability to shape, not merely reflect, people\u2019s preferences and behavior is also how the company makes money. The company might suggest to a video game developer that tweaking its social media ads \u2014 changing the pitch language or tailoring the ad differently for Midwestern college students than for 40-somethings on the West Coast \u2014 can help it sell more app downloads.\nFacebook sells billions of dollars in ads each year because what people see there, and how Facebook chooses to prioritize that information, can influence what people believe and buy.\nFacebook knows it has the power to shape what we believe and how we act. That\u2019s why it has restricted wrong information about the coronavirus, and it doesn\u2019t allow people to bully one another online.\nFurther proof: An internal team of researchers at Facebook concluded that thesocial network made people more polarized, The Wall Street Journal reported in May. American society is deeply divided, but Facebook contributes to this, too.\nSo why does Zuckerberg keep saying that Facebook is a mirror of society? Maybe it\u2019s a handy media talking point that is intentionally uncomplicated.\nThere are no easy fixes to make Facebook or much of the world less polarized and divided, but it\u2019s dishonest for Zuckerberg to say his company is a bystander rather than a participant in what billions of people on its site believe and how they behave.\nZuckerberg knows \u2014 as we all do \u2014 the power that Facebook has to remake reality.\nYour Lead\nA reader from El Dorado Hills, California, emailed a follow-up question to last week\u2019s newsletter about Utah\u2019sflawed, but still promising, virus-alert app. Why does any health authority need to persuade us to download another app, when our phones already follow our movements and could be redeployed to figure out whom we might have exposed to the coronavirus?\nYup, fair question. First, I would say that it\u2019s not great for a zillion apps to already collect information about where we go and what we do. But it\u2019s true that one flaw of many coronavirus-tracing apps around the world is that people have to be persuaded to download yet another app, and trust what it does.\nGoogle and Apple are working together on technology that wouldmake it easier for statesto notify people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus by detecting phones that come close to one another. With this technology, the states would not necessarily have to create separate health apps.\nPeople still need to trust this virus-alert technology and give it permission to track their whereabouts. Trust in both technology companies and public health authorities has been sorely lacking in this pandemic.\nGoogle and Apple\u2019s technology is also still in development, and some elected officials and public health authorities in the United States and other countries decided they needed to create their own apps to give people more information about the coronavirus or to help track possible exposures. It\u2019s a good bet that some states and countries will incorporate Google and Apple\u2019s virus-alert system into their own early app versions.\nPublic health experts have said this kind of virus exposure notification technology will be useful for as long as we\u2019re battling the coronavirus. And most people who have followed Google and Apple\u2019s work have said the companies are (mostly) doing the right things to listen to health authorities and also protect people\u2019s privacy.\nThis virus-alert technology will be flawed, possibly creepy and not a silver bullet, but we need it.\nOnline school stinks. So does in-person school.Crashing websites, cyberattacks and a tangle of technology complicated the early days of back to virtual school for many American school children, my colleagues Dan Levin and Kate Taylor wrote.Online learning problemswere a symptom of a lack of guidance from state and federal education officials, one expert told them.\nAnd at colleges that opted to reopen for classes in person, my colleague Natasha Singer reported that administrators have sometimesfailed to help or effectively isolate studentsinfected with or exposed to the coronavirus.\nDon\u2019t buy a new phone expecting it to be magically faster:The next generation of wireless technology promises to make our phones zippier and connect our cars and factory equipment to the internet more easily. But right now, the claims about 5G wireless are a lot of hot air. A Washington Post columnist found that smartphones connected to 5G phone networkssurfed the internet at roughly the same or even slower speeds than older networks.\nI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s pointless to make your canned beans look beautiful.If you\u2019ve been on Instagram, you\u2019ve seen that aesthetic of hyper organized and color-coded food pantries, closets and sock drawers. Go read thisNew York Times Magazine articleabout the two people most responsible for this look and how they reflect an online subculture that both fetishizes control over some aspects of life, like stylish junk drawers, while also reveling in being imperfect.\nGus the hamster is going on a JOURNEY.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nDuring a pandemic, it\u2019s great to have Amazon, Netflix and TikTok at our fingertips. And their success shows that good enough is plenty good.\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard that old saying: Content is king. The idea is that must-have, exceptional entertainment, information and technology rule the land. I\u2019m not sure this was ever true, and it\u2019s definitely not now. What rules instead is \u201cgood enough.\u201d\nAmazon might not have that one thing you want to buy, but it\u2019ll have five other things that are perfectly fine substitutes. Good enough is why I recently sat through multiple episodes of a bad old television series. Good enough is why Apple iscombining multiple not-must-have digital services into one. Netflix, TikTok and YouTube are powerhouses of the good enough economy.\nThey have a small amount of great stuff and lots of perfectly fine stuff, and they package it in a convenient and affordable way. That\u2019s useful.\nThe power of good enough is underappreciated, I think, because it seems like an insult. It\u2019s admitting that mediocrity is OK. But it is!\nThe good enough economy does, however, speak to the balance of power between those who create stuff and the gatekeepers that distribute it.\nThe internet made it easier for people everywhere to show the world the music they created, the cat toys they made in their spare time or the entertainment they shot on an iPhone. But because anyone can create anything, it\u2019s hard for any one thing to get attention.\nThat\u2019s why companies that can assemble mass numbers of people in one place \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, Netflix and others \u2014 have become our kings. They are Harry Potter-like sorting hats organizing the sea of entertainment, information and products.\nIf you draw enough eyeballs to one place, each individual movie hit, online celebrity or star video gamer matters less. If the video app TikTok didn\u2019t haveCharli D\u2019Amelio, one of its biggest draws, some of her fans would freak out. But most of them would be happy with everything else that\u2019s still there.\nDid \u201cTiger King\u201d get a lot ofattention and eyeballs on Netflixbecause it\u2019s amazing TV, or because Netflix made it front and center to its 200 million subscribers? When one of the world\u2019s most popular video game starscouldn\u2019t thrive outside a hugely popular video game website, it showed that the companies that assemble an audience can outweigh the draw of a superlative star.\nI don\u2019t want to underplay the draw of superstars and must-have programming. The National Football League might single-handedly be keeping the American television industry alive, for example. Some individuals aresingular content kings.\nBut mostly, for companies that assemble big numbers of people and make it easy for all of us, the aggregate wins over the individual. A lot of good enough is better than a little perfect that is most likely hard to find or costs extra.\nThe funny thing about online life is that two poles exist. The good enough economy sits oppositethe \u201cpassion economy,\u201dwhich Ben Smith, the media columnist for The New York Times, wrote about recently. Digital services like Patreon and Substack give musicians, podcasters, drawing teachers or newsletter writers a chance to make a living from a relatively small number of passionate fans.\nSo content does rule, sometimes. And so do the websites that amass an audience of billions with stuff that\u2019s good enough.\nCompanies don\u2019t just try to sell us what we need or want. They also try to sell us what they need us to buy.\nOn Tuesday, Apple talked up a dizzying array of products, including new and upgraded versionsof the Apple Watch,iPadand combinationsof monthly subscriptionsto things like Apple\u2019s music service andnew Apple-created virtual fitness classes.\nApple now has approximately 1,031 things for sale \u2014 you know, approximately\u2014many of them added in the last few years.\nTo understand why, you need to know that Apple ishaving a midlife crisis.\nPopularizing the smartphone was a gold mine for Apple. It still is. But the mine is slowly running out of gold. Around the world, smartphones arebecoming basic necessities like refrigerators, and fewer people are excited to rush out every year or two and buy another $1,000 iPhone.\nThis is fine. But it\u2019s not fine for Apple. This company pretends it doesn\u2019t care about money, but yeah it does. And companies like Apple have to make more money year after year, which is harder to do when the gold mine starts to run out of gold.\nSo if Apple struggles to sell more of what had been a relatively small number of precious products, one solution is to make way more products.Something for everyone.\nThat may help us understand why Apple until 2018 typically released one new iPhone model each year \u2014 and it now has four. It\u2019s why over the last few years, Apple also startedto make television series, soldnewsandvideo gamesubscriptions,offered a credit card, pitcheda home speakerand is experimenting with combining its online subscriptions.\nA lot of this stuff might be great \u2014 or (COUGH, COUGH) good enough. And we want companies to come up with new ideas. But when you see these products, also imagine Apple whispering, \u201cPlease buy more things from us.\u201d\nYoga teachers versus a conspiracy theory:Some yoga instructors and other people interested in wellness are concerned that the QAnon conspiracy theory isgaining traction in their community. My colleague Kevin Roose explained in a new feature called \u201cDaily Distortions\u201d that QAnon supporters using the language and sensibility of a New Age healing workshop helped broaden the conspiracy that falsely claims that a cabal of satanic pedophiles and cannibals runs the world and wants to undermine President Trump.\nIt\u2019s easy to snark, but Kim K is powerful:Celebrities including Kim Kardashian West and Leonardo DiCaprio said they would protest what they see as inaction by Facebook against misinformation and hate speech bynot posting on Instagram or Facebookfor 24 hours. An organizer said this celebrity freeze was one step in a broader pressure campaign against Facebook, wrote my colleague Kellen Browning. Others called it an ineffective performative gesture.\nMaybe singular stars do top \u201cgood enough\u201d?My colleagues have a fun and thoughtful set of short essays all about how the internetfractured and remade what it means to be famous. Academics and geologists are famous. Nail artists and hedgehogs are stars. And you can vote for the most relevant celebrity. (Academics are leading right now.)\nWe all \u2014including this raccoon\u2014 deserve to hug a teddy bear. (Thanks to my colleague Liam Stack for finding this one. Yes, there is literally a hug in today\u2019s \u201cHugs to this.\u201d)\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.
