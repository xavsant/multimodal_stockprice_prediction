        "title": "Apple and Goldman Sachs Must Pay Nearly $90 Million in Credit-Card Inquiry",
        "fulltext": "Federal regulators ordered Goldman Sachs and Apple on Wednesday to pay combined penalties of more than $89 million over their handling of their credit-card business, affecting hundreds of thousands of Apple Card users.\nThe investment bank was ordered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to pay fines of $45 million, and Apple was fined $25 million. In addition, Goldman will be required to pay at least $19.8 million in customer refunds. Regulators are barring Goldman from offering any new credit card other than the Apple Card unless it provides a \u201ccredible plan\u201d showing the product will comply with the law.\nThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s yearslong inquiry looked into, among other issues, Goldman\u2019s customer-service operations, specifically how the bank handled fraud and refunds in its credit-card partnership with Apple. The investigation found that the companies\u2019 conduct left customers with incorrect credit reports and unresolved charge disputes.\nApple and Goldman failed to properly handle customer disputes, Rohit Chopra, the C.F.P.B.\u2019s director, said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. Even when Goldman was alerted to disputes, Mr. Chopra added, the bank often failed to follow federal requirements to investigate and resolve them in a timely manner.\nThe agency also said Goldman and Apple misled consumers about interest-free payment options for Apple devices, charging substantial interest despite leading customers to believe they would get interest-free financing when purchasing Apple products with their Apple Card.\n\u201cThe execution was a mess,\u201d Mr. Chopra said, referring to the launch of the credit card partnership in 2019.\n\u201cKey systems related to Apple Card weren\u2019t ready,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldman Sachs\u2019s board was even told about the problems, but it made the business decision to go forward anyway.\u201d\nNick Carcaterra, a spokesman for Goldman, said Apple Card, issued by Goldman, is \u201cone of the most consumer-friendly credit cards that has ever been offered.\u201d\n\u201cWe worked diligently to address certain technological and operational challenges that we experienced after launch and have already handled them with impacted customers,\u201d Mr. Carcaterra said in a statement, adding that the bank is \u201cpleased to have reached a resolution with the C.F.P.B.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the tech giant worked closely with Goldman to quickly address the \u201cinadvertent issues\u201d when they arose years ago and help customers who were affected. Apple disagrees with the C.F.P.B.\u2019s characterization of its conduct, but has reached an agreement with the agency, the spokeswoman said in a statement.\nThe $45 million fine against Goldman pales in comparison to the $3 billion in profits that the bank reported last week in itsthird-quarter earnings. Goldman took in almost $13 billion in revenue in the last quarter, over $1 billion more than analysts had projected.\nBut in its earnings report, Goldman underscored the continued challenges in its consumer-bank ambitions, from which the bank is struggling to retreat. The bank set aside $397 million for credit losses last quarter, a sharp increase from the previous quarter and the same period last year.\nLast week, Goldman took a $415 million hit largely by selling its General Motors-branded credit cards to Barclays \u2014 and while it has yet to exit its Apple-branded cards, it has said it intends to do so, which could result in further losses.\nIn 2022, Goldman disclosed that the federal agency was looking into how the bank refunded cardholders, resolved billing disputes and reported consumer information to credit bureaus. Other government agencies have since joined in on inquiries into the bank\u2019s credit-card business, Goldman said last year.\nSome Goldman executives have privately blamed Apple for regulatory scrutiny of the bank\u2019s credit-card business, according toThe Wall Street Journal. Apple cardholders receive their bill at the start of each month, rather than on a rolling basis, leaving Goldman customer-service employees inundated with requests, according to The Journal."

        "title": "Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying",
        "fulltext": "Last fall, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive, asked his counterpart at Microsoft, Satya Nadella, if the tech giant would invest billions of dollars in the start-up.\nMicrosoft hadalready pumped $13 billioninto OpenAI, and Mr. Nadella was initially willing to keep the cash spigot flowing. But after OpenAI\u2019sboardof directors briefly ousted Mr. Altman last November, Mr. Nadella and Microsoft reconsidered, according to four people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nOver the next few months, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t budge as OpenAI, whichexpects to lose $5 billion this year, continued to ask for more money and more computing power to build and run its A.I. systems.\nMr. Altman once called OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft \u201cthe best bromance in tech,\u201d but ties between the companies have started to fray. Financial pressure on OpenAI, concern about its stability and disagreements between employees of the two companies have strained their five-year partnership, according to interviews with 19 people familiar with the relationship between the companies.\nThat tension demonstrates a key challenge for A.I. start-ups: They aredependent on the world\u2019s tech giants for money and computing powerbecause those big companies control the massive cloud computing systems the small outfits need to develop A.I.\nNo pairing displays this dynamic better than Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot. When OpenAI got its giant investment from Microsoft, it agreed to an exclusive deal to buy computing power from Microsoft and work closely with the tech giant on new A.I.\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply grateful for our partnership with Microsoft; the early big bet they took on us and the vast compute resources they\u2019ve provided have been essential to our research breakthroughs, benefiting both companies greatly,\u201d Mr. Altman said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are excited and committed to pursuing our shared vision and achieving even greater things together far into the future.\u201d\nOver the last year, OpenAI has been trying to renegotiate the deal to help it secure more computing power and reduce crushing expenses while Microsoft executives have grown concerned that their A.I. work is too dependent on OpenAI. Mr. Nadella has said privately that Mr. Altman\u2019s firing in November shocked and concerned him, according to five people with knowledge of his comments.\nSince then, Microsoft has started to hedge its bet on OpenAI.\n\u201cWe have continued to invest in OpenAI at many discrete points in the partnership,\u201d Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are certainly the very largest investor of capital in them.\u201d\nBut in March, Microsoftpaid at least $650 millionto hire most of the staff from Inflection, an OpenAI competitor. Inflection\u2019s former chief executive and co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman, oversees a new Microsoft group that is working to build A.I. technologies for consumers based on OpenAI software. He is also the point person for Microsoft\u2019s long-term effort to build technologies that could replace what the company is getting from OpenAI, according to two people familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans.\n\u201cMicrosoft could be left behind if it is only using OpenAI technologies,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson. \u201cIt is a real race \u2014 and OpenAI may not win it.\u201d\nSome OpenAI executives and employees, including Mr. Altman, are angered that Mr. Suleyman is at Microsoft, according to five people familiar with the relationship between the two companies. Mr. Suleyman\u2019s team is part of a group of Microsoft engineers who work directly with employees at OpenAI. Dozens of Microsoft engineers work on-site at OpenAI\u2019s offices in San Francisco and use laptops provided by OpenAI that are set up to maintain the start-up\u2019s security protocols.\nSome OpenAI staff recently complained that Mr. Suleyman yelled at an OpenAI employee during a recent video call because he thought the start-up was not delivering new technology to Microsoft as quickly as it should, according to two people familiar with the call. Others took umbrage after Microsoft\u2019s engineers downloaded important OpenAI software without following the protocols the two companies had agreed on, the people said.\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and Microsoft in December claiming that they had infringed The Times\u2019s copyright in training A.I. systems.)\nAfter Microsoft backed away from the discussions about additional funding, OpenAI was in a bind. It needed more cash to keep its operations going, and its executives chafed at the exclusivity of the contract. Over the past year, the A.I. company repeatedly tried to negotiate a lower cost and terms that would allow it to buy computing power from other companies, according to seven people familiar with the discussions.\nIn June, Microsoft agreed to an exception in the contract, six people with knowledge of the change said. That allowed OpenAI to sign a roughly $10 billion computing deal with Oracle for additional computing resources, according to two people familiar with the deal.Oracle is providingcomputers packed with chips suited to building A.I., while Microsoft provides the software that drives the hardware.\nAnd in recent weeks, OpenAI and Microsoft negotiated a change to a future contact that reduces how much Microsoft will charge the smaller company for computing power, although the exact terms were unclear, according to a person familiar with the change.\nWhile it was looking for computer power alternatives, OpenAI also raced to broaden its investors, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s plan.\nPart of the plan was to secure strategic investments from organizations that could bolster OpenAI\u2019s prospects in ways beyond throwing around money. Those organizations included Apple, the chipmaker Nvidia, and MGX, a tech investment firm controlled by the United Arab Emirates.\nMr. Altman and OpenAI had been discussing potential partnerships with Apple for years. In 2022, as OpenAI was developing thetechnologies that would drive ChatGPT, Mr. Altman and Mr. Scott met with executives at Apple to explore ways the three companies might work together, according to two people familiar with the meeting. That meeting eventually led Apple toagree to put ChatGPT on the iPhoneearlier this year.\nNvidia was an important partner because it designed the computer chips that OpenAI needed to build its A.I. technologies. MGX was part of anambitious OpenAI effortto build new computer data centers across the globe.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI closed a$6.6 billion funding roundled by Thrive Capital, with additional participation from Nvidia, MGX and others. Apple did not invest, but Microsoft also participated in the funding round.\nOpenAI expected to spend at least $5.4 billion in computing costs through the end of 2024, according todocuments reviewedby The New York Times. That amount was expected to skyrocket over the next five years as OpenAI expanded, soaring to an estimated $37.5 billion in annual computing costs by 2029, the documents showed.\nIt is not clear how much the recent tweaks to the partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft will alter that trajectory, but Microsoft executives were happy with the changes, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s strategy. The tech giant can continue to benefit from OpenAI\u2019s improving technologies, while the start-up continues to pay the tech giant for substantial amounts of computing power.\nStill, OpenAI employees complain that Microsoft is not providing enough computing power, according to three people familiar with the relationship. And some have complained that if another company beat it to the creation of A.I. that matches the human brain, Microsoft will be to blame because it hasn\u2019t given OpenAI the computing power it needs, according to two people familiar with the complaints.\nOddly, that could be the key to getting out from under its contract with Microsoft. The contract contains a clause that says that if OpenAI builds artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. \u2014 roughly speaking, a machine that matches the power of the human brain \u2014 Microsoft loses access to OpenAI\u2019s technologies.\nThe clause was meant to ensure that a company like Microsoft did not misuse this machine of the future, but today, OpenAI executives see it as a path to a better contract, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s negotiations. Under the terms of the contract, the OpenAI board could decide when A.G.I. has arrived.\nAt an A.I. conference in Seattle this month, Microsoft didn\u2019t spend much time discussing OpenAI. Asha Sharma, an executive working on Microsoft\u2019s A.I. products, emphasized the independence and variety of the tech giant\u2019s offerings.\n\u201cWe definitely believe in offering choice,\u201d Ms. Sharma said.\nKaren WeiseandTripp Micklecontributed reporting."

        "title": "\u2018Founder Mode\u2019 Explains the Rise of Trump in Silicon Valley",
        "fulltext": "Silicon Valley\u2019s current fascination with a trendy management meme illustrates a broader and more troubling turn in certain powerful pockets of its culture \u2014 one that has seized our politics and could even unduly influence our election (again).\nI\u2019m talking aboutfounder mode. A recently coined management style being celebrated by some venture capitalists, it embraces the notion that a company\u2019s founder must make decisions unilaterally rather than partner with direct reports or frontline employees. All too often the extension of founder mode is to resist not only internal checks and balances but also those from the government.\nI see founder mode as another expression of a creeping attraction to one-man rule in some corners of tech. (I use \u201cman\u201d intentionally, as only 3 percent of venture capital funding goes to solo female founders.) This neo-authoritarianism is nothing short of a rejection of the historical values that made Silicon Valley what it is today. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that a handful of the wealthiest and most powerful venture capitalists there are throwing their resources behind the re-election of Donald Trump.\nThis view of the world is the antithesis of what I most love about Silicon Valley, which has its roots in a rebellious anti-authoritarianism. In 1957 eight engineers quit Shockley Semiconductor and founded Fairchild Semiconductor, which built transistors and integrated circuits, because they were frustrated by their boss\u2019s megalomaniacal refusal to listen to them. Then in 1968 two of those founders, frustrated by the way their bosses at Fairchild were treating them, quit to start a chipmaker called Intel.\nIn that original recipe, venture capitalists invested in founders rebelling against established hierarchy and building great products. And when those rebels themselves became too hierarchical, venture capitalists turned to new founders aspiring to overtake the old order. When rebels became kings, they got deposed. Command and control kills innovation.\nThat history explains why, in the early days of Google, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, wanted to avoid becoming despotic bosses, no matter how much the company grew. At first they eliminated engineering manager roles, only to learn that chaos is just as bad as autocratic leadership. So they opted for checks and balances, electing to build management systems that systematically stripped unilateral decision-making authority from all managers \u2014 all the way up to the founders and chief executive. At Google the idea of one-person rule seemed illogical and bound to fail. Why hire the smartest people in the world, only to refuse steadfastly to listen to a word they say?\nFounder mode invokes Steve Jobs, revealing a misunderstanding of what made Apple\u2019s chief executive legendary. Edwin Catmull, a co-founder of Pixar and a close associate, says Mr. Jobs failed when he acted like a jerk and succeeded when he learned to be a better manager and learned to work with great leaders like Tim Cook, then his chief operating officer, now Apple\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Jobs 2.0 said, \u201cWe hire people to tell us what to do, not the other way around.\u201d\nIt was his better side that won him the fierce loyalty of the managers he hired, including Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s superstar designer. Not only did Mr. Jobs not ignore his direct reports; he had close relationships with them. Mr. Ivereferredto Mr. Jobs as his closest friend. Mr. Cook offered Mr. Jobs part of his liver after Mr. Jobs was diagnosed with cancer. Mr. Jobs refused.\nAutocratic leadership, whether in a corporation or a nation-state, is a negative-sum game. On the basis of innumerable research papers, Robert L. Sutton, the author of \u201cGood Boss, Bad Boss,\u201dconcluded that when a person who bullies others is removed from a team, the performance of that team improves \u2014 even when the bully was a high performer. In her book \u201cThe Fearless Organization,\u201d Amy C. Edmondson showed that a team unafraid to speak truth to power performs better. Her research and Google studies that examined what makes teams successful have demonstrated what we all know in our gut: that the bloviating bully taking up all the air in the room is not a leader but a value destroyer. And also damned unpleasant to work with.\nMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest products were originally intended to liberate, not to control people. Apple sought to create \u201ca bicycle for the mind\u201d or \u201cthe computer for the rest of us.\u201d Google was trying to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d\nA decade ago, we were celebrating Twitter as a force for democracy. The messaging platform played a role in helping organize the Arab Spring, a series of anti-authoritarian uprisings that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. Black Twitter helped get #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter trending. Social media was not supposed to be controlled by the Man. The early promise was to allow us to talk to one another, peer to peer.\nThen as these platforms grew, money poured in. Content moderation was hard and expensive. The platforms caused harm but gave birth to multibillionaires and even centaurs \u2014 people worth not a mere $1 billion but over $100 billion. So much money offers its own kind of absolute power and regulatory capture.\nSince buying Twitter in 2022, the centaur Elon Musk has been using the platform to reinforce his personal views. He fired about 80 percent of employees, unilaterally decided to rename it X and has no compunction about using the platform to support his chosen candidate, Mr. Trump, and to spread disinformation about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Not only did Mr. Muskfiremost of the people who were tasked with identifying and eliminating disinformation; he reposts it himself.\nSince Mr. Musk bought it, the company\u2019s reported value plummeted to about $12.5 billion as of January 2024, down from the $44 billion purchase price. Maybe buying Twitter was just a bad investment, but an even more frightening hypothesis is that it was worth $31.5 billion to Mr. Musk, who is still worth $260 billion, to silence his opponents. This is how founder mode theory gets dangerous not just for investors but also for all of us.\nThen there\u2019s the disgraced FTX chief, Sam Bankman-Fried. One of his staff membersonce tolda prospective investor raising questions about his unchecked authority to go take a hike (in much cruder terms). Mr. Bankman-Fried accepted no checks on his power \u2014 not from a board of directors, not from employees, not from the government. Investors loved his style, and he was able to raise $1.9 billion, only for his abuses to eventually land him in prison and lose FTX\u2019s investors a lot of money.\nMost people in Silicon Valley understand the role that checks and balances play in corporate governance and in a well-functioning society that offers rebels a chance to improve the world without dominating it. The venture capitalist and entrepreneur Reid Hoffman has explained why therule of law is essential for innovationto flourish in Silicon Valley.\nHowever, a few of the noisiest and most powerful \u2014 like Mr. Musk and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 are now embracing what feels like techno-authoritarianism. One of the firm\u2019s co-founders, Marc Andreessen, who is on the board of Meta, wrote amanifestolast year with a \u201cBecoming Technological Supermen\u201d section, in which he said, \u201cThere is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Technology must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.\u201d He is quoting the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti\u2019s 1909 \u201cManifesto of Futurism.\u201d Mr. Marinetti was also famous as an author of the 1919 \u201cFascist Manifesto.\u201d (Ben Horowitz, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s co-founder,recently announcedthat he would make a donation to help elect Harris, after having previously endorsed Mr. Trump.)\nRather than winning in a free market by attracting customers, these would-be strongmen seek a different leverage point: a single authority operating in founder mode to eliminate the obstacles standing between them and so much power and wealth that it is impossible to disrupt them, no matter how much damage they do. In other words, they turned to Mr. Trump. (There\u2019s a misperception that Silicon Valley is full of Trump supporters. That\u2019s not accurate. Over800 venture capitalistshave signed their support for Ms. Harris.)\nA few Trump supporters like Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Musk seem to believe the presidency is for sale. After previously expressing skepticism of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump had a sudden change of heart last summer. First he tapped JD Vance, who was an early prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the venture capitalist Peter Thiel and who has been pushing a light touch on crypto regulation, to be his running mate. Then Mr. Trump showed up at the Bitcoin 2024 conference vowing to fire the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Gary Gensler, an appointee of President Biden\u2019s whose tough-on-crypto approach may help explain why Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s flagship crypto fund plummeted 40 percent in value in 2022. If Mr. Trump wins and if he honors any implicit or explicit quid pro quo \u2014 two very big ifs \u2014 the bet will pay off.\nWill authoritarianism win the day? Will founder mode continue to worm its way through Silicon Valley? I do not believe it will, for the simple reason that it doesn\u2019t work. It may be brutal, but it is also incompetent.\nEmotional dysregulation, bullying and bloviating are not leadership attributes. People who cannot manage themselves should not manage others. Leaders who can self-regulate understand the wisdom of accepting checks and balances on their own power from employees, boards and the government. Humanity\u2019s superpower is our ability to collaborate. Great leaders, including great founders, know how to bring people together and help them work better together. They create hierarchies that optimize for collaboration, not domination.\nThe authoritarian playbook can be seductive. Coercive leaders can appear to get lots done in the short run, especially when they promise special treatment to their supporters. But in the long run, they damage lives, companies and even democracies.\nKim Scott, the author of the book \u201cRadical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity,\u201d was an executive at Google and Apple.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s A.I. Is Landing Soon on iPhones. Here\u2019s What It\u2019s Like.",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s most important new product of the year (sorry,it\u2019s not a $3,500 headset) will arrive this month. Apple Intelligence, a suite of software tools bringing what Apple describes as artificial intelligence to its devices, will be released through free software updates for owners of some iPhones, Macs and iPads.\nThe initial version of Apple Intelligence, which Apple is publishing as an unfinished \u201cbeta,\u201d will include a slightly improved version of Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri, and tools that automatically summarize text, transcribe audio recordings and remove distractions like photo bombers from pictures.\nFor Apple, this debut is the beginning of a new era.Apple Intelligence is the result of a major restructuring of the Cupertino, Calif., giantnearly two years after the tech industry was upended by the ChatGPT chatbot from OpenAI.\nApple executives had been concerned that, without similar A.I. technology, the iPhone would eventually look antiquated, soApple killed its self-driving car project, which had been more than a decade in the making, and reassigned its engineers to work on Apple Intelligence.\nApple Intelligence is arriving without many of themost hyped features that Apple announcedin June. Although the company struck a deal with OpenAI to include ChatGPT in its software, the chatbot will not be part of this initial release. Siri also isn\u2019t smart enough (yet) to do things likestitch together data from multiple appsto tell you whether a last-minute meeting will make you late for your child\u2019s play. Apple said those features and others would be gradually rolled out through next year.\nTo get a sneak preview, I tested an early version of Apple Intelligence over the last week. The new features were a little tricky to find \u2014 they have been integrated into different parts of Apple\u2019s software system, including into its buttons for editing text and photos.\nI found a few features, including tools for proofreading text and transcribing audio, to be very handy. Others, like a tool for generating summaries of web articles and a button for removing unwanted distractions from photos, were so hit or miss that they should be ignored.\nThis is all to say that Apple Intelligence is worth watching over the next few years to see whether it evolves into a must-have product, but that it\u2019s not a compelling reason to splurge on new hardware.\nApple Intelligence will work on the latest iPhone 16s and last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro, as well as on some iPads and Macs released in the last four years. Here are the tools that will be most useful and the ones you can skip when the software lands on devices this month.\nApple Intelligence delivers a feature that feels long overdue: When you use the voice memos app to record audio, the app will now automatically produce a transcript alongside the file.\nAs a journalist who regularly records interviews, I was gung-ho about trying this tool and pleased that it worked well. When I met with a tech company last week, I pressed the record button in the app, and after I hit stop, the transcript was ready for me. Apple Intelligence detected whenever a different person was speaking and created a new paragraph accordingly in the transcript. It transcribed some words incorrectly whenever a person mumbled. But over all, the transcript made it easy for me to look up a keyword to pull a portion of the conversation.\nWhile it may be easy to use any smartphone or tablet, Apple\u2019s software has grown increasingly complex over the years, so it can be difficult to know how to take advantage of features that are hard to find. Apple Intelligence has imbued Siri with the ability to offer help with navigating Apple products.\nI can never remember, for the life of me, how to run two apps side by side on the iPad, for instance. So I asked Siri, \u201cHow do I use split screen on the iPad?\u201d Siri quickly showed me a list of instructions, which involved tapping a button on the top of an app.\nIronically, Siri could not offer help on how to use Apple Intelligence to rewrite an email. Instead, it loaded a list of Google search results showing other websites with the steps.\nSpeaking of email, Apple Intelligence includes writing tools to edit your words, and it can even generate canned email responses.\nI used the automatic response tool to quickly shoo away a salesperson at a car dealership: \u201cThanks for reaching out. I\u2019m no longer interested in purchasing a vehicle at this time.\u201d\nAs for editing text, I highlighted an email I quickly wrote to a colleague and hit the \u201cProofread\u201d button. Apple Intelligence quickly edited the text to insert punctuation that I had skipped.\nOne of Apple Intelligence\u2019s most anticipated features is the ability to automatically edit a photo to remove a distraction, such as a photo bomber in an otherwise perfect family portrait. Plenty of people will want to try this tool, called Clean Up, but prepare to be disappointed.\nTo try it, I opened a photo I shot of family members at an outdoor wedding a few years ago. I hit the \u201cClean Up\u201d button with hopes of removing people sitting on lawn chairs in the background. The software deleted the people and lawn chairs, but they were replaced with an unintelligible jumble of black-and-white pixels.\nI tried the tool again on a photo of my corgi, Max, sleeping on my couch next to a blanket. Apple Intelligence removed the blanket and tried to reproduce the couch cushion. Instead, it generated a deep, unflattering butt groove.\nApple seems to think that the internet is filled with too many words. One of Apple Intelligence\u2019s most prominent features is its ability to generate summaries of text in many applications, including an email, a web article and documents.\nBy pressing the \u201cSummarize\u201d button in the Safari browser, I got a three-sentence summary of a 1,200-wordNew York Times article about the pros and cons of eating tuna. Apple Intelligence summed up the premise of the article \u2014 that tuna was a nutritious food that could be high in mercury, and consumers should consider species of tuna with lower mercury levels.\nUnfortunately, in its summary, Apple Intelligence recommended that people consume albacore, one of the species listed in the article as having the highest levels of mercury. This is what\u2019s known in the tech industry as ahallucination, a common problem in which A.I. fabricates information after failing to guess the correct answer.\nThe tool also fell short summarizing my notes. Recently, to prepare for an office meeting, I took notes on three colleagues I was going to meet with. Instead of producing a tight dossier on each person, the tool generated a summary of only one person\u2019s role.\nApple declined to comment.\nIn summary, you can skip this tool."

In addition, when Apple\u2019s suite of A.I. tools,Apple Intelligence, arrives on iPhones and other Apple productsthrough software updates this month, the tech will appear inside the buttons we use to edit text and photos.\nThe proliferation of A.I. in consumer technology hassignificant implications for our data privacy, because companies are interested in stitching together and analyzing our digital activities, including details inside our photos, messages and web searches, to improve A.I. systems. For users, the tools can simply be an annoyance when they don\u2019t work well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a genuine distrust in this stuff, but other than that, it\u2019s a design problem,\u201d said Thorin Klosowski, a privacy and security analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit, and a former editor at Wirecutter, the reviews site owned by The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s just ugly and in the way.\u201d\nIt helps to know how to opt out. After I contacted Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google, they offered steps to turn off their A.I. tools or data collection, where possible. I\u2019ll walk you through the steps.\nGoogle\u2019s highest-profile A.I. product,A.I. Overviews, automatically generates a summary that tries to answer questions you enter into a Google search. The feature had a rocky debut in May \u2014 when, among other snafus, Google\u2019s A.I. told users that they could put glue on pizza \u2014 but it has since improved.\nStill, the A.I. summaries can be distracting, and there\u2019s no way to deactivate them from loading, but you can click a button to filter them out. After typing something like \u201cchocolate chip cookies recipe\u201d into a search bar, click the \u201cWeb\u201d tab to see a list of plain search results, just as Google search used to be.\nAs for search data, users can prevent Google from keeping a record of their web searches by visiting myactivity.google.com and switching off \u201cweb and app activity.\u201d\nGoogle also has anA.I. chatbot, Gemini, and the setting to prevent it from storing data can be found at myactivity.google.com/product/gemini.\nIn April, Meta AI, a chatbot that can look up flights, generate images and whip up recipes, began appearing in the search bar of Meta\u2019s apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. There is currently no way for users to turn off Meta AI, Meta said.\nOnly in regions with stronger data protection laws, including the European Union and Britain, can people deny Meta access to their personal informationto build and train Meta\u2019s A.I.\nOn Instagram, for instance, people living in those places can click on \u201csettings,\u201d then \u201cabout\u201d and \u201cprivacy policy,\u201d which will lead to opt-out instructions. Everyone else, including users in the United States, canvisit this support pageto ask Meta only to delete data used by third parties to develop its A.I.\nMicrosoft\u2019s A.I. chatbot, Copilot, can be activated by clicking a rainbow button built into some products like the Edge browser and Bing search.\nThe simplest way to avoid the chatbot is not to click on that button. But if you want to remove it from the Edge browser, you can enter edge://settings into the address bar and click \u201cSidebar,\u201d then \u201cApp and notification settings\u201d and, finally, \u201cCopilot,\u201d where you should toggle off the Copilot setting.\nIf you want to prevent Copilot from using your data to train the A.I., you have to visitcopilot.microsoft.comand go into the privacy menu in the account settings, where you can toggle off an option labeled \u201cModel training.\u201d\nA bonus tip for users of LinkedIn, Microsoft\u2019s social network for professionals: The site recently began using anything posted on its site to train its A.I. system, which could eventually be used to help people find new jobs.\nTo prevent LinkedIn from using your content, go into theSettings and Privacy tabunder your profile, click the \u201cData privacy\u201d tab and click on \u201cData for GenAI Improvement.\u201d Then toggle the switch off.\n(The Timessued Microsoft and its partner OpenAIlast year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)\nApple\u2019s suite of A.I. services, Apple Intelligence, will be released this month in an unfinished state through software updates on some iPhones, iPads and Macs. To use Apple Intelligence, users will have to opt in through a menu labeled \u201cApple Intelligence & Siri.\u201d\nOnce activated, some of the features will appear inside tools for editing text and photos \u2014 when you edit a photo, for instance, there\u2019s a \u201cClean Up\u201d button to automatically remove photo bombers.\nIf you change your mind and no longer want to use Apple Intelligence, you can go back into the settings and toggle the Apple Intelligence switch off, which makes the tools go away.\nApple says it has devised a system that protects users privacy, in which data pushed to its servers is inaccessible to Apple. Rather, the company says, it is used exclusively to process a user\u2019s request, such as a complex question posed to Siri, before the information is purged from its servers."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Quarterly Profit Down Because of Tax Payment in Europe",
        "fulltext": "Over the past month, Apple blanketed television with commercials about how its newest iPhone had exciting artificial intelligence capabilities even though the company was still working on many of the features it was pitching.\nBut Apple\u2019s delay with A.I. didn\u2019t cut into profits. Regulators did.\nOn Monday, the tech giant said sales of iPhones, iPads and subscription services like Apple Music had helped the company increase its quarterly revenue by 6 percent to $94.93 billion during the three months that ended in September.\nThe increased revenue didn\u2019t translate into profit gains because Apple, whichlost a court case in September,was forced to pay the European Union $14.4 billion in unpaid taxes. The one-time payment reduced its quarterly profit by 36percent to $14.74 billion.\nThe results exceeded Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations for $94.58 billion in sales and, excluding the one-time tax payment, would have topped projections for $24.49 billion in profit. The company said it expected revenue to increase in the current quarter, which ends in December. Shares fell 2 percentin after-hours trading.\nIn September, Apple unveiled iPhones that could use its generative A.I. system, called Apple Intelligence, to sort messages, offer writing suggestions and use a more capable Siri virtual assistant. Itreleased the firstof those features this week, but other A.I. bells and whistles are coming out more slowly than expected.\nStill, Apple said iPhone sales rose 5.5 percent to $46.22 billion during the quarter that ended in September.\nDuring a call with analysts, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that the company would add new A.I. features in December, including additional writing tools and the integration of ChatGPT. It will also expand to Britain, Canada and Australia. More languages will be available next April.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very strong drum beat,\u201d Mr. Cook said, adding that twice as many iPhone users have downloaded the latest software as a year ago.\nThe staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence features has tempered Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the technology\u2019s ability to quickly drive new iPhone sales.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of the world, but it suggests they\u2019re not going to succeed in changing people\u2019s behavior, who are holding onto their phone longer and longer,\u201dsaid Charles Rinehart, chief investment officer at Johnston Investment Counsel, a financial advisory firm.\nApple is leaning on A.I. as it faces stiffer smartphone competition in China. Huawei sales have surged behind new models and interest in a phone that can befolded twice. There has also been an uptick in purchases of Xiaomi and Vivo phones, which have helped cut Apple\u2019s share of the Chinese smartphone market to 13.5 percent from 14.5 percent, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.\nIn the face of that competition, Apple\u2019s sales in China, its second-largest market, were flat at $15 billion. The company posted sales increases in every other geographic region, including the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific.\nServices, which include the sales of apps, Apple TV+ and Apple Pay, continue to be the growth engine for Apple\u2019s business. The company is taking a cut of revenue from more than one billion subscriptions sold across iPhones and iPads. Sales of services in the quarter rose 12 percent to $24.97 billion, which was less than analysts had forecast.\nThe resilience of that business could be challenged next year. In August, afederal judge ruledthat Google is a monopolist. The Justice Department may ask the judge to address that by preventing Google from paying Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones. Such a ruling could cost Apple about $20 billion a year in services revenue.\nApple could also face challenges should Donald J. Trump return to the White House. Mr. Trump has said he would impose tariffs on products made outside the United States. That would be tough for Apple, which makes its devices in Asia, with most iPhones made in China.\nWhen a Wall Street analyst asked what Apple would do about that, Mr. Cook declined to answer the question, saying it was too speculative.\nApple\u2019s other devices showed strength in the quarter. Sales of Macs rose 2 percent to $7.74 billion, while sales of iPads jumped 20 percent to $6.95 billion.\nThe company\u2019s wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, was the only area of weakness in the period. It declined 3 percent to $9.04 billion.\nThis week, Apple released a new Mac Mini, an iMac and a MacBook Pro with more powerful chips to support Apple Intelligence. Last month, it released a new Apple Watch with a larger screen and new AirPods.\nApple\u2019s call with analysts on Thursday was the last for its chief financial officer, Luca Maestri. He is stepping down from his position in January and will be replaced by Kevan Parekh, who has worked for the company for more than a decade, most recently as vice president of financial planning and analysis.\nDuring Mr. Maestri\u2019s decade in the role, Apple\u2019s sales and profits nearly doubled, while the company\u2019s market valuation rose from about $600 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion."

        "title": "Did Apple Just Kill Social Apps?",
        "fulltext": "This year, when Apple announced iOS 18, the latest version of its mobile operating system, most of the attention went to its slate of new artificial intelligence features.\nBut a lesser-noticed change in iOS 18 \u2014 a tweak to an obscure feature that allows users to share their contact lists with various apps \u2014 may wind up being more important.\nThat\u2019s because \u201ccontact sync,\u201d as the feature is known by some developers, has played a critical role in the growth of many social and messaging apps for the past two decades. It\u2019s how apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat were able to find their footing, by quickly connecting millions of iPhone users to people they already knew, and suggesting other users for them to follow. That early momentum helped kick-start their viral growth, propelling them to the top of the App Store charts.\nNow, some developers are worried that they may struggle to get new apps off the ground. Nikita Bier, a start-up founder and adviser who has created and sold several viral apps aimed at young people, hascalled the iOS 18 changes\u201cthe end of the world,\u201d and said they could render new friend-based social apps \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d\nThat might be a little melodramatic. I recently spent some time talking to Mr. Bier and other app developers and digging into the changes. I also heard from Apple about why it believes the changes are good for users\u2019 privacy, and from some of Apple\u2019s rivals, which see it as an underhanded move intended to hurt competitors. And I came away with mixed feelings.\nOn one hand, I\u2019m sympathetic to the uphill battle faced by any developer trying to build a new social app today. The contact-sharing changes in iOS 18 will undoubtedly make it harder for some fledgling apps to break through. And in a world where it\u2019s harder for smaller apps to succeed, incumbents like Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which already have network effects, and don\u2019t have to ask existing users for permission to keep collecting their contacts \u2014 obviously stand to benefit.\nBut I\u2019m also sympathetic to Apple\u2019s stance that giving users more control over which contacts they share is a good thing for privacy, and that apps that ask users to hand over their entire contact lists can be creepy and invasive. (Personally, I plan on using this feature to avoid sharing sensitive contacts, such as confidential sources, with the dozens of social and messaging apps I use.)\nMostly, the drama demonstrates how powerful gatekeepers like Apple have become and how even minor changes to Apple\u2019s products can create dramatic ripple effects in the rest of the tech industry. It also illustrates the trade-offs that many tech companies and regulators are grappling with, as they try to promote competition while also protecting privacy.\nFor years now, the way contact sharing has worked on iOS devices is that an app can trigger a message called a \u201cdata access prompt,\u201d asking for access to a user\u2019s contacts.\nIf the user agreed, the app developer got a list of all the contacts in that user\u2019s address book, along with other information stored in the user\u2019s contact cards, such as phone numbers and email addresses. App developers could then use that information to build out a user\u2019s social graph, or suggest other accounts for the user to follow.\nIn iOS 18, however, users who agree to give an app access to their contacts are shown a second message, allowing them to select which contacts to share. Users can opt to share just a handful of contacts by selecting them one by one, rather than forking over their entire address book.\nApple\u2019s stated rationale for these changes is simple: Users shouldn\u2019t be forced to make an all-or-nothing choice. Many users have hundreds or thousands of contacts on their iPhones, including some they\u2019d rather not share. (A therapist, an ex, a random person they met in a bar in 2013.) iOS has allowed users to give apps selective access to their photos for years; shouldn\u2019t the same principle apply to their contacts?\nApple also made it clear that it didn\u2019t think the iOS 18 changes would hurt app developers. In fact, the company told me, developers might see an uptick in contact sharing, if users who previously would have declined to share any contacts can just share the ones they want.\nApp developers think that\u2019s a bogus argument. Mr. Bier told me that data he had seen from start-ups he advised suggested that contact sharing had dropped significantly since the iOS 18 changes went into effect, and that for some apps, the number of users sharing 10 or fewer contacts had increased as much as 25 percent. (Other developers said their own apps had experienced similar declines, though nobody except Mr. Bier would agree to speak on the record, out of fear of angering the Cupertino colossus.)\nA 25 percent decline in contact sharing might not sound like a huge change. But for social apps, the ability to quickly connect new users with their friends can mean the difference between success and failure. Facebook, for example,discoveredduring its early days that if users added seven friends within 10 days of signing up for an account, they were more likely to stick around than users who didn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to form density on an early-stage app,\u201d Mr. Bier said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t wait around for a week for all their friends to sign up.\u201d\nSome developers also pointed out that the iOS 18 changes don\u2019t apply to Apple\u2019s own services. For example, iMessage doesn\u2019t have to ask for permission for access to users\u2019 contacts the way WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat and other third-party messaging apps do. They see that as fundamentally anticompetitive \u2014 a clear-cut example of the kind of self-preferencing that antitrust regulatorshave objected toin other contexts.\nOf course, iPhone users can still upload their whole address books if they choose. (There\u2019s also Android, which still requires users to make an all-or-nothing choice.) But it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the added friction of a second screen will result in fewer contacts being shared.\nThe result, Mr. Bier said, might be that friend-based social apps will simply be replaced by apps like TikTok, which show users content based on what they like rather than whom they\u2019re connected to, or A.I. companionship apps that don\u2019t require humans at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be pretty crazy already to do a friend-based social app,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all but impossible.\u201d"

And you don\u2019t even need the latest phone model or third-party apps; current tools for Android and iOS can do the job with a screen tap or swipe. Here\u2019s how.\nGoogle\u2019sCircle to Searchfeature,released early this yearfor Android devices, makes firing off a query as easy as dragging your finger around a specific object on the screen \u2014 all without switching apps. The feature is available ondozens of Android phones, including manySamsung Galaxydevices. (Galaxy users also have Samsung\u2019sBixby Visiontool for visual search.)\nTo use Circle to Search,make sure it is enabled. OnAndroid 15, open the Settings, choose Display & Touch and select Navigation Mode to see the Circle to Search controls. (Steps vary based on the hardware and software involved, but the Settings search box can help you find Circle to Search if you have it.)\nNow, when you see something that you want to investigate further, summon Circle to Search by pressing the circular home button at the bottom of the screen (for 3-Button navigation) or by pressing the navigation handle (the horizontal line at the bottom of the screen) for Gesture navigation.\nWhen Circle to Search is activated, the screen dims slightly and a menu of search tools appears. Drag your finger around the onscreen item that interests you, and Google Search results will appear below the image. You can add keywords to narrow the search, andA.I. overviewsmay be included.\nGoogle has not released an iPhone edition of Circle to Search, but there is a workaround that skips the circling and analyzes a freshly made screenshot of the object in question.\nTo use it, you need theGoogle appfor iOS and a few minutes with Apple\u2019s freeShortcutsapp forautomating tasks.\nOpen the Shortcuts app and tap the plus (+) button in the top-right corner. Go to the Search Actions box. Search for and select the \u201cTake Screenshot\u201d action. Next, look for the \u201cSearch Image With Lens\u201d action and add it. Tap the Done button.\nYou can command the Siri assistant to run the shortcut by its \u201cSearch Image With Lens\u201d name. But for silent research requests, you can activate it by touch once you have an image in the camera\u2019s viewfinder or a photo on the screen.\nTo assign the shortcut to theAction button, available only on iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or later models, go to Settings, choose the Action Button, then Choose a Shortcut and select Search Image With Lens.\nOn older iPhones, go to Settings, select Accessibility, then Touch andBack Tap. In the Back Tap menu, select your choice of Double Tap or Triple Tap and choose the Search Image With Lens shortcut. Tap the back of your phone twice or thrice to run the shortcut and get your search results.\nTheGoogle Lensimage-recognition technology has been providing visual search resultssince 2017and can identify many plants, animals, landmarks, artworks and other objects, as well asstuff (like clothing) you may want to buy. It can also translate signs and assist with math homework, amongother things.\nThe software is available in the stand-aloneGoogle Lens app for Android\u2014 as well as in theGoogleapp,Google Photosand theChrome browser(for both Android and iOS).\nIn the Lens app for Android, tap \u201cSearch with your camera\u201d and point the phone at the object you want to search. In other Google apps, tap the square Lens icon onscreen to start searching. The results (often related tomarketingefforts) appear below the image.\nApple\u2019s coming A.I.-poweredVisual Intelligencefeature for itsiPhone 16 models with their Camera Control buttonswill supply real-time visual search before the end of the year.

It works with Apple\u2019sPhotosapp,Safaribrowser,Quick Lookimage previews and elsewhere to identify objects.\nTo use it, open a photo or pause a video. If Visual Look Up is available, the information button at the bottom of the screen shows a leaf, paw print, map pin or other icon you can tap for more information from Apple\u2019sSiriassistant on the object in the image. As with all search tools, check theGoogleandAppleprivacy policies if you have concerns.\nThe accuracy of visual search results can vary, but for those times when you don\u2019t have the words or time to describe what you\u2019re seeing, the tool might point you in the right direction."

        "title": "The Cutting-Edge Hearing Aids That You May Already Own",
        "fulltext": "In your pocket or purse, you may be toting around small devices that, with the help of new software authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, could soon become inexpensive hearing aids. Millions of people already own them.\nThey\u2019re Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2, those white plastic knobs protruding from so many ears in malls and workplaces, on buses and sidewalks. The users may not be among the 30 million American adults reporting some degree of hearing loss; they\u2019re probably just listening to music or podcasts, or talking on their phones.\nWithin weeks, however, consumers will be able to use those AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to bolster their hearing. Last month, Apple software called Hearing Aid and Hearing Test received agreen light from the F.D.A., a first for the regulatory agency.\nWith the upcoming software and a compatible iPhone or iPad, users will be able test their hearing. For those with mild-to-moderate hearing loss, the AirPods Pro 2 will adjust sounds in their environments and on their devices.\nUsers will be able to customize their AirPods for volume, tone and balance. All that should allow them to hear better \u2014 at least for the devices\u2019 roughly five to six hours of battery life.\nApple plans to release the free software later this fall for iPhones running iOS 18 or later and iPads running iPadOS 18 or later, a spokesperson said. A set of AirPods Pro 2 costs $249 from Apple, and less at big box stores or through online retailers.\nThis is what reformers had in mind when Congress directed the F.D.A. in 2017 to develop regulations for quality over-the-counter hearing aids.\nThe idea was to change the existing gatekeeper model, in which people could acquire prescription aids only through licensed professionals for several thousand dollars a pair. Instead, over-the-counter hearing aids that could benefit a majority of the people with hearing loss would be available for a few hundred dollars at any CVS or Walmart, no audiologist or prescription required.\nThe F.D.A. had three years to develop those regulations; it took five. Finally, two years ago, the hearing health worldbraced for a transformation\u2014 one that still hasn\u2019t quite happened.\n\u201cWe have no evidence that O.T.C. hearing aids have dramatically changed the hearing market,\u201d said Nicholas Reed, an audiologist and epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health.\n\u201cTwo years in, I would have thought we\u2019d see a nice bump by now\u201d in the number of people owning hearing aids, he added.\nBut the most recent National Health and Aging Trends study shows that although abouttwo-thirds of Americans in their 70s and older have some degree of hearing loss, fewer than 30 percent have hearing aids, a fairly consistent finding. Among Black, Hispanic and low-income seniors, ownership rates are even lower.\n\u201cHearing loss is so gradual, a lot of people don\u2019t realize they have it,\u201d said Andy Sabin, a hearing scientist and scientific consultant toHearAdvisor, which tests and evaluates hearing aids.\nIn fact, a regularsurvey by the Hearing Industries Associationshows that it takes years for people who recognize they have hearing difficulties to buy a hearing aid, if they do at all.\nBut perhaps because of recent educational campaigns, that delay in seeking treatment has shrunk, from six years in the 2019 survey to four years in 2022. And now the entrance of Apple, a high-profile consumer company, into the O.T.C. market might hasten such changes.\n\u201cThat moment when they hear better\u201d \u2014 and realize that birds are chirping outside the window \u2014 \u201ca light goes on. And now that moment will be so much more accessible,\u201d Dr. Sabin said. Like others in the field, he anticipates that more manufacturers and software developers will follow Apple\u2019s lead.\n\u201cThe way the F.D.A. works, once the first company is through the door, being the second one is so much easier,\u201d Dr. Sabin said.\n\u201cWe expect lots of other companies will also introduce hearing aid features in their earbuds,\u201d he added. (In his day job, Dr. Sabin is an engineer at Bose, whose technology is already used in a brand of O.T.C. hearing aids.)\nThe F.D.A. said it couldn\u2019t disclose details of pending product applications.\nConcern about older Americans\u2019 hearing reflects a wave of research showing how crucial it is to physical and cognitive health. In 2020, a Lancet commission identified untreated hearing loss as the single greatest potentiallymodifiable risk factor for dementia.\nLast year, researchers reported that among study participants who were older and less affluent, and thus more at risk,hearing aid use slowed the rate of cognitive declineby 48 percent over three years. Untreated hearing loss also increases the risks ofsocial isolationanddepression, and it is associated withfalls.\nSo why haven\u2019t more older Americans embraced over-the-counter hearing aids?\nPrice remains a factor. The F.D.A. has authorized 10 brands of better-quality hearing aids (labeled \u201cself-fitting\u201d) in the last two years, and they usually run $800 to $1,000. Traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover hearing aids, and although some Medicare Advantage plans provide hearing benefits, beneficiaries still wind uppaying most of the tabthemselves.\nBeyond the high prices, \u201cwe know consumers are still confused about the choices out there and whom to see and when,\u201d said Bridget Dobyan, the executive director of the Hearing Industries Association, which is the main lobbying organization for hearing aid manufacturers.\n\u201cWhen you type in \u2018O.T.C. hearing aids\u2019 on Amazon, hundreds of products come up, and some of them cost $1,000 and some cost $100,\u201d said Dr. Reed. \u201cHow is a consumer supposed to navigate this market?\u201d\nDevices not identified as \u201cself-fitting\u201d are registered with the F.D.A., but manufacturers don\u2019t have to submit evidence of their real-world effectiveness. Those that cost less than $250 \u201care probably junk,\u201d Dr. Sabin said.\nThough consumers can\u2019t try the new software yet, Apple is \u201ca well-known, trusted company\u201d with global brand awareness, Dr. Reed added. That might induce more people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss \u2014 the cohort the Apple software is intended for \u2014 to become de facto hearing aid owners.\nAnother advantage: Earbud use isn\u2019t age-specific, possibly reducing the stigma of conventional hearing aids. Nobody will know whether an earbud wearer is listening to Arcade Fire or trying to understand a conversation.\n\u201cPeoplewantto wear AirPods \u2014 my kids would want them,\u201d Dr. Reed said. \u201cThat attitude shift is a big deal.\u201d\nIt might also encourage earlier use, he added, since \u201cyou can start using something every now and then in your 40s and 50s, before you really need it in your 60s and 70s,\u201d when hearing loss accelerates.\nAirPods-as-hearing-aids will have disadvantages, too. They won\u2019t be as powerful or sophisticated as prescription aids, and they are not intended for those with severe hearing loss. They won\u2019t work for all-day wear, either. \u201cYou\u2019d have to use them episodically,\u201d Dr. Sabin said.\nAnother potential downside of using the AirPods Pro 2: It can take several weeks to adjust to a hearing aid. Apple requires returns within 14 days, and it also charges a fee to replace lost AirPods, which is not an uncommon problem. Other makers of self-fitting O.T.C. devices have varying return policies, but several allow 45 days and their warranties may cover loss or damage replacement (typically for an additional charge).\nAlso, the Hearing Aid feature requires a later-model iPhone, which will cost $800 to $1,200, or iPad, which costs between $349 and $999.\nPeople with mild to moderate hearing loss who aren\u2019t already Apple product owners could buy prescription hearing aids at Costco instead, where devices start at $1,500 and have better warranty and return policies.\nStill, advocates who for years have pushed for more accessible and affordable hearing aids sound genuinely excited.\n\u201cThis is what we were hoping for \u2014 technological innovation,\u201d said Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America. \u201cWhen Apple makes a splash, it pushes the idea of hearing health into the mainstream.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Booking a table for two atTao Downtown, I hesitated when I got to the box asking whether I had a special request. I did, but I wasn\u2019t sure how it would go down. Would I be the first customer in history to ask for a noisy table?\nThis is not a normal ask, but I had my reasons. Recently I\u2019d been trying to find out whether the way to hear and be heard in a dining room filled with booming speakers and screaming diners might be as simple as wearing a pair of earbuds. To put it to the test, I needed something I usually try to avoid: a hellishly loud restaurant.\nAs you may have heard, Apple announcedlast monththat it would soon introduce new software enabling its AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to act asover-the-counter hearing aidsfor mild to moderate hearing loss, adjustable to your own ears. (You will be able to take a simple exam from Apple on your device, or upload the findings of one given by an audiologist.)\nWhat you may not know is that the AirPods Pro 2 already come with a setting that can turn up the volume on the voices of people you\u2019re talking to and another one that tamps down background noise. Other earbud makers, including Sony, Samsung, Beyerdynamic and Soundcore, also offer functions meant to make conversation easier in noisy places. AirPods outsell them all, though, which is why I wore a pair to Tao and several other Manhattan restaurants known to wreak mayhem on the eardrums.\nOver my12 years as a restaurant critic, few problems I wrote about drew as many emails and comments as noise, and no issue came anywhere close to sparking as much white-hot rage. When I admitted thatI like loud restaurants, up to a point, many readers were angry with me. They were even angrier with restaurants.\nI get it. Long exposures to loud noise can cause hearing damage. Even at less brutal volumes, not being able to hear the other people at the table is maddening. Not being heard \u2014 having to repeat yourself and raise your voice until you sound as if you\u2019re in a screaming match \u2014 is worse. All this is more punishing for people with any amount of hearing loss. Drowning in an angry sea of background noise, most of us finally give in to helplessness. We seethe, silently.\nBefore taking my Apple-white AirPods out to dinner, I tested them in a makeshift home laboratory. I sat in a chair with bookshelf speakers on either side of my head loudly blaring \u201cMetal Machine Music,\u201d Lou Reed\u2019s room-clearing experiment in crunching guitar dissonance. Several feet in front of my face I set a third speaker, tuned to \u201cThe Brian Lehrer Show\u201d on WNYC, on which a botanistwas being interviewedabout fall foliage.\nIn the first round, with my naked ears, Lou totally annihilated Brian. For the next round, I stuffed the AirPods into my ears set to what Apple calls Transparency Mode. The point of Transparency Mode is to allow the ambient noise in, and boy, did it ever. 2-0, Lou.\nThen came the real experiment. Still in Transparency Mode, I burrowed down into the Accessibility settings until I had toggled the Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction switches to their lime-green On positions. Conversation Boost uses directional microphones to isolate and amplify voices that are directly in front of the listener. Ambient Noise Reduction dampens sound coming from other angles.\nNow the botanist came through loud and clear. Lou\u2019s guitars purred raggedly but semi-quietly, like an asthmatic house cat.\nIn the wild, my earbuds\u2019 performance was less dramatic.\nInside two restaurants on the stretch of the Lower East Side thatsome people call Dimes Square, I ran into a problem I hadn\u2019t expected: The dining rooms weren\u2019t very loud. This is not the usual complaint about Dimes Square, but it was a warm night, and more people were eating outside than in.\nBoth restaurants had also thrown open their windows. This meant that sound waves, instead of bouncing off the glass to bombard the ears of everybody indoors, went sailing out of the room like paper planes.\nEven though the din wasn\u2019t as murderous as I\u2019d hoped, it did lead to a discovery I hadn\u2019t expected. I went with a friend who also owns an AirPods Pro 2 set. Each time he plugged them into his ears and turned down the background noise, he dropped his voice to a murmur, as if he were in a genuinely quiet room. Nice for him, but I could barely hear a word he said \u2014 even with the help of my own AirPods.\nTao Downtown has no windows or outdoor seating. As our host took a right at a reclining Buddha the length of a moving van and led us down the 40-foot staircase to the sunken dining room, I saw full tables everywhere. The music was thumping along. It wasn\u2019t hellishly noisy, but it would do.\nMy AirPods didn\u2019t make the thumping disappear. They helped a lot, though. It was as if I\u2019d dialed the volume down to three from seven or eight. My dinner guest across the table came through clearly. I could hear him without my AirPods, too, but I had to work at it \u2014 leaning forward, watching his lips and making other small efforts that can add up to make a night in a noisy space exhausting.\nThat I could hear him at all was no doubt the result of painstaking planning by Tao\u2019s designers. Building a restaurant where you can talk to your dinner companions is a tricky proposition. Background noise can come from street traffic, subway tracks, air-conditioning, exhaust hoods and subwoofers. The No. 1 enemy of conversation, though, is simply other people.\n\u201cYour biggest source you have to control is the human voice,\u201d said Albert Maniscalco, a partner atCerami & Associateswho has helped massage the acoustics ofUnion Square Cafeand Eataly.\nThe voices you want to hear are in the same frequency range as the ones you don\u2019t, Mr. Maniscalco explained, so there\u2019s constant competition for your ears. This crowding is especially critical in the higher frequencies produced by consonants, those quick bursts of sound that make the difference between, say, \u201cSpain\u201d and \u201cstain.\u201d Your friend\u2019s voice may carry across the table, but crucial bits of information that make her intelligible will be missing, especially as higher frequencies build up around you.\nAnd build they will. People who want to be heard over background chatter will, invariably and often subconsciously, start to vocalize more and more forcefully. This tendency is so well documented that it has a name, the Lombard effect, and it is not unique to humans. It has been studied in cats, canaries, marmosets, bats, frogs and beluga whales.\nBraxton Boren, an associate professor of audio technology at American University,has described the Lombard effectin crowded rooms as a version of what social scientists call the tragedy of the commons, the tendency of people to overuse a shared, finite resource until they spoil it.\nInMr. Boren\u2019s analogy, the resource is peace and quiet. Diners in a crowded restaurant probably know that they have a shared interest in keeping the volume down to a conversation-friendly level. But they also want to be heard, even when it means talking too loudly. Self-interest wins out over the common good.\n\u201cEvery person who gets a little louder is a betrayal of our common pact to stay quiet,\u201d Mr. Boren said.\nThe two standard ways to prevent the tragedy are regulation and privatization. We might all agree to speak more quietly in restaurants \u2014 a form of social regulation. \u201cBut the mechanics of the Lombard effect make it very unlikely that a group of people will do this for any length of time,\u201d he said.\nThe other answer is to privatize parts of the commons. In a restaurant, Mr. Boren said, this could mean installing booths with partitions that block some of the noise coming from the big, shouty table in the center of the room. But he is also intrigued by hearing aids and earbuds with directional microphones. In effect, they allow the wearer to stake out a personal quiet zone inside a loud space.\nA couple on a date with tiny speakers plugged into their ears may strike us as unromantic, but it shouldn\u2019t if it helps them talk to each other. Diners have different hearing abilities and different ideas of a good time. My signal may be your noise, and vice versa. The restaurant that can please all sets of ears does not exist.\nSo why aren\u2019t more people tweaking the volume of crowded rooms to their own preference? In the case of AirPods, one answer may be that Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction are so well buried in the settings that each time I wanted to switch them on, it was like crawling through a heating duct in the ceiling.\nBoth functions are nested inside the Accessibility settings, where people who don\u2019t believe they have hearing loss aren\u2019t likely to look. They should become easier to find when the hearing-aid and hearing-test functions are rolled out in the coming weeks.\nBased on my experiments, I would not suggest buying a pair of AirPods Pro 2 just for these features. But if you already own them or one of the other earbuds that have similar settings, I would recommend taking them out for dinner. Even a modest improvement could make the difference between real communication and silent rage. And it\u2019s cheaper than a trip to Stain.\nFollowNew York Times Cooking on Instagram,Facebook,YouTube,TikTokandPinterest.Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice."
