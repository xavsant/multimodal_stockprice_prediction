        "title": "\u2018This Is a New Phase\u2019: Europe Shifts Tactics to Limit Tech\u2019s Power",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 European Union leaders are pursuing a new law to make it illegal for Amazon and Apple to give their own products preferential treatment over those of rivals that are sold on their online stores.\nIn Britain, officials are drawing up a law to force Facebook to make its services work more easily with rival social networks, and to push Google to share some search data with smaller competitors.\nAnd in Germany, authorities are debating a rule that would let regulators essentially halt certain business practices at the tech companies during an antitrust investigation.\nEurope\u2019s lawmakers and regulators have shifted to a new stage in their battle to limit the power of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies. The region has long been at the forefront of using existing antitrust laws andlevying multibillion dollar penaltiesagainst the tech giants, but officials now say that those tactics have not gone far enough in altering the behavior of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. So they are drafting at least half a dozen new laws and regulations to aim at the heart of how those tech companies\u2019 businesses work.\nEurope has embarked on its legal blitz just as the United States has started flexing its own tech regulatory muscles. On Wednesday, the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook were grilled by lawmakers in acongressional hearing to scrutinize their power. Alldefended themselves against criticismfrom Democrats about anticompetitive business practices and accusations from Republicans that they were muzzling conservative voices. On Thursday, all four companiesshowed their financial muscleby reportingbillions of dollars in profitsandsurging revenue.\nThe momentum in the United States is set to grow. The Justice Department is expected to announcean antitrust case against Googlein the coming weeks. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are alsoinvestigating Facebook, Apple and Amazon for potential anti-competitive behavior.\nThose actions, coupled with the efforts in Europe, represent a double whammy for the tech giants. If the proposed laws in Europe are enacted, the policies could lead to a major overhaul of the region\u2019s digital economy, where there are more than 500 million consumers, by regulating the tech companies more like traditional industries such as telecommunications and finance.\n\u201cThis is a new phase,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president who isleading the effort in Brussels to write new laws, said in an interview.\nMs. Vestager said the proposed laws would lower hurdles to force the tech companies to change and even restrict them from moving into new product areas. \u201cAt stake is whether or not these markets will be open and contestable and innovative, or if they will just be governed by these walled gardens of de facto monopolies,\u201d she said.\nEuropean officials are working on the new laws against Big Tech alongside more traditional tactics such as antitrust investigations. European Union officials are investigating whetherApple\u2019s App Storepolicies are anti-competitive, and arepreparing charges against Amazonfor abusing its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals. The European Union is also reviewing Google\u2019s purchase of the wearables maker Fitbit, whileBritain opened an inquiryin June into Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Giphy, a GIF company.\nGoogle, Facebook, Apple and Amazon are closely monitoring Europe\u2019s proposals. While the companies have publicly said they want to work with the region\u2019s lawmakers and regulators, their lobbying groups have argued that Europe\u2019s aggressive actions are partially an effort to protect homegrown industries.\n\u201cPopular tech services are increasingly being developed outside of the E.U.,\u201d said Christian Borggreen, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, an industry group in Brussels. \u201cThe E.U. should strive to become a leader in tech innovation, not just in tech regulation.\u201d\nAmazon, Facebook, Apple and Google declined to comment.\nFor years, Europe set the standard in tech regulation \u2014 only to find that its efforts did not make much of a dent as the tech behemoths continued to grow.\nConsider that the European Commission found Google guilty of antitrust violations three times from 2017 to 2019, resulting in fines of roughly 8.25 billion euros, or about $9.7 billion at current conversion rates. But the cases each took several years to complete, givingGoogle ample time to secure its dominancein online advertising, smartphone software and internet search. The monetary penalties, which are small for a company with more than $160 billion in annual revenue, remain tied up in court appeals.\nOther legal efforts, such as Europe\u2019s landmark privacy law calledthe General Data Protection Regulation, were aimed at many industries and were not just aimed at the tech companies. Since G.D.P.R. was enacted in 2018, it has beenfaulted for lack of enforcement.\nSo over the past year, European regulators and lawmakers began a concerted effort to draw up new laws that specifically homed in on the tech companies\u2019 businesses.\nMuch of the energy came from officials in Brussels, where European Union leaders set policies for the 27-nation bloc. In December, Ms. Vestager, who had already spent five years as the world\u2019s top tech industry watchdog, began a new five-year term leading digital policy and antitrust oversight. She and her colleagues vowed to take aneven harder line.\nThey proposed new rules to make it easier for regulators to begin investigations against the tech companies. One proposed law, the Digital Services Act, would draw more business boundaries for search engines, marketplaces, social networks and app stores. Policymakers are debating barring Amazon, Apple and others from giving their products preferential treatment in their digital stores. Ms. Vestager said there was broad political support for the ideas, which could become law by next year.\nAmong European countries, Britain has become particularly active in moving to rein in the tech giants. Lawmakers are debating the creation of a regulator tofocus on the largest tech companies, holding them to new codes of conduct so they do not use exploitative or exclusionary business practices.\n\u201cWe have crossed a line,\u201d said Andrea Coscelli, the head of Britain\u2019s antitrust agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, which published a400-plus-page reportthis month accusing Google and Facebook of anticompetitive behavior in online advertising. \u201cSomething needs to happen sooner rather than later, and it needs to be done in an intelligent way.\u201d\nMr. Coscelli said the lack of specific tech regulation reminded him of the lax oversight of banks before the 2008 financial crisis. Regulators should treat the tech giants more like formerly state-owned enterprises such as British Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, he said. Starting in the 1980s, those companies were often blocked from practices like bundling new services at reduced prices, or moving into product areas where new companies were emerging. Europe is now considered among the world\u2019s most competitive wireless markets.\nIn Germany, authorities said they were debating rules to restrict how the tech companies use their dominance in one area to enter new markets. In recent years, Apple has leveraged its strength in smartphones and tablets to subsidize its entrance into the video-streaming market, Google has used its search engine to offer travel services and Facebook has offered new e-commerce services off its base of social networking.\n\u201cIf a platform is so big and if a platform has such a powerful position, there are opportunities to abuse this power,\u201d said Andreas Mundt, Germany\u2019s top antitrust regulator.\nIn France, policymakers are debating a new law that would censor hate speech online, making Facebook, YouTube and Twitter legally liable for content posted by users, though the proposalis already facing legal challenges. Germany has adopted a similar proposal, and Britain and the European Union are considering such measures as well. France is also leading an effort with Italy and the European Union to force the tech companies to pay more taxes.\nMany hurdles remain before the proposals become law. Some question whether the regulations would be effective, particularly if they take years to enact. Others said any laws could be watered down during the legislative process as companies pour money into lobbying, or that in a rush to get something done, flawed policy will be put into place.\n\u201cThere is a desire to \u2018go further,\u2019 but European regulators are struggling to define the specific problems they want to fix,\u201d said Joe McNamee, a veteran internet policy consultant in Brussels, who is particularly concerned about new online censorship rules. \u201cBadly designed measures are unlikely to achieve their goals at the same time as creating collateral damage.\u201d\nWilliam E. Kovacic, a professor specializing in antitrust law at George Washington University, said that even if many of the proposals did not become law, the increased scrutiny alone would lead the tech companies to change behavior.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the policeman at your elbow,\u201d he said."

        "title": "The Economy Is in Record Decline, but Not for the Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "A day after lawmakers grilled the chief executives of the biggest tech companies about their size and power, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook reported surprisingly healthy quarterly financial results, defying one of theworst economic downturns on record.\nEven though the companies felt some sting from the spending slowdown, they demonstrated, as critics have argued, that they are operating on a different playing field from the rest of the economy.\nAmazon\u2019s sales were up 40 percent from a year ago and its profit doubled. Facebook\u2019s profit jumped 98 percent. Even though the pandemicshuttered many of its stores, Apple increased sales of all its products in every part of the world and posted $11.25 billion in profit. Advertising revenue dropped for Alphabet, the laggard of the bunch, but it still did better than Wall Street had expected.\n\u201cThe strong continue to get stronger,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAs many companies are falling by the wayside, the tech stalwarts continue to gain muscle and power in this environment.\u201d\nThe tech companies\u2019 financial performance was a remarkable contrast to the overall health of the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the country\u2019s gross domestic productfell 9.5 percent in the second quarterof the year as consumers cut back spending. It was the steepest drop on record.\nCombined, the companies reported $28.6 billion in quarterly net profit, underscoring how regulatory scrutiny remains more background noise and a distraction for them rather than an imminent threat to their businesses.\nOn Wednesday, a congressional antitrust panel questioned the companies\u2019 leaders \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet \u2014 about their market power and business practices.\nIt was part of a broader inquiry by regulators and lawmakers into the dominance of the tech giants, with open investigations from the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.\nThe spectacle of the chief executives of the four companies, worth nearly $5 trillion by market capitalization combined, appearing before a House subcommittee was historic. But antitrust investigations often take years, especially if regulators seek more drastic measures like breaking up companies.\nThe pandemic has reinforced the advantages held by the big tech companies. As consumers stay home, demand for Amazon\u2019s shopping site surged, while companies are turning to its cloud computing products to keep their services up and running. Apple said the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices and use its services.\n\u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. He noted, however, that Apple could have made several billion dollars more if not for the pandemic.\nFacebook and Google continue to be important to marketers and they are weathering the downturn in advertising better than rivals. Facebook shrugged off a spending slowdown, hailing record levels of engagement with its products.\nAlphabet said revenue from Google search ads fell 10 percent \u2014 pushing the company\u2019s overall revenue lower for the first time in the company\u2019s history \u2014 but that still was better than rivals. Last week, Microsoft reported an 18 percent slide in search advertising revenue.\nSince the beginning of March, the companies\u2019 stock prices have risen by an average of 35 percent, compared with a 10 percent rise in the S.&P. 500.\nBuoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping,Amazon had $88.9 billion in quarterly sales, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Profit doubled, to $5.2 billion, even though the company invested in expanding warehouses and other ways to increase capacity.\n\u201cSimply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors.\nIn April, Mr. Bezostoldinvestors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses like temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing, and $300 million for testing its work force for the virus.\nBut even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48 percent.\nOn a call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would give its warehouse workers virus-related bonuses or raises in the current quarter, but added that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter.\nSales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers include major corporations and small start-ups, grew 29 percent, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they had expected.\nFacebook\u2019s revenue for the second quarter rose 11 percent from a year earlier to $18.7 billion, while profits jumped 98 percent to $5.2 billion. The results were well above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.\nDespite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions aboutits role in subverting electionsand how people use the platform to spread misinformation, neither users nor advertisers have shown an inclination to stop using Facebook.\nMore than three billion people now regularly come to Facebook or one of its family of apps, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day.\nThe company said its number of monthly active users rose 12 percent from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of shelter-in-place orders around the world.\nIn late June, a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook toreduce their spendingbecause of issues with hate speech on the site.\nFacebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July and warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could eventually hurt Facebook\u2019s bottom line.\nDespite the globaleconomic slowdown, people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.\nApple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.\nSales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which include Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations inthe United StatesandEurope.\nEven the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, had a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.\nApple also announced a stock split on Thursday that would quadruple its number of shares, allowing people to buy a share in the company for a quarter of the current stock price, which closed at $384.76 on Thursday.\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. The company posted revenue of $38.3 billion and a profit of $6.96 billion \u2014 significantly higher than what Wall Street analysts had predicted.\nRuth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said advertising revenue \u201cgradually improved\u201d as the quarter went on. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside Google\u2019s search results, but the company\u2019s efforts to diversify its business paid off as revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud computing business grew.\nWhen asked in a call with financial analysts about the congressional hearing, Mr. Pichai said the company would have to learn to live with the investigations.\n\u201cThe scrutiny is going to be here for a while and we\u2019re committed to working through it,\u201d he said."

        "title": "I Tried to Live Without the Tech Giants. It Was Impossible.",
        "fulltext": "The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple were called before a House antitrust committee this week, ostensibly to answer questions about whether they have too much power and whether that hurts consumers.\nThe tech bosses, who appeared via videoconference, fended off questions about being \u201ccyber barons,\u201d saying they have plenty of competition and that consumers have other options for the services they offer.\nBut do they? Last year, in an effort to understand just how dependent we are on these companies, I didan experimentfor the tech news site Gizmodo to see how hard it would be to remove them from my life.\nTo do that wasn\u2019t easy. From my years writing about digital privacy, I knew these companies were in the background of many of our online interactions. I worked with a technologist named Dhruv Mehrotra, who designed a custom tool for me, a virtual private network that kept my devices from sending data to or receiving data from the tech giants by blocking the millions of internet addresses the companies controlled.\nThen I blocked Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, one by one \u2014 and then all at once \u2014 over six weeks. Amazon and Google were the hardest companies to avoid by far.\nCutting Amazon from my life meant losing access to any site hosted by Amazon Web Services, the internet\u2019s largest cloud provider. Many apps and a large portion of the internet use Amazon\u2019s servers to host their digital content, and much of the digital world became inaccessible when I said goodbye to Amazon, including the Amazon Prime Video competitor Netflix.\nAmazon was difficult to avoid in the real world as well. When I ordered a phone holder for my car from eBay, it arrived in Amazon\u2019s signature packaging, because the seller used \u201cFulfillment by Amazon,\u201d paying the company to store and ship his product.\nWhen I blocked Google, the entire internet slowed down for me, because almost every site I visited was using Google to supply its fonts, run its ads, track its users, or determine if its users were humans or bots. While blocking Google, I couldn\u2019t sign into the data storage service Dropbox because the site thought I wasn\u2019t a real person. Uber and Lyft stopped working for me, because they were both dependent on Google Maps for navigating the world. I discovered that Google Maps hada de facto monopolyon online maps. Even Google\u2019s longtimecritic Yelpused it to tell computer users where businesses could be found.\nI came to think of Amazon and Google as the providers of the very infrastructure of the internet, so embedded in the architecture of the digital world that even their competitors had to rely on their services.\nFacebook, Apple and Microsoft came with their own challenges. While Facebook was less debilitating to block, I missed Instagram (which Facebook owns) terribly, and I stopped getting news from my social circle, like the birth of a good friend\u2019s child. \u201cI just assume that if I post something on Facebook, everyone will know about it,\u201d she told me when I called her weeks later to congratulate her. I tried out an alternative called Mastodon, but a social network devoid of any of your friends isn\u2019t much fun.\nApple was hard to leave because I had two Apple computers and an iPhone, so I wound up getting some radical new hardware in order to keep accessing the internet and making phone calls.\nApple and Google\u2019s Android software have a duopoly on the smartphone market. Wanting to avoid both companies, I wound up getting a dumb phone \u2014 a Nokia 3310 on which I had to relearn the fine art of texting on numerical phone keys \u2014 and a laptop with a Linux operating system from a company called Purism that is trying to create \u201can ethical computing environment,\u201d namely by helping its users avoid the tech giants.\nYes, there arealternativesfor products and services offered by the tech giants, but they are harder to find and to use.\nMicrosoft, which is not in the antitrust hot seat this time around butknows what it feels like, was easy to block on the consumer level. As my colleagueSteve Lohr notes, Microsoft is \u201cmainly a supplier of technology to business customers\u201d these days.\nBut like Amazon, Microsoft has a cloud service, and so a few sites went dark for me, as did two Microsoft-owned services I used frequently, LinkedIn and Skype. Not being able to use tech giant-owned services I love was a hazard of this experiment: As TheWall Street Journalnoted, the tech giants have bought more than 400 companies and start-ups over the last decade.\nCritics of the big tech companies are often told, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the company, don\u2019t use its products.\u201d My takeaway from the experiment was that it\u2019s not possible to do that. It\u2019s not just the products and services branded with the big tech giant\u2019s name. It\u2019s that these companies control a thicket of more obscure products and services that are hard to untangle from tools we rely on for everything we do, from work to getting from point A to point B.\nMany people called what I did \u201cdigital veganism.\u201dDigital vegansare deliberative about the hardware and software they use and the data they consume and share, because information is power, and increasingly a handful of companies seem to have it all.\nThere were two very different types of reaction to the story. Some people said that it proved just how essential these companies are to the American economy and how useful they are to consumers, meaning regulators shouldn\u2019t interfere with them. Others, like Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and ex officio member of the House\u2019s antitrust committee, said at the time that the experiment was proof of their monopolistic power.\n\u201cBy virtue of controlling essential infrastructure, these companies appear to have the ability to control access to markets,\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \u201cIn some basic ways, the problem is not unlike what we faced 130 years ago, when railroads transformed American life \u2014 both enabling farmers and producers to access new markets, but also creating a key chokehold that the railroad monopolies could exploit.\u201d\nIf I were still blocking the tech giants today, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch this week\u2019s antitrust hearing online. C-SPAN streamed it live via YouTube, which Google owns.\nAfter the experiment was over, though, I went back to using the companies\u2019 services again, because as it demonstrated, I didn\u2019t really have any other choice."

        "title": "Lawmakers, United in Their Ire, Lash Out at Big Tech\u2019s Leaders",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The chief executives ofAmazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, four tech giants worth nearly $5 trillion combined,faced withering questionsfrom Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on Wednesday for the tactics and market dominance that had made their enterprises successful.\nFor more than five hours, the 15 members of an antitrust panel in the House lobbed questions and repeatedly interrupted and talked over Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google.\nIt was the first congressional hearing for some time where Democrats and Republicans acted as if they had a common foe, though for different reasons. Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying start-ups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors, while Republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.\n\u201cAs gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d\nIn response, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Cook and Mr. Bezos, who testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned their companies into giants.\n\u201cWe approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\u201d said Mr. Cook at the outset of his testimony.\nNot sinceMicrosoft stood trial in the late 1990sfor antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for the power of their businesses. With echoes of the trustbusting of U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and AT&T in 1984, the hearing underlined the government\u2019s recognition that this cohort of tech companies \u2014 which wield immense control over commerce, communications and public discourse \u2014 had become the new trusts of the internet age.\nPresident Trump also used the event to rail against tech power. In apost on Twitterbefore the hearing began, he said that he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if Congress did not.\nFrom its conception, the House antitrust hearing was set to be a spectacle, lining up four of the world\u2019s most powerful executives \u2014 with two of them among the planet\u2019s richest individuals \u2014 to answer largely hostile questions together. While the joint appearance limited sustained questioning of any one executive, it created a side-by-side image that recalled the1994 congressionalhearing of top American tobacco executives, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive.\nHouse lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech companies in June 2019, made the most of it. Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with the C.E.O.\u2019s own emails, saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Mr. Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect Joseph R. Biden for president.\nIn one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, confronted Mr. Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products. She asked him to answer whether it misused data with a yes or no.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d said Mr. Bezos, appearing rattled.\nYet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that areimperfect for corralling internet firms. Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations \u2014 generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.\nWhile Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law, Representative JimSensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change.Ultimately, Congress doesn\u2019t have the power to break up the companies.\nStill, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected tosoon announce charges against Googleaccusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge of the investigation have said. TheF.T.C. is preparing to question Mr. Zuckerbergunder oath in its investigation of Facebook\u2019s grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.\n\u201cThis is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser to the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.\nRegulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s top trustbuster,recently vowed to take a harder lineon the companies. On Wednesday,Turkey passed legislationgiving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content.\nThe hearing on Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago, when Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple were emblems of national pride for their innovation and growth. But the expanding reach of the four \u2014 which are involved in everything from smartphones to e-commerce to digital payments \u2014 and their stumbles inmisinformation, privacy,election interferenceand labor issues have increasingly raised hackles.\nEven so, the companies have continued growing as more people live their lives online, with all of them expected to post solid financial performances when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.\nThe hearing was made more bizarre by Mr. Bezos, Mr. Cook, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Zuckerberg dialing in remotely using Cisco\u2019s Webex videoconferencing service. Lawmakers \u2014 who mostly appeared in person wearing masks in a House hearing room \u2014 faced empty chairs and a jumbo screen with the faces of the executives, who looked soberly into their cameras.\nLawmakers nonetheless drilled down on key moments when the companies had gained power or allegedly squeezed consumers, competitors and small businesses. They directed most of their questions to Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai, then to Mr. Bezos, according toa tallyby The New York Times. Mr. Cook was asked the fewest questions.\nThe tone of the hearing was set with Mr. Cicilline\u2019s very first question, directed at Mr. Pichai. \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?\u201d Mr. Cicilline asked. Mr. Pichai replied: \u201cMr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\u201d\nMr. Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google\u2019s dominance in search and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within \u201ca walled garden.\u201d He said Google had many competitors for specific categories of search, such as shopping.\nMr. Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook emails where executives discussed the company\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg said that, in fact, Instagram\u2019s success had never been guaranteed and was the result of Facebook\u2019s investment in the product.\nWhen lawmakers asked Mr. Bezos if Amazon had bullied small merchants, he said that it was \u201cnot how we operate the business\u201d \u2014 before being confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller begging him directly for relief.\nIn response to questions about whether Apple favored some app developers over others, Mr. Cook said there were \u201copen and transparent rules\u201d that applied \u201cevenly to everyone.\u201d\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management company that has battled with both Google and Apple over their market power, said the hearing would be irrelevant if the government did not act to rein in the tech giants.\n\u201cWhat we ultimately need is relief. We don\u2019t just need a historic moment. We need this to lead to legislation and regulation and enforcement,\u201d he said.\nBut, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson added, \u201cthankfully I\u2019ve never been more optimistic for that than I am right now.\u201d\ntranscript\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\nToday: The C.E.O.s of the nation\u2019s most influential technology companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook \u2014 are brought before Congress to answer a question. Are they the too powerful and too dominant monopolies of the internet age? My colleague, Cecilia Kang, was in the room.\nIt\u2019s Thursday, July 30.\nCecilia, we are talking just ahead of the start of what is probably the most anticipated hearing in the history of the tech industry. So, just to begin, why is this hearing happening at all?\nThis hearing is happening because there is a recognition across government that these four very powerful and very important companies to the economy have become so dominant that they are harming consumers and harming competition.\nSo Congress has summoned the C.E.O.s of the corporations \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2014 to ask them and interrogate them on their business practices, and find out if these internet giants that have become, in many ways, the new trusts of our economy, if they are harming consumers and competition.\nSo how exactly did we get to this point where these four executives are being summoned before Congress and being forced to confront that question?\nI think you can start with the 2016 presidential election. That really was a wake up call in Washington and across the world, really, about the power of these social media platforms to be used for harm, not just for entertainment and good. The presidential election of 2020 in the United States then really picked up on this feeling of concern.\nI\u2019m deeply concerned right now that the space around companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, is now referred to by venture capitalists as the \u201ckill zone.\u201d\nAnd we saw for the first time a political candidate, Elizabeth Warren, announced her promise to break up big tech.\nBreak those things apart and we will have a much more competitive robust market in America. That\u2019s how capitalism should work.\nThis was the first time that even the real term \u201cbig tech\u201d became sort of part of our lexicon.\nRight, and almost like a kind of epithet.\nAbsolutely.\nYou have criticized a lot of big banks. Today, you\u2019re talking about breaking up big tech. Why?\nSo here\u2019s the deal. We need real competition in this field. And there\u2019s a problem.\nAnd there was a domino effect after that.\nSo I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook \u2014\nDonald Trump \u2014\n\u2014 they\u2019re really treading on very, very troubled territory. And they have to be careful. It\u2019s not fair to large portions of the population.\nI\u2019m also really disappointed in a lot of the tech companies.\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders \u2014\nI think we need vigorous antitrust legislation in this country.\n\u2014 all articulated similar concerns about big tech.\nThey have incredible power over the economy, over the political life of this country in a very dangerous sense.\nSoon after, the ground moved underneath the technology companies in Washington. In the span of one week in June 2019, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys generals all announced that they had opened investigations into the biggest technology companies. It was unprecedented. These companies have not been investigated, except for Google, on antitrust grounds before in the United States. And beyond that, it was a real recognition to put these four companies into a cohort.\nI wonder if you can briefly walk us through how each of these companies\u2019 behavior has gotten them to this point, into this hearing room. Because these four companies are all big and they\u2019re all tech, but they\u2019re actually all pretty different, right? So what exactly has each done that people during this hearing are going to be confronting them about?\nSo, in the case of Amazon, the accusation is that it is both a retailer and it is a platform for third-party sellers \u2014 in other words, another small business that might sell, let\u2019s say, a face mask or tissue paper \u2014 that will sell their goods on Amazon. And the accusation is that Amazon abuses its position and its clout to make sure that their own products will always perform better than these third parties. And they also use the data and the intelligence they have to suppress and to charge these third-party sellers more.\nIn the case of Apple, the accusation is that it unfairly uses its clout over the App Store. The App Store is huge. It has more than a million apps on it. And it uses its power over the platform to block rivals and to force the apps that are on the App Store to pay high commissions.\nIn the case of Facebook, the accusation is that it is a monopoly in social networking and that it has acquired rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain its monopoly. And in the process, really killed off competition on the internet.\nIn the case of Google, the accusation is that it uses its dominant position in search and online advertising, and in the Android smartphone market, to crush rivals and to continue to maintain its dominance in all of those marketplaces.\nSo the common theme here is size, dominance and basically, monopolistic conduct.\nYeah, and I would say that they are different companies, and they do have different business models. But the one thing I would say they have in common is that they are gatekeepers. They are actually the chokepoints on the internet, because they control commerce, and they control communications, and they control the discovery of information on the internet. These are sort of unprecedented in their scope. And they\u2019re global. Everyone around the world uses them.\nSo, listening to you talk about this hearing \u2014 the stakes of it, the questions around influence and conduct \u2014 I am inevitably reminded of \u2014\nI\u2019d like to ask our guests to please take your seats.\n\u2014 what was probably the most famous congressional hearing of my lifetime, which was the tobacco industry hearings of 1994.\nFor the first time ever, the chief executive officers of our nation\u2019s tobacco companies are testifying together before the United States Congress.\nAnd of course, tobacco, smoking, health are different than technology. But it was a moment when the top executives of billion dollar companies, and very powerful companies in the economy \u2014\nThe truth is that cigarettes are the single most dangerous consumer product ever sold.\n\u2014 were summoned before Congress and really held to account in a highly public way.\nI similarly see the comparison to the tobacco hearings. I mean, this is the moment when you have the heads, the captains of the biggest companies in technology, just like we saw the heads, the captains of the biggest companies of the tobacco industry, have to come before Congress \u2014\nIf you raise your right hand.\n\u2014 stand up \u2014\nDo you swear \u2014\n\u2014 raise their right hand, swear in \u2014\n\u2014 the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\n\u2014 and really defend themselves as companies that are potentially harmful to society.\nHm.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to just go down the row. Yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?\nI believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.\nMr. Johnston.\nUh, Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction. There is no intoxication.\nWe\u2019ll take that as a no, and again \u2014\nThe moment of reckoning is similar for the tech industry in the way that that was a moment of reckoning for the tobacco industry.\nAnd of course, in that case, those tobacco hearings, they were the beginning of very serious changes in how the United States regulated tobacco companies. There were big reforms. There were big fines. It was a turning point. And if this hearing ends up feeling like a turning point for the technology industry, I wonder what the basis for whatever regulation flows from this would be.\nThe hearing is going to be a real test of whether antitrust laws and competition laws that were first created in 1890 can actually apply to internet companies, where the companies of Silicon Valley are just so different than rail, sugar, steel \u2014 the trusts that, at that time, were the inspiration for trust busters like Theodore Roosevelt and others that were trying to contain the power of the big industrialists at that time. So a lot of the conventional tests that have been used on whether a company has violated antitrust laws may not apply.\nAnd one of the biggest tests is this test known as the consumer welfare test. This is a standard that\u2019s been used for about 40 years now and very much permeates antitrust thinking in this country. And that question is, are consumers harmed? It\u2019s really hard to prove harm with a company like Google or Facebook, when they can say, well, at the end of the day, our products are free. And at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t like us, we\u2019re one click away from an alternative.\nMm. Well, this is going to be an interesting hearing.\nIt certainly will.\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nHi, this is Cecilia Kang. It is noon. I am in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing room in the Rayburn Building. Right now, we have some lawmakers, and many of their aides are shuffling in, all with their face masks on. And there is, in the middle of the room, which would normally be about five rows of chairs very tightly packed together, they\u2019re all spread apart, about six feet each. It\u2019s an odd scene.\nThere\u2019s a lot of cleansing of desks and microphones. We have right now a cleanup crew coming in with their gloves and face masks, cleaning off the microphones with some alcohol, and everybody being handed Purell and hand wipes. So that\u2019s the scene a few minutes before we begin.\nThe subcommittee will come to order.\nSo Cecilia, tell us how this hearing starts on Wednesday.\nSo the hearing started just a little bit late, about one hour late. And the lawmakers, 15 of them, looked towards the back of the room at a big jumbotron type screen from their dais. And they saw the faces of the C.E.O.s streamed from the homes and offices of Silicon Valley and presumably Seattle with Jeff Bezos. And \u2014\nWill you please unmute your microphones and raise your right hands? Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you ought to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge?\n\u2014 after Chairman Cicilline gavels in the hearing, he begins to ask the C.E.O.s to introduce themselves.\nAnd Cecilia, I found these introductions, these five-minute kind of testimonials, surprisingly personal.\nI think the C.E.O.s really wanted to accomplish a lot in these opening remarks.\nThank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the subcommittee. I was born into great wealth, not monetary wealth, but it is said the wealth of a loving family.\nYou heard Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai in particular really emphasize their humble roots.\nMy mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque. Being pregnant in high school was not popular.\nI didn\u2019t have much access to a computer growing up in India. So you can imagine my amazement when I arrived in the U.S. for graduate school and saw an entire lab of computers to use whenever I wanted.\nThey are known as the richest individuals in the world, and that\u2019s certainly the case with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. And I think they wanted to be more relatable. Each of these companies wanted to start off, right off the bat, by explaining how they were scrappy for so long, and they continue to have that scrappy spirit. And then, in some cases, they aren\u2019t monopolies.\nMany of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users. Some are upstarts, but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their app stores to compete with them.\nAnd that, in fact, there\u2019s competition all over the world.\nAnd history shows that if we don\u2019t keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today. And that change can often happen faster than you expect.\nSo they wanted to set a line early on to just dispel the notion that there is a big tech kind of threat right now in our economy, and that they, as individual companies, are part of a very vibrant, competitive marketplace that\u2019s changing very quickly.\nSo then we get to the questions from lawmakers to these four C.E.O.s. And what do you think characterize those questions overall?\nWell, it was fascinating, Michael. The Democrats and Republicans were very much split in their approaches.\nSo my first question, Mr. Pichai, is why does Google steal content from honest businesses?\nRight off the bat, the Democrats launched into very specific questions about antitrust, and the antitrust cases against each of these companies.\nMr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\nThey really used this opportunity to show off the most damning evidence that they had collected over 13 months, the hundreds of hours of interviews that they\u2019ve held with employees and rivals.\nConservatives are consumers, too.\nThe Republicans were very coordinated as well on one particular message.\nCensorship of conservative viewpoints \u2014\nThey believe that tech companies represented are so powerful that they\u2019re censoring public discourse. They\u2019re censoring speech.\nYou know, I\u2019m concerned that the people who manage the net \u2014 and the four of you manage a big part of the net \u2014 and are ending up using this as a political screen.\nI was wondering throughout that line of questioning, Cecilia, is there a case that the Republicans focusing on this idea of conservative bias kind of is related to anti-trust \u2014 that ultimately, these companies have a monopoly on the market of ideas? Or, is this really just Republicans using this opportunity, this face time with these executives, to focus on political grievances, and kind of ignoring the intention of this hearing?\nI do think that there\u2019s a sincere belief that antitrust is related to their concerns about censorship. Because they believe that the companies have become so powerful, the social media companies, and that they have, right now, the biggest marketplace of ideas and the biggest exchanges of information. And so they see the problem of censorship as a symptom of companies that are too big and powerful.\nMm-hmm, that\u2019s interesting. But we didn\u2019t really see much Republican focus on the more traditional idea of antitrust, meaning a business has gotten so big that it\u2019s hurting kind of all consumers, and it\u2019s anti-competitive to other businesses. Is that an indication that the Republicans are less concerned about big tech as an economic threat than Democrats are?\nYeah, I was surprised actually by how little the Republican side went into the specific debates on antitrust around these companies. And you did hear, for example, James Sensenbrenner, who is the ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee, say that \u2014\nI think the law\u2019s good.\n\u2014 actually, right now, the market should work itself out.\nAnd we don\u2019t need to throw it all in the wastebasket.\nAnd that things are OK right now. The laws do not need to change.\nLet me ask Mr. Bezos. You know, say you are required to spin stuff off so you might have no more of a one-stop shop. How are the consumers helped by that?\nAnd said that this test \u2014 the consumer welfare standard, this test that whether prices go up and if there are fewer options for consumers \u2014 that should remain the big test for even big tech and these tech companies.\nSir, thank you. They would not be.\nRight.\nVery clear.\nRight, he said the laws don\u2019t need to change \u2014\n\u2014 of enforcement of those anti-trust laws \u2014\n\u2014 but that enforcement does.\nIndeed. He said that enforcement is appropriate. The laws just simply don\u2019t need to change. And also, we should be careful, he said. In his words, he said, being big \u2014\nBeing big is not inherently bad.\n\u2014 doesn\u2019t inherently mean that you\u2019re bad.\nOK, so let\u2019s talk about the most memorable exchanges involving each company when the focus was on the more traditional aspects of antitrust and the evidence that had been dug up in the course of this investigation. Did they focus these lines of questioning on what you had predicted? For example, Facebook, you had said, was going to be asked about its tendency to buy up competitors. Is that what happened?\nI definitely expected the issue of buying up competitors to come up. What I did not expect is the level of specificity that was included in the line of questioning.\nAnd thank you, John. I now recognize the distinguished chair of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler from New York.\nI was really surprised, for example, that Jerry Nadler \u2014\nMr. Zuckerberg, I want to thank you for providing this information during our investigation.\n\u2014 brought up and read directly from emails from the top executives at Facebook during the time when they wanted to purchase Instagram.\nHowever, the documents you provided tell a very disturbing story.\nAnd quoted from these emails the intent to, for example, neutralize competitors \u2014\nYou have written that Facebook can likely always just buy any competitive startups.\n\u2014 and the concern articulated in these emails \u2014\nWhen Facebook contemplated acquiring Instagram, a competitive startup, you told your C.F.O. that the nascent Instagram could be very disruptive to us. And in the weeks leading up to the deal \u2014\n\u2014 that Instagram was going to be a big threat.\n\u2014 saying that, quote, \u201cInstagram can meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business.\u201d\nAnd Mark Zuckerberg responded by saying \u2014\nYes, I\u2019ve been clear that Instagram was a competitor.\n\u2014 well, yes, Instagram is a competitor. And we clearly thought they\u2019re our competitor. And by the way \u2014\nI think the F.T.C. had all of these documents and reviewed this and unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition.\n\u2014 the F.T.C. in 2011 approved this merger. So let\u2019s be clear that this has been vetted by the federal government. He also said that if not for Facebook and the resources that Facebook had, Instagram perhaps would not be the company it is today, the app that it is today, which is a wildly popular global app. And Jerry Nadler responded to that \u2014\nMr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re making my point.\n\u2014 I think you\u2019re proving my point. He\u2019s saying, you do take nascent competitors, and you gobble them up. And then you turn them into important parts of the Facebook ecosystem. But those are really interesting exchanges, in particular because they were so specific, and they were taking the words of the executives in these emails and in these documents straight back to the executives, and asking them directly to respond and defend themselves. And that was something that these executives aren\u2019t used to having to do, and certainly not in front of the public.\nOK, let\u2019s move on to Google. You had predicted that Google would be asked about the downside of its dominance in search. Is that what happened?\nYes, David Cicilline asked Sundar Pichai about his search practices. He said \u2014\nWe heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen content to build your own business.\n\u2014 you steal content. You surface search results that aren\u2019t necessarily the best search results, but that are the best search results for you and your services.\nThese are consistent reports. And so, your testimony that that doesn\u2019t happen is really inconsistent with what we\u2019ve learned during the course of the investigation.\nAnd you steal content from companies specifically like Yelp, which is a restaurant review site. And you use that content to help lift and benefit other Google services. David Cicilline\u2019s accusation was that Google has a walled garden of all kinds of services, and they just want users to be on their services as much as possible. And as a consequence of that, any rival is either being used or being blocked entirely from this important gateway, which is this Google search engine.\nAnd I noticed that when the chairman tried to press the C.E.O. of Google on, for example, this allegation of stealing content from Yelp \u2014\nMr. Pichai, isn\u2019t that anti-competitive?\n\u2014 the C.E.O. of Google did not respond.\nSundar Pichai, throughout his whole testimony, was very reserved.\nCongressman, you know, when I run the company, I\u2019m really focused on giving users what they want. We conduct ourselves to the highest standard.\nAnd often, he did not reply to specific accusations. And that was the case this time as well.\nHappy to engage and understand the specifics and answer your questions further.\nHe was deflecting.\nAnd on Amazon, Cecilia, you had said that Jeff Bezos would be challenged about the way that company treats third party vendors. How did that play out?\nSeveral lawmakers questioned Jeff Bezos about its treatment of third party vendors.\nDoes Amazon ever access and use third-party seller data when making business decisions? And just a yes or no will suffice, sir.\nI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no.\nRepresentative Lucy McBath \u2014\nAnd we\u2019ve interviewed many small businesses, and they use the words like \u201cbullying,\u201d \u201cfear,\u201d and \u201cpanic\u201d to describe their relationship with Amazon.\n\u2014 aired the recording from one of her constituents in her district who was a bookseller on Amazon.\nAnd as we grew, we were shrinking Amazon\u2019s market share in the textbooks category.\nAnd this bookseller was delisted from the marketplace.\nSo now in retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling.\nAnd in this recording, we heard the bookseller talk about how being delisted essentially crippled her business entirely.\nWe haven\u2019t sold a single book from the past 10 months. We were never given a reason. Amazon didn\u2019t even provide us with a notice as to why we were being restricted. There was no warning. There was no plan.\nWhat did that anecdote, that audiotape, illustrate about Amazon and this question of antitrust?\nI think it demonstrated that Amazon is so big.\nDo you think this is an acceptable way to treat someone that you described as both a partner and a customer?\nAnd it spoke to the fact that Amazon, in a way, has become its own economy.\nNo, congresswoman, and I appreciate you showing me that anecdote.\nYou could say the same thing with Apple, too, and its App Store. There are so many other companies that depend on these economies and platforms, if you will, for their livelihoods. And in a way, they become their own subeconomies. All four of them, actually.\nMm-hmm. You just mentioned Apple. And it was your prediction that this hearing would be about the App Store and not much else. Was that true?\nThat was the case. With Apple, Tim Cook was asked about Apple\u2019s control over its App Store. And Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, asked Tim Cook \u2014\nMr. Cook, does Apple not treat all app developers equally?\n\u2014 if he treated all apps fairly. He asked, why is it that developers have to get permission, and why is it that you charge developers 30 percent commission on average for simply operating on iPhones?\nIf you look back at history \u2014\nWhat\u2019s to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent?\nSir, we have never increased commissions in the store since the first day it operated in 2008.\nThere\u2019s nothing to stop you from doing so, is there?\nWhat\u2019s to stop you from raising that commission price? The line of questioning really was about how Apple maintains its monopoly over that App Store and makes sure that it stays ahead of rivals by that dominant gateway position that they have as the controller of App Store.\nSo we had fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially it\u2019s so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.\nAnd Tim Cook really didn\u2019t have a great answer.\nAs a great American Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis once said, \u201cWe must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d This concludes today\u2019s hearing. Without objection, this hearing is adjourned.\n[GAVEL]\nSo let\u2019s talk about how this all went. This was supposed to be big tech\u2019s big tobacco moment, as you said. But Democrats and Republicans were up to two very different things in this hearing. And I\u2019m mindful that lawmakers have been ridiculed in the past for their kind of shallow understanding of technology in hearings like this. And this is for tech companies that are distinctly difficult to understand because of their vastness, pinning down their inner workings. And so, I\u2019m wondering if you think that this did feel like a big tobacco moment. Did this hearing accomplish what lawmakers had intended?\nThis hearing felt like big tech\u2019s big tobacco moment in that, for the first time, the four C.E.O.s of the four biggest technology companies had to defend themselves from accusations that were pretty tough, that presented these companies in a pretty dark and negative light \u2014 as brutal, dominant enterprises that are willing to squash competition and harm consumers along the way to maintain their dominance. In that way, the hearing presented them through a lens that the companies had not before been viewed through by consumers or the public. The hearing really presented the companies as something different than just tech startups. They presented them as big enterprises, very similar to the trusts of the late 1800s and the early 1900s.\nRight.\nAt that time, the same sort of debates were swirling around, whether it was good for U.S. steel or for standard oil to be such sprawling enterprises, and to be such big actors and have so much influence.\nSo where does this leave us now? I mean, this combination of a 13-month investigation, this spectacle of this hearing, what happens next?\nSo that\u2019s the big question, Michael. I think that what you saw was agreement among the Republicans and Democrats that they were angry at these technology companies, and they had a lot of concerns. But where you\u2019re going to see disagreement is what comes next in terms of legislative change, what comes next also in terms of recommendations to enforcement agencies that are actually investigating these companies at this time. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of disagreement as to what the path forward is going ahead.\nWhat does change is that these companies now really can\u2019t shake this image that they have an antitrust problem \u2014 that all of them are, in some way, dominant and have abused their monopoly power to harm competition and potentially to harm consumers as well. And that\u2019s not the kind of tag that any of these companies want attached to them.\n\nIn other words, once you have been tagged as a trust and a monopoly, it\u2019s probably just a question of what the regulatory answer to that is.\nYeah, I think it\u2019s just a question of time.\n\nThank you, Cecilia.\nThank you.\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that more than 150,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the U.S., a new milestone in the pandemic. The death rate, which had briefly fallen over the summer, is now rising in 23 different states, especially in Arizona, South Carolina and Mississippi. On average, the virus has killed 1,000 people a day over the past week alone.\nAnd the governor of Oregon, Kate Brown, said that federal officers would begin to withdraw from the city of Portland today. Under an agreement between the governor and the Trump administration, Oregon state police will provide security for the exterior of the city\u2019s federal courthouse, replacing the federal officers, who had repeatedly clashed with and tear gassed protesters there.\nYou hear all sorts of reports about us leaving. We\u2019re not leaving until they have secured their city. We told the governor, we told the mayor, secure your city.\nEven as the negotiations to leave were underway, President Trump threatened that federal agents would remain in Portland or return there.\nIf they don\u2019t secure their city soon, we have no choice. We\u2019re going to have to go in and clean it out. We\u2019ll do it very easily. We\u2019re all prepared to do it. So in Portland, they either clean out their city and do the job \u2014\n\nThat\u2019s it for \u201cThe Daily.\u201d I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\nReporting was contributed by Jack Nicas, Mike Isaac, Daisuke Wakabayashi, Karen Weise and Kellen Browning."

        "fulltext": "The titans of the tech industry like to think of themselves as solvers of big world problems, and, lately, they\u2019re tripping over themselves to show that they are working to solve a problem for which they, too, are culpable: climate change.\nApple on Tuesday became the latest tech giant to promise to do more to reduce the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases,announcingin a statementthat, by 2030, \u201cevery Apple device sold will have net-zero climate impact.\u201d\nApple said it aimed to reduce emissions by 75 percent in its manufacturing chain, including by recycling more of the components that go into each device and nudging its suppliers to use renewable energy. As for the remaining 25 percent of emissions, the company said it planned to balance them by funding reforestation projects. The company also said it planned to improve energy efficiency in its operations.\nForests absorb carbon dioxide, and reforestation has become a popular way for companies to offset the greenhouse gas emissions that they produce, including from factories.\nClimate advocates describe these offset efforts as inadequate because they allow emissions to grow at a time when the scientific consensus demands that emissions be cut in half by 2030 in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change \u2014 and be reduced to zero by 2050.\nSeparately on Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it wouldrequire its suppliers to report their emissions, as a first step toward making reductions.\nLike other corporate pledges, both are entirely voluntary.\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a virtuous follow-the-leader thing happening here,\u201d said Simon Nicholson, co-director for the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University.\nHe noted the limitations of the pledge, though. \u201cWhat Apple has signaled here is the beginning of a strategy on the carbon-removal side,\u201d Dr. Nicholson said. \u201cHolding carbon in forests for a year or two isn\u2019t going to cut it. It needs to be held in forests for the long term, which means centuries.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s role in global warming varies from company to company. Amazon, Facebook and Google all use enormous amounts of energy and water for their data centers. Amazon relies on gas-guzzling trucks and packages that themselves have a huge environmental footprint; even recycling uses a lot of energy. And makers of devices \u2014 like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 produce greenhouse gas emissions through their supply chains, which involve contractors that do the actual manufacturing in different parts of the world.\nThe pressure on companies to do something about their climate footprint comes both from within the ranks of their employees and from advocacy groups on the outside.\nNot only are they under scrutiny for the emissions they produce. Internet companies, like Facebook, have been criticized for allowing the spread of disinformation about climate science. Greenpeace took aim at Google, Microsoft and Amazon for using their artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to help oil producers find and extract oil and gas deposits, whichGreenpeace said is \u201csignificantly undermining\u201dthe tech companies\u2019 other climate commitments.\nOne by one, the giants of Silicon Valley have been compelled to address their own role in the climate crisis.\nGoogle said in Mayit would no longer build customized artificial intelligence technology or machine learning algorithms for the oil and gas sector.It has also pledged to include recycled material in its devices, including its popular Chromebook computers, by 2022.\nAmazon announced last September its bid to be carbon-neutralby 2040, while its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, committed $10 billion to fund climate science and advocacy.\nAmazon\u2019s move came after sustained calls from its own employees to reduce emissions to zero by 2030, a full 10 years earlier than the company\u2019s current target. Its employees also pressed Mr. Bezos to stop offering custom cloud-computing services to the oil and gas industry and to suspend campaign donations to politicians who deny climate science.\nAmazon continues to do business with fossil fuel companies, but Mr. Bezos said the company would take a \u201chard look\u201d at its political donations. Amazon said it would reduce itsclimate change impact by, among other things, buying a fleet of 100,000 electric delivery trucks. But, like Apple, Amazon\u2019s pledge to be net-zero by 2040 relies on reforestation projects to offset its continuing emissions. The company has also said it plans to improve energy efficiency in its operations.\nMicrosoft this year said it would draw down more emissions than it adds and also somehowremove all the emissionsthe company has ever produced. It promised to invest $1 billion in what it called climate innovations, but it left untouched its partnerships with oil and gas companies.\nFacebook announced that it would use 100 percent renewable energy in its facilities and reduce water use in its data centers, though it has said little about what it will do to stop the spread of climate disinformation on its platform.\nApple\u2019s net-zero pledge is notable in that it seeks to address the main source of its greenhouse gas emissions: from the manufacturing of its phones, tablets and computers by its contractor companies.\nApple\u2019s statement on Tuesday underscored the need for businesses like it to pivot away from fossil fuels for the sake of its own bottom line. \u201cWe have a generational opportunity,\u201d said Lisa Jackson, a company vice president responsible for environmental issue, \u201cto help build a greener and more just economy, one where we develop whole new industries in the pursuit of giving the next generation a planet worth calling home.\u201d\nElizabeth Jardim, who works on corporate issues at Greenpeace USA, cautiously welcomed the pledge as a step up from the company\u2019s previous commitments, noting in an email that \u201cas with all \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 or \u2018carbon negative\u2019 goals, it is critical to see detailed plans for how the company will pursue deep decarbonization rather than a reliance on offsetting or weak nature-based carbon removal initiatives.\u201d\nMs. Jardim also urged large, profitable companies to throw their weight behind policies like the Green New Deal.\nOn Twitter, Edward Maibach, of the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication,called the Apple pledge\u201ca big step in the right direction, if they make good on it. Next, they should lobby governments worldwide to increase their commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement.\u201d"

        "title": "Google Promises Privacy With Virus App but Can Still Collect Location Data",
        "fulltext": "When Google and Apple announced plans in April forfree softwareto help alert people of their possible exposure to the coronavirus, the companies promoted it as \u201cprivacy preserving\u201d and said itwould not trackusers\u2019 locations. Encouraged by those guarantees,Germany,Switzerlandand other countries used the code to develop national virus alert apps that have been downloaded more than20 million times.\nBut for the apps to work on smartphones with Google\u2019s Android operating system \u2014 the most popular in the world \u2014 users must first turn on the device location setting, which enables GPS and may allow Google to determine their locations.\nSome government officials seemed surprised that the company could detect Android users\u2019 locations. After learning about it, Cecilie Lumbye Thorup, a spokeswoman for Denmark\u2019s Health Ministry, said her agency intended to \u201cstart a dialogue with Google about how they in general use location data.\u201d\nSwitzerland said it had pushed Google for weeks to alter the location setting requirement.\n\u201cUsers should be able to use such proximity tracing apps without any bindings with other services,\u201d said Dr. Sang-Il Kim, the department head for digital transformation at Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Public Health, who oversees the country\u2019s virus-alert app.\nLatvia said it had pressed Google on the issue as it was developing its virus app. \u201cWe don\u2019t like that the GPS must be on,\u201d said Elina Dimina, head of the infectious-disease surveillance unit at Latvia\u2019s Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\nGoogle\u2019s location requirement adds to the slew ofprivacy and security concernswith virus-tracing apps, many of which were developed by governments before the new Apple-Google software became available. Government officials and epidemiologists say the apps can be a helpful complement to public health efforts to stem the pandemic. But human rights groups and technologists have warned that aggressive data collection and security flaws in many apps put hundreds of millions of people at risk for stalking, scams, identity theft or oppressive government tracking.\nNow the Android location issue could undermine the privacy promises that governments made to the public.\nPete Voss, a Google spokesman, said the virus alert apps that use the company\u2019s software do not use device location. That\u2019s including for people who test positive for the virus and use the apps to notify other users. The apps use Bluetooth scanning signals to detect smartphones that come into close contact with one another \u2014 without needing to know the devices\u2019 locations at all.\nSince 2015, Google\u2019s Android system has required users to enable location on their phones to scan for other Bluetooth devices, Mr. Voss said, because some apps may use Bluetooth to infer user location. For instance, some apps use Bluetooth beacons in stores to help marketers understand which aisle a smartphone user may be in.\nOnce Android users turn on location, however, Googlemay determine their precise locations, using Wi-Fi, mobile networks and Bluetooth beacons, through a setting called Google Location Accuracy, and use the data to improve location services. Mr. Voss said apps that did not have user permission could not gain access to a person\u2019s Android device location.\nApple, which does not require iPhone users of the virus apps to turn on location, declined to comment on Google\u2019s location practices.\nThe Android location requirement underscores a troubling power imbalance between governments and two tech giants that dominate the mobile market, some security and privacy experts said. Countries using the software, they said, have little recourse against the new global standards that the companies are setting for public health technology.\nGoogle and Apple, for instance, bar government virus apps using their technology from tracking users\u2019 locations. But Google may determine and use the device locations of Android users of the apps, depending on their settings.\n\u201cWe are giving too much control to two big companies,\u201d saidAlexandra Dmitrienko, a professor of secure software systems at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. \u201cThey are monopolizing it.\u201d\nThe companies\u2019 Bluetooth proximity detection technology springs from ideas developed by Singapore andacademics. It offers public health agencies an alternative to more invasive models that involve tracking users\u2019 fine-grained locations and sending private data like their names to centralized government servers.\nThe Apple-Google software uses rotating ID codes to log close contact between app users \u201ctohelp prevent tracking,\u201d the companies say. It also processes people\u2019s data on their phones \u2014 where governments cannot gain access to it.\n\u201cThis is what we call \u2018privacy by design,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Kim, the Swiss health official. \u201cThat means no personal data, that means no name, no phone number, even no technical identification of the hardware from email or smartphones\u201d are collected by the apps.\nThe privacy-focused design has made the companies\u2019 technology attractive to government leaders.\n\u201cThis app deserves your trust. It protects your privacy,\u201d Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, said in a recentvideo addressabout her government\u2019s Corona-Warn-App, which is based on the Apple-Google model. \u201cNo geodata is collected,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\nBut privacy and security experts said they were troubled that Google\u2019s location practices might deter some people from using public health agency apps during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe point of the Apple-Google exposure notification design is to protect privacy and mitigate barriers to adoption,\u201d saidJonathan Mayer, an assistant professorof computer science and public affairs at Princeton.\nSome Android users in Europe say they feel misled by their governments. Instructions on many of the apps direct Android users to turn on location, for instance,but make no mention of Googleor that users can stop the company from determining their precise locations by turning off the accuracy feature within the location setting.\n\u201cWith this app, you\u2019re invited, by the government strongly appealing to your sense of responsibility and morality, to give away your live location to entities that are getting a profit out of it, in order to protect public health,\u201d said Massimo Zannoni, an electronic engineer in Zurich.\nHealth officials in Denmark, Germany, Latvia and Switzerland said their governments had deliberately designed their national virus alert apps for maximum privacy.\n\u201cNo government, no security agency has any chance to misuse the technology,\u201d Gottfried Ludewig, director general for digitalization and innovation for Germany\u2019s Ministry of Health, said of the Corona-Warn-App, which has been downloaded more than 15.5 million times. He said more than 500 people who tested positive for the virus had used the app to notify other users of possible virus exposure.\nHe added that if Google used location data for any other purpose than enabling the Bluetooth services in the app, it would need legal grounds to do so under European data protection law.\nOthers involved in the German app said it was Google\u2019s issue, not theirs.\n\u201cYou need to ask Google about the specs of their operating system,\u201d Marcus Winkler, a spokesman for SAP, which helped develop Germany\u2019s app, said in an email. \u201cIf you turn on location tracking you get a message from the operating system \u2014 this has nothing to do with the app.\u201d\nProfessor Dmitrienko, the software security expert, said the solution was for governments to push Google to stop requiring Android users of the virus alert apps to turn on location.\n\u201cThey have sufficient power, and they could put pressure even on such giants as Google and Apple to do something about it,\u201d she said.\nAaron Krolik contributed reporting."

        "title": "Four of the World\u2019s Wealthiest Men Are Preparing for Battle",
        "fulltext": "Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Congress\u2019s attention will turn briefly to another matter: world domination. On Wednesday, the chief executives of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, will appear together to defend themselves in a continuing inquiry into their market power by the congressional subcommittee focused on antitrust.\nThe virus\u2019s reach meansMark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Alphabetwill dial into the hearing via video chat, avoiding the glare of photographers, members of Congress and the gallery as they are peppered with questions. While in their home offices, the men also could receive messages from aides about how to respond.\nNonetheless, the one-day hearing, conducted by the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, could give the public a rare glimpse into the inner workings of some of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Panel members are likely to turn a good deal of attention to Mr. Bezos, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, in part because he\u2019s never appeared before Congress. (He initiallytried to avoid itthis time.)\nThe challenge for the subcommittee will be in establishing whether these tech companies \u2014\u00a0which have amassed immeasurable power \u2014 operate as illegal monopolies in certain domains, such as online search (Google), online marketplaces (Amazon), mobile phone app stores (Apple), the dissemination of information (Facebook), advertising sales (Google and Facebook) and mergers and acquisitions.\nIt\u2019s not against the law to be the largest search engine, online marketplace or social media network. But antitrust laws, meant to protect against outsize market power, do not allow companies to suppress competition \u2014 a practice known asexclusionary conduct\u2014 by, for instance, quashing or gobbling up potential rivals. Freed from competition, companies may also cross the line by squeezing suppliers or imposing higher prices on consumers.\nWednesday\u2019s hearing will be the culmination of a roughly yearlong investigation into the businesses\u2019 operations and is likely to be the final public forum before the subcommittee releases its findings, expected in the fall.\nRepresentative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the subcommittee\u2019s chairman, has indicated the tech companies may not like the results, this month calling the companies\u2019 power\u201cterrifying.\u201d\nIt\u2019s up to the subcommittee to help the public understand the breadth of the companies\u2019 power and, potentially, to recommend that regulators break them up or take other action. Also at issue is determining if existing rules are sufficient given the tech companies\u2019 market power and whether the laws should be updated because the companies behave in ways that should be illegal.Here are some questions subcommittee members ought to consider:\nThe subcommittee will probably focus on the company\u2019s relationship with third-party merchants that use the site to sell directly to consumers. Such merchants represent about 60 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales. The company also operates an enormous shipping network, an advertising sales business and a cloud computing service that may raise alarms among regulators. Amazon\u2019s trove of sales data gives it incredibly detailed insights into both customers and merchants.\nAfter aninvestigation by German regulators, Amazon vowed last year to overhaul its contracts with third-party merchants. Did the company adequately do so? Does Amazon have contracts that require lower prices than other retailers\u2019? Does it require exclusivity, meaning merchants cannot offer their goods on other sellers\u2019 websites?\nAn Amazon lawyer told the panel, \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual seller data directly to compete\u201d with other businesses on Amazon\u2019s site. But a Wall Street Journalreportshowed evidence that Amazon does just that, helping it create tailored private-label products that undercut competitors. What is the extent of Amazon\u2019s use of seller data?\nAmazon offers its sellers warehousing and shipping services worldwide. What does it seek in return, beyond a commission? Does Amazon use sales data from small merchants to source new products or to help larger sellers succeed, forcing outsmaller ones?\nIn 2010, Amazondropped diaper priceswell below profitability, in a successful effort to force a competitor, Diapers.com, into acquisition talks. Amazon has since shuttered that site. Does Amazon view such actions as exclusionary? And is the company engaged in other such pricing wars in order to force a competitor to sell?\nA Washington Postinvestigationshowed that Amazon pushes consumers toward its private-label products even when they appear to want to buy name brands. Does Amazon favor its own products in consumers\u2019 searches? Does it require fees or advertising purchases from merchants or brands to ensure their products rise to the top of searches?\nWhile Apple is best known for its iPhones and laptops, it also has healthy competition from companies like Samsung and Lenovo in hardware sales. As a result, Mr. Cook is most likely to be asked about the structure of Apple\u2019s App Store, where millions of software developers offer their apps for download.\nWhy does Apple permit only its own app store on iPhones?\nDevelopers are generally required to offer their in-app purchases and paid subscriptions through Apple\u2019s App Store, rather than on their own websites, where they may avoid Apple\u2019s commissions. Apple hasthreatened to remove appsthat don\u2019t abide. How is this in the best interest of consumers and app developers?\nSome app developers have alleged that Apple uses the detailed data it collects about app downloads tocopy their ideasand that the companyfavors its own appsin searches. Is this true? If so, how does the company defend such practices?\nFacebook\u2019s aggressive acquisition strategy \u2014 including the giants Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014\u00a0makes it vulnerable to a breakup if regulators find that it was trying to rid the market of real competition.\nReportedly, the Federal Trade Commission had documents demonstrating Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 in an explicit bid to stifle a competitor. Were those documents mischaracterized? How did Facebook\u2019s buying Instagram benefit consumers, and how did it determine the$1 billion price?\nBritish lawmakersreleased emailsshowing Facebook used an analytics app to collect detailed data about competitors in order to snuff them out. That helped Facebook decide to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion, the emails show. Couldn\u2019t that be called an abuse of market power? Does Facebook still cull proprietary data on rivals in order to protect its market leadership?\nAdvertisers can target customers on Facebook with incredible accuracy, in part because of the platform\u2019s ability to track users\u2019 internet browsing activity across the web. Shouldn\u2019t users consider those terms onerous? Also, has Facebook made assurances about the privacy of customer data that it later reneged on? What assurances do consumers have that their data will remain private and not be repurposed for Facebook\u2019s benefit?\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Facebook quashed efforts to make its site less politically divisive because partisan content drives more use of the site, which is beneficial to its advertising business. How can suppressing opposing views for users be viewed as anything but an abuse of power?\ntranscript\nThis is me back in my college days. And this is my roommate, Mark. Together, we founded Facebook in 2004. Now, 15 years later, I think Facebook has grown too big and too powerful. Every week brings new headlines about privacy violations, election interference or mental health concerns. I haven\u2019t been at the company in over a decade, but I feel a sense of responsibility to account for the damage done. Americans have the power to right the ship through government action. We need new regulations. It\u2019s time to break up Facebook. The early days of Facebook tell a classic American story of innovation and entrepreneurship. From our college dorm room, we started a little social network for our friends that exploded in popularity and connected the world. Mark\u2019s hustle in those early years made it possible for Facebook to dominate our rivals like Friendster, MySpace, Tumblr and many others. These competitors made us better. And then we beat them out. This is how it\u2019s supposed to work in America. Hard work leads to economic success. You start a small business and compete on the merits to provide a better product. Today, nearly three billion people use Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and they\u2019re all owned and controlled by the same company. Of every dollar spent buying ads on social media, $0.84 goes to Facebook. It\u2019s now worth over half a trillion dollars. That\u2019s roughly the size of the G.D.P. of the bottom 65 countries in the world \u2014 combined. It\u2019s not just that Facebook is a really big social network. It\u2019s everything. When a single company dominates any market, they become susceptible to abusing their power. Social networking is like most other American industries. There used to be plenty of healthy competition. But now many industries are controlled by just one or two companies. Companies often create an illusion of choice. You think there are hundreds of beer brands out there, but they\u2019re all made by one or two companies. Why is this a problem? Well, when companies get too big, they get sloppy and careless, and that leads to things like poor privacy practices, enabling foreign actors to meddle in elections, the spread of violent rhetoric, fake news and the unbounded drive to capture more of our data and attention. I often hear people say, \u201cI\u2019m shutting down my Facebook account. Thank God for Instagram,\u201d not realizing that Instagram is owned by Facebook. People are powerless in this situation because there\u2019s nowhere else to go. Monopolies stifle innovation. Facebook snatches up competitors by buying them before they get too big. Or, by copying their innovations. Despite all the money and hype being poured into new startups, there hasn\u2019t been a single major social media platform launched since 2011. The harm goes beyond he economy though, it goes to democracy itself. When companies become empires, people are stripped of power. Facebook\u2019s employees write complex rules called algorithms that decide what you see in your News Feed. Facebook can decide what messages get delivered and which don\u2019t. And what exactly makes for violent or inappropriate content. Even Mark himself has said that he and the Facebook team have too much power over speech. Facebook does have a board of directors. But Mark owns the majority of the shares. Unlike the leader of a democracy there are no checks and balances on Facebook. Mark has no boss, and he cannot be fired. Listen, it\u2019d be great if Mark can fix this himself. But this, ironically, is a problem he cannot solve. We need the government to intervene with two steps. First, the Facebook empire needs to be broken up. America\u2019s regulated corporate empires before, and we can do it again. This isn\u2019t unprecedented and surprisingly, it often boosts the value of these companies in the long run. The Federal Trade Commission can force Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Then we\u2019ll see real competition around social media and digital messaging. Breaking up Facebook isn\u2019t a punishment for its economic success. It\u2019s a way to guarantee that other new companies can compete. We also need a new government agency to protect Americans from the overreach of Facebook and other companies like it. Think about it. We don\u2019t trust airlines or pharmaceutical companies to regulate themselves. We shouldn\u2019t trust social media companies either. We need basic privacy protections and the ability for people to move their data around as they please. Right now Facebook makes free speech decisions on its own with little accountability. Instead, we need government to set guidelines, not Facebook employees in Menlo Park. I don\u2019t think Mark\u2019s a bad guy and I\u2019ve made this decision to speak out because I feel a sense of responsibility for what Facebook has become. And to be honest, I\u2019m angry that Mark\u2019s obsession with growth led him to sacrifice security for clicks. I think we all want to live in a country where David can take on Goliath, where a kid with a smart idea in a dorm room can start a billion- dollar company. We\u2019ve strayed from that ideal, and breaking up and regulating Facebook will help put us back on that path.\nAlphabet\u2019s signature product, Google, is central to nearly every activity on the web \u2014 and increasingly, many activities off the web as well. It is the dominant search engine by far and operates sprawling advertising and cloud computing businesses. Subcommittee members are likely to home in on how Google\u2019s search business potentially stifles competition by favoring its own services and how YouTube, a Google subsidiary, pushes content to users.\nFrequently, answers to common Google search questions can be found in so-called answer boxes at the top of a results page. Google culls that information from other websites, eliminating the need for users to visit those sites. Doesn\u2019t that starve other websites of valuable traffic? Don\u2019t answer boxes simply buttress Google\u2019s market leadership by stifling competitors?\nGoogle has paid Applebillions of dollarsto be the default search engine on the Safari web browser on iPhones and iPads. How does Google expect rivals to compete on an even playing field if it has cornered such a significant share of the market?\nGoogle controls multiple levers in the process of placing advertisements on the web, including analytics. The company also requires some businesses to use its ad technology if they want to use Google services. How does Google\u2019s ad sales technology benefit advertisers? Why doesn\u2019t Google allow marketers to see what prices others pay to place ads? Doesn\u2019t that stifle bargaining power?\nCritics say YouTubepushes videosthat are politically slanted, based on data about its users, meaning viewers aren\u2019t likely to see competing viewpoints. Is it correct that YouTube\u2019s software is designed to reinforce biases? Other than keeping users on YouTube longer, what is the purpose of that system?\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple Scores Legal Victory Against $14.9 Billion E.U. Tax Demand",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Apple won a major legal victory on Wednesday against European antitrust regulators as a European court overruled a 2016 decision that ordered the company to pay $14.9 billion in unpaid taxes to Ireland.\nThe decision, which can be appealed to the European Union\u2019s top court, is a setback for the region\u2019s efforts to clamp down on what the authorities there believe is anticompetitive behavior by the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Google and Amazon have other court appeals pending as they seek to overturn decisions that they broke European competition laws.\nThe Apple case stems from the company\u2019s use of Ireland as its base for its European operations. In 2016, the European Union\u2019s top competition regulator said Apple hadused illegal deals with the Irish governmentto avoid taxation on profits from the sales of Apple products in the European Union.\nIn 2011, for instance, Apple\u2019s Irish subsidiary recorded European profits of $22 billion, but only about $57 million was considered taxable in Ireland, regulators said.\nThe authorities said the arrangement amounted to an illegal subsidy not available to Apple\u2019s competitors, and ordered Ireland to recover 10 years of back taxes, worth 13 billion euros, or about $14.9 billion at current conversion rates.\nApple and Ireland appealed the judgment, arguing that the structures were consistent with tax laws. Apple called the effective tax rate used by the European regulators \u201ca completely made-up number.\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, called the punishment \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d\nThe appeal has put Ireland in the unusual position of opposing the collection of billions in taxes when its government is facing a budget deficit, a result of emergency spending to respond to the pandemic. The country, which has long faced criticism from other countries for low corporate taxes, argued that its appeal was a defense of Ireland\u2019s independence.\n\u201cIreland has always been clear that there was no special treatment,\u201d Ireland\u2019s Department of Finance said in astatement. \u201cThe correct amount of Irish tax was charged in line with normal Irish taxation rules.\u201d\nApple praised the court\u2019s decision. The company has said that because its products and services are made in the United States, that is where it books much of its taxable income.\n\u201cThis case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, a company spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society.\u201d\nApple has used Cork, Ireland, as its home in Europe since 1980. The company employs about 6,000 people in the country in areas including logistics, distribution and customer support.\nOther American tech giants followed Apple, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, drawn to using an English-speaking country with favorable corporate taxes as a base for operations across Europe. Their large office buildings have taken up parts of Dublin; an area along the city\u2019s canal is known as Silicon Docks.\nThe decision on Wednesday by the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg is a blow toMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s topantitrustenforcer, who for years has been taking aggressive action against the world\u2019s largest technology platforms. It shows that companies she has targeted can sometimes find a more sympathetic audience in courts that can overturn her judgments.\nGoogle is appealing three antitrust decisions brought by Ms. Vestager that amount to fines of about \u20ac8.2 billion, worth $9.4 billion. Amazon is appealing a 2017 ruling that it owes Luxembourg \u20ac250 million in unpaid taxes.\n\u201cThe courts are ready to exercise their judicial review and are not going to take the commission\u2019s assertions for granted,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Lapr\u00e9vote, a lawyer with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in Brussels who specializes in state aid cases.\nIn astatement, Ms. Vestager said her office would \u201ccarefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps.\u201d\n\u201cThe commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she said.\nThe ruling on Wednesday centered on tax law and what constitutes illegal state aid. The court said that the European Commission\u2019s argument was flawed and that regulators were \u201cwrong\u201d to conclude Apple had been granted \u201cselective economic advantage.\u201d\nBased on the decision, Mr. Lapr\u00e9vote said the commission would have a \u201cdifficult but not impossible\u201d task in winning an appeal.\nMs. Vestager has made targeting what she considers unfair tax deals a central part of her leadership of the European Commission\u2019s competition office. In an earlier decision, a court overturned her ruling that Starbucks must repay \u20ac30 million to the Netherlands. The commission did not appeal that decision.\nA broader international debate is underway about how to tax large multinational technology corporations. Several European countries, led by France, have been putting forward digital services taxes that would hit companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\nTheTrump administrationhas threatened to retaliate if European countries move forward with the proposals. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been leading an effort to negotiate a compromise."

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The chief executives of four of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies will appear before Congress this month as part of its sweeping antitrust investigation into their market power, according to the committee running the inquiry, setting up a high-profile face-off between the companies and skeptical lawmakers.\nJeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, will appear at the hearing, said Shadawn Reddick-Smith, a spokeswoman for the House Judiciary Committee, which is said to be nearing the end of its investigation.\nThe date and whether the executives will appear in person or virtually, as has become common during the coronavirus pandemic, are still being discussed, Ms. Reddick-Smith said.\nThe hearing will allow lawmakers to ask the executives about accusations of antitrust abuses at their companies, all of which are the focus of investigations by federal regulators or state attorneys general. The executives are also likely to face questions about other issues, like Amazon\u2019s treatment of its warehouse workers or the spread of hate speech on Facebook and YouTube.\nThe hearing would be a central moment in the continuing backlash against the power of major tech companies. Prosecutors at the Justice Department are preparing a possible antitrust case against Google this year, after an inquiry homed in on its control of advertising technology and the search engine market. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon\u2019s business and Facebook\u2019s acquisition of smaller companies.\nA number of state attorneys general are investigating similar issues and could pursue their own actions or work with federal authorities.\nIt will be the first time that Mr. Bezos will testify before Congress. Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Cook have appeared in front of Capitol Hill lawmakers before.\nAlphabet, Facebook and Amazon declined to comment on the record about the committee\u2019s plans. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe plans for the hearing werereported earlier by Kara Swisher, a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.\nThe lawmakers\u2019 investigation has focused on different aspects of each business. They have raised many questions about Amazon\u2019s treatment of brands that sell products on its e-commerce site. Much of the attention on Google has been on its lucrative ad business. With Apple, lawmakers have asked about how its App Store terms hurt developers. Their questions to Facebook have been largely about its use of past acquisitions to cement its dominance in social media.\nApple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook are four of the five biggest tech companies by market value. The fifth, Microsoft, has not been subjected to the same public scrutiny in recent years. It faced a landmark antitrust case a generation ago."
