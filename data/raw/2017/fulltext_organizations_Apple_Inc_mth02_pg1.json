        "title": "What Facebook Owes to Journalism",
        "fulltext": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s manifesto about community,released last week on Facebook,wisely analyzed the state of journalism: He decried sensationalism, and declared that \u201ca strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community.\u201d Giving people a voice, he said, \u201cis not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it.\u201d He even noted that \u201creading local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement.\u201d\nUnfortunately, his memo ignored two major points \u2014 the role that Facebook and other technology platforms are playing in inadvertently damaging local news media, and the one way they could actually save journalism: with a massive philanthropic commitment.\nLocal news is weak in large part because the business models have collapsed. The main reason: As advertising spending shifted from print, TV and radio to the internet, the money didn\u2019t mostly go to digital news organizations. Increasingly, it goes to Facebook and Google.\nOf the $59 billion spent on alldigital advertising in 2015\u2014 across millions of web sites, by millions of advertisers \u2014 $36 billion went to those two companies. And their share is rising: Most ofthe increasein digital advertising in 2016went to them. One analyst estimated that while Facebook and Google surged, the category called \u201ceveryone else\u201d actually declined.\nBecause their ad-targeting abilities are so effective, their power with local businesses will only grow. About 25 percent of Facebook\u2019s digital advertising income comes from local businesses, accordingBorrellAssociates, a leading media analyst.\nTo be clear, Facebook and Google are not being malicious. This isn\u2019t like the tobacco industry knowingly trying to addict people to a product that kills them. Quite the contrary; these companies are sucking in the lion\u2019s share of digital advertising because the ad products they offer are so damn good. They are saving local businesses massive amounts of money.\nBut just because the result is unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it is fantasy: Newsrooms have been decimated, with basic accountability reporting slashed as a result.\nA quick word about two other big players, Verizon and Apple. If Verizon, which owns AOL, succeeds in buying Yahoo, the combined company would become the third biggest recipient of digital advertising dollars, earning about 10 percent.\nApple\u2019s impact is more indirect. Its promotion ofad blocking technologywill further erode the income of news organizations. And the rise of mobile news consumption fueled by smartphones has mostly ended up hurting local news organizations by facilitating the rise of social media as the main distribution platform for news.\nI\u2019m not saying that the good stuff \u2014 the mobile revolution, blocking intrusive ads, better marketing options for small businesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. And local news organizations absolutely contributed to the problem with their sluggish and often uncreative reaction to the digital revolution. But we still need to accept that \u201cdisruption\u201d does disrupt, and occasionally some of what gets overturned is extremely important. When that happens \u2014 and if adequate market-based solutions haven\u2019t materialized \u2014 philanthropy must step in, too.\nIn the last ten years or so, there has been a bit of an increase in philanthropic support for journalism. But if you look closely, a few things stand out.\nFirst, the amounts are tiny. Foundations donated $13.4 million to investigative journalism in 2015 and 2016, according toMedia Impact Funders, an organization that tracks philanthropic spending on media. By contrast, newspaper revenue is at least$1.6 billion less per yearthan it was in the 1980s.\nThe next thing you notice is the four names that are missing from the list of 89 foundations that contributed during those two years: the foundations connected to Facebook, Google, Verizon and Apple. The Tulsa Community Foundation donated more to help investigative journalism than those four combined.\nIf we go back further in time, the pattern persists: $145 million was donated for investigative journalism by 374 foundations from 2009 to 2016. There was one from the big four \u2014 $10,000 in 2011 to the Bronx News Network.\nAs a reminder, these companies have not exactly been financially struggling. In 2016, the four posted a combined net income of $88 billion ($19.4 for Google, $10.2 for Facebook, $13 billion for Verizon and $45 billion for Apple). By contrast, the combined net income for The New York Times, Gannett and McClatchy was $41 million.\nIndividual executives at these companies no doubt have given money to support journalism, and the companies have other significant initiatives to help. Google, which has done the most of the four companies, has established the well-regardedGoogle News Labsto provide outstanding \u201ctools, data and programs\u201d to help journalism and the \u201cDigital News Initiative\u201d that\u2019s spent more than $40 million on new media in Europe.\nFacebook recently announced the\u201cFacebook Journalism Project\u201dpledging to work with media on \u201cnew storytelling formats\u201d and stating that \u201cwe\u2019re interested in exploring what we can build together with our partners to support local news.\u201d These are genuinely positive steps that may indicate a growing recognition that they need to be a big part of the solution.\nBut while training, technology and innovation are critical, what journalism needs most now is money, and lots of it \u2014 to fund full-time local journalists. What these companies have donated so far is too little given how wealthy they are, how much harm they\u2019re (inadvertently) doing \u2014 and how much good they could do.\nThe 19th century robber baron Andrew Carnegie gave away most of his wealth later in life. \u201cSurplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community,\u201d he said. Carnegie built almost3,000 libraries. All Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Laurene Powell (widow of Steve Jobs) have to do is fund 3,000 journalists.\nIf the leaders of these companies put the equivalent of just 1 percent of their profits, for five years, to the cause, local American journalism would be transformed for the next century.\nThat would be $4.4 billion \u2014 enough to establish a permanent endowment tofund local journalism. That would produce about $200 million in income a year, more than 15 times the current philanthropic spending on investigative journalism \u2014 and enough for about 50 new investigative reporters in each state, or to underwrite the technology operations of most nonprofit news organizations.\nThese four companies (plus other digital economy winners) could study Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist. In the rise of web 1.0, the classified ads site dramatically undercut newspapers\u2019 classified revenues. Newmark defended Craigslist but also acknowledged that, whatever the cause, the fate of journalism is important to American democracy. Sohe\u2019s given millions of his personal wealthto fund journalism projects.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the digital revolution \u2014 built in no small part by these four companies \u2014 has made reporting much easier for the journalists still remaining in local newsrooms. But we urgently need far more of those journalists.\nThese companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of the digital disruption that has, among other things, caused the crisis in American journalism. It\u2019s time for the disrupters to solve these problems. They have the money, the know-how and the obligation."

        "title": "Apple Tiptoes Into Producing Original Video but Plans to Pick Up Pace",
        "fulltext": "DANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Watch out, Netflix. Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content.\nApple said Monday night that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring.\nOther original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as Apple tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service.\n\u201cThere are a bunch of projects. We\u2019re in it. This is what Apple Music is going to be,\u201d Mr. Iovine said in an interview Monday night. \u201cApple Music will have video and other things that I can\u2019t talk about. We\u2019re going to be aggressive about it.\u201d\nApple is still primarily a smartphone company. And despite sitting on $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, it insists it has no short-term plans to directly challenge streaming-video giants like Netflix and Amazon, which are increasingly commissioning high-quality original shows to attract and retain subscribers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out to buy a bunch of shows,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software and services, said during an onstage interview at the Code Media technology conference Monday night.\nBut Apple does intend to use original video to help distinguish Apple Music, which began in June 2015 and has attracted than 20 million subscribers, from competitors like Spotify. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do things that are unique and cultural,\u201d Mr. Cue said.\nMuch like MTV did in its heyday, that means going beyond music.\nApple aired atrailer for the first show, \u201cCarpool Karaoke,\u201dat the Grammy Awards on Sunday. The series, a spinoff of James Corden\u2019s running sketch on \u201cThe Late Late Show,\u201d will be available to Apple Music subscribers in April.\nThe second program, \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d is a reality TV series about iPhone app developers competing to build the next great app. In the show, developers will make 60-second pitches, receive mentoring from the musicianWill.i.am, the actors Jessica Alba or Gwyneth Paltrow, or the social media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk to develop their ideas, and then try to persuade a venture capital fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, to invest in them. The winners will get prime billing in Apple\u2019s App Store.\n\u201cWhat does it take to be an app developer? Who are they?\u201d Mr. Cue said, showing a trailer of the show with Ben Silverman, the veteran TV producer who brought the project to Apple. \u201cCustomers are going to love it.\u201d\nMr. Iovine said that Apple Music was also working on other video projects that are \u201cso opposite\u201d to the first two.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just take much longer.\u201d\nAlso under consideration, he said, is a way for musicians to interact with their audiences. \u201cWe\u2019re still experimenting,\u201d he said.\nMr. Iovine was a successful record producer before joining Apple in 2014 when he and the musician Dr. Dresold the headphone-maker Beats Electronicsto Apple for $3 billion. At Beats, Mr. Iovine said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see a stand-alone model that was going to work.\u201d\nApple, by contrast, had vast resources to invest in building a music service.\nDiscussing Apple\u2019s broader video ambitions, Mr. Cue said that the company was currently focused on two problems: how to make it easier to discover already-available content, and how to make it easier for video creators to innovate.\nHe dismissed suggestions, however, that Apple wanted to compete with cable and satellite companies by bundling a group of video channels and selling subscriptions to its users.\n\u201cWe are happy doing the things we are doing today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere it goes, we don\u2019t know.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.Microsoft seems to update Windows 10 constantly and it results in computer freezes and other issues for me. If I wanted to switch, is there a real advantage to Apple software as opposed to Microsoft?\nA.System software updates \u2014 and upgrade problems \u2014 are not a Windows-only issue. Apple has rolled out system upgrades thathave caused disruptions for Mac users when certain hardware and software stopped working reliably, sending upset users toonline support forumsandtech-help sites. Subsequent system updates often fix problems, but outdated driver software and programs incompatible with the new system software can hinder any platform.\nSome users have accused Microsoft ofbeing overly aggressivein pushing out Windows 10 system upgrades and software updates to computers, especially when theupdates caused problems\u2014 likeknocking out internet connections. Apple\u2019ssettings for its Mac operating systeminclude an option to automatically download major system upgrades, but asks first before installing them. You can also stop updates from downloading automatically. (Thesettings that control Mac OS and app updatescan be found under the Apple menu in the App Store area.)\nBeyondtransferring your files from a PC to a Mac, switching operating systems is a big step. Along with the new hardware, you will have to get Mac versions of the programs installed on your hard drive. Web-based apps and services usually work the same, but you may find quirks between the platforms.\nCompanies update their systems to keep on top of security and performance issues, introduce new features, and phase out aging code. Regardless of the operating system you use, keeping it up-to-date generally keeps your data safer, but maintaining a regular backup of yourWindowsorMacsystem in case an update goes wrong can provide a little peace of mind as well."

        "title": "Amid Immigration Furor, Apple\u2019s Chief Focuses on Apps and Music",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s next big business won\u2019t be a self-driving car or an improved smartwatch. It will be digital services like the App Store and Apple Music.\nThe company said on Tuesday that such services brought in $7.2 billion in the quarter that ended in December, and $25.5 billion over the last 12 months.\n\u201cOur goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors to discuss the company\u2019sfinancial results.\nMore difficult to predict is what the impact of President Trump\u2019s policies will be on Apple\u2019s business over the next four years.\nMr. Cook said he was optimistic about corporate tax cuts proposed by Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, and he noted that there was bipartisan support for reducing the tax on overseas profits that American companies must currently pay if they bring the money back to the United States.\nHe said such changes would be good for Apple and for the country. As of Dec. 31, Apple had $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, most of it in foreign accounts.\nMr. Cook said nothing on the call about Mr. Trump\u2019s push to limit immigration, which hasriled the technology industry.\nBut in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published late Tuesday, he said that he has contacted senior people in the White House and that Apple is studying its legal options.\nOn Friday, the president signed an executive order restricting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, prompting an outcry from Mr. Cook and other tech leaders. The administration is expected to issue another order soon that would change the rules for immigrant worker programs, including the H-1B visa program, which Apple and other tech companies rely on when filling many key jobs.\nMr. Trump has also publicly called on Apple to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday, \u201cWe are working to understand what the new administration\u2019s standpoint is.\u201d\nThe strong growth in services will partly offset a slowdown in sales of Apple\u2019s flagship product, the iPhone. Apple said the number of iPhones sold rose just 5 percent in the first fiscal quarter, which ended in December, despite the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September. In the past, product upgrades have yielded bigger jumps in sales.\n\u201cFor a while now, we\u2019ve seen Apple take a step back from the iPhone and try to derive value from services,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with the research firm Gartner.\nOver all, the company\u2019s financial results for the quarter were an improvement from the year before, when it struggled with declining revenue. Apple posted revenue of $78.4 billion for the quarter, up 3 percent compared with the previous year. Profits actually fell slightly, to $17.9 billion, but the company used some of its $27 billion in cash flow in the quarter to buy back millions of shares, so earnings per share rose slightly.\nApple said it was seeing strong growth globally. In mainland China, sales were flat, after a long run of declines. Apple said its global revenue for the quarter was reduced by 1 percent because of the high value of the dollar. In some countries, Mr. Maestri said, Apple raised prices of its products by as much as 40 percent in local currency terms as the dollar rose.\nMr. Cook said that Apple was continuing to explore new services. \u201cWe have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are learning from that.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. This week, Brian X. Chen, the Times\u2019s personal technology writer, filled in for Mike.\nFarhad:Hello, Brian! You\u2019re stepping in for Mike this week becausehe has again locked himself out of the office.You really can\u2019t count on that guy. So thank you for filling in.\nAnyway, I wanted to start with some real talk:Science newsis very cool right now. You must have seen how astronomersdiscovered seven Earth-size planetsorbiting a star just 40 light years away. Meanwhile,physicists are puzzling over how quickly the universe is expanding; it seems to be going faster than physics predicts it should, which could be a clue that our understanding of the universe is missing something. I don\u2019t have any jokes here. I just think this stuff is awesome.\nBrian: Forty light years is pretty far away. I was hoping I could find another planet to live on for the next four to eight years. I guess I\u2019ll have to settle for Vancouver.\nFarhad: Eh, Canada. O.K., things picked up in the tech industry this week. For the first time in a long time, there was some news that didn\u2019t have anything to do with Donald Trump. Instead, it pretty much all had to do with Uber.\nBut we\u2019ll get to that in a bit. Here are some other things that happened.\nFirst,Apple announcedthat its huge new headquarters building in Cupertino, Calif., would be completed in April. This is the spaceship building thatSteve Jobs unveiled to the Cupertino City Councilin the summer of 2011, in his last public appearance before he died that fall. Apple has named the new campus Apple Park, and it has named the campus auditorium after Jobs. The building will house 12,000 employees. I bet more than a few of them will have roller-skate races around the huge circular hallways.\nBrian:Apple\u2019s campus renovations are long overdue. Have you tried to find parking there recently? It\u2019s a nightmare \u2014 the place is flooded with Teslas and Mustangs.\nAnyway, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been talking about this new campus for years now. The way it\u2019s shaped \u2014 kind of like a U.F.O. \u2014 is supposed to foster stronger collaboration between different departments across Apple, whereas historically the divisions (hardware, software, special projects, Apple Minivan or whatever the heck they\u2019re doing, iOS, Mac, etc.) have been very siloed. Let\u2019s see if that happens. (Maybe one day we\u2019ll be able to plug the iPhone charging cable into the ports on the newMacBook Pros\u2014 what a concept.)\nFarhad: If it takes a $5 billion building to eliminate dongles, I\u2019m all for it.\nSo a shocking thing happened this week: A subsidiary of Facebook copied a feature from Snapchat.\nI\u2019m sorry, I should be above easy sarcasm as a joke. But this week the president used\u201cNOT!\u201din a tweet, and it took me back to the fourth grade. Remember when people used to say, \u201cPsych?\u201d\nBrian:Tcha. I mean, totes.\nFarhad: Anyway, WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased for more than $19 billion a few years ago, rolled out a number of features this week that borrow heavily from Snapchat. This follows another Facebook-owned app, Instagram, rolling out Stories, a way to make collections of short videos that Snapchat also pioneered.\nI have no problem with this; as I\u2019ve argued repeatedly, I think it\u2019s generally good for consumers and innovation online when companies freely copy each other\u2019s best software ideas. Still, it\u2019s got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas.\nAs a columnist, I know that feeling well.\nBrian:Tell me about it. I just did my third advice column onphone plansin the last two years.\nAnyway, I\u2019m used to social media giants cloning each other\u2019s features, but I don\u2019t think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction.\nPeople loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp\u2019s new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?\nI mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I\u2019m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use.\nFarhad: WhatsApp is great because it just works without any fuss. This all feels like a big fuss.\nNow let\u2019s talk Uber. What a cluster. So, last weekend, a former Uber engineer named Susan Fowler published a lengthy blog post in which she went into lots of detail about sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber.She described a culturein which women were treated terribly and the human resources department did nothing.\nThen Mike, our Uber beat writer,published a really good piece detailinga whole bunch of other explosive stories about the company\u2019s unrestrained culture. Then on Thursday, another shoe dropped: Waymo, a unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, filed suit against Uber. Waymo said that a former member of Google\u2019s self-driving car project stole thousands of technical documents about the project before starting Otto, his own company \u2014 which Uber bought last year. And all this follows another controversy at Uber \u2014 C.E.O. Travis Kalanick\u2019s one-time plan to join a presidential advisory council,which led to an outcryfrom employees and customers.\nUber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it\u2019s not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally.\nSo, where do you think this goes next?\nBrian:As these things often tend to go, Uber is going to be in damage-control mode for the coming months. It will probably release the results of the investigation and announce a mandatory sexual harassment training program for its employees.\nMike\u2019s reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWe are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone\u201d \u2014 is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture. Their next step, PR-wise, is to show the steps they are taking to \u201cheal.\u201d\nFarhad: I think that was the plan, but the script is already falling apart. Two of Uber\u2019s early investors, Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, published an open letter to Kalanickexpressing their disappointment in how Uber has handled the crisis so far. The company has tasked Eric Holder, the former attorney general under President Obama, to lead an investigation into its culture. But the investors \u2014 who have long fought for better representation of women in tech companies \u2014 say that such an investigation will not be truly independent.\n\u201cTo us, this decision is yet another example of Uber\u2019s continued unwillingness to be open, transparent and direct,\u201d they said.\nThis is something new in tech \u2014 you don\u2019t ordinarily see investors calling out their companies. So it seems like Uber is going to have to do something much bigger and less superficial here\u2026. I think.\nBrian: What an epic disaster. I guess Travis will have to make his employees do more than a few trust falls before they recover from this one.\nFarhad: This is one of those sagas that might never end. Well, thanks for being Mike this week, Brian.\nBrian:No problem. Did I sound childish enough? Smell ya later."

        "title": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives",
        "fulltext": "In late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.\nFor all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.\nNo longer.\nAfter President Trump\u2019s Jan. 27executive order restricting immigration, high-tech has gone full-tilt political. Companies are being pushed by their employees, by their customers and sometimes by their ideals. They are trying to go far enough without going too far.\nNearly 130 companies, most of them in the technology field, filedan amicus brieflate Sunday in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which declined to reinstate the travel ban after a lower court blocked it. The brief, which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Uber and Intel, said Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201cviolates the immigration laws and the Constitution.\u201d\nNearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\n\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201d\nIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\nMany of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after anupbeat meeting with the president-elect in December. That modest approach, which even the most risk-averse executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections,Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber,was forced to step downfrom one of the administration\u2019s advisory councils.\n\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201d\nResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201d\nWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.\nSeveral factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.\nLess remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201d\nMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.\nYet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\n\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.\nSince the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201d\nAt an all-hands meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington State\u2019s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort,Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said.\nThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.\nSome in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\n\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201d\nMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201d\nPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.\nMaciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.\nIt was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.\nMr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.\nBest-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.\nHe talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.\nWhen Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\n\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\n\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\n\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.I recently switched to a Mac laptop, and the Safari browser confuses me. Sometimes it has scroll bars on the side of the page, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Why is this?\nA.In an attempt to streamline the user interface, Apple\u2019s Safari browser for the Mac has scroll bars that can disappear from view if you are not actively scrolling through a web page. The company has beentinkering with desktop scrolling behavior for several years, and Safari\u2019s behavior on the Mac is similar to the way it behaves in Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system.\nScroll bars that disappear until they are needed make more sense on a mobile device with limited screen space than they do on a bigger screen navigated by mouse or track pad. Fortunately, you can change the scroll bar behavior for your programs in the Mac\u2019s system preferences.\nClick the System Preferences icon inthe Mac\u2019s desktop dock, or go to the Apple Menu and choose System Preferences. Whenthe System Preferences boxopens, click the General icon in the top row.\nIn the General box, go to the \u201cShow scroll bars\u201d section and click the button next to Always. Additionally, you can change what happens when you click in a scroll bar too, either jumping to the next page or to the area of the page where you clicked. (Before you close the preferences box, you can make other interface adjustments like changing the highlight color and increasing the sidebar icon size, among other things.)\nIf you do not like Safari, you can download another Mac-friendly browser likeGoogle Chrome,Mozilla Firefox,OperaorVivaldi. In most newer browsers, you can even use a keyboard shortcut to roll through a page \u2014 tap the space bar to scroll down, or hold down the Shift key and tap the space bar to reverse direction."
