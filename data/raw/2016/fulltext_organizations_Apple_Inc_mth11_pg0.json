        "title": "Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple\u2019s App Store in recent weeks \u2014 just in time to deceive holiday shoppers.\nThe counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard\u2019s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a barrage of fake apps,\u201d said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time.\nSome of them appeared to be relatively harmless \u2014 essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.\nBut there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information.\nThe rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple\u2019s process for reviewing every app before it is published.\nThat scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google\u2019s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company\u2019s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers.\nIn practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them.\nWith apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pok\u00e9mon Company, among others.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,\u201d he said.\nApple removed hundreds of fake apps on Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after aNew York Post article last weekdrew attention to some of the counterfeits.\n\u201cWe strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We\u2019ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.\u201d\nIn September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove \u201capps that no longer function as intended, don\u2019t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.\u201d The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing.\nDespite Apple\u2019s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple\u2019s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of Whac-a-Mole,\u201d Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said.\nOn Friday, for example, an entity calling itself Overstock Inc. \u2014 an apparent attempt to confuse shoppers looking for the online retailer Overstock.com \u2014 waspeddling Ugg boots and apparel through a fake appthat was nearly identical to one banished by Apple on Thursday.\nThe same Chinese app developer,Cloaker Apps, created both fake Ugg apps on behalf of Chinese clients.\nJack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients.\n\u201cWe hope that our clients are all official sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.\u201d\nMr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi \u2014 about $3,000 \u2014 for an app written in English.\nBut like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook\u2019s campus in Menlo Park, Calif.\nIn the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have \u201ctens of employees\u201d at the Facebook address.\nChina is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts.\nMany of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, \u201cOur angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.\u201d\nData from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. \u201cWould give zero stars if possible,\u201d wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. \u201cConstantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.\u201d\nMr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands.\n\u201cThe retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,\u201d he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard\u2019s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps.\nBut the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real.\nThe shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store \u2014 including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear.\nSimilarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume.\nSome of the fake apps have even used Apple\u2019s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store.\nJon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple\u2019s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google\u2019s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said.\nBut that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pok\u00e9mon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available.\n\u201cThe criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,\u201d Mr. Clay said."

        "title": "How Apple Empowers, and Employs, the American Working Class",
        "fulltext": "AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump complained that America had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies like Apple to bring that work home. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\u201dhe said.\nFor ahost of reasons, Apple is unlikely to produce iPhones in the United States. But opening a smartphone factory in this country is not the only way to provide solid employment for working-class Americans who lack college degrees.\nApple\u2019s overall contribution to the American economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads.\nApple\u2019s rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world\u2019s largest technology company and their economic impact.\nAt Apple\u2019s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company\u2019s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them.\nEmployees here help run Apple\u2019s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company\u2019s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple\u2019s products.\nThe Austin campus \u2014 the company\u2019s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \u2014 offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.\nAlthough contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.\nApple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States.\n\u201cApple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\u201d\nLast week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple\u2019s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised.\nGenny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \u201cA lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201d\nApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages \u2014 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone \u2014 and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer.\nEmployees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple.\nThe region\u2019s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple\u2019s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone.\nAnd about 3,400 construction workers helped build the Austin campus. Apple ensured that they all got paid at least $12 an hour. It also provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance and safety training, and it allowed the monitoring of conditions by an outside labor group, theWorkers Defense Project, which has been trying to improve safety and pay in Texas construction.\n\u201cThere is a high road, and Apple followed that path,\u201d said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. \u201cIt sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.\u201d\nA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple\u2019s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.\nFlex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.\nApple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.\nLarger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to ship a phone, and it\u2019s harder to ship a computer,\u201d said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder still for cars and refrigerators.\u201d\nOver time, the value of Apple\u2019s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. \u201cThere are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is probably more gender equity. And it\u2019s probably better for customers, too.\u201d\nAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer\u2019s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple\u2019s suppliers into the company\u2019s production systems. \u201cHere, there\u2019s a lot more openness and creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIn manufacturing, it\u2019s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.\u201d\nMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough \u2014 at least $20 an hour \u2014 to support the city\u2019s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices.\nSome of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. \u201cThe best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,\u201d Mr. Adler said.\nAsked about Apple\u2019s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: \u201cThe product that Apple builds here is us.\u201d"

I would love a copy of the movie as a keepsake, but no one can figure out how to make a DVD for me. Can you help?\nA.As versatile as it is, the iPad does not include the ability to record DVDs, so you need the right hardware and software to get the movie onto a disc. Some programs in Apple\u2019s App Store offer to create DVDs from uploaded video, but you can also do it yourself if you have access to a computer with a DVD burner and disc-making software.\nIf you want to go the app route, software likeBurn Videopromises to take video uploaded from an iOS device and record it to a DVD for you. The App Store has other similar programs, although some may charge monthly subscription fees to regularly record iPhone or iPad video to disc.\nMost video-editing programs for iOS devices offer export options that allow you to save a copy of a movie project as a file that plays outside of the app that created it.\nThe export options vary based on the editing software used, but Apple\u2019s owniMovieapp is frequently used for making iPad video projects and can be used here as an example. Open the iMovie app and tap the thumbnail for the project you want to export. On the project\u2019s page, tap theShare menuicon at the bottom of the screen between the preview icon and the trash icon.\nIn the window that pops up, select a place to save the movie. Depending on the apps and accounts used with the iPad, choices may include online storage sites like iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox. If the iPad is near a compatible Mac, it is also possible to wirelessly transfer the movie to the computer with Apple\u2019s AirDrop feature. (On a Mac, you can alsoopen it with the desktop version of iMovieorimport it through iTunes.)\nFrom the Share menu, you can also export the movie to the iPad\u2019s photo library with the Save Video icon. Connect the iPad to a Mac or PC with its USB cable to import the video to the computer the same way you import photos from a digital camera, through the WindowsAutoPlaybox (andother methods) or the Mac\u2019sImage Captureapp.\nOnce you get the exported file on the computer with the connected DVD burner, record the movie to a disc. A DVD-creation program can record and format the disc so that it automatically plays like a standard movie on the DVD player connected to your home entertainment center."

How can I copy them to an external drive without messing up the Photos app?\nA.Apple\u2019s Photos app lets youcreate multiple photo librarieswithin the program, and even store those libraries on external drives. You can reclaim a chunk of your laptop\u2019s drive space by moving your picture library to a new external drive (and deleting it from its original location), but this means you do need to have the external drive connected to the computer when you want to see, edit or share the pictures.\nIf you prefer to keep your pictures on the ground and out of the cloud, start by getting an external hard drive large enough to hold your growing image library for the foreseeable future. Connect the new drive and quit the Photos program before you copy the library.\nNext, go to your Mac\u2019s Home folder and open the Pictures folder. Drag the PhotosLibrary.photoslibrary file to the new drive\u2019s desktop icon (or onto its icon in the window\u2019s sidebar). If youhold down the Command key while you dragthe library file, the Mac will copy it to the new location and then delete the file from its original spot, but you might want to make sure everything is copied properly to the new drive first \u2014 and then delete the old library file manually.\nTo point the program to the library\u2019s new location, hold down the Mac\u2019s Option key and click the Photos app icon in the desktop dock to start it up. As the Photos program starts, the Choose Library box appears. Click the Other Library button, navigate to the external hard drive that now houses your library file, select it and click Open.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s New MacBook Pro: Fast and Light, but Not for Everyone",
        "fulltext": "When Apple unveiled its newMacBook Pro laptopsat a media event last month, Adam Leventhal, a software engineer, was eager to learn about them.\nYet by the time he finished watching a live stream of the event, Mr. Leventhal, who has owned only Mac computers for the last 30 years, was turned off. \u201cWith this one I was really disappointed,\u201d he said.\nFor a new laptop, the MacBook Pro has been divisive. That may partly be because the model, which has long been used by creative professionals and coders, has stayed largely the same since 2012. So this time, when Apple introduced some fairly radical changes, emotions among somelongtime Mac customersran high.\nIn their latest incarnation, MacBook Pros have only one type of connection port, as opposed to the several types they had before. That will require people to buy adapters to plug in devices that use different types of connectors. On the keyboard, Apple also replaced the top row of physical keys, including the Escape key, with a virtual touch strip called the Touch Bar.\nThe benefits? The new laptops are faster, much thinner and lighter than the previous generation, and they have about 10 hours of battery life. The Touch Bar\u2019s virtual buttons transform depending on the app you are using, unlocking the potential for software makers to create custom shortcuts.\nI tested the new MacBook Pros \u2014 which cost $1,500 to $2,800, depending on the model \u2014 while gathering reactions to the new computers from engineers and information technology professionals over two weeks. I concluded that while the new laptops are capable enough for many professionals, there is no need to rush to buy one.\nHere are the highlights and lowlights of the new MacBook Pros:\nWith the new laptops, Apple has gone all in onUSB-C, the next-generation USB port. This small, oval-shaped connection is expected to replace the bulkier, rectangular port known as USB-A on many computing devices and accessories in the next few years.\nIn my tests, having only USB-C on the MacBook Pros was the biggest change. The previous MacBook Pros included USB-A and some other types of ports, including HDMI, for connecting devices like printers and monitors. Now the USB-C ports will be the only way to hook up just about everything, including power chargers, external screens and photo-card readers, to the laptop. The entry-level MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports, and the higher-end models include four.\nWhat this means in the near term is that you may have to buy adapters to plug in devices with different connectors. Annoyingly, that includes the iPhone power cable, which has a USB-A connector. So to charge an iPhone on a new MacBook Pro, for example, you have to hook up the cable to a dongle that connects USB-A and USB-C devices.\nThe transition to USB-C might be a headache, but it is easily resolved by picking up some inexpensive adapters. I bought mine fromMonoprice.\nIn the long run, Apple\u2019s shift to USB-C will help set an industry standard, said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. The goal is to reach a point where all peripheral devices are made with a USB-C connector. So eventually you won\u2019t need adapters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut ties with the past and go with the new standard, finally,\u201d Mr. Denslow said.\nWith the Touch Bar, Apple intended to replace some outdated keys with a versatile strip that adapts to the apps you are using. Apple also built a fingerprint sensor into the Touch Bar.\nThe Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn\u2019t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That\u2019s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab \u2014 but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker.\nThe Escape key also exists as a virtual button on the Touch Bar. I didn\u2019t mind that because I rarely use this key, but the design decision made Mr. Leventhal, the software engineer, wince. He said the physical Escape key was crucial for coders, and not being able to press it seemed crippling.\nThe jury is still out on whether the Touch Bar will be a must-have. When switching back to a laptop with a normal keyboard, I didn\u2019t feel as if I was missing anything. But much like the iPhone on Day 1, the Touch Bar is essentially a blank slate, and the onus is on app developers to make it more compelling.\nMany Apple loyalists have fixated on the memory constraints and underwhelming performance of the new MacBook Pros. The new models have a maximum of 16 gigabytes of RAM \u2014 the same limit as the previous MacBook Pro \u2014 and roughly the same processor speed as the last professional notebooks. But that\u2019s not the full story.\nThe new notebooks are much faster in some ways than older models, while other parts are only slightly faster. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the 15-inch MacBook Pro\u2019s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the 15-inch model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too.\nThe RAM limit might irk users who need power. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can open and the more quickly your computer can juggle them. The problem, in theory, is that in a few years if your future apps hog more memory, you won\u2019t be able to add more memory to MacBook Pros because the most they can hold is 16 gigabytes.\nProfessional Mac users are too divided on the MacBook Pro for me to make a blanket recommendation.\nOne thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. A Chromebook, like the$430 Chromebook 13from Dell, or the $1,000MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s least expensive notebook computer, are slower and have lower-resolution screens, but they are powerful enough for your needs.\nThe new MacBook Pros are probably powerful enough for most professionals. But if you consider yourself a power user and are skeptical about the MacBook Pro, you might wait to see whether the initial concerns are borne out after early adopters start using their machines. Plenty have already bought them: Applesaidearly orders for the new MacBook Pro have been stronger than for past professional notebooks.\nOn the plus side, these notebooks are fast, with high-resolution screens and responsive keyboards. But the Touch Bar so far feels gimmicky, and not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.\nThe MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage.\nSo if you aren\u2019t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don\u2019t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it\u2019s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price.\nMr. Leventhal says he is exploring other options such as aHackintosh\u2014 a generic PC that is modified to run the Mac operating system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dark place where you\u2019re doing something that is basically illegal and spending a ton of time to even make it feasible, but I have no good options,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "The Irish government on Wednesday filed an appeal seeking to stop efforts by European authorities to force Apple to pay the country $14.3 billion to cover what antitrust officials say are unpaid taxes.\nMargrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, ordered Apple in August to pay the amount,alleging the companyhad received preferential tax rulings from the Irish government that gave Apple an unfair advantage over rivals.\nBoth Ireland and Apple deny any wrongdoing. The appeal, filed with the General Court, the top appellate court of the European Union, represents the beginning of a lengthy standoff between European authorities, the Irish government and Apple.\n\u201cThe government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission\u2019s analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal,\u201d Michael Noonan, the country\u2019s finance minister,told European politicianson Tuesday.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\nThere is much at stake for both sides.\nIreland\u2019s low tax rate and other financial incentiveshave attractedhundreds of foreign companies, providing thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of annual investment. Any restrictions on how Ireland can use its tax code, experts say, could seriously hamper the country\u2019s growth and leave Apple with a multibillion-dollar tax bill to pay. The company plans a separate appeal.\nFor European officials, the Apple tax ruling is the most visible of a series of cases against American companies accused of using Europe\u2019s tax system to reduce their tax burdens unfairly. Lawmakers worldwide are trying to clamp down on complex tax structures that have allowed many multinational companies to significantly lower their tax liability.\n\u201cWe need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency,\u201d Ms. Vestager said when announcing the tax clawback against Apple in August.\nAlready, Starbuckshas been finedroughly $34 million for an preferential tax deal in the Netherlands. McDonald\u2019s and Amazon are likely to face similar charges in Europe in the coming months. All the companies deny they have breached Europe\u2019s competition rules.\nFor Apple and the Irish government, though, the tax battle is likely to drag on for years.\nLegal analysts say it will take up to 18 months for the General Court to rule on the matter. And any decision may be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the region\u2019s highest court, further prolonging the uncertainty."

        "title": "Will.i.am Moves Wearables Off the Wrist With the Help of Kendall Jenner and Apple",
        "fulltext": "Wearable technology is finally beginning to go beyond the wrist.\n\u201cWhy should you have to take off your earphones when you finish listening to something and put them back in a box or bag, instead of just wearing them around your neck like jewelry?\u201d\nThat wasWill.i.am, the musician/TV personality/entrepreneur, co-founder of the Black Eyed Peas, and founder ofi.am+, a wearable technology company with a focus on youth education, during an interview by telephone while traveling by car from Manchester, England, to London.\nIt is the kind of question that, when voiced (especially by a coach of \u201cThe Voice UK\u201d), seems enormously obvious, but, apparently, has not occurred to any of us to ask. And it clearly reflects some of the issues in bridging the gulf between fashion and technology: It\u2019s not the products that are the problem, but figuring out what the products should be and what we want our stuff to do.\nThe question did occur, however, to Will.i.am, whose full name is William Adams. So he created an answer.\nCalledi.am+ BUTTONS, it is a pair of Bluetooth headphones backed by magnetic metallic discs that, when in the ears, look like a cross between ear plugs and giant studs in the shape of old vinyl records. When not in use, the discs connect via the magnets to form a necklace of sorts.\n\u201cYou know, we all love buying shoes to match our outfits and bags to match our outfits, but for some reason we don\u2019t expect our technology to match our outfits,\u201d Will.i.am said. \u201cWhy not? Why should we just accept that? What I want to do is change that.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not the only one who thinks it\u2019s a good idea. Originally made as accessories to his firsti.am+ product,a bangle/smartwatch called Puls, he was test-driving the Buttons one day when he ran into Angela Ahrendts,senior vice president of retail at Apple. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she said, pointing to the earphones around his neck. He told her, and she told him that he should sell them as products in their own right. In Apple stores.\n(Will.i.am has a history with Apple, being involved in the company\u2019s first foray into original television \u2014 he is a mentor onthe reality series \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d\u2014 as well as \u201cThe 411 with Mary J. Blige,\u201d a show that streams on Apple Music).\nSo he will: Buttons are being produced in four colors that match the iPhone 7, and are to go on sale in Apple stores beginning on Wednesday; additional shades will be available on thei.am+ website and through stores such as Max Field for the holidays. The Buttons also work with Android products, have a battery life of six to eight hours, and are priced at a luxury level: $229.95, with a percentage of sales going to benefit the i.am.angel Foundation, which focuses on teaching inner-city youth about technology and core subjects.\nAesthetically speaking, though, you might think of Buttons as the anti-AirPod, Apple\u2019s wireless earphones that, when introduced in September, were compared to tampons and \u201cear cigarettes.\u201d So it will be interesting to see how Buttons are received. To me, they seem like most first-run products: a great idea, but the reality could use some tweaking.\nThe discs, after all, are the most attractive, fashion-y part of the product, but they are also where the magnets reside, so when worn as a necklace they are inside what is effectively the pendant, and the ear piece is what sticks out. As a result, instead of looking like a medallion, which would be a cool addition to an outfit, giving it a 1970s edge, it looks kind of like a little rubber angel. Or a pair of earphones worn around the neck.\nStill, my guess is that things may evolve: Will.i.am has enlisted a host of major fashion names in his cause. Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell joined the company as partners and ambassadors, and model the new product in its campaign.\n\u201cKendall represents the new millennial face of fashion, and Naomi is the queen of fashion,\u201d Will.i.am said, explaining why he asked them to get involved. Also adding fashion heft and taste is Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, who has joined as style and fashion director. And Kering, the parent company of Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, is an investor.\nTogether, they are gearing up for a series of introductions of connected fashion technology products in the next year that will include Button bomber jackets, with connected collars, and Button chokers.\nMeanwhile, Will.i.am plans to involve other collaborators \u2014 musicians, athletes \u2014 to create an ecosystem of advisers on what people wear in all parts of life.\n\u201cI never wanted to do fashion from a me-too perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to add to the conversation.\u201d\nTune in to see who is listening."

        "title": "In China, Toilets Have Trump\u2019s Name Without His Permission",
        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 The founder of a Chinese brand of high-tech toilets called Trump said he had no intention of soiling the name of America\u2019s next president.\nZhong Jiye, the founder, said he had not heard of Donald J. Trump when he registered the English name of his company, Shenzhen Trump Industrial Company Limited, as a trademark in 2002. In Chinese, the company name means \u201cinnovate universally,\u201d he said, highlighting how the toilet seats warm and wash the user\u2019s backside. That Chinese name, he explained, also sounds a little like \u201ctrump.\u201d\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t know of this person called Trump,\u201d Mr. Zhong said in a telephone interview from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. \u201cIt was entirely a coincidence.\u201d\nIn the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s name has adorned ties, steaks, water and other products. In China, it is found on computers, cosmetics, even leather goods.\nThe difference: Many such Chinese products don\u2019t have the president-elect\u2019s permission.\nOf the 46 registered trademarks under the Trump name in China, 29 appear to be owned by Mr. Trump, based on data with the country\u2019s trademark office. At least 14 companies not associated with Mr. Trump applied for the Trump trademark in 2015 and 2016 alone, according to Itaotm, a Chinese commercial trademark website.\nThe situation highlights the difficulties that big brands and celebrities face as they navigate the country\u2019s relatively new trademark laws.\nIn China, trademarks are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, in a practice known as \u201ctrademark squatting.\u201d\nMany Western companies like Apple and Starbucks have been caught up in long legal battles to win the right to use their names in China.\nIn May, a Chinese company won the right to sell its leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal wrangling with Apple. Michael Jordanlost the rightsto the name he is known by in China. New Balancepaid$16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the Chinese name for the company, which a person had trademarked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to prove bad faith,\u201d said Matthew Dresden, a lawyer with Harris Moure in Seattle who specializes in Chinese intellectual property law. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to prove that your name is well known at the time that the application is filed.\u201d\nMr. Trump has fought at least once to get his name back. In 2015, he lost a legal battle against a businessman in the northern province of Liaoning, Dong Wei, to prevent him from using the Trump name for a construction company, according to a website run by China\u2019s Supreme Court. Then the decision was reversed. A notice issued on China\u2019s trademark office website on Sunday said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trademark had been granted preliminary approval for use in construction services. The Wall Street Journalreported the decisionon Monday.\nAlan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nMr. Trump isn\u2019t the first world leader wrapped up in a name dispute in China.\nIn 2004, the country\u2019s government officials were not favorably inclined when a Chinese businessman tried to register the Chinese name of former President George W. Bush for a brand of disposable diapers. The officials said the application was likely to be rejected \u201cbecause it may bring about bad social impact if a leader\u2019s name is registered as a trademark,\u201d according to state media.\nMr. Zhong, of the toilet maker Shenzhen Trump, said he had not received a challenge from Mr. Trump or his company. Still, he said, he \u201cwill never\u201d give up his trademark easily, if Mr. Trump decides to sue.\n\u201cLitigating is his right,\u201d Mr. Zhong said. \u201cBut we will let the government make its judgment. We believe the country\u2019s laws will protect businesses like us.\u201d\nMr. Zhong said he approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ccourageous style and spirit of reform.\u201d He also liked Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cinnovative ideas.\u201d\nWhen asked about the criticism directed toward Mr. Trump in the United States, Mr. Zhong said, \u201cDemocratic countries are like that. I think a transformation is not bad at all.\u201d"
