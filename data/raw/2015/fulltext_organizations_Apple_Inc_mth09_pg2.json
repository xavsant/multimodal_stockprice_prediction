        "fulltext": "Apple Music is getting a little bit of luxury.\nBurberry, the high-end fashion retailer, said on Monday that it was starting a channel on Apple Music, the streaming music service. The channel will feature performances, songs and films that have come out of Burberry\u2019s\n                                        work with British artists.\nThe deal is the first collaboration between the two companies since Apple in 2013 hired away Angela Ahrendts, then Burberry\u2019s chief executive, to become senior vice president of retail and online stores. Since\n                                        Ms. Ahrendts left Burberry, industry observers have wondered whether Apple and Burberry would work together and whether that collaboration would involve retail. Apple recently chose to work with a different high-end\n                                        retailer, Herm\u00e8s, to make luxury wristbands for the Apple Watch.\nThe partnership is also a new feature for Apple Music, which began in June. Apple is a latecomer to the streaming music space, which has been dominated by other services such as Spotify. Apple said that 11 million people\n                                        had signed up for the service, while Spotify has 75 million active users and 20 million paying subscribers. Since Apple Music users get a three-month free trial period, the company won\u2019t know for a few weeks\n                                        yet whether those who initially signed up stay on after the trial ends and pay the $10-a-month price.\nBurberry has been commissioning work from and filming British recording artists since 2010 as part of its Burberry Acoustic program. The 100 or so performances that have come out of that project have been shown on YouTube.\n\u201cI am excited about our partnership with Apple on this amazing platform which will enable us to take what we do now with Burberry Acoustic and share it with an even bigger audience,\u201d Christopher Bailey,\n                                        Burberry\u2019s chief executive and chief creative officer, said in a statement.\nBurberry\u2019s Apple Music channel will kick off with exclusive videos from emerging British artists that will be filmed at the Burberry Womenswear show. The show is scheduled to take place Sept. 21 in London.\nOnce Burberry takes those performances to Apple Music, subscribers can comment on and share the content using Facebook, Twitter, email and Apple\u2019s Messages tool.\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA version of this article appears in print on 09/21/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Burberry Creates Media Channel for Apple Music."

        "fulltext": "Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 CONSERVATIVES and liberals interminably debate the merits of \u201cthe free market\u201d versus \u201cthe government.\u201d Which one you trust more delineates the main ideological divide in America.\nIn reality, they aren\u2019t two separate things. There can\u2019tbea market without government. Legislators, agency heads and judges decide the rules of the game. And, over time, they change the rules. The important question, too rarely discussed, is who has the most influence over these decisions and in that way wins the game.\nTwo centuries ago slaves were among the nation\u2019s most valuable assets, and after the Civil War, perhaps land was. Then factories, machines, railroads and oil transformed America. By the 1920s most working Americans were employees, and the most contested property issue was their freedom to organize into unions.\nNow information and ideas are the most valuable forms of property. Most of the cost of producing it goes into discovering it or making the first copy. After that, the additional production cost is often zero. Such \u201cintellectual property\u201d is the key building block of the new economy. Without government decisions over what it is, and who can own it and on what terms, the new economy could not exist.\nBut as has happened before with other forms of property, the most politically influential owners of the new property are doing their utmost to increase their profits by creating monopolies that must eventually be broken up.\nThe most valuable intellectual properties are platforms so widely used that everyoneelsehas to use them, too. Think of standard operating systems like Microsoft\u2019s Windows or Google\u2019s Android; Google\u2019s search engine; Amazon\u2019s shopping system; and Facebook\u2019s communication network. Google runs two-thirds of all searches in the United States. Amazon sells more than 40 percent of new books. Facebook has nearly 1.5 billion active monthly users worldwide. This is where the money is.\nDespite an explosion in the number of websites over the last decade, page views are becoming more concentrated. While in 2001, the top 10 websites accounted for 31 percent of all page views in America, by 2010 the top 10 accounted for 75 percent. Google and Facebook are now the first stops for many Americans seeking news \u2014 while Internet traffic to much of the nation\u2019s newspapers, network television and other news gathering agencies has fallen well below 50 percent of all traffic. Meanwhile, Amazon is now the first stop for almost a third of all American consumers seeking to buyanything. Talk about power.\nWhenever markets become concentrated, consumers end up paying more than they otherwise would, and innovations are squelched. Sure, big platforms let creators showcase and introduce new apps, songs, books, videos and other content. But almost all of the profits go to the platforms\u2019 owners, who have all of the bargaining power.\nContrary to the conventional view of an American economy bubbling with innovative small companies, the reality is quite different. The rate at which new businesses have formed in the United States has slowed markedly since the late 1970s. Big Tech\u2019s sweeping patents, standard platforms, fleets of lawyers to litigate against potential rivals and armies of lobbyists have created formidable barriers to new entrants.\nThe patent system is crucial to innovation. The law gives 20 years of patent protection to inventions that are \u201cnew and useful,\u201d as decided by the Patent and Trademark Office. But the winners are big enough to game the system. They make small improvements warranting new patents, effectively making their intellectual property semipermanent. They also lay claim to whole terrains of potential innovation including ideas barely on drawing boards and flood the system with so many applications that lone inventors have to wait years. The White House intellectual property adviser Colleen V. Chien noted in 2012 that Google and Apple were spending more money acquiring patents (not to mention litigating them) than on doing research and development.\nAntitrust laws used to fight this sort of market power. In the 1990s, the federal government accused Microsoft of illegally bundling its popular Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer browser to create an industry standard that stifled competition. Microsoft settled the case by agreeing to share its programming interfaces with other companies. But since then Big Tech has been almost immune to serious antitrust scrutiny, even though the largest tech companies have more market power than ever. Maybe that\u2019s because they\u2019ve accumulated so much political power.\nIn 2012, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Competition submitted to the commissioners a 160-page analysis of Google\u2019s dominance in the search and related advertising markets, and recommended suing Google for conduct that \u201chas resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d But the commissioners chose not to pursue a case. Investigators also found evidence that Google was pushing its products ahead of competitors\u2019 on search results, though no legal action was recommended on this point.\nIt\u2019s unusual for commissioners not to accept staff recommendations, and they didn\u2019t give a full explanation. The F.T.C. noted a competing internal report that recommended against legal action, but another plausible reason has to do with Google\u2019s political clout. Google is now among the largest corporate lobbyists in the United States. Around the time of the investigation the company poured money into influencing both the commissioners and the commission\u2019s congressional overseers.\n\nGOOGLE is heading into a major fight with antitrust officials in the European Union for some of the same reasons the F.T.C. staff went after it. Not incidentally, Europe is also investigating Amazon for allegedly stifling competition in e-books, and Apple for doing the same in music. While many on this side of the Atlantic believe Europe is taking on these tech giants because they\u2019re American, another possible explanation is that Google, Amazon and Apple lack as much political clout in Europe as they have here.\nEconomic and political power can\u2019t be separated because dominant corporations gain political influence over how markets are maintained and enforced, which enlarges their economic power further. One of the original goals of antitrust law was to prevent this.\n\u201cThe enterprises of the country are aggregating vast corporate combinations of unexampled capital, boldly marching, not for economical conquests only, but for political power,\u201d warned Edward G. Ryan, the chief justice of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, in 1873. Antitrust law was viewed as a means of breaking this link. \u201cIf we will not endure a king as a political power,\u201d Senator John Sherman of Ohio thundered, \u201cwe should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale\u201d of what the nation produced.\nSherman\u2019s Antitrust Act easily passed Congress and was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison on July 2, 1890. Twelve years later, President Teddy Roosevelt used it against the Northern Securities Company, which dominated rail transportation in the Northwest. In 1911, President William Howard Taft broke up the Standard Oil empire.\nThe underlying issue has little to do with whether one prefers the \u201cfree market\u201d or government. The real question is how government organizes the market, and who has the most influence over its decisions. We are now in a new gilded age similar to the first Gilded Age, when the nation\u2019s antitrust laws were enacted. As then, those with great power and resources are making the \u201cfree market\u201d function on their behalf. Big Tech \u2014 along with the drug, insurance, agriculture and financial giants \u2014 dominates both our economy and our politics.\nYet as long as we remain obsessed by the debate over the relative merits of the \u201cfree market\u201d and \u201cgovernment,\u201d we have little hope of seeing what\u2019s occurring and taking the action that\u2019s needed to make our economy work for the many, not the few."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Timothy D. Cook,Apple\u2019s chief executive, presents an updatediPhoneandother gadgetsat an event on Wednesday, several hundred of the company\u2019s invited guests will be seated in a giant auditorium in San Francisco to watch.\nMore than 5,000 miles away in Britain, members of the London Mac User Group \u2014 comprising about 90 people, many of whom are longtime Apple enthusiasts \u2014 will also be watching Mr. Cook\u2019s event closely, but via a live stream at a pub called the Sun Tavern. Along with bar snacks and pints, a bingo game and a raffle will be part of the fun. The top prize: an Apple accessory.\n\u201cWe organize a \u2018keynote bingo\u2019 for all of the catchphrases we think will come up,\u201d said Paul Foster, 46, vice chairman of the group, which is known as L.M.U.G. While the group usually holds such gatherings at a nightclub called Tiger Tiger, that venue is closed for remodeling. The club also normally meets earlier in the day, Mr. Foster said, because \u201cwe have people of many ages, but we also have a lot of retirees.\u201d\nSo it goes these days for many Mac user groups, which were once the backbone of Apple\u2019s faithful. Beginning in the late 1970s to troubleshoot and discuss Apple products, these user groups are now mostly sidelined \u2014 to pubs like the Sun Tavern, church basements and libraries \u2014 as the company has outgrown them to become the world\u2019s most valuable enterprise, selling tens of millions of smartphones and tablets every quarter.\nThe continued existence of Mac user groups is an anachronism in a world where Apple customers today can almost instantaneously get tech support online and atApple Stores. Only a few hundred user groups remain, down from several thousand at their peak in the early to mid-1990s. But they continue as a testament to loyalty and fellowship, qualities that seem quaint in a fast-moving world that sometimes favors online interaction over face-to-face encounters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about camaraderie as it is about helping people with their computers,\u201d says Scott Williams, 72, who leads the Aquidneck Island Mac User Group in Rhode Island, which draws about 25 regular attendees.\nMembers of some now-faded Mac user groups still maintain a connection. The Berkeley Macintosh Users Group, in Berkeley, Calif., filed for bankruptcy and shut down 15 years ago, yet some members continue to dine together every Thursday night.\n\u201cWhat really matters is the community, and that lives on,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-founder Raines Cohen.\nIn a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said the company was \u201chonored to have the support of loyal customers like the members of Mac user groups, many of whom have been part of the Apple community for decades.\u201d\nMac user groups sprang up in the pre-Internet, pre-App Store era, with members sharing software on floppy disks and cooking up new ways to use then-novel Apple Macintosh machines. Some made their own applications. For the next 20 years, the clubs provided tech support, taught classes and helped expand the use of Apple computers in fields like desktop publishing, accounting, education and graphic design.\n\u201cIt was a movement that believed we could solve our own problems and take care of each other,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, 48, who co-founded the Berkeley group in 1984.\nAt the time, the user groups amplified the then-unorthodox vision of Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, that a home computer could be easy to use and powerful. The groups enjoyed an open dialogue with Apple executives and employees, who sometimes dropped in on meetings. Mr. Jobs first demonstrated the1984 Macintosh computerat a meeting of the Boston Computer Society, which spawned one of the country\u2019s largest Mac user groups.\nIn the 1990s, Apple was teetering close to bankruptcy and Microsoft dominated the personal computer industry. Mr. Jobs was pushed out of Apple in 1985 and returned in 1997, when the company was on the verge of collapse. Not long after Mr. Jobs\u2019s return, Michael Dell, head of rival computer maker Dell, said that if he were Mr. Jobs, he wouldshut down Apple and return the money to shareholders. At the time, the user groups were quasi-support groups for those who had chosen to be Mac people in a PC world.\nGuy Kawasaki, Apple\u2019s former chief evangelist, likened user groups to churches that shepherded the community and the company through its darkest times.\n\u201cThey filled the void of support and enthusiasm that the market wasn\u2019t providing and created a cult feeling that kept us going,\u201d said Mr. Kawasaki, who worked two stints for Apple, once in the 1980s and once in the 1990s.\nThe clubs were \u201cthe Genius Bars of their time, and they did it out of love,\u201d said Ellen Leanse, who led Apple\u2019s first formal user-group outreach from 1985 to 1989, referring to Apple\u2019s in-store technical support.\nNow, even though iPhones dominate computing, and Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system is one of the most widely used in the world, longtime user-group members aren\u2019t entirely convinced that Apple has won.\n\u201cPeople have predicted the demise of the iPhone since Day 1, and I read stories all the time that the company could fail,\u201d said Robert Zusman, the president of the Arizona Macintosh Users Group. \u201cWe still feel like we\u2019re fighting against the evil empire, like Google or Microsoft. It\u2019s hard to reconcile that Apple could be the empire.\u201d\nThe user groups\u2019 membership rolls have, not surprisingly, shrunk over time. MacNexus in Sacramento had 1,300 members at its height in the late 1990s and is now down to about 650 members. Arizona\u2019s user group had 2,600 members at its peak and now has about 70. The Aquidneck Island monthly meeting in Rhode Island drew as many as 200 attendees in the mid-1980s.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all suffering the same thing. We\u2019re not getting new people,\u201d said Bob White, 72, a MacNexus member. \u201cA lot of us are senior citizens.\u201d\nThe clubs still provide tech support and classes to people who don\u2019t want to trawl the Internet for information or visit Genius Bars. Members do house calls for septuagenarian customers, and they repair systems that younger people have possibly never seen.\n\u201cI\u2019ve owned a Mac longer than many people at the Genius Bar have been alive,\u201d said Mr. Zusman, 55. \u201cI just helped a woman who was running [the 16-year-old system] OS 9.\u201d\nMostly, though, the user-group members like to talk about Apple and reminisce.\nAt a recent breakfast gathering in Berkeley, about a dozen former user-group members from around the country explained what made them Mac converts. For some it was the graphics, for others the typography and the photo editing.\nThey recalled pilgrimages to MacWorld, a huge trade show that focused on the Macintosh platform, and discussed inflated software prices and luminaries like Mr. Jobs and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, both of whom had given presentations to the clubs.\n\u201cDo you remember any of the other C.E.O.s?\u201d asked Felix Kramer, 66, a former New York user-group member, referring to the three executives who ran Apple before Mr. Jobs returned in 1997.\nThe chatter grew louder. Everyone recalledJohn Sculley, the former Pepsi executive whoousted Mr. Jobsas chief executive. A few mentionedMichael Spindler, who came after Mr. Sculley.\n\u201cGil Amelio, he\u2019s the other one,\u201d said Sylvia Paull, who had been on the board of Berkeley\u2019s user group. \u201cGod, remember Gil? That\u2019s when you knew things were bad.\u201d\nEveryone nodded, but most people smiled. \u201cBad? What was bad?\u201d asked Mr. Cohen. \u201cIt was an incredible revolution. We didn\u2019t give up.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "MORE SIGNS OF A SHARPER SLOWDOWN IN CHINA|Once the world\u2019s workshop, China\u2019s exports are facing theirmost protracted declines since the global financial crisis,Neil Gough writes in The New York Times. China\u2019s trade slump deepened in August\n                                                    \u2014 an indication of a sharper industrial slowdown at home and weaker demand from overseas. Exports fell 5.5 percent in August and 1.4 percent in dollar terms in the first eight months of the year.\nThe country\u2019smanufacturing sector is losing competitivenessas labor costs rise and the renminbi remains relatively strong despite its devaluation, making Chinese goods more expensive for\n                                                    foreign buyers.\nImports are falling even more steeply. They fell for the 10th month in a row in August, recording a drop of 14 percent by value. Economists blame the rout in commodity prices, but imports have fallen in\n                                                    volume too. The falling imports of industrial raw materials point toweakening domestic demand, driven by a slump in manufacturing and new housing construction.\nTheweak trade data weighed on markets, with Japan\u2019s main index, the Nikkei 225, closing 2.4 percent lower. In Shanghai, stocks initially fell when the trade figures were released, but heavy\n                                                    buying in the afternoon set off a rally. Shares closed 2.9 percent higher \u2014 a pattern seen often in recent weeks, as China\u2019s government appears to continue its efforts to support the slumping\n                                                    stock markets.\nChina\u2019s leadership made the surprise decision last month to devalue the currency by about 3 percent, therenminbi\u2019s sharpest drop in two decades. But the central bank has since intervened\n                                                    in the markets on a massive scale, fighting pressure to weaken the currency further by selling dollars and buying renminbi.\nAs a result, China isburning through foreign exchange reserves at the fastest pace yet. Reserves fell by nearly $100 billion in August alone, though they are still huge at $3.56 trillion.\nStill, analysts say that the recent devaluation was most likely too modest to give China\u2019s exports much of a boost, and that theexchange rate is still stronger than China\u2019s slowing economic growth would otherwise support.\n\nPATRICK DRAHI, A POTENTIAL PLAYER IN U.S. CABLE|When the French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi was mentioned as a potential\n                                                    suitor for Time Warner Cable, it may have been the first time many Americans had heard his name. But he isno stranger to American cable,Nicola Clark writes in The New York Times.\nMr. Drahi resigned from his job at a Philips fiber-optics lab in 1990, telling his wife he was going to try his hand in the cable industry in the United States,inspired by the significant number of American cable entrepreneurs on the Forbes list of wealthy people.\nThe young engineer then left Paris for the United States and offered his services as aconsultant to American cable investors, advising them on European acquisitions. Within three months, he was earning\n                                                    more than he had been making at Philips.\nNow, 25 years later, Mr. Drahimay be setting off on an American cable-buying spree. He bought Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest cable operator in the United States, for $9 billion in\n                                                    May.\nTime Warner accepted a $56 billion offer from Charter Communications in the end. But Altice, the publicly traded company that Mr. Drahi controls, has never been shy about making debt-driven acquisitions.\n                                                    The Suddenlink deal has set off speculation that the Amsterdam-based company, with a stock market value of nearly $28 billion, may beeyeing midsize American players, including AT&T, Cox Communications, Cablevision or Verizon.\n                                                    This in turn has attracted more investor attention to Mr. Drahi\u2019s strategy.\nIn Europe, he has focused on theconvergence of fixed-line cable, Internet services and wireless communications. \u201cPatrick believes that high-speed communications networks today are the equivalent\n                                                    to what networks for water, electricity and railways were to economic development in the 19th and early 20th centuries,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Yomtov, a former investment banker at HSBC who runs\n                                                    Altice\u2019s main French cable and telecommunications business, Numericable-SFR.\nAnalysts estimate that Altice has thefinancial firepower to pursue up to \u20ac30 billion in debt-driven deals, provided that interest rates remain low and the group continues to generate sufficient\n                                                    revenue to service its debts. The company\u2019s borrowing strategy has made some French leaders nervous about its acquisition methods. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, worried that it\n                                                    might one day require a government bailout to preserve jobs.\nMr. Drahi thinks these concerns are overblown.\u201cWhen you are focused on debt reduction, it\u2019s because you have a growth problem,\u201dMr. Drahi told a French legislative committee.\n                                                    \u201cIf I stop my so-called bulimic development, in five years, I would have no debts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then what? That would be stupid, because I will not have grown for five years.\u201d\n\nDECODING STEVE JOBS|The debate overwhether Steve Jobs deserves to be so admired continues, nearly four years after his\n                                                    death,Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.\nWhen he died, \u201cthe grief for Jobs seemed to go beyond the products he left behind,\u201d said Alex Gibney who directed the documentary \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine.\u201d \u201cWe mourned the man himself.\n                                                    But why?\u201d\nThe documentary Mr. Gibney directed makes the case that Jobs does not deserve his iconic status, but these efforts to paint Jobs as a hero or a villain miss a larger truth, Mr Sorkin argues:\u201cHe can be both and still be worthy of acclaim.\u201d\nMost people are flawed. The influential can be even more so. Although Mr. Gibney held out thatJohn Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr.were more worthy than Jobs of the outpouring of grief that followed\n                                                    their deaths, they were troubled too.\nLennon\u2019s son, Julian, has talked about how he never experienced the peace and love that his father would talk about to the rest of the world. King has been chronicled as a serial adulterer.\nJobs also defies simple characterization. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s famed designer, recalled how he pulled Jobs aside for being too tough on his team , and asked him\n                                                    to be nicer. \u201cWell, why?\u201d Jobs replied. \u201cBecause I care about the team,\u201d Mr. Ive responded. \u201cAndhe said this brutally, brilliantly insightful thing, which was,\n                                                    \u2018No, Jony, you\u2019re just really vain,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ive recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just want people to like you, and I\u2019m surprised at you because I thought you really\n                                                    held the work up as the most important, not how you believed you were perceived by other people.\u2019\u201d\nThis anecdote and the documentary have left Mr. Sorkin wondering:Would you rather do something extraordinary that benefits the lives of millions or be liked by several hundred?And does it have to\n                                                    be an either-or question?\n\nON THE AGENDA|Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, will speak about the outlook for monetary policy\n                                                    in the United States at 5:15 p.m. at Northwestern University\u2019s Center for International Macroeconomics.\nLeon G.

The contractors who\n                                                    arrived in droves have departed, and the enormous embankment where Gazprom built a gravel road, encroaching on the village\u2019s cemetery, comes to a dead end at a rocky cliff.\nRussia\u2019s experiences have highlighted the challenge facing those dreaming of an Arctic Klondike. Shifts in the global economy, fierce opposition from environmentalists and formidable logistical obstacles\n                                                    have alltempered enthusiasm for the Arctic\u2019s imagined riches.\nThe world today is awash in oil and natural gas, largely because of the shale revolution in the United States. Saudi Arabia and other states around the Persian Gulf are producing at maximum levels. If the\n                                                    nuclear agreement with Iran is approved, Iran\u2019s reserves could flood the market. Theprice of oil has plummetedfrom more than $90 a barrel to less than $50.\nAfter years of planning and delays, Shell\u2019s drilling project in the stormy waters of the Chukchi Sea is being closely monitored by the industry as amake-or-break test of the viability of production in the Arctic.\n                                                    Shell has already spent $7 billion and has had to deal with dogged protests, harsh weather and an accident in July that gouged a hole in one of its ships after it struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutian\n                                                    Islands.\nNow, even optimistic projections suggest the Arcticmight not prove to be as transformative as once imagined. According to Rystad Energy, a global consultancy based in Norway, production from offshore\n                                                    fields in or near the Arctic could double between 2015 and 2025 to 1.4 million barrels a day, which would still be less than 2 percent of current global production.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nMitsui Sumitomo of Japan to Acquire British Insurer Amlin|The deal is the latest by a Japanese insurer seeking to expand its operations\n                                                    globally, as insurers seek growth opportunities outside their home market.NYT \u00bb\n\nDoctors\u2019 Association Sees Harm in Insurance Mergers|The American Medical Association says the proposed merger of Anthem\n                                                    and Cigna, along with that of Aetna and Humana, could reduce competition in 154 metropolitan areas in 23 states.NYT \u00bb\n\nAustralia\u2019s Woodside Petroleum Bids for Oil Search|Woodside Petroleum has made an all-share takeover bid for Oil Search,\n                                                    placing a big bet on Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuels despite the steep fall in global oil prices.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nTesco Sells South Korean Business Homeplus for Over $6 Billion|The British grocery chain sold the Homeplus Group to a consortium\n                                                    of investors led by the Asian private-equity firm MBK Partners as it looked to improve its performance.NYT \u00bb\n\nBlackRock Buys British Garden Centers|The world\u2019s largest asset manager bought a portfolio of eight garden centers around\n                                                    Britain for $171.1 million from the property investor LaSalle Investment Management, a fresh signal that investors are digging deeper into the property sector in their hunt for yield.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nE.U. to Approve GE\u2019s $17 Billion Alstom Deal|The European Union is set to approve General Electric\u2019s $17 billion\n                                                    acquisition of Alstom\u2019s power business on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing two people familiar with the matter.

        "title": "Apple Plus Herm\u00e8s: Smartwatch Dream Team or Weird Mash-Up?",
        "fulltext": "On Wednesday, Apple once again managed to overshadow the start of fashion month byannouncingat an event in San Francisco that it was teaming up with Herm\u00e8s ona new version of the Apple Watch.\nThe creators of two of the most iconic accessories of our time, the Birkin bag and the iPhone, working together? Zowie!\n\u201cI see it as the establishment of an alliance in excellence; like horse and carriage, a perfect team,\u201d Pierre-Alexis Dumas, artistic director of Herm\u00e8s, said ina statement.\nBut, though I understand the collaboration is a strategic move for both companies \u2014 easing an even bigger push into the luxury and fashion market by Apple; Herm\u00e8s, which has a tendency to the staid, gets a frisson of cutting-edge cool \u2014 I\u2019m not entirely convinced by the result.\nAt least not as it looked on screen, behind Tim Cook\u2019s head. There will be a joint event in Paris on Oct. 4 to unveil the watch to the fashion flock, so perhaps I\u2019ll change my mind. Never say never, and all that. Especially because it should, in theory, be my dream come true. And I mean that in an entirely personal way.\nAfter all, I wear a double-strap Herm\u00e8s Cape Cod watch and have for a long time (it was a gift from my younger brother). This past spring, I abandoned it briefly in favor of an Apple Watch, but we never really bonded, for a variety of reasons I later detailed ina columnthat provoked a surprising amount of reaction. So much so that I was asked to appear on CNBC to talk about it. By that time, I had reverted to my Herm\u00e8s watch.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me,\u201d one of the TV hosts said during our conversation, \u201cthat if Apple could make a watch that looked like that\u201d \u2014 she pointed at my Herm\u00e8s watch \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019d wear it?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d I said.\nDump that in the clich\u00e9 bucket called \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d Because now Apple has.\nKind of. And that\u2019s the problem.\nThe Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s is effectively a hybrid. It has the same Apple Watch body that was unveiled in September \u2014 in the same sizes (38 millimeters and 42 millimeters); and with the same weight, albeit with improved functionalities. But it adds digital versions of some signature Herm\u00e8s watch faces \u2014 the Clipper, Cape Cod and Espace \u2014 though they go to sleep, like all Apple Watch faces, when your arm isn\u2019t moving, to save battery. There is also a trio of signature leather Herm\u00e8s straps in different colors: the Single Tour (a thin strap), the Double Tour (a strap that wraps twice around your wrist) and the Cuff (a wide leather bracelet) style.\nThat sounds \u2014 and looks, on screen \u2014 good, but it doesn\u2019t actually solve any of the problems I originally had with the Apple Watch, most of which had to do with its weight and dimensions vis-\u00e0-vis both my wrist and my ability to use the screen, as well as the fact I didn\u2019t find it technically additive to my life (but that\u2019s just me).\nThis could change, I know. My colleague Farhad Manjooposited as muchto me in June. Theoretically, I suppose, you could get the Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s strap now, and just keep swapping out the watch bodies as they improve or shrink.\nAnd the Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s is less expensive than the traditional Herm\u00e8s Cape Cod, for example. The latter retails for $2,900; the new Double Tour with 38-millimeter case is priced at $1,250. It fills the accessible luxury niche between the $549 Apple Watch andthe gold Apple Watch Editionat $12,000. \u201cAccessible\u201d being a relative word here.\nBut the most interesting thing about all this is less the product itself than the fact this is the first time Apple has admitted that fashion does fashion better than Apple can.\nWhich is actually a pretty big shift, given that its traditional attitude has been that Apple does everything better than anyone else.\nI still think there\u2019s a ways to go: It seems to me, to really make something new, you have to actually make it new. That means Apple and Herm\u00e8s would have had to start from scratch (or scratch-ish) to make a collaborative watch, as opposed to simply cutting-and-pasting each of their products into one. And that\u2019s a truly provocative, and disruptive, idea.\nYet this collaboration sends some interesting signals about the future of wearables, and the way fashion and tech are going to have to work together. So while, at this stage, I don\u2019t want to wear an Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s, I definitely want to see what\u2019s going to happen next."

Paul Mozur and Jane Perlez reported on Tuesday that during Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to the United States later this month, the Chinese Internet czar Lu Wei, who\n                                        oversees China\u2019s restrictions on overseas Internet companies, plans to hold a tech forum in Seattle.

And Uber, the ride-hailing\n                                        company, said on Tuesday that it hadraised an additional $1.2 billionto enter more than 100 cities in China over the next year.\nIn some non-China tech news,Dell announced it would begin selling the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tabletto large corporate customers \u2014 an unusual development since Dell typically sells only its own hardware. And in a move with cultural significance, Intel said itplanned to end its supportfor the prestigious Science Talent Search, one of the best-known science and mathematics competitions for American high school students.\nThat brings us to today, when Apple will hold an event to introduce new products.

        "fulltext": "Despite many reports to the contrary, not everyone rushes out to get a new iPhone every time Apple has an upgrade.\nFor those of you who have waited a (phone) generation or two and maybe you\u2019re worried your phone is starting to act a little wonky, now may be the time to make a change. Ina review of the iPhone 6s and the 6s Plus,\n                                        Brian X. Chen says an upgrade makes sense for people with phones two years old or more. The screen is bigger, the processor more powerful, and there are a number of different storage options.\nBut think twice about spending $650 for the 16-gigabyte version. A new feature called Live Photos makes photos twice as large as those on older phones \u2014 so 16 gigs may not be enough for people who take a lot\n                                        of photos. Instead, think about going to $750 for 64 gigs and $850 for 128 gigs.\nFor people with newer phones, the main new features of the 6s and 6s Plus may not be enough to justify the upgrade. The first, called Live Photos, keeps a \u201cbuffer of a second and a half\u2019s worth of motion\n                                        frames before and after you take the photo.\u201d You may want this for those little moments when you didn\u2019t expect to want to take a video \u2014 until it\u2019s too late and the moment has passed.\nThe second, significant new feature is called 3D Touch. It allows the phone\u2019s screen to be sensitive to how hard you are pressing, assigning different tasks to light and hard touches. But it could be some time\n                                        before enough third-party app makers can support this capability.\nIt is an interesting feature, but whether it\u2019s compelling depends on how voraciously you need the newest gear."

Slower speeds or unstable network connections can cause the buffering and stuttering interruptions that make streaming video unpleasant to watch.\nFor streaming video in the 720p resolution, a broadband speed of 6 megabits per second (or faster) is recommended. Apple\u2019s guidelines for watching video in standard definition \u2014 sometimes referred to as 480p resolution \u2014 advise a minimum speed of 2.5 megabits per second.\nIf you are paying for a broadband package, it should provide adequate speeds for high-definition streaming, but you may have to do some poking around. You can test your home network\u2019s general connection speed on the computer at sites likeMegaPath Speakeasy Speed Test,Ookla SpeedtestorBandwidthPlace. If your network comes up slow, contact your service provider.\nIf your network speed meets the guidelines for streaming video, check the Apple TV\u2019s network connection and signal strength: From the device\u2019s main screen, select Settings, then General and About to see signal-strength information. If the signal is weak, move the network router closer to the TV, or away from furniture and other obstacles that may be interfering with the network signal. Rebooting the router and the Apple TV box may also help, as well asinstalling any available updates for the Apple TV\u2019s system software. Theofficial support pagefor the product may have further advice.\nApple has not significantly updated its Apple TV hardwarein several years. Those pondering the purchase of the device may want to wait until the company\u2019sSept. 9 product eventto see if a fresh model may be coming."
