        "title": "Tesla Optimists Are in Retreat",
        "fulltext": "Investors punished Tesla for cutting its growth forecast on Wednesday, sending shares tumbling nearly 6 percent lower in premarket trading, despite Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to play down worries about slowing demand amid broader worries about the economy and growing competition.\nIt\u2019s been a drastic fall.Almost a year ago, Tesla raced into the exclusive trillion-dollar club \u2014 joining Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet\u2019s Google with market capitalizations in the 13-figure range. Recap: Tesla bulls set off a rally back then after the company\u2019s deal to sell 100,000 cars to Hertz.\nOn Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s market cap closed at just below $700 billion. Investors continue to fret about recession fears and rising interest rates, which will make car-financing more pricey. Undaunted, Musktold investorsthat the company would return to those lofty valuations \u2014 and even become the world\u2019s most valuable company, bigger than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. \u201cI will not let you down, no matter what it takes,\u201d he added in atweet.\nInvestors seem more focused on the here and now, particularly that Tesla missed out on its shipping targets.\nAnother concern: whether Musk will need to sell shares to finance his roughly $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He\u2019s alreadysold about $15.5 billion this year. Musk revealed little about his plans yesterday, butdid admitthat he\u2019s \u201cobviously overpaying,\u201d for the tech company.\nBig Tesla shareholdershave been lobbying for a share buyback.Musk addressed this request yesterday, saying a \u201cmeaningful buyback\u201d in the $5 billion to $10 billion range could come next year.\nIn the meantime, Tesla is struggling with the new realities of rising commodity prices and slowing global demand. AsThe Times\u2019s Neal Boudette reports, the company sold roughly 20,000 fewer cars last quarter than it made, and it narrowly missed analysts\u2019 profit expectations.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s favorite banker and a firm backed by Michael Dell team up.BDT, the merchant bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs banker Byron Trott, said it wouldmerge with MSD Capital, an investment firm born from Dell\u2019s family office. Trott, whom Buffett has praised over the years, will be co-C.E.O. of the combined firm with Gregg Lemkau, another former Goldman executive who leads MSD. \u201cWe believe strongly that our firms share a common mission and similar cultures,\u201d BDT executives wrote to investors, \u201cwhich will underpin our efforts to come together and unlock the full capabilities of our combined firm.\u201d\nCould market turmoil like Britain\u2019s happen in the U.S.?Officials at the Fed and the White House quizzed investors on whether the kind of market meltdown that affected British government bondswas possible there, The Times reports. The answer: probably, but not imminently.\nBritain\u2019s government may be on the brink.Support for Prime Minister Liz Truss appeared to be collapsing, as an increasing number of lawmakers in her own party called for her tostep down. Truss has had a torrid 24 hours, including thefiring of her home secretaryand one lawmaker\u2019s description of her government \u201cas a shambles and a disgrace.\u201d\nThe Biden administration offers an olive branch to OPEC.The U.S. has quietly assured the oil production cartel that itwon\u2019t be subjectto the same sort of price caps that the Group of 7 countries are imposing on Russia, Reuters reports. OPEC and Russia teamed up this month to announce drastic cuts to production, drawing President Biden\u2019s public ire.\nA federal appeals court undercuts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s reach.A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the bureau wasunconstitutionally funded, which negated the agency\u2019s ability to regulate payday lending. A spokesman for the agency disputed the ruling, which was made by judges appointed by former President Donald Trump.\nOn Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, seemed to sum up the big fears hanging over the economy when hetweeted his concernabout a pending slowdown, warning his 5.3 million Twitter followers to \u201cbatten down the hatches.\u201d\nOne group that seems to be defying that advice: consumer goods giants, which continue to flex their pricing power. Squeezed by higher commodity prices, firms have passed on higher costs to shoppers by raising prices on products like cereal, detergent and diapers.\nConsumers have been willing to pay up.Elevating prices to offset costs has enabled the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble \u2014 which both reported healthy third-quarter earnings on Wednesday \u2014 to beat analysts\u2019 expectations despite selling fewer goods,reports The Times\u2019s Isabella Simonetti.Nestl\u00e9, the Swiss maker of Kit Kat, Nespresso coffee capsules and Purina pet food, raised prices by 9.5 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2021, and up from a 7.7 percent price increase in the previous quarter. The U.S.-basedProcter & Gamble, whose brands include Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, raised prices by 9 percent. Last week, PepsiCo disclosed it hasincreased prices17 percent on an annualized basis on its snacks and drinks.\nThe global inflation crisis could sap any short-term gains.P.&G. said it expected a drop in sales for the fiscal year.Nestl\u00e9, in contrast, is sticking with its growth forecast. This comes as consumer prices in most advanced economies are rising at or near a 40-year high, even as central banks ratchet up interest rates to rein in inflation. The cost of one essential food staple \u2014 bread \u2014 hasskyrocketed.\nA few hours after P.&G. reported results, unnerved investors sent risky assets, including most stocks, lower. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help to have Jeff Bezos join the recession chorus,\u201d Quincy Krosby, an equity strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a client note.\nDozens of the publicly traded shell companies formed during theSPAC boomare now running out of time to make a deal.\nSPACs raise money in the hopes of buying a private company that is looking to go public without a traditional I.P.O. But there\u2019s a catch: SPAC sponsors must complete a deal within one to two years. If they fail to do so, they have to return the money \u2014 taking a loss on the millions in fees that go to lawyers, bankers and others who help set up the investment vehicles.\nThe rocky market and generally lackluster performance of SPACs post-deal have made pulling off an acquisition more difficult. There are533 SPACsthat have raised money from investors still seeking a suitable acquisition. Of those, about 79 will hit their deadline by the end of the year,according to SPACInsider, which calculated the number for DealBook.\n\u201cThis is for sure an unbelievably difficult period for this market,\u201dsaid Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who runs SPACInsider. This year, 45 SPACs have liquidated or announced they will, returning as much as $12 billion to their original investors, according to the group. Last month, Chamath Palihapitiya, once a prominent and enthusiastic sponsor of SPACs, announced he wasclosing two of his dealsand giving the money back.\nBut quitting is about to get more expensive.The Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s1 percent tax on stock buybacksapplies to SPAC liquidations as well. Starting Jan. 1, sponsors will have to pay the tax if they liquidate.\nParadoxically, the SPAC is making a modest comeback.October is on pace to see more SPAC deals than June, July and August combined. But as their clocks run out, SPAC sponsors appear to be getting less picky. Parsec Capital Acquisition Corp. raised $86 million a little over a year ago, and its sponsors were looking for a space-themed merger candidate. This week it found a dance partner: Enteractive Media, which makes videos for casinos and gambling websites.\n\u2014 John Mack, a former Morgan Stanley C.E.O., discussing being diagnosed with dementia in his new memoir, \u201cUp Close and All in: Life Lessons From a Wall Street Warrior.\u201dBloomberg\u2019s review of the bookdescribes it as \u201ca rare opportunity to hear power\u2019s unvarnished internal monologue.\u201d\nIn the latest expansion of its antitrust powers, the Biden administration successfully pushed directors of several companiesto step down, after suggesting that they might be violating a seldom-enforced provision of federal competition law.\nAmong those who stepped down from a board:Larry Illg, who had served at Udemy; Randall Winn, who had been at Definitive Healthcare; Gordon Hunter, who had been at CTS; and Joanne Isham, who had been at Redwire. Three directors at SolarWinds also resigned.\nAt issue is the idea of interlocking directorates,where people simultaneously serve on the boards of ostensible competitors. The Justice Department cited Section 8 of the Clayton Act \u2014 \u201can important, but underenforced, part of our antitrust laws,\u201d according to Jonathan Kanter of the department\u2019s antitrust division \u2014 as a warning to the executives.\n\u201cCompetitors sharing officers or directors further concentrates power and creates the opportunity to exchange competitively sensitive information and facilitate coordination \u2014 all to the detriment of the economy and the American public,\u201d Kanter added. (None of the companies admitted to liability for breaking the law.)\nThe move is also a warning shot against private equity,which Kanter has suggested would be anantitrust targetfor its efforts to roll up companies in various industries. The former directors at SolarWinds represented the buyout firm Thoma Bravo, which still owns a big stake in the company. (While not a private equity firm, Prosus \u2014 where Illg is an executive \u2014 is a huge tech investor.)\nDeals\nPhilip Morrisraised its takeover bid for Swedish Match, a maker of smokeless tobacco, to nearly $16 billion, and agreed to pay $2.7 billion to regain the U.S. rights for the IQOS line of heated tobacco products.

        "title": "Which Watches Will Be the Classics of Tomorrow?",
        "fulltext": "GENEVA \u2014 When is it time to turn the page?\nEven thoughtheir resale valueshave slid from recent supercharged heights, demand continues to be strong for Patek Philippe\u2019s Nautilus, Audemars Piguet\u2019s Royal Oak and Rolex\u2019s Daytona \u2014 designs that have been around for half a century or more.\nBefore many of today\u2019s collectors were born.\nSo brands \u201cdon\u2019t have to make something new,\u201d said Manuel Emch, the longtime watch industry executive now leading the Swiss brand Louis Erard. \u201cThis is why we see most of the design creativity in the 21st century \u2014 several of the future classics \u2014 among the independents, as they design something from scratch.\u201d\nAnd what makes a design a likely classic? According to collectors, designers and other watch experts, characteristics such as recognizability, wearability, innovation, experimentation and disruption all come into play. A world first, classic inspiration or bit of craziness can\u2019t hurt either.\nHere are nine models introduced in recent years that just might create the buzz in 2070.\nRecognizability\nThe Ressence Zero, introduced in 2011, has one of the most distinctive designs that\u2019s been created for a mechanical watch in recent years. Its separate discs and rings for hours, minutes and seconds rotate on their own axes, making complete revolutions around the dial every hour.\nThe novel mechanical movement \u2014 combined with tapered indicators painted onto the discs and rings, in lieu of traditional hands \u2014 drew special interest at the 2011 Geneva Time Exhibition, where the Belgian brand won the first of several prizes.\nAxel Kufus, professor of design at the Berlin University of the Arts, was on the jury at that show (and, for full disclosure, I was its chairman). Recently, Mr. Kufus said the Zero Series and its successors, which feature design improvements like a curved case and movement, hidden crown, and an oil-filled dial that improves readability, are still among his favorite watch designs of the 21st century.\n\u201cI love that the whole dial is moving, and it is fantastic to see how you can use old symbols and still create something completely new,\u201d Mr. Kufus \u2014 himself the designer of two watches for the German brand Nomos Glash\u00fctte \u2014 said during a video call from Berlin.\nWearability\nFor its fashion-oriented universe, Cartier in 2007 introduced the round Ballon Bleu, featuring a metal hoop to protect its sapphire-capped crown.\nWhen Jessica Owens started collecting watches in 2013, the New York City resident said she often saw the Ballon Bleu on wrists around town. \u201cIt is one of the early watches considered unisex, but you still find it mainly on women,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sure the bracelet on the early models is part of why it has become a modern icon.\u201d\nAccording to Ms. Owens, the Ballon Bleu followed another contemporary unisex classic:the J12 from Chanel. The extremely scratch-resistant sports watch, known for its three-row bracelet and unusual ceramic shine, continues to be made in black and white today.\nThe J12 was introduced in 1999, but seemed to take almost a decade to achieve mainstream approval. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2012, the J12 was the ultimate status watch, even beyond Rolex and Cartier for fashion watch women,\u201d said Ms. Owens, one of the new generation of young collectors who has turned her passion into a full-time career. In her case, she became a marketing coordinator with the online Swiss watch magazine Watchonista.\nFor something to become an enduring classic, Ms. Owens said, \u201cit is all about recognizability and wearability\u201d \u2014 and some amount of disruption. \u201cI truly believe a classic should lack complications and be wearable on an everyday basis. Why? People like simplicity and clean dials,\u201d she said. \u201cJust look at older classics like the Nautilus, Royal Oak, Tank and Submariner: date only, no other complications.\u201d\nInnovation\nIn 2003, Urwerk all but took wrists into outer space with the UR-103, a combination of retro style and futuristic design that proved to be pivotal for the fledgling brand, founded in 1997 \u2014 as well as for the independent watchmaking scene, which was still in its infancy at the time.\nThe avant-garde, sci fi-inspired case of the UR-103 organically merged a square with a circle, and had a chunky crown protruding from the top of the case.\n\u201cThis phenomenon, where two different geometrical shapes meet, is called durchdringungand schnittlinie in German, and it makes the watch look more complex than it is,\u201d the chief designer and co-founder of Urwerk, Martin Frei, said during a conversation early last month at Geneva Watch Days. \u201cWhen I designed the UR-103, I thought it would be possible to produce it by hand. But it turned out the case shape was so complex that it forced us to work with CNC (computer numerical control) machines, which since then have been a crucial design tool for us \u2014 and we tend to push the limits for what is possible to make with such machines.\u201d\nExperimentation\nBefore the UR-103 came on the scene, another innovative take on retrofuturistic design had appeared in 2001: the Richard Mille RM 001 with a tourbillon escapement.\nThe timepiece \u2014 a new interpretation of the traditional tonneau, or barrel shape \u2014 was a technical feast and a material exploration made very visible. The architecture of the movement provided extreme shock resistance, something previously unheard-of in sensitive tourbillons. The first 11 of the 17 RM 001 watches made employed a PVD (physical vapor deposition) coating on the movement, which is made of German silver, whereas the last six used titanium for the visible main plate.\n\u201cThis very three-dimensional, mechanical depth reminds us that time is the fourth dimension,\u201d Mr. Kufus, the Berlin design professor, said. \u201cAnd I like how it is not skeletonized, but it is staging the main mechanical structures on the main plate in layers \u2014 and a similar art of layering is also used on the external parts of the case.\u201d The watch\u2019s design laid the foundation for a brand that now is estimated to be seventh among Swiss watch brands by sales, according to theannual report released in March by Morgan Stanley and LuxeConsult.\nDisruption\nSpeaking of sales, no list of future classics from the 21st century would be complete without the Apple Watch.\nIn its seven-year existence, this smartwatch has rocketed beyond the traditional timepiece: In 2021, Apple Watch sales were estimated to have hit 38.2 million, according to the industry analyst Counterpoint, while Switzerland exported15.7 million watches, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\u201cThe most iconic watch product in the 21st century is definitely the Apple Watch,\u201d Mr. Emch of Louis Erard said.\nBeno\u00eet Mintiens, the industrial designer who founded Ressence, said that at least the smartwatch has young people wearing something on their wrists. If you had never worn watch, it \u201cwould feel awkward if you want to have a mechanical watch at a later stage in life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t agree with watch industry people who say things like, \u2018You cannot say Apple and watch in the same sentence.\u2019 If that is your approach, then who will buy your watches in 10 years?\u201d\nWorld first\nThe A. Lange & S\u00f6hne Zeitwerk is digital in the classical, horological sense of the word, showing the time in digits rather than with hands.\nWhen, in 2009, the German house introduced this chunky yet elegant design, it featured a world first combination in wristwatches: both jumping hours and minutes. Mr. Kufus explained: \u201cIt is based on a genius idea of three discs circling behind the apertures. But I find its thickness and heaviness somewhat anachronistic. It is a bit of an SUV for the wrist.\u201d\nMr. Emch agreed that the Zeitwerk has one of the strongest dial designs of the 21st century. \u201cBut to be a real classic, it should also have a new case,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile this is merely a slight design development for the Lange 1 case \u2014 which to me is a true icon.\u201d\nInspiration\n\u201cTo me,\u201d said the freelance watch designer Eric Giroud, \u201cone of the most iconic watches of the 21st century is the Chronom\u00e8tre Bleu by F.P. Journe.\u201d\nMr. Giroud, who has created most of MB&F\u2019s designs and worked for many large brands, said this timepiece, released in 2009, \u201cappears simple, yet this is high-end watchmaking in every sense of the word.\u201d\nThe case is made of tantalum, a rare blue-gray metal that resists corrosion. Its design, which features an off-center small seconds dial between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock, \u201chas a strong inspiration of classical watchmaking with a complement of very modern details, such as the hands and this mirror-lacquered blue dial, which is very contemporary,\u201d Mr. Giroud said. \u201cIt is the tension between the different inspirations that give this watch its unique elegance and a magical touch where you feel, \u2018Wow, cool, I need one,\u2019 without really knowing why.\u201d\nCraziness\nThe Bulgari Octo Finissimo Automatic, introduced in 2017, is a monochromatic matte gray, multifaceted, sharply angular watch \u2014 a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois of round, square and octagon shapes that is so complex that it is rarely copied, despite its huge success.\nIt also managed, at 5.15 millimeters thick, to take the record as the world\u2019s thinnest automatic watch at the time that it came on the market.\n\u201cThe Octo Finissimo Automatic was a milestone,\u201d said Fabrizio Buonamassa Stigliani, Bulgari\u2019s executive director of product creation and the designer of the Octo Finissimo series. As well as, he said, \u201ca bit of Italian craziness.\u201d\nWhich of these watches will eventually enter the horological pantheon? It is too early to say, but auction trends could be an indicator.\n\u201cThe F.P. Journe Chronom\u00e8tre Bleu has performed well, and earlier models from Journe have been skyrocketing,\u201d said Mikael Wallhagen, the European head of watches at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cThis makes sense if you look at the design, the quality and the fantastic level of watchmaking. All F.P. Journes have a touch of contemporary design, combined with an obvious flirtation with old wall and table clocks.\u201d\nMr. Wallhagen also noted that \u201cA. Lange & S\u00f6hne iscoming up more and more at auction. We have sold a few Zeitwerks lately, but I must say the brand\u2019s earlier models from the 1990s are performing much better.\u201d\n\u201cRichard Mille has had a few years of rising prices, but these have slowed down a bit,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the various models of Bulgari Octo Finissimo are starting to climb.\u201d\nBut then, Mr. Buonamassa Stigliani pointed out: \u201cIf you don\u2019t evolve the design, you end up with a vintage product. And if you don\u2019t respect the past and go too far, people don\u2019t find the connection with the past, nor with the future.\n\u201cAs a designer,\u201d he added, \u201cyou have to respect the past to find solutions for the future.\u201d"

        "title": "Why USB-C Is the Meryl Streep of Cables",
        "fulltext": "If you bought a new phone, computer, game console or some other such device in the past few years, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ve been charging it using a cable with at least one end that looks something like a squashed Tic Tac \u2014 a rectangular plug with rounded corners,abouta tenth of an inch long and a third of an inch wide.\nOfficially, per thecoalition of tech companiesthat determines this sort of thing, a connector of this shape is known as Universal Serial Bus Type-C. But its friends just call it USB-C \u2014 and I suspect that sooner or later we will all grow enormously friendly with this capable little cable.\nUSB-C\u2019s singular selling point is universality. It was designed to plug in to more or less everything to accomplish more or less anything, thereby cutting down on the number and variety of cables one needs to navigate digital life. This may strike you as a small blessing, but these aren\u2019t times to scoff at small blessings. Insofar as it is possible to find not just utility but something like joy in the mitigation of trivial but nevertheless regularly agonizing inconveniences of modern life, USB-C might be one of the more life-changing innovations of our age.\nTechies reading this will argue I\u2019m blowing smoke. USB-C is not even new; the first devices bearing these ports went on sale in 2015.\nTrue, but realizing USB-C\u2019s full potential has taken some time. The technology has had to overcome numeroustechnical challenges, and it has had to achieve a certain critical mass across the device ecosystem. Only this week, finally, did USB-C\u2019s one-cable dream start to become inevitable. On Monday, in an effort to reduce electronic waste, the European Union\u2019s member statesapproveda rule requiring USB-C charging ports on \u201call new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, hand-held video game consoles and portable speakers, e-readers, keyboards, mice, portable navigation systems, earbuds and laptops\u201d sold in the E.U.\nThe rule will phase in over a few years, but it has already achieved results with the main holdout, Apple, which had gone all-in on USB-C for its computers and tablets but stuck to its proprietary connector, called Lightning, for the iPhone. An Apple executivetold an interviewerat The Wall Street Journal\u2019s tech conference on Tuesday that even though Apple opposed the law, it would \u201chave to comply.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if this means that all iPhones or just European ones will get a USB-C port. Here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s the former.\nThe European rule applies just to charging, but USB-C does much more. It is the Meryl Streep of cables, capable of playing any role better than any other choice. In addition to charging, a USB-C cable can be used to transmit video signals from your computer to your monitor or TV; to transfer huge amounts of data at blazing speeds to and from devices like cameras, external drives and other peripherals; and, perhaps best of all, to do many of these things at the same time, so that you can accomplish more than one task with one cord.\nFor instance, the one USB-C cable strung between my laptop and the monitor on my desk isferrying data and power in opposite ways simultaneously\u2014 the monitor (plugged into a wall socket) is charging the laptop, while the laptop is sending images to the screen. This is far superior to HDMI, the video cable I might have used before USB-C \u2014 HDMI cannot carry enough power to charge a laptop, meaning I\u2019d have to use it in addition to a laptop charger. In small ways like this, USB-C has lightened my load. Because a majority of my devices now use this single connector, I\u2019ve lately found myself traveling with far fewer chargers, cables and dongles (the terrible name for the numerous adapters and other tiny devices that plug into our computers).\nIt\u2019s also saved me some storage space. One weekend this summer I put on some calming music and mounted an archaeological expedition through the tangled mess of old cables stuffed in forgotten corners of my house.\nMy cleanup was a tortured trip through tech history. The USB standard was introduced in 1996 as a way to create compatibility among devices, but it\u2019s striking how many varieties of USB there have been in the years since \u2014 each new one undermining the goal of standardization. First there was the classic, full-size USB \u2014 that ubiquitous rectangular plug about the size of the end of your thumb. Then we had USB-B (a square-ish plug found often on printers), followed by Mini-USB and Micro-USB, the tiny plugs found on many non-Apple devices since the 2000s. Amazingly, through all these versions, designers repeated the same flaw \u2014 every variety of USB until USB-C could be plugged in only if it faced the correct direction, making charging anything in the dark a furiously fiddly process. (USB-C, like Lightning, is symmetrical, so you can plug it in in any direction.)\nPerhaps the biggest mess was in TVs and computer monitors, where new cables came seemingly every few years. When I was a kid you connected a TV to a VCR or Nintendo using RCA cables (a braid of two or three colored round plugs). Then came component video (similar braids with various colors), S-video (round plug, many holes) and eventually HDMI, the trapezoidal plug found on most TVs today. Monitors, meanwhile, have gone through a staggering number of cable types \u2014 VGA, SVGA, DVI, Micro-DVI, Mini-DVI, DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort and now HDMI, Mini HDMI and Micro HDMI. Is it any wonder that people have trouble setting up their home entertainment systems?\nIt\u2019s hard to fault manufacturers for cycling through these varieties: As our devices got more powerful and their shapes changed, the cables had to change, too. One reason I\u2019m optimistic that USB-C will stick around for a while is that it\u2019s coming along during a new era of stability in tech. Next year\u2019s smartphone or tablet is going to be only slightly different from this year\u2019s. And USB-C is designed to change with the times \u2014 even though USB-C ports will get more powerful over time, your older USB-C devices will still have a place to plug in.\nThere will be exceptions, of course; in tech there always are. Lots of wearable devices \u2014 things like smart watches and fitness trackers \u2014 will continue to use their own specialized connector. Other connectors will stick around just because of market dynamics. I\u2019d expect HDMI to linger because there are just too many devices that use it.\nEven with these holdouts, though, USB-C\u2019s kingdom is sure to be vast and its reign will be long. One cable that works for (pretty much) everything \u2014 sometimes, dreams do come true.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhone Powers Growth, but Signs Point to a Slowdown",
        "fulltext": "When Apple released the 16th version of its iPhone in September, some tech reviewers described it as an incremental improvement over earlier models.\nApple\u2019s customers didn\u2019t care. They bought the new iPhone 14 in droves.\nOn Thursday, the world\u2019s most valuable company said that strong demand for iPhones helped it increase total revenue by 8 percent to $90.1 billion for the three months that ended in September, bringing an end to a fiscal year in which it posted sales gains every quarter. The company reported that profits rose nearly 1 percent to $20.7 billion.\nThe company said iPhone sales increased 10 percent to $42.6 billionin the quarter that ended in September, a major deceleration from the 47 percent increase it reported in the same period last year. The signature product accounts for about half of the company\u2019s total revenue.\nDuring a call with analysts, Apple said its business was slowing down in the current quarter, with a deceleration in sales of Macs and services. In noting the slowdown, it joined peers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft in warning that their business are being hobbled as the economy weakens.\nThough Apple\u2019s earnings exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts, its shares initially fell in after-hours trading before turning around and rising more than 1 percent to $146.20. The shares had fallen 3 percent before the market closed.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that the company was facing inflationary pressure on wages and device components. Those factors, as well as a strengthening dollar, contributed to price increases on devices sold internationally.\nSome Wall Street analysts have pointed to Apple as a safe haven for investors amid a slowing economy. In a year when smartphone sales are contracting, the iPhone has expanded and stolen market share. The company\u2019s other businesses, including the App Store, Apple Watch and AirPods, are also growing, though they don\u2019t come close to the scale of iPhone sales.\nOther analysts are unconvinced. They see the economic slowdown buffeting the company\u2019s two largest markets, the United States and China, and worry that Apple will be caught in the downturn. They predict that the iPhone\u2019s business will dim, just as sales of Macs and iPads have cooled as students and workers return to classrooms and offices.\n\u201cApple is human,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cNot surprisingly, even this great consumer brand is not immune from the economic headwinds.\u201d\nSeveral years ago, Apple unveiled a new strategy to offset slowing iPhone sales by accelerating the sale of software and services across its devices.It issued its own credit card and rolled out a suite of new subscription offerings, including Apple TV+ and Apple News+.\nThe services business posted its lowest ever quarterly sales increase this quarter, rising 5 percent to $19.19 billion.The company appears to be intent to avoid a similar slowdown in the current period. This week, it raised the monthly prices on Apple Music by $1 and Apple TV+ by $2. It also said it would begin taking a 30 percent cut of advertising payments to boost social media posts and start levying a 30 percent fee on trades of nonfungible tokens across iPhones and iPads.\n\u201cTo do that now, in a challenging economy, it shows that their business is strong,\u201d said Trip Miller, founder of Gullane Capital Partners, an investment firm based in Memphis, Tenn.\nStill, the biggest issue Apple faces is its supply chain. China produces more than 90 percent of the iPhones that it sells globally, as well as many of its iPads and Macs. The country\u2019s strict coronavirus restrictions have led it to close factories to suppress outbreaks,costing Apple about $4 billion in lost iPad and Mac sales. Those troubles spread to an iPhone factory for the first time this week whenFoxconn reporteda Covid outbreak at its Apple assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China.\n\nApple also is navigating increasing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. Beijing\u2019s military provocations have inspired Washington to scrutinize the supply chain risks should China invade Taiwan. The White House recently imposed newrestrictions on the sale of U.S. technologyto Chinese chip makers, and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping last week urged his nation to beprepared for \u201cdangerous storms.\u201d"

        "title": "China\u2019s Latest Covid Lockdown Affects a Major iPhone Factory",
        "fulltext": "A Covid-19 outbreak at the largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China, has forced some factory workers into quarantine, part of a citywide outbreak that has also prompted shops and hotels near the factory to close.\nFoxconn, a major manufacturer for Apple, confirmed in a statement to The New York Times on Thursday that a \u201csmall number of employees\u201d had been asked to quarantine, but declined to comment on details of the outbreak.\nFoxconn, with headquarters in Taiwan, said efforts to control the outbreak were \u201cprogressing steadily\u201d and that the quarantined employees were being provided with what they needed, including \u201cmaterial supplies, psychological comfort and responsive feedback.\u201d\nThe outbreak comes at an inopportune time for Apple and Foxconn, which is now making the new iPhone 14. Foxconn said that production and operations were \u201crelatively stable,\u201d and that output estimates for the three-month period from October to December would \u201cremain unchanged.\u201d\nThis part of the year is typically a critical period for iPhones. Last year, roughly a third of the $192 billion in iPhone sales was generated in the holiday period alone, according to Apple. The phone helped increase total revenue by 8 percent inthe latest quarter, the company reported on Thursday.\nCalled \u201ciPhone City\u201d by locals, Zhengzhou is a city of six million people in inland China. It is a central artery in Apple\u2019s production of the iPhone, producing roughly half of Apple\u2019s global supply, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group.\n\u201cWhat happens if this hits other Chinese cities where Apple has supply chains?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that Apple needs to consider in the mid-to-long term.\u201d\nApple hasmoved productionof some of its next-generation iPhones to India, a shift in response to growing awareness of heightened risks caused by concentrating manufacturing in a single country.\nThe Zhengzhou city government said that neighborhoods in several of the city\u2019s 12 districts are under some form of restrictions.\nThose restrictions were imposed against the backdrop of last week\u2019s Communist Party congress that extended Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership for a precedent-defying third term. Under Mr. Xi\u2019s direction, China has stuck with a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic \u2014 marked by mass testing, severe lockdowns, and quarantines \u2014 that has shut down entire cities because of a handful of cases. Some people have had trouble securing food, and some have been confined for weeks in poorly built isolation facilities.\nGao Mingjun, 24, a Zhengzhou resident, said her mother and aunt have been quarantined in their dormitories in the Foxconn Zhengzhou factory for weeks.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my Mom for more than a month,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cthere are basically no advantages, but all are flaws,\u201d with the pandemic restrictions.\nThough financial markets havesignaled uneasewith China\u2019s economic slowdown, local governments have hewed closely to Mr. Xi\u2019s playbook. At his opening address at the congress, Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to China\u2019s pandemic policy, describing the fight against Covid as an \u201call-out war.\u201d\nSeveral other cities have been battling outbreaks in recent weeks, including Wuhan, where the virus first appeared; Lanzhou, in Gansu province; and Xining in the northwestern province of Qinghai. The latest viral wave, which reached 993 cases on Thursday, followedearlier outbreaksat the start of October in western Xinjiang and southern Hainan, among other places, when daily cases reached 1,400.\nThe lockdown in Zhengzhou began early last week when people in more than a dozen neighborhoods in the central Zhongyuan district, west of the Foxconn factory, were told to stay at home, according to anofficial notice. By Tuesday, images and videos of an outbreak inside Foxconn erupted on social media, sparking outrage from Chinese internet users who accused the company of failing to be transparent and downplaying the situation. The hashtag #ZhengzhouFoxconn briefly trended on Weibo, a popular social media platform in China.\nBut some online commenters were relieved that the news had finally emerged. Posts revealed shortages of food and other necessities inside workers\u2019 dormitories."

        "title": "Lufthansa Says Apple AirTags Are Once Again Allowed in Checked Bags",
        "fulltext": "The German airline Lufthansa reversed itself on Wednesday, saying that Apple AirTags and other Bluetooth tracking devices would once again be allowed in checked baggage.\n\u201cThe German Aviation Authorities (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) confirmed today, that they share our risk assessment that tracking devices with very low battery and transmission power in checked luggage do not pose a safety risk,\u201d the airline said. \u201cWith that these devices are allowed on Lufthansa flights.\u201d\nThe airline had set off a storm of confusionand criticism after telling passengers that they would have to deactivate the trackers in baggage stowed in cargo holds because of international guidelines for personal electronic devices.\nApple had rejected that interpretation on Tuesday, saying its trackers comply with all airline safety regulations.\nIn the United States, that was confirmed by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said that its regulation did \u201cnot in itself ban or allow\u201d the trackers, but that operators had the right to determine which devices were safe to use in flight.\nIt appears Lufthansa sought advice from German aviation authorities. Martin Leutke, a spokesman for the airline, said Wednesday that he had no further comment about the company\u2019s statement,first released on Twitter.\nLufthansa found its policy under fire when reports surfacedin the German news mediathat it had prohibited the devices,amid speculation that the airline had been embarrassedby reports of passengers using the devices to find baggage it had lost.\nLufthansa hadconfirmed Sundayon Twitter that it believed the trackers must be deactivated in checked baggage on its flights, citing the International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s guidelines for dangerous goods as well as the trackers\u2019 \u201ctransmission function.\u201d Shutting off the trackers renders them useless.\nOn Tuesday,it tried to clarifyits position, with Mr. Leutke saying the airline had not banned the devices and believed they were safe but that \u201cit is on the authorities to adapt regulations, that right now limit the use of these devices for airline passengers in checked luggage.\u201d\nRegulators in the United States have said the trackers, which use Bluetooth technology and do not interfere with the airplanes\u2019 communications equipment, are permitted in carry-on or checked baggage. A variety of other companies sell similar trackers,including Tile, which is popular with users of Android phones.\nIn its statement, Apple said that AirTags are \u201ccompliant with international airline travel safety regulations for carry-on and checked baggage.\u201d\nThe devices use Bluetooth Low Energy, the same technology commonly used by wireless headphones, which are permitted on flights. They are tracked by sharing their last location via a secure signal to nearby Apple devices.\nApple said I.C.A.O. does not have specific standards for cargo tracking devices, and its definition of personal consumer electronic devices is focused on larger devices, including phones, cameras and laptops. These tend to have larger lithium batteries.\nThe aviation organization itself said Tuesday that it is not a regulator and \u201cdoes not play an oversight role\u201d over the airlines. Rather, its guidelines on what passengers may and may not do, and similar advice from the international trade group, trickle down to the regulators and airlines, which set policy.\nApple said AirTags use CR2032 coin cell batteries, which are commonly used in watches and key fobs. Apple said those batteries have been approved for all baggage by the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the International Air Transport Association, an airlines trade group.\nAnF.A.A. advisory from 2017 allows devicesto use low-powered wireless communication like Bluetooth on board planes in the United States. In a statement on Monday, the Transportation Security Administration confirmed Apple\u2019s view that \u201ctracking devices are allowed in both carry-on and checked bags.\u201d"

        "title": "Spotify Wants to Get Into Audiobooks but Says Apple Is in the Way",
        "fulltext": "Daniel Ek, the chief executive of Spotify, wants his company to be the premier outlet in the world of audio. But when he pushed the streaming-subscription service beyond music and podcasts into audiobooks, he ran into a familiar obstacle: Apple.\nOver the past month, Apple, the App Store\u2019s gatekeeper, has rejected Spotify\u2019s app three times, saying that its new audiobooks offering broke Apple\u2019s rules governing how developers can communicate with customers about online purchases.\nThe rejections are the latest skirmish in a long-running battle between Spotify and Apple. For nearly seven years, the companies have feuded over the rules Apple imposes on apps and its practice of collecting a 30 percent fee on the services and products that apps sell.\nApple\u2019s role as a make-or-break arbiter for apps haslong frustrated app developers, particularly companies like Spotify that compete against services such as Apple Music.\nSpotify views the conflict over audiobooks as another example of how Apple impedes competition and hampers rivals. Since making an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe in 2019, Spotify has urged regulators and lawmakers to give app developers the freedom to tell customers about ways to purchase products and services outside of Apple\u2019s payment system, which many apps are required to use.\nThe audiobook fracas offers a glimpse into the challenges developers face as they try to introduce new features. To abide by Apple\u2019s rules, Spotify included its legal team in the product development process and tapped a former start-up founder with a law degree, Nir Zicherman, to spearhead the effort.\nApple initially approved the new feature in Spotify\u2019s existing app before later reversing course, sending Spotify into what it considered to be a Kafkaesque world where Apple simultaneously told the audio company that it could send customers emails about online purchases but couldn\u2019t provide a button inside its app to request those emails. After a series of rejections, Spotify said that Apple on Tuesday approved a version of its app with the audiobook experience.\nAn Apple spokesman said that the company had no objections to Spotify adding audiobooks, but he added that Spotify couldn\u2019t do so by circumventing rules against providing web addresses and language that encourages customers to make purchases outside its app.\n\u201cWe provided them with clear guidance on how to resolve the issue, and approved their app after they made changes that brought it into compliance,\u201d Apple\u2019s spokesman said.\nMr. Zicherman and three colleagues said in an interview with The New York Times that they worked hard to add audiobooks to their app according to the App Store\u2019s guidelines.\n\u201cThose are effectively hurdles that we have to workaround,\u201d Mr. Zicherman said.\nThe challenges with Apple, which also sells audiobooks, contrast with Spotify\u2019s experience on Google Play, a store for apps on the company\u2019s Android operating system. Google approved Spotify\u2019s Android app, allowing listeners to click a button and receive an email about how to purchase audiobooks online.\nApple has made the App Store a centerpiece of its strategy to evolve from a business driven by device sales into one propelled by the sale of software and services. The store, which is estimated to generate about $24 billion in annual sales from the 30 percent fees it collects, has little overhead and generates profits of nearly 80 percent, according to testimony and documents discussed as part of an antitrust lawsuit brought by Epic Games.\nApple contends that the distribution it provides across billions of iPhones and iPads has helped Spotify and other apps succeed. It says routing app purchases through its payment system protects users from fraud and keeps the App Store safe for users. A spokesman noted thatBritish antitrust authorities decided not to investigatecompetition issues in the music streaming business earlier this year.\nSpotify on Tuesday reported a loss for the third quarter of about 194 million euros, or $193.3 million, as advertising sales increased less than expected. The company said total revenue rose by 21 percent to about \u20ac3.04 billion, or $3 billion, buoyed by the addition of seven million paid subscribers. It now has 195 million paid subscribers.\nThe company\u2019s share price fell nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading to $92.35.\nOver the past few years, Spotify and other developers have brought complaints about Apple\u2019s rules and fees to antitrust authorities and lawmakers in hopes that governments would intervene. European regulators aremore than three years into an antitrust investigation, andCongress is still considering lawsthat could ban Apple from requiring apps to use its payment system.\n\u201cAlmost four years. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since Spotify filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission, and we are still waiting on a decision,\u201d Mr. Ek said in a statement.\nLast year, developers earned their biggest winsagainst Apple in a U.S.court and inJapan. To settle separate cases,Apple agreed to relax its rulesand permit developers to communicate with customers about making purchases outside its payment system.\nSpotify viewed the new allowances as an opportunity to fulfill Mr. Ek\u2019s audiobook ambitions. Rather than give Apple a 30 percent share of audiobook sales, which would make the business too costly, it developed a plan to direct its customers to buy the titles online and then listen to them in the app.\nThe company tapped Mr. Zicherman to lead the effort. Mr. Zicherman joined Spotify in 2019 through the acquisition of a podcasting company he co-founded called Anchor. He thought the audiobook format \u2014 which increased sales last year by 25 percent to $1.6 billion, according toPublishers Weekly\u2014 was poised for \u201cmassive growth.\u201d\nMr. Zicherman said he and his team worked with Apple\u2019s rules in mind. Two lawyers were in the room throughout the development process to help them stay within Apple\u2019s boundaries.\nThey developed a nine-step process for buying an audiobook. When customers clicked on audiobooks, they would land on a screen with a lock icon over the audio play button. Pressing the play button led customers to a page where they could request an email to learn more about buying a book. The subsequent email included the book price and a link to purchase it.\nMr. Zicherman said that the experience resulted in more steps than his development team wanted but that the design abided by Apple\u2019s rules. It didn\u2019t include any information about prices, and it didn\u2019t link users out to a website to complete its purchase.\nIn mid-September, Apple approved the audiobook update, Spotify said. Spotify launched the feature days later, advertising the 300,000 titles it was making available.\nMark Mahaney, a Wall Street analyst who tracks Spotify for the investment bank Evercore ISI, tested the new audiobook service. He found it to be cumbersome, requiring him to enter his payment information even though Spotify already had it. He complained to Paul Vogel, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, in an email.\n\u201cWhy is it so bad?\u201d Mr. Mahaney wrote. \u201cAnd can you fix it?\u201d\nWhen Spotify later submitted an app update with features unrelated to audiobooks, Apple rejected it. App Store reviewers told Spotify that the audiobooks offering, which had previously been approved, violated rules requiring apps to use Apple\u2019s payment system to unlock new features, according to Spotify.\nMr. Zicherman\u2019s team changed the email customers would receive, stripping out the purchase button they had previously included. They replaced it with an email that gave customers a link to browse Spotify\u2019s audiobook titles.\nApple rejected Spotify\u2019s change days later, saying that offering customers a button to receive an email about other purchase options broke App Store rules. An Apple spokesman said that Spotify also had a discrepancy in an external link in its app, which sent people to a different web address than one that Apple had approved. Spotify said the link was unrelated to audiobooks and that it has resolved that issue.\nMr. Zicherman said his team consulted with Spotify\u2019s legal staff before deciding to strip out the email phase of the audiobook process. In its place, they told listeners to go to Spotify\u2019s website to buy a book.\n\u201cWhat we have now is effectively a dead end,\u201d Mr. Zicherman said.\nOn Monday, Spotify said that Apple had rejected Mr. Zicherman\u2019s latest redesign. He and a team of product designers, engineers and attorneys worked until early Tuesday morning on four other options. They stripped away Spotify\u2019s website and directions for more information about audiobooks, putting the onus on customers to go online and figure out how to complete a purchase. The changes won Apple\u2019s approval, Spotify said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy audiobooks in the app,\u201d the landing page now says. \u201cWe know, it\u2019s not ideal.\u201d"
