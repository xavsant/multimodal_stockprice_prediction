        "title": "Former Senior Apple Lawyer Charged With Insider Trading",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A former senior lawyer at Apple who oversaw the company\u2019s insider trading policies was himself accused of insider trading by federal prosecutors and securities regulators in complaints made public on Wednesday.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said in a suit that Gene Levoff, a former senior director of corporate law and a corporate secretary at Apple, repeatedly traded on inside information from 2011 to 2016.\nThe S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff violated insider trading laws three times from 2015 to 2016. On one occasion, Mr. Levoff sold roughly $10 million of Apple stock \u2014 nearly his entire holdings \u2014 from his personal brokerage account four days before Apple announced quarterly earnings on July 21, 2015.\nIn a related action, federal prosecutors in New Jersey charged Mr. Levoff with one count of securities fraud in a criminal complaint.\nThe company\u2019s stock price fell 4 percent after the earnings report, in whichApple revealed it had fallen short of analysts\u2019 estimatesfor iPhone sales.\nMr. Levoff had already seen a draft of the announcement and avoided about $345,000 in losses by dumping his Apple shares before the official announcement, the S.E.C. said. But since the end of 2016, Apple\u2019s share price has increased 47 percent.\nKevin Marino, Mr. Levoff\u2019s lawyer and a principal at the law firm Marino, Tortorella & Boyle, said he was reviewing the allegations against Mr. Levoff and looked forward to defending him.\n\u201cGene Levoff was a trusted Apple executive for many years, and has never before been accused of wrongdoing of any kind,\u201d Mr. Marino said in a statement.\nAccording to the S.E.C., Mr. Levoff oversaw Apple\u2019s corporate law group of 20 to 30 lawyers and paralegals. He was responsible for Apple\u2019s compliance with securities laws and providing legal advice for the company\u2019s S.E.C. filings and financial reporting. He also served as a corporate officer of every major Apple subsidiary.\n\u201cAs a member of the core group of senior Apple insiders entrusted with material nonpublic information, and as an attorney with a sophisticated understanding of securities and corporate law, Levoff knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he had a duty of trust and confidence to the company and its shareholders,\u201d according to the complaint filed in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nThe S.E.C. said he was placed on leave in July and fired in September.\n\u201cAfter being contacted by authorities last summer, we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,\u201d an Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said in a statement.\nIn an indication of how senior Mr. Levoff was at the company, he was part of Apple\u2019s disclosure committee \u2014 a group that helps Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Luca Maestri, the chief financial officer, determine whether the company is meeting its responsibilities for providing accurate and timely disclosures to investors.\nAt the time of his departure, Mr. Levoff reported to Katherine Adams, Apple\u2019s general counsel. She replaced Bruce Sewell, who served as the company\u2019s top lawyer for eight years until he stepped down in 2017.\nMr. Levoff was responsible for ensuring compliance with Apple\u2019s insider trading rules, including sending emails to individuals who were subject to trading restrictions around Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings announcements. Apple\u2019s insider trading policy said any individual with material, nonpublic information about the company was not allowed to trade the stock until 60 hours after that information had been announced.\nThe S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff also engaged in insider trading on three other occasions from 2011 to 2012. In each instance, Mr. Levoff received draft news releases and S.E.C. filings. He then bought thousands of shares of Apple stock before the public announcement. Shortly after the stock rose on the positive earnings announcements, Mr. Levoff sold the shares. He made approximately $245,000 in profits on those insider trading transactions.\nBefore those transactions, Mr. Levoff sent emails to company employees alerting them that a blackout period was starting and that they were prohibited from trading Apple securities."

        "title": "Apple Takes a Hit in China, and Workers There Feel the Pain",
        "fulltext": "HUOJIANCUN, China \u2014 The line to quit stretched the length of a football field.\nMore than a hundred Chinese workers who once assembled and tested Apple iPhones queued up on a recent morning outside Gate 7 of the vast Changshuo electronics factory to collect their severance and go on their way. They had once hoped that their assembly line jobs would give them big enough paychecks to propel them into a better life.\nThat was before consumers in China turned up their nosesat Apple\u2019s new iPhone XRand its nearly $1,000 price. Work slowed. Overtime evaporated. And now workers are giving up.\n\u201cUsually we had 80 to 90 extra hours\u201d per month, said Zhang Zhi, 25, who had worked two years at the factory but was now standing in the quitting line. Starting in late October, her supervisors started sending her home early and giving her two-day weekends, eating into her overtime. In December, her pay totaled about $370, roughly half what she had made in the busiest months.\nMs. Zhang found part-time work elsewhere that pays about $600 a month. Still, she said, \u201cit\u2019s better than staying here.\u201d\nChina\u2019s factories once made products for the rest of the world. These days, increasingly, Chinese factories make products for China as well. Itsvast and still-emerging consumer classhas opened up a hugely profitable market for global companies like Apple, Nike, General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies in turn use Chinese factories to meet those needs.\nToday, China\u2019s consumers have grownmore reluctant to spend, and many of the workers who depend on them have been hit. Lower demand for consumer goods has led to job losses and shrinking paychecks. That is worseningChina\u2019s economic slowdown, which has posed a major challenge for Beijing andcould put it at a disadvantagein the trade war with President Trump.\nChina doesn\u2019t disclose reliable employment data, but signs of slowing factory work abound. Car and chemical factoriesare moving at a slower pace. China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday begins next week, but some companies were sending home workers as early as December.\nHuojiancun isn\u2019t the only place where weak iPhone sales are leaving an impact.\nIn the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, employment at avast factory that makes iPhones has fallento about 70,000 from the already low pre-Lunar New Year level of more than 100,000 a year ago, according to China Labor Watch, which tracks working conditions and speaks to workers in China.\nIn a statement, the Zhengzhou factory\u2019s owner, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn, declined to comment directly on the group\u2019s figures but said it was constantly reviewing its operations and planned to add more than 50,000 positions across China in the first three months of the year.\nAn Apple spokeswoman, Wei Gu, pointed to the company\u2019s previous statements and declined to comment further.\nHuojiancun is a rough industrial community on the edge of glittering Shanghai. Snack shops, calling card stalls and other small businesses catering to factory workers pervade the narrow streets and alleys surrounding the Changshuo plant.\nWorkers there may make the iPhone, but they can\u2019t afford it. Even when their pay was at its peak, those assembly line workers would have needed more than a month\u2019s wages to buy a base-level iPhone XR. Still, jobs there for years were in high demand because they tended to pay more and offer better working conditions than elsewhere.\nToday, the situation is more complicated. Chinese workers are increasingly difficult to lure because they don\u2019t want to work so many hours on an assembly line. Chinese companies are increasingly exploring automation as labor costs rise.\nSupervisors kept workers from taking too many breaks and would dock their pay for infractions like littering, said Hou Fu\u2019an, a Changshuo worker who had quit and was heading back home in the interior province of Henan. As workers began to leave over missing hours, he said, many remaining workers started getting overtime again, fattening their paychecks but adding to the workload.\n\u201cInside the factory, workers are tightly controlled,\u201d Mr. Hou said. \u201cIf one person does not do well, everyone in the group will be yelled at by the group leader. But they did not yell much when there were not many workers left.\u201d\nThe Changshuo plant is owned byPegatron, a Taiwanese contract assembler. Its shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since the summer as the trade war with the United States mounted and as skepticism grew about the appeal of Apple\u2019s latest iPhone models, which were released in September.\nA Pegatron spokeswoman, Ming-Chun Tsai, declined to comment on the Apple business.\nEvery year, before Apple\u2019s usual September launches of its latest iPhones, the Changshuo factory adds temporary workers to accommodate the rush. It offers bonuses that can vary from $400 to $1,300 depending on demand, workers said. Qualified workers must be between 18 and 45 years old, be able to recognize the English alphabet and sport no visible tattoos, they said.\nMany workers then typically leave before the Lunar New Year holiday, when they generally qualify for their bonus. But workers and local businesses alike said more workers than usual were leaving this year.\nHuang Qionghuang owns a stall that sells bras that won\u2019t set off metal detectors, an essential undergarment in a factory that scans workers coming and going to make sure they aren\u2019t stealing or smuggling in cameras to take photos of the latest iPhone. In the past, October was her busy season. But sales slumped in recent months, and she dares not buy more bras to stock. The ones that did sell were the cheap ones, costing roughly $2.50.\n\u201cLast January, I earned more than my rent,\u201d Ms. Huang said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t even make enough to pay the rent,\u201d which she added was about $500 a month.\n\u201cThis is the worst year since I came here three years ago,\u201d she said.\nPegatron holds an outsize presence in Huojiancun. Online, it says the plant employs 70,000. Neon signs hanging among the warren of stalls next door call them the \u201cPegatron night market.\u201d During busy seasons, according to local merchants, the streets and alleys are so crowded it can be difficult to move around.\nMore recently, merchants said, the Pegatron night market has grown quieter.\n\u201cThere are fewer workers in the factory,\u201d said Xu Aihua, who opened a local restaurant with his mother eight years ago. Looking up from the chicken soup he was making, Mr. Xu pointed to the nearly empty street out front. \u201cSee? There\u2019s nobody.\u201d\nThat could mean tough times for him and his mother. Their rent costs about $1,500 per month. A year ago, his daily revenue totaled about $150. In recent months, he has earned about half that.\nAt the line to quit at Gate 7, Wang Xiaofeng stood in the cold waiting for a severance that he hoped would total about $150. A year ago, his work hours were relatively steady. But this December, his overtime dwindled.\n\u201cI had three or four days without work in a week,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much was I going to earn?\u201d\nMr. Wang said he had found a new job, one that gave him more hours to pad his paycheck.\n\u201cI made the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d"

        "title": "The Joy of Standards",
        "fulltext": "Our modern existence depends on things we can take for granted. Cars run on gas from any gas station, theplugs for electrical devices fit into any socket, and smartphones connect to anything equipped with Bluetooth. All of these conveniences depend on technical standards, the silent and often forgotten foundations of technological societies.\nThe objects that surround us were designed to comply with standards. Consider the humble 8-by-16-inch concrete block, the specifications of which are defined in the Masonry Society\u2019s \u201cBuilding Code Requirements and Specification for Masonry Structures.\u201d\nThis book distills centuries of knowledge about the size and thickness of blocks, seismic design requirements and the use of materials like concrete, glass and mortar.Professionals worked through committeesorganized by the American Concrete Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers and the Masonry Society from 1977 to 1989 to foster consensus around this single national standard.\nThe number of technical standards that go into some products is astonishing, and the complexity of the methods used to create these standards is perhaps even more remarkable. A 2010studyfound that a laptop computer incorporates 251 standards. Companies such as I.B.M. and Microsoft created some of these standards \u2014 but only 20 percent of them. The other 80 percent of the laptop\u2019s standards were developed by private or nongovernmental organizations that facilitate collaboration and cooperation among technicalexperts.\nThese facts should prompt some reflection about the exercise of power in a technological society: Amid concerns about the excesses of market power and government regulation, nobody seems to worry much about the private groups of experts who created 80 percent of the laptop\u2019s standards. Standards created this way, known as the \u201cvoluntary consensus\u201d process, are ubiquitous. They range from technologies like electrical plugs, lumber and concrete, to rules and certifications for food safety and environmental sustainability, to more personal matters such as definitions of health and disease.\nThe basic irony of standards is the simple fact that there is no standard way to create a standard, nor is there even a standard definition of \u201cstandard.\u201d There are, however, longstanding ways that industries and nations coordinate standardization efforts. In the United States, the system of voluntary consensus standards is coordinated by ANSI, the American National Standards Institute.\nThe standards-development organizations accredited by ANSI follow a bottom-up process. It begins when someone proposes a draft standard, which then goes through a period of public comment. A panel of stakeholders and interested parties then seeks to resolve points of friction. Eventually this process, which often takes years, results in a final published standard.\nANSI was first known as the American Engineering Standards Committee, which wascreated to address rampant incompatibility throughout American industry.(It was eventually reconstituted in 1966 and took on the name ANSI in 1969.) Its founders came from engineering organizations and departments of the federal government that all published their own standards, which were of limited value because they varied from group to group. The consequences could be catastrophic, as with the 1904 fire that destroyed much of downtown Baltimore: Buildings could have been saved if fire departments from neighboring cities had hoses that fit Baltimore\u2019s fire hydrants.\nTheEngineering Standards Committee\u2019s solution to technical incompatibility was to get organized. At its first meeting, in 1918, it created a process where people could work out the details of technical specifications and agree to carry them out. The structure of the standardization panels balanced producers and consumers \u2014 that is, makers and users of technologies \u2014 so that no single company could dictate the outcome. This method incorporated advice from British engineers, who had created a similar organization a decade earlier, and reflected lessons from World War I, where cooperation among engineers led to technological and humanitarian accomplishments.During the war, Herbert Hoover, who was then head of the United States Food Administration, coordinated farming and business interests, as well as the automobile, railroad and shipping industries, to provide food for America and its allies.\nThe consensus-driven approach had two clear advantages over existing alternatives. First, a forum to bring \u201call interested parties\u201d into alignment reduced duplication and wasted effort. Second,the absence of state coercion to enforce standardsmeant that engineers and executives had strong incentives to resolve conflicts before they published a standard, lest they face government intervention down the road. The success of their efforts would depend on the voluntary adoption of standards. The consensus process was well suited for a society where technological and economic progress was within reach \u2014 all it needed to do was to find ways to cooperate.\nThis was no easy task. The standards committee\u2019s longtime secretary, Paul Gough Agnew, looked back wearily at the \u201cendless discussions\u201d that set the stage for the first meeting in 1918. One of the group\u2019s founders, the electrical engineer Comfort Adams, observed, \u201cFear and jealousy, as well as ignorance, were the chief obstacles which had to be overcome.\u201d\nOver the past century, standardization has expanded immensely. Today, private transnational organizations create and revise thousands of consensus standards every year.\nAlthough the voluntary consensus method has been effective, it has never been perfect. For example, \u201cconsensus\u201d is often a euphemism. Nasty disagreements can derail the process. Companies that agree on standards one day turn around and sue one another the next. In some industries, companies can make fortunes by defying established standards \u2014 think of innovative products from Apple, or bold designs from the leaders of the fashion industry. Standardization also creates losers, and it can be very costly to invest in the losing side of \u201cstandards wars\u201d like VHS versus Betamax, or Blu-ray versus HD DVD.\nAccess to standards also poses challenges. Since the consensus-building process is costly, organizations like ANSI often try to cover expenses by selling or licensing access to standards documents. For example, the book ofstandards for concrete blocks and masonry structures costs $150. This business model strikes many critics as unjust, since private standards can be built into regulations, yet sometimes only citizens who pay can look at them.\nThe American system of standardization is driven by industry, but we should not lose sight of the crucial role played by government agencies. The National Bureau of Standards, now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, contributed research and ideas to the standards committee\u2019s efforts from the beginning. And governments often mandate standards around air pollution and automotive and aviation safety because industry did not adopt them on a voluntary consensus basis. Federal air pollution standards that led to the widespread adoption of the catalytic converter and reduced some automotive emissions by 99 percent worked through force, not bottom-up consensus.\nStandards have always struggled with an image problem. Critics worry that a standardized world is dull and mediocre, a nightmare of conformity and Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Yet the champions of standardization insist that standards create the foundations for a better world. Albert Whitney, who was the standards committee\u2019s chairman from 1922 to 1924, argued that many accomplishments of civilization involved \u201cthe fixation of advances.\u201d The committee\u2019s motto in the 1920s declared: \u201cStandardization is dynamic, not static; it means not to stand still, but to move forward together.\u201d\nIn an age of breathless enthusiasm for the new and \u201cdisruptive,\u201d it\u2019s worth remembering the mundane agreements embodied in the things around us. It\u2019s very ordinariness and settledness of standards that enable us to survive, and to move ahead.\nAndrew Russell, the dean of arts andsciencesat the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, and Lee Vinsel, an assistant professor of science and technology studies at Virginia Tech, are working on a book about innovation and maintenance.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."

        "title": "Restoring an Avenue in Paris Meant for Kings",
        "fulltext": "PARIS \u2014 The sidewalks are cracked along \u201cla plus belle avenue du monde\u201d \u2014 the most beautiful street in the world. Each day, 60,000 cars clog the lanes. Walkways are cluttered with abandoned scooters.\nThe Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es was built for royalty and named after paradise. But its last major renovation was more than 20 years ago. New retail tenants have been intermittent. Parisiansavoid the areawith the resolution of New Yorkers steering clear of Times Square.\nAs Paris prepares to host the 2024 Olympics, hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing into construction projects on the avenue, one of the most visited areas of the city, as it tries to re-establish and redefine its place.\nApple and WeWork moved in recently, and will be followed by the Galeries Lafayette department store. Planned improvements will beautify and expand space for cyclists. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent refurbishing historic monuments, including the 119-year-old Grand Palais exhibition center.\n\u201cWe want to prevent the image of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es from falling,\u201d said Jean-No\u00ebl Reinhardt, the president of the Comit\u00e9 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a community group.\nThe project is a complicated undertaking. Commercial rents along the promenade are among the highest in the world, at $1,519 per square foot per year, compared with $2,250 on Fifth Avenue,according to Cushman & Wakefield. Construction in the Beaux-Arts buildings that line the street is heavily regulated, and any changes made to accommodate tourists and global chains risk further alienating locals.\nWithout the renovation, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\u2019 risks losing its prestige as a world-class destination, said Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor of Paris for urban planning and economic development.\nThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es ranks among grand boulevards such as Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and Oxford Street in London. Other streets, such asDes Voeux Roadin Hong Kong andKhao San Roadin Bangkok, are trying to position themselves as major attractions.\nThe avenue, stretching nearly 1.2 miles from Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, has inspired streets inthe Bronx, New Orleans, Prague and, recently, Tokyo. Joe Dassin sang in 1969, over perky piano chords, that the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es had \u201ceverything you want.\u201d\nNamed after the Elysian fields of Greek mythology, the street was commissioned in the 1600s for the French royal family. Napoleon III added fountains and pathways in the 1800s. Later in the 19th century, a regionwide urban design overhaul led by Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann erected the uniform stone buildings that still populate many Parisian streets.\nParisians celebrated their city\u2019s liberation from the Nazisin 1944and their nation\u2019sWorld Cup victoriesthere.A restoration in the 1990swidened sidewalks, added trees and moved parking underground. But the glamorous charm that made the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es a quintessentially Parisian street has waned.\nThe theaters that dot the avenue have shed millions of moviegoers. Shopping arcades set farther back from the street are often deserted. The Arc de Triomphe, a testament to military might that has become a monumental symbol of the extreme affluence and global consumerism in its shadow, was recently vandalized by so-calledyellow vest protestersobjecting tohigh taxes and income disparity.\nIn 2007, the city government, wanting to resist the \u201cbanalization\u201d of the strip,tried to block H & Mfrom opening an outlet on the avenue. The fast-fashion chain arrived anyway, along with two Zara stores and anAbercrombie & Fitchhoused in a sumptuous mansion behind a gilded gate.\n\u201cHaving always the same brands, it\u2019s not good for the place, because people don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d Mr. Missika said. \u201cThey could be in London or Tokyo.\u201d\nIdeally, he said, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es would host a balanced mix of fast-food outlets, sit-down restaurants, global retailers and local designers. But the city has few legal tools to shape the commercial composition of the street.\n\u201cThere must be a good equilibrium of commercial activity,\u201d Mr. Missika said. \u201cWhen a place is totally deserted by local people, it\u2019s a big problem; the soul of the city disappears.\u201d\nThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is being repopulated by tenants that hope to draw both Parisians and tourists.\nA 70,000-square-foot extension of the Galeries Lafayette chain will open between Rue La Bo\u00e9tie and Rue du Colis\u00e9e at the end of March, becoming the largest retail site on the street.\nThe nearly 90-year-old property, a former bank, is owned by the Qatar Investment Authority. The Danish architect Bjarke Ingels uncovered a hidden cupola and crafted a vortex-like entrance into the four-story store. A food court with communal tables will welcome shoppers and the 180,000 people who work around the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\nGaleries Lafayette follows Apple, which opened a store in November at the corner of Rue Washington in a 19th-century apartment building that was once home to the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont. Architects from Foster & Partners restored the original wood and marble staircase and added a glinting, kaleidoscopic roof over an interior courtyard.\nNegotiations over construction permits took months, in part because of the building\u2019s history. The 59,000-square-foot property was purchased in April for more than $650 million for Bayerische Versorgungskammer a German pension fund.\nOther companies are finding their way onto the street. In December, Norges Bank Real Estate Management of Norway bought nearly 110,900 square feet of retail and office space at 79 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Thomas Jefferson once lived at 92 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where WeWork opened its 48,000-square-foot outpost in June.\nPierre Herm\u00e9, known as the \u201cPicasso of pastries,\u201d teamed up with the beauty brand L\u2019Occitane en Provence to open a 10,000-square-footlifestyle storeat 86 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in early 2018. New boutiques from Dior and Nike are in the works.\nConventional retail, with its large signs and rushed customers, \u201cwill eventually just disappear\u201d from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, said Stefan Behling, the lead architect on the Apple project. Instead, concept stores and experiential spaces will take over.\n\u201cThe subtlety is the right thing,\u201d he said.\nBut although stores take up most of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, only 23 percent of visitors come to shop, according to data from the neighborhood committee.\nMany are looking for culture and leisure, for reasons to interrupt their sidewalk strolls with a stop in a gallery or an elevator ride up to an expansive view. City rules that were relaxed in recent years will allow more development of theChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\u2019 rooftops, with bars, restaurants and up to a dozen pools, including one planned for a SO Sofitel hotel.\nInitiatives to expand green space have already taken root. The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es has been closed to cars one Sunday per month since 2016. One night in July, it became an open-air cinema where the fantasy film \u201cLes Visiteurs\u201dplayed on a towering screennear the Arc de Triomphe. Helen Mirren and Jane Fonda strutted down the middle of the street for a 2017fashion show.\nLast year, the city began constructing a dedicated bike lane on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which it expects to complete by early 2020. A government effort \u2014 with an assist by Chanel \u2014 to upgrade and expand the exhibition and event spaces at the Grand Palais will start next year.\nThere is also talk of sprucing up the gardens along the eastern part of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where Jeff Koons\u2019s towering 35-foot-tall sculpture \u201cBouquet of Tulips\u201d will be permanently placed this year. The French designersRonan and Erwan Bouroullec, supported by private funding, are redesigning several fountains along the street.\n\u201cThis is part of a global transformation of the city,\u201d Mr. Missika said."

It has been another earnings news week, which means we\u2019re learning exactly how much money the local tech companies earned in 2018.\nThe news might not surprise you: Everyone in Silicon Valley is still raking in cash. Apple is the country\u2019s most valuable public company again, after briefly losing the title to Amazon.Facebookhas shattered its own considerable records for profit and revenue, despite increasing scrutiny of its business practices.\nAnd a flock of companies is set to join the tech giants in the public market.Slack, the workplace chat app that I compulsively check throughout my day, has filed for its initial public offering. It\u2019s now in line behindUber and Lyftfor a 2019 debut on Wall Street. Airbnb and Pinterest are likely to follow, bringing a fresh wave of money to one of the most expensive regions in the United States.\nNew wealth and tech is nothing new, of course. But it is notable that tech companies have done so well in a difficult year for the industry.\nExecutives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were called to Washington to answer lawmakers\u2019 concerns about political bias, privacy violations and excessive market power.\nIn Europe, antitrust worries are on the rise. In 2017, Google paid what was a record fine of$2.7 billion. Last year, Google was fined again, this time for$5.1 billion.\nJust this past week, Germany announced that it wouldcrack downon the way Facebook collects and combines data on its users as they browse the web.

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Don\u2019t look now: Storm clouds are gathering over tech.\nChinese consumers have pulled back their spending, blowing a $9 billion hole inApple\u2019s recent quarterly revenue. China was again a culprit whenNvidia warnedlast month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations, though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centers.\nIntel, the big chip maker, cited intensifying \u201ctrade and macro concerns\u201d for financial results in January that did not meet expectations. And Samsung, another semiconductor powerhouse, said salesplunged 10 percentin the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones.\nChina, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand.\nWarnings about a sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Micron Technology and Western Digital. It\u2019s an abrupt reversal, coming on the heels of stellar results in 2018 for the business that gave Silicon Valley its name.\nLast year, manufacturers shipped a staggering 1 trillion chips and other semiconductor devices, 10 percent more than the year before, IC Insights estimates. But 2019 is shaping up to be a much different story, now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampening.\nThe notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known asthe dot-com bust.\nBack then, investors showed no mercy. Intel madewhat seemed a modest adjustmentto its revenue forecast for the third quarter of 2000, saying it would be up 3 to 5 percent instead of 7 to 9 percent. The value of the company immediately fell by nearly 30 percent over the next few days.\nThis year, with a similar downgrade, investors largely shrugged it off. Intel shed about 5 percent of its value over a week.\nWhile acknowledging the parallels to 2000, Gene Munster, research director for Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s different this time.\u201d\nBack then, among the best customers for the established chip firms were start-ups, which had more dreams than revenue. As the start-ups faltered, the chip firms were imperiled. The storm lasted for years.\n\u201cThese are all real companies now, with real customers,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cPeople are willing to look past a few bumpy months.\u201d\nEven if the problems do not linger, they are a reminder that demand is not eternal. That seems to be what happened with smartphones, which use multiple varieties of chips to run software, process data and connect to cellular networks.\nConsider Apple, which gave a muted forecast in October for the holiday season and followed up early last month with itsfirst full-fledged revenue warning in 16 years. The iPhone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in China. Total smartphone shipments fell 15 percent in that country in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Canalys.\nMichael Wolf, who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm Activate, said people seem to beshifting to lower-priced phone modelsand cheaper service plans. But he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like Netflix, video games, online advertising and business-to-business sales for companies like Microsoft.\n\u201cFrom all of our research, I don\u2019t see some general consumer malaise,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.\nYet several other businesses appear to be softening as well, including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Sales of high-priced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like Intel and Nvidia, but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautious.\n\u201cCloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity,\u201d Robert Swan, who was then Intel\u2019s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said on a conference call after Intel released its fourth-quarter results. (On Thursday, Mr. Swanbecame Intel\u2019s chief executive.)\nLongtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips, an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the United States and rivals in Japan and South Korea. Makers of a key category called dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industry.\nDuring the dot-com bust of 2001, DRAM revenue plummeted 63 percent while total semiconductor revenue fell 31 percent, according to Gartner data.\nBut conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits, leaving three major DRAM makers \u2014 Samsung, Hynix and Micron. They have been slow to boost production, enabling them to keep their prices high. And they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones, data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most sales.\n\u201cThe markets today are structurally different,\u201d Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview.\nYet market cycles haven\u2019t disappeared entirely. DRAM prices peaked last June and began sliding, prompting Micron and Samsung to issue their recent profit warnings. DRAMeXchange, a Taiwan-based firm that tracks the market, predicts DRAM prices will fall an additional 20 percent in the first quarter.\nMemory chips \u201cbehave like onions or steel or any other commodity,\u201d said Jim Handy, a market researcher at Objective Analysis. \u201cIf there is an oversupply, prices fall.\u201d\nNvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust. The 25-year-old company, which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games, becameone of Silicon Valley\u2019s most valuable companies in 2017as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giants.\nBut Nvidia\u2019s processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency, driving a surge in demand that inflated prices and created a shortage of chips. Buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders, making it hard for the company to get a handle on conventional demand for its technology.\nThe cryptocurrency bubblefaded suddenly last year, causing Nvidia\u2019s revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips. The crypto issue \u201cended up being way, way bigger\u201d for the company than expected, said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy story.\u201d\nFor all the turmoil, industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain a lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps. For one thing, a series of mergers has reduced price competition. Companies like Micron, which routinely lost money in past cycles, are expected to remain solidly profitable even if sales dip.\nBeyond that, there is the glorious future.\n\u201cEventually the storm will pass and these companies \u2014 Nvidia, Apple, Samsung \u2014 will have a pole position in the next tech growth curve, including A.I., health care, self-driving cars, 5G,\u201d said Mr. Munster, the Loup analyst. \u201cThe curve is so exciting, so juicy, so full of opportunity.\u201d"

Want this by email?Sign up here.\nPresident Trump might keep some tariffs on Chinese goods even if Beijing and Washington reach a trade agreement, hetold the NYT yesterday, after delegates from both countries wrapped up another round of negotiations.\n\u201cWithout the tariffs, we wouldn\u2019t be talking,\u201d he said in an interview.\nHow were the discussions?According to Mr. Trump\u2019s posts on Twitter, they went well, \u201cwith good intent and spirit on both sides.\u201d He hosted the negotiators in the Oval Office and suggested that President Xi Jinping of China was willing to welcome more American companies and to buy more American products \u2014 including five million tons of soybeans. The Chinese representatives, led by theAmerican-educated vice premier, Liu He, said that the two sides had made \u201cimportant progress\u201d and had \u201ccandid, specific and fruitful\u201d talks. Robert Lighthizer, the top American trade negotiator, was less sanguine. \u201cWe did not come off the rails,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s significant.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?The two sides hope to reach an agreement by early March, before Mr. Trump plans to increase tariffs after a 90-day truce.

So did workers at Google.\nAfter Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple\u2019s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users\u2019 consent. Appleeventually restored accessfor both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.\nThe tension with Apple was not Facebook\u2019s only concern.\n\u2022 The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be followingthe Russian playbookfor using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.\n\u2022 Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target ofseveral more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.\nDeutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it\u2019slooking increasingly probablethat the German governmentwill step into combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.\nDeutsche reported itsfirst full-year net profit since 2014today but still failed to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.\nThe bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occurby midyear.\nBut that may not be wise,writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:\nThe deal looks like the option of last resort. Combining two of Europe\u2019s most inefficient banks to create an even bigger supertanker would require tens of thousands of job cuts and a risky (read costly) integration to stand a chance of working.\nThe Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there\u2019s even more uncertainty than usual,writes the NYT\u2019s Ben Casselman. Here\u2019s what to look for:\nCrucial time:The United States\u2019 decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.\nPotential impact:There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.\nSolid foundation:The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, andpaychecks are growing.\nInvestors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.\nStiff competition:The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon\u2019s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, asgrowth slowed from its usual breakneck pace. But the company compensated by expanding its highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Its revenue guidance fell short of expectations, sendingshares down sharplyin after-hours trading.\nSeeking a turnaround:G.E.\u2019s fourth-quarter results pointed tothe depth of the company\u2019s challenges, despite a strong performance by the company\u2019s jet engine business. G.E. made no forecast for what its profit and revenue would look like this year, and its chief executive, Lawrence Culp, said that 2019 was \u201cstill very much a work in progress.\u201d The company also said that it hadreached a $1.5 billion settlementin an investigation of its role in the 2008 financial crisis, reassuring investors.\nMore earnings news:Nintendo shares dropped more than 9.3 percent afterit cut its full-year targetfor sales of its Switch video game console.\nIntel named its interim chief executive,Robert Swan, as its permanent leader, ending a seven-month search.

        "title": "Apple Shows Facebook Who Has the Power in an App Dispute",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Facebook employees woke up on Wednesday morning, many found they could not perform even the most basic work tasks.\nTheir calendars were not working. Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook\u2019s latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company\u2019s cafeterias were serving for lunch.\nThat\u2019s because those features run on Facebook\u2019s internal, custom-built iPhone apps \u2014 and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nThe situation stemmed froma disputeafter Facebook violated Apple\u2019s rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users\u2019 online activity. When Apple discovered the transgression this week, it revoked Facebook\u2019s special access to apps and updates that run on its iPhone software.\nThat immediately cut off Facebook\u2019s 35,000 workers from its internal iPhone apps. And the problem snowballed when mobile apps like Workplace and Messenger \u2014 two internal communication tools \u2014 also stopped working, frustrating employees and resulting in hours of lost productivity.\nLate Thursday, Apple relented and restored Facebook\u2019s access. Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world. While Facebook is the world\u2019s biggest social network, Apple controls the distribution of apps \u2014 including Facebook\u2019s \u2014 on its phones. That power is a longstanding concern for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, making his company beholden to the rules of others.\nThe spat underscored the tensions between two of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech companies, which have competed for years over talent and new technologies. Recently, each has taken potshots at the other over data privacy, with Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, trading slights with Mr. Zuckerberg in interviews. Facebook also worked last year witha public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to urge reporters to scrutinize Apple and other tech companies. And Apple hasmade changes to some of its tech featuresthat limit the ability of Facebook and others to track users.\nApple did not immediately have a comment on Thursday after reinstating Facebook\u2019s access to its internal apps. In a statement, Facebook said it was \u201cgetting our internal apps up and running\u201d and added, \u201cTo be clear, this didn\u2019t have an impact on our consumer-facing services.\u201d\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said of the dispute with Apple, \u201cObviously we want to be in full compliance with all of our partners.\u201d She added that the Facebook research app at issue hadn\u2019t been a secret and had been operated only with its users\u2019 consent.\nApple also briefly demonstrated its power on Thursday with another Silicon Valley giant, Google. Like Facebook, Google had violated Apple\u2019s rules by publicly distributing an app, Screenwise Meter, through a special Apple developer program. The internet search company said some of its internal apps that run on iPhone software were temporarily disrupted.\nTwo Google employees, who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak publicly on the matter, said iPhone apps for internal services like hailing a bus or viewing cafeteria information were not working. In addition, apps testing unreleased updates of Google products such as Gmail and Google Maps were unavailable, these people said. The disruptions wereearlier reportedby the technology website The Verge.\nA Google spokeswoman, Suzanne Blackburn, said in a statement that the company expected the issue to be resolved \u201csoon.\u201d A spokesman for Apple, Tom Neumayr, said it was working with Google to reinstate access \u201cvery quickly.\u201d He declined to comment on whether Apple had revoked Google\u2019s access or if it was a technical glitch.\nApple\u2019s dispute with Facebook this week was rooted in the social network\u2019s practice of scooping up information on its users\u2019 practices, a way for it to gain insight into their digital habits so it can improve products to keep consumers regularly coming back to its site.\nIn 2013, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli company that collected information on how customers used every app on their phones. Onavo\u2019s findings helped Facebook executives predict which apps were rising and trending across App Stores.\nThat gave Mr. Zuckerberg, who colleagues have said was highly dependent on the data, the foresight to try to buy Snapchat long before it went public. Although that effort failed, Facebook has built products, like live video streams and group video chat, based on information gleaned from Onavo\u2019s app.\nLast year, Apple updated some of its privacy policies andforced Facebook to remove Onavo\u2019s appfrom its App Store. But Onavo had other ways of collecting consumer data that bypassed some of Apple\u2019s restrictions.\nIn 2016, the Onavo team had created a research app that vacuumed up all of a user\u2019s phone and web activity; Facebook paid people ages 13 to 35 to install it. Then Facebook distributed the app under an Apple program with a special approval process if apps are used only for internal testing.\nOn Tuesday, the technology news siteTechCrunch published a reportdetailing Facebook\u2019s research app and its public use, which violated the rules of Apple\u2019s program. Facebook immediately pushed back on privacy concerns and said it was not tricking users with the research app.\n\u201cThere was nothing \u2018secret\u2019 about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App,\u201d Arielle Argyres, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018spying\u2019 as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate.\u201d\nShe added that fewer than 5 percent of users in the research program were teenagers and that all had obtained signed parental consent forms.\nBut Facebook had no comeback for sidestepping Apple\u2019s rules. On Wednesday morning, Apple revoked Facebook\u2019s \u201centerprise developer certificate\u201d and paralyzed the social giant from deploying its internal iPhone apps.\n\u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple,\u201d Tammy Levine, an Apple spokeswoman, said at the time. \u201cAny developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.\u201d\nApple has been dealing with its own privacy problems. This week,a bug was discoveredin its FaceTime app, whereby people could spy on the video and audio FaceTime calls of other users. Apple has pledged to fix the problem by the end of this week.\nAfter Apple\u2019s revocation, employees inside Facebook became furious with the Onavo team, according to four people familiar with the company\u2019s deliberations. Some said they would have to wait weeks to get app updates or changes approved through Apple\u2019s App Store. Several employees in Facebook\u2019s hardware division said they were considering quitting because they could not get any work done.\nLate Thursday, after Apple relented, Facebook employees began seeing the next day\u2019s lunch menu again, as well as their calendars and their shuttle bus schedules. Still, they said, Apple had made its point."

Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nGreetings, I\u2019m Li Yuan, your Asia tech columnist. I\u2019m writing to you from balmy Hong Kong as the Chinese are getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year next week and China\u2019s tech community is bracing for a very tough Year of the Pig amid a slowing economy and a persistent trade war between the United States and China.\nI\u2019m old enough to remember that the Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve dinner was the meal of the year in the 1970s and 1980s because every family would try their best to put multiple meat dishes on the table. Almost every mainland resident of China was poor then and we had to use ration books to buy food, meat and cooking oil.\nI\u2019m also old enough to remember that the world was divided into the Eastern Bloc (the former Soviet Union and its satellite states) and the Western Bloc (the United States and its allies). China was close to the Eastern Bloc until it had a fallout with the Soviet Union. It was poor, isolated and ruled by a ruthless leader called Mao Zedong.\nThings changed dramatically the year I was born, when Henry Kissinger secretly visited Beijing. In the following five decades, U.S.-China relations had its ups and downs but it should be fair to say that the two countries benefited tremendously from opening to each other: China from accessing the American technology, capital and market while the United States benefited from China\u2019s cheap and hard-working labor and later its vast market.\nRelations have soured since China has becomeincreasingly authoritarianunder President Xi Jinping and the United States increasingly isolationist under President Trump. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war since summer 2018. But Monday felt like a watershed moment as the Justice Department unveiledsweeping chargesagainst the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. A tech Cold War seems irreversible, and much of the world has to choose a side: China or the United States?\n\u201cThe Americans are not going to surrender global technological supremacy without a fight, and the indictment of Huawei is the opening shot in that struggle,\u201d Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration,told my colleagues.\nAt the core of the fight is a technology called the fifth generation, or 5G, mobile network that is expected to remake the plumbing that controls the internet. Huawei is a global leader in the technology. For the U.S. government, that poses serious security risks.\nAs detailed in an excellenttaleby my colleagues from the United States, Europe and China, over the past year the United States embarked on a global campaign to push its allies to bar Huawei\u2019s 5G build-out.\nOne thing in the article that really struck me is that some countries have questioned whether America\u2019s campaign is really about national security or if it is aimed at preventing China from gaining a competitive edge. \u201cAdministration officials see little distinction in those goals,\u201d my colleagues wrote.\nIn the eyes oflawmakers and intelligence officialsin the United States, the Chinese government\u2019s tightening grip on its companies makes it impossible to distinguish whether a firm like Huawei is a business entity or an agent of the Chinese government because no company could choose whether to cooperate with Beijing or not.\nThis is what I call the Chinese curse for Chinese companies. Huawei may have done many wrong things, including stealing trade secrets and violating sanctions, but that won\u2019t change the fact that its employees, scientists and executives had put a lot of blood and sweat to grow it from a tiny maker of telecom equipment to a global giant. Huawei exemplifies how the Chinese lifted themselves out of poverty and became a technological power through perseverance.\nBut because China has an authoritarian government that believes the Communist Party should control everything and everything in the country should serve the interest of the party, it is nearly unimaginable that any Chinese company can say no to government requests, especially if they are made repeatedly and in the name of national security.\nSome readers must already be screaming that just like Huawei, China developed its technologies by stealing intellectual properties and forcing foreign companies to share their knowledge in exchange for market access. Yes, China has committed many wrongdoings and needs to admit and correct its mistakes in order to set forth on the right path in the future. And the world needs to become more alert to the threat of China\u2019s techno-authoritarianism (see the link to the George Soros speech below). Still, I can\u2019t help but reserve some sympathies for the Chinese who are caught in the middle of the fight.\nThe relationship between the United States and China can\u2019t go back to what it had been in the last 40 years. Even if the trade war is resolved with China promising to buy a lot of American products, the Huawei problem and the tech war aren\u2019t going away.\nIt\u2019s the struggle for global supremacy. Neither side is going to back off easily. Some 170 nations will have to choose to either let go of Huawei, thus crossing Beijing, or lose the support of Washington by staying with Huawei.\nHere are a few things worth reading if you haven\u2019t:\n\u25a0 This is a little dated, but very relevant to the whole Huawei saga. In aspeechat the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the billionaire investor George Soros labeled President Xi the world\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous opponent of open societies,\u201d warning of the \u201cmortal danger\u201d in China\u2019s use of artificial intelligence to repress its people.\n\u25a0 My colleague Jack Nicas used the story ofa tiny screwto illustrate why Apple is unlikely to bring its manufacturing closer to home and why the economic decoupling of the United States and China will be tough and painful.\n\u25a0 Even Foxconn, Apple\u2019s biggest contract manufacturer in China, initially seemed tobowto the difficult economics of manufacturing in the United States. A top official of the company said on Wednesday that it was reassessing its plans to build a $10 billion Wisconsin plant to make flat-screen television and create 13,000 jobs. But on Friday, after a conversation between the company\u2019s chairman and President Trump, the companysaid it was committedto building the factory.\n\u25a0 The residents ofTonga, a remote island nation 1,100 miles northeast of New Zealand,losthigh-speed internet after an underwater fiber-optic cable was severed on Jan. 20. Daniel Victor talked to residents about how they survived the digital darkness.\n\u25a0 Geoffrey A. Fowler of The Washington Post wrote an excellentcolumnabout the ethical questions we should be asking ourselves as video doorbells and connected security cameras have become the fastest-growing smart home tech. Here\u2019s one piece of advice. \u201cFacial recognition isn\u2019t a product feature: It\u2019s a superpower.\u201d\nLi Yuan is the Asia tech columnist for The Times.

        "title": "Chief of Apple Stores Is Leaving After 5 Years in the Job",
        "fulltext": "Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief hired by Apple five years ago to oversee its stores, said Tuesday that she would leave the company in April.\nThe departure is an unusual move for a top executive at Apple, which is facing retail challenges as sales in China have dropped and iPhone sales have turned sluggish.\nMs. Ahrendts, 58, wasone of Apple\u2019s most prominent hireswhen the Silicon Valley company lured her from Burberry withan initial $73 million pay packagein 2014. She had spent eight years as Burberry\u2019s chief executive and was credited with expanding it into an international fashion brand.\nOver five years, Ms. Ahrendts was among Apple\u2019s highest-paid executives, earning more than $170 million, according to securities filings.\nApple said in a news release that she was leaving \u201cfor new personal and professional pursuits.\u201d\nOne of Ms. Ahrendts\u2019s primary goals was to improve Apple\u2019s online retail operation so it was as admired as its sleek, minimalist stores. She generally succeeded, allowing customers, for example, to order online and pick up items in a store, said Neil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst.\nMr. Cybart said that Apple\u2019s stores remained among the most lucrative in the world by square foot, and that traffic to them had been steady.\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily see any huge red flags,\u201d he said while discussing the circumstances of Ms. Ahrendts\u2019s exit.\nUnder Ms. Ahrendts, Apple started offering more public talks, concerts and seminars at its stores in an attempt to draw in customers who weren\u2019t necessarily in the market for a new device.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. We actually don\u2019t call them stores anymore,\u201d Ms. Ahrendts said at an Apple event in 2017. \u201cWe call them town squares.\u201d She waslater criticizedfor suggesting that a store with $1,000 products could be a community gathering place.\nMs. Ahrendts said in a statement that \u201cthe last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling of my career.\u201d\nDeirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s human resources chief, will take over management of the retail operation in addition to her current duties, the company said. She has worked for Apple for three decades.\nMs. O\u2019Brien, 52, is a surprising choice as the new retail chief, given her already heavy load handling human resources for more than 100,000 employees. She will add responsibilities that include \u201cstrategy, real estate and development, and operations of Apple\u2019s physical stores, Apple\u2019s online store and contact centers,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s website.\nApple was probably willing to give her such a large role to keep retail in the hands of a company veteran, Mr. Cybart said.\nApple operates 506 stores on five continents, about a 25 percent increase since Ms. Ahrendts was hired. Mr. Cybart said Apple had recently increased its focus on adding stores in prominent locations in major cities like Chicago and Milan.\nTwo Wedbush Securities analysts, Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe, said in a research note that one of Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s focuses would be stimulating demand in China, where the retail experience is important.\nThey said they were encouraged that Apple had chosen Ms. O\u2019Brien over an outside hire, given the company\u2019s recent struggles.\n\u201cWhile the timing of this departure is a head scratcher, change could be a good thing for Apple, as the last year has been nothing to write home about,\u201d they wrote."
