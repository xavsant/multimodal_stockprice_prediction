        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: The Cautionary Tale of the Fall of Yahoo",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Ahoy, Farhad! What\u2019s new with you? Right now I\u2019m watching my dog sleep and thinking if somehow mycryogenic life extensionfails and I eventually die, I hope to be reincarnated as a Bernese mountain dog. All she does issleep, eat and play.\nFarhad:That\u2019s an odd choice. I would much rather come back as a bird \u2014 and not just any bird, but one of those huge, mean, absolutely lethal birds of prey, something like an eagle or condor or falcon. When you\u2019re an eagle no one messes with you, least of all some silly mountain dog that can\u2019t even fly.\nMike:Me as a dog will totally bark at you as an eagle.\nMoving on to tech news!\nSo this week was tech company earnings week, or what I like to call boring hell week. It is not a lot of fun because it\u2019s a bunch of numbers and math, which is really not what I signed up for when deciding to enter journalism as a career. I studied Faulkner in college, notFibonacci.\nFarhad: I don\u2019t believe that. You once told me \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d was your favorite U2 album.\nMike: Saying I like U2 in a public newsletter is dangerously close to libel, sir.\nThe good thing, I will grant, is that you get at least some insight into the health and well-being of how a public company is faring, something that we really aren\u2019t able to get \u2014 at least not that easily \u2014 when dealing with privately owned companies.\nSo what happened this week? Twitter said it expecteddecelerating revenue growthin the months to come, and the stock tanked. Facebook also said itexpected decelerating revenue growthin the months to come, but the stock went up like a rocket ship. Both companies are aggressively pursuing video as the messiah of how to increase advertising revenue in the years ahead. No one knows if either can really pull it off, but everyone thinks Facebook will do it because Facebook can do no wrong.\nAlso, Google is stillminting money, as isAmazon. And Amazon said it employs nearly 270,000 people, which is up 47 percent from last year. That\u2019s nuts, right? I can\u2019t think of many companies that do that.\nFarhad:At Microsoft, meanwhile, things are going the other way. In May the company said it would be cutting1,850 jobsin its latest wave of layoffs; now in a new regulatory filing, Microsoft reports it will belaying off 2,850 more.\nMike: And practically every chief executive mentioned Pok\u00e9mon Go on their earnings calls, which was funny and predictable. Even Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have Pok\u00e9mon fever. Or should I say, they\u2019re pandering to Pok\u00e9mon players. Anything to capture thatWigglytuffvoting base.\nApparently Tim Cook doesn\u2019t even know how to properly pronounce Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 he said something like \u201cpokey man\u201d \u2014 which probably threatened to hurt Apple\u2019s quarterly financials. Luckily, Apple didn\u2019t do aspoorly as analysts expected, and the stock actually fared well. And by \u201cdidn\u2019t do as poorly\u201d I mean they still made bazillions of dollars, as usual.\nFarhad: One thing they\u2019re doing with those bazillions: Makingself-driving software for cars, according to Bloomberg. Apple\u2019s car project, known as Project Titan, has previously been devoted to building its own vehicle. But after lots of shifts in personnel, the company now seems to be trying to prioritize the autonomous car software. Apple still might also develop a car, Bloomberg reported, but it could establish partnerships with established car companies to realize its vision for the future of driving.\nWhich sounds cool, but when I\u2019m a peregrine falcon, I won\u2019t need to drive anywhere, because I\u2019ll be one ofthe fastest animals in the world.\nMike:Yeah. In non-earnings news, folks are starting to think that the hackers who breached the Democratic National Committee may have beenconnected to the Russian government, which brings us full circle to the plot of \u201cThe Americans\u201d on FX.\nO.K., now onto the big thing. Yahoo, the company I never think about except to say \u201cha, ha, Yahoo,\u201d finally agreed tosell itself to Verizon for about $5 billion, a relative pittance compared to Yahoo\u2019s market cap in its heyday as one of the internet\u2019s premier companies. And thank God for it. If I had to read another Yahoo story I was gonna quit journalism.\nThat said, I have an idea for its send-off from us. We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.\nI\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.\nFarhad:I think Yahoo\u2019s failure offers one lesson above all for tech companies: Invest in technology. I know that sounds obvious, but it\u2019s one place where Yahoo totally missed the boat from the beginning. It started out in the 1990s as a guide to the web that was created by human beings. In other words, from its very inception, Yahoo was more of a media company than a tech company. And that origin story infected its culture \u2014 sure, it had lots of engineers and acquired lots of innovative tech, but at its core Yahoo never really saw itself as a company whose mission was to invent the next big thing.\nNotice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.\nYahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.\nMike:I really agree with this, mostly because I always like to see Wall Street\u2019s reaction to tech companies reporting quarterly losses. Maybe I\u2019m brainwashed, but it\u2019s funny to hear people bemoan the death of innovation at companies and in the same breath criticize companies for spending heavily on research and development. I appreciate fiscal responsibility, but I think looking at a quarterly report without that appreciation is a bit shortsighted.\nI will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.\nProblem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.\nIt\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog. Till next week, Falco! I mean, Farhad!\nFarhad:See you. I hope you don\u2019t get fleas."

        "title": "Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real",
        "fulltext": "Artificial intelligence is booming. But why now?\nMove over, social media and mobility: Silicon Valley has a next big thing, John Markoffwrites, and it\u2019s A.I. and robots. It is useful to think of them as part of the same thing, since many robots are autonomous machines programmed for decision making based on A.I.\nThe movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That\u2019s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble.\nYet it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn\u2019t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would?\nThe answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago.\nIn 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It\u2019s typically called \u201cunstructured\u201d data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world\u2019s databases.\nThat new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem.\nTo money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I.\nOnly one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things.\nThat created many more places where computers could do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation.\nIt\u2019s enough to make you believe in this boom.\nWhat could make you believe it\u2019s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own. If big money goes into that stuff, run for the hills."

        "title": "Spotify and Apple Music: The Goth vs. the Stoner",
        "fulltext": "In this episode, we depart from the familiar letter-and-intervention format for a dive into the world of music streaming services. It is a topic that fascinates the Haggler, who can still barely fathom that for a mere $10 a month, he can get access to just about any musical recording on the planet.\nBut which streaming app is the best? The Haggler has been mulling this question for a while, and after a lot of dabbling he regards Spotify as the gold standard. It is sturdy and remarkably fast; when you play a song from the cloud, it starts so quickly it seems to be waiting for you.\nThe system is also easy to use. Streaming services, at least to the Haggler, are all about creating playlists \u2014 grabbing albums and songs and putting them in a place where you can find them quickly. That process is simple and intuitive on Spotify.\nIf the system has a weakness, it is a less-than-lovely user interface, which is black and a Halloweenish shade of green \u2014 a little too goth for the Haggler\u2019s tastes. Far more important, it isn\u2019t great at introducing you to new albums and acts. It has features and algorithms designed to help you find undiscovered music, but they aren\u2019t compelling or visually appealing enough to be much help. The Haggler winds up listening to the same stuff over and over.\nThis is why the Haggler has been rooting for Apple Music since an Android version of it was unveiled in November. The user interface is gorgeous \u2014 bright, airy and dominated by album art \u2014 and it is the finest new music introduction system ever created. It\u2019s like a professional matchmaker who never sleeps. It is always trying to find you something to love.\nBut for all its upsides, Apple Music for iOS has been criticized for randomly deleting both songs and playlists. On Android, though, the app behaves even more weirdly. It took the Haggler a while to figure out what was happening. Then, a few weeks ago, it all became clear: Apple Music is stoned.\nNot dinner-party stoned, either. Apple Music is fried. It has the kind of \u201cWhere am I?\u201d buzz that should worry its friends. To wit: When the Haggler tries to turn an album into a playlist, only half the songs make the journey. Or all the songs make the journey but there are three copies of many. Or two copies. Sometimes, inexplicably, the songs are arranged alphabetically.\n\u201cHeh heh heh,\u201d says Apple Music, or so it seems to the Haggler\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019m really high right now.\u201d\nYou sure are! Just as bad, the system is supposed to learn what music you like, but no matter how many times the Haggler presses the \u201cI don\u2019t like this suggestion\u201d button on jazz albums, Apple Music keeps serving up Chet Baker and Bill Evans in a \u201cFor you\u201d list on the main menu. That\u2019s especially vexing because each time that button is pressed, up pops this message: \u201cGot it. We\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\nBut Apple Music forgets. Do you know why? It\u2019s totally baked.\nWhen someone consumes this amount of weed, for so long, it\u2019s time for an intervention, and fortunately Apple Music just completed one. On July 8, the company updated the program, promising a fix for an assortment of bugs. A fix for the iOS version was released a few weeks ago.\nThe Haggler doesn\u2019t own an iPhone, so he can\u2019t comment on whether it has improved, though the \u201cMy music has vanished!\u201d online complaints do seem to have died down. But he is happy to report that on his Android smartphone, the fixes work. Since the program update, playlists have been rationally sorted. No more triple copies, no more alphabetized albums.\nSo is it time to ditch Spotify? Not so fast. Apple Music is still missing essential features. It doesn\u2019t let users make and share their own playlists, \u00e0 la Spotify, which is how the Haggler got to know every song from the HBO show \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d (Some fan of the show just made a compilation.) Apple Music also lacks crossfade, which allows the next song to fade in, over a customizable number of seconds, as the last song fades out. This is invaluable if you listen to music in part to block out the noise made by the rest of the universe.\nAlso, while it\u2019s off recreational drugs, Apple Music is still balkier than Spotify, and is more likely to leave you staring at a spinning red line as it gathers its wits and looks for songs. And Apple Music has failed to streamline its playlist adding system. On Spotify, a playlist of Drake\u2019s album \u201cViews\u201d is automatically designated \u201cDrake \u2014 Views.\u201d On Apple Music, when you create a new playlist, it has no idea what to call it. The name is blank. So you have to type it yourself. This isn\u2019t exactly hard labor. But it adds to the sense that Apple Music needs more tweaks.\nThe Haggler contacted Apple, but the company would not discuss whether any of these tweaks were coming, because it generally does not discuss future iterations of products.\nWhat\u2019s odd is that Apple is the user interface master of the world. If anything, you would expect it to take the bar established by Spotify and then leap over it. Instead, at least in a few crucial areas, it\u2019s lagging.\nYet recently, after a few hours of rummaging around the \u201cRadio\u201d section of Apple Music \u2014 a bunch of shows curated by artists and D.J.s \u2014 the Haggler fell hard for a fantastic indie band from Oklahoma called Broncho and its song \u201cClass Historian.\u201d On Dr. Dre\u2019s radio station, the Pharmacy, he was reacquainted with A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cOh My God\u201d which he hadn\u2019t heard in years. The \u201cFor you\u201d list last week included an album of Beethoven\u2019s string trios that the Haggler will never again live without.\nIf only someone could splice together the best parts of Apple Music and the best parts of Spotify, and then subtract each of their flaws. Unlikely, yes. But the Haggler can dream."

        "title": "Joshua Brown, Who Died in Self-Driving Accident, Tested Limits of His Tesla",
        "fulltext": "CANTON, Ohio \u2014 Joshua Brown loved his all-electric Tesla Model S so much he nicknamed it Tessy.\nAnd he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.\n\u201cI do drive it a LOT,\u201d he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.\nThey also tend to be people who like to live on technology\u2019s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown\u2019s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks.\nHis Tesla, in other words, was simply one more extension of his technology-driven life. It took him on far-flung adventures from the gravel driveway of the pale-blue clapboard house where he lived alone in Canton, an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland.\nThe driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.\nBut Mr. Brown became a victim of an innovation geared precisely to people like him when hisTeslaModel S electric sedan collided with a semitrailer truck on a Florida highway in May, making him the first known fatality in a self-driving car.\n\u201cHe liked it mainly because it was an exceptional use of technology, and Josh was very much an innovator,\u201d said his friend Paul Snow, who recalled how excited Mr. Brown was about his Tesla during a recent road trip. \u201cHe enjoyed the fact that technology was available, that it was being used to, ironically, increase safety on the roads.\u201d\nTesla owners are a devoted bunch. Immediately after the companyunveileda prototype of its Model 3 car, more than 200,000 enthusiasts put down deposits on the vehicles, which start at $35,000 and will not be available until next year.\nMany owners like to showcase their cars on social media, creating songs, routines and otherdemonstrationsof different features, particularly to show offhow Autopilot works.\nMr. Brown\u2019s most recent video was his most popular. Titled \u201cAutopilot Saves Model S,\u201d it shows Mr. Brown driving on an interstate highway from Cleveland to Canton. A white truck cuts in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, and by his account, the Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature swerves the car to the right, avoiding a collision.\nAfter Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder, called attention to the video on Twitter, it went viral.\nMr. Brown seemed to be elated.\n\u201cHe had said, \u2018For something to catch Elon Musk\u2019s eye, I can die and go to heaven now,\u2019\u201d said a neighbor, Krista Kitchen, choking up. \u201cHe was absolutely thrilled \u2013 and then a couple weeks later he died.\u201d\nIn a statement, theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administrationsaid preliminary reports indicated that the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The agency did not name the victim, but the Florida Highway Patrol identified him as Mr. Brown.\nMs. Kitchen said Mr. Brown, 40, had just left a family trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando. His relatives did not respond to requests for comment. At Mr. Brown\u2019s house, behind an expansive, well-trimmed lawn, a man who answered the door on Friday said the family did not wish to speak to reporters.\nMs. Kitchen and others described how Mr. Brown would eagerly share his Tesla with friends, letting them take turns behind the wheel. And they described a man who was broadly generous with his time, who consistently helped friends in need, and who stayed in touch with his fellow veterans.\nAfter Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\n\u201cHe was certainly an adventurer,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cHe was a warrior that served proudly for his country; he was a patriot. He did many things that had never been done before.\u201d\nMr. Brown was particularly interested in testing the limits of the Autopilot function, documenting how the vehicle would react in blind spots, going around curves and other more challenging situations.\n\u201cThis section in here is going to be very, very difficult for the car to handle,\u201d he said in one video, posted in October, as his vehicle rounded a curve. \u201cWe\u2019re filming this just so you can see scenarios where the car does not do well.\u201d\nMark Vernon, a high school classmate who recalled tinkering with electronics in shop class together, said that his friend showed off the self-driving feature on a recent visit at Mr. Brown\u2019s home.\n\u201cHe knew the hill that it would give up on, because it couldn\u2019t see far enough,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cHe knew all the limitations that it would find and he really knew how it was supposed to work.\u201d\nMr. Brown attended the University of New Mexico, where he studied physics and computer science, but did not graduate, the school said. Instead, he joined the Navy, where he served for more than a decade and specialized in disarming explosives, according to his company\u2019s website.\nHis service included a stint with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6. Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said he had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201d\nTesla owners tend to share a love of technology, and an eagerness to embrace the unknown, the untested or the unproven. Photos posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page show a love of the outdoors, where he rappelled down cliffs and jumped out of airplanes for fun.\nOne of those struck by Mr. Brown\u2019s adventurous side was Terri Lyn Reed, a senior insurance account executive who said she had helped Mr. Brown set up the insurance at his company,Nexu Innovations.\n\u201cHe\u2019d probably fly an F-18 to test-drive it,\u201d she said, referring to the military fighter jet.\nTesla enthusiasts often also share a loyalty to the company, much the way Apple has engendered true believers whom it relies on to back the introduction of new iPhones, Macs and other products.\nRichard Henry, 26, who bought a 2015 Model S about nine months ago, uses Autopilot to take him through about 40 miles of freeway driving on each leg of his commute between San Francisco and Mountain View.\nWhen he started using his car\u2019s Autopilot mode, it had a tendency to lose track of the highway lines and tell him to take control. But in the last few months it has improved more and more. Most days he turns it on and sits with his hands on his knees \u2014 ready to take the wheel, he pointed out.\nLearning about the technology and getting used to it has been \u201csuperfun,\u201d he said. That is a point that separates him from the many other drivers who tend to learn how to use a few necessary functions in their car and never bother with most others. \u201cI really like trying stuff like this out and understanding how the technology works,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\nMr. Brown\u2019s enthusiasm for technology factored deeply into his work at Nexu, which specialized in setting up internet access in rural areas of the country where forests and mountains created special obstacles to entering the connected world.\n\u201cJosh knew how to get around all the interference from all the trees and all the hills,\u201d said Cindi Staneski, who runs theHickory Run Campgroundin Denver, Pa., an 80-acre operation that became one of Mr. Brown\u2019s early clients.\n\u201cThe big companies wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d Ms. Staneski said, adding that Mr. Brown had become a mentor to her son. \u201cIt was too difficult, or they just wanted to charge you an extreme amount of money, whereas Josh felt that we deserved a chance that everybody else had.\u201d"

On some routers, likeApple\u2019s line of AirPortbase stations,a blinking yellow lightis usually a sign that the router needs your attention.\nIf you have not lost your internet connection, the blinking yellow (or as Apple calls it, \u201camber\u201d) light can mean that a firmware update is available to install on the AirPort hardware. You canupdate the base station\u2019s firmwareby using the AirPort Utility software that came with it to download the update, connect to the AirPort hardware and install the firmware. If you do not have the app already, versions of the AirPort Utility are available online forWindowsandiOS, and the program is included with recent editions of the OS X operating system.\nYou may also see a blinking yellow light if the AirPort base station has been reset. On AirPort Time Capsule models, the blinking light can also indicate an internal hard-drive error.\nIf you cannot connect to the internet, the blinking yellow light may mean the cable from the modem to the AirPort device is unplugged or that the internet service from your provider is unavailable. TheAirPort + Wi-Fi Support section of Apple\u2019s sitehas additional troubleshooting information.\nOther router manufacturers likeLinksysandNetgearhave their own online guides to interpretingthe meaning of a flashing amber lighton the router. Depending on the company, a blinking light could mean that therouter\u2019s firmware is corruptedand needs to be reinstalled, but check the support area of the website for a guide to your specific model."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Have consumers lost their affection for Apple gadgets, or are they just waiting for the new iPhones to come out in September?\nEvery one of Apple\u2019s major hardware businessesposted declinesin the three months that ended in June, thecompany reportedon Tuesday.\nIt was thesecond quarter in a row of falling salesas the technology giant wrestles with a saturated market and a slow shift to services, not gear, as a major driver of the company\u2019s profits. Over all, the company posted revenue of $42.4 billion, down 15 percent compared with the same quarter last year.\nThe quarter that ended in March was thefirst time in 13 yearsthat revenue at Apple, which has spent much of the last five years as the world\u2019s most valuable company, was lower than in the same period a year earlier.\nThe introduction of the 4-inch iPhone SE earlier this year appeared to hurt revenue and profits as some customers bought that device instead of Apple\u2019s bigger, more expensive models.\n\u201cApple is moving from only iPhones matter to iPhones and services matter,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, who estimated that nearly one-third of the company\u2019s quarterly profits came from services like App Store purchases, Apple Music subscriptions and the iCloud storage business. Revenue in the segment rose 19 percent to $6 billion.\nStill, Apple is still primarily a hardware company and its products did not fare well.\nThe number of iPhones sold dropped 15 percent, compared with the same quarter a year ago, and revenue plunged 23 percent. The number of Macs sold fell 11 percent, and the number of iPads fell 9 percent. And sales of the Watch, Apple\u2019s newest product, plunged 55 percent compared with the previous year, according to the research firm IDC, which published itsown assessment on Fridaysince Apple does not break out its smartwatch sales.\nNet income was $7.8 billion, or $1.42 a share, down 27 percent.\nApple\u2019s weak results were partly a result of the company\u2019s position at the end of its product cycle. In September, it is expected to announce major upgrades to its iPhone hardware and software, which happens every two years. Many Apple customers hold off buying a new phone in the months before a big release so that they can get the newest model.\nBut Apple is also wrestling with longer-term issues. The smartphone market in developed countries like the United States is saturated, and newer markets like India buy hardly any iPhones.\nChina, long a source of growth for Apple, is itself slowing down, with revenue down 33 percent. But revenue from Europe was down just 7 percent. In an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that Apple had experienced little impact from the Brexit vote on sales in Britain.\nThe declines were less steep than Wall Street had expected after the gloomy outlook Apple had laid out three months ago. Shares of Apple rose about 7 percent in after-hours trading.\n\u201cThe valuations had been driven down based on expectations of no growth,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG Research. \u201cNow investors can start focusing on what they\u2019re going to say in September about the new products.\u201d\nMr. Maestri said the quarter\u2019s sales drop looked worse than it was because Apple held back on shipments to retailers, particularly in China, so that the stores could clear out their existing inventory of Apple gear. On that basis, iPhone sales were down only 8 percent, Mr. Maestri said.\nThe revenue from iPad sales also rose as customers bought the more expensive iPad Pros even as sales of traditional iPads sank.\nApple projected that the next quarter would be a down quarter, but after that, when the new phones are fully in the market, Wall Street expects the company to return to growth.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, suggested that Apple TV in particular might be the basis for substantial innovation but offered no specifics.\nMr. Piecyk said that Apple was also increasing its spending on research and development \u2014 a sign of new products in the pipeline beyond simple updates of existing ones.\n\u201cThere are so many places of pain out there in our lives \u2014 the living room, the car \u2014 where there\u2019s room for substantial improvement,\u201d he said."
