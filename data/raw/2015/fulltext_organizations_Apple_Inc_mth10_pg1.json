        "fulltext": "The Central Committee of China\u2019s Communist Party is scheduled to hold its annual policy session in Beijing from Monday through Thursday. The meeting may bring leadership changes, including in the military, which could reinforce President Xi Jinping\u2019s influence. The gathering is expected to begin drafting a new five-year plan, which will begin in 2016, that aims, in part, to make the currency more convertible and bring more market disciplines to state-owned enterprises.\nBut many important details will not be formally approved and released until the national legislature meets in March. The last several autumn sessions have not produced far-reaching economic policy changes, as reformers have not reached consensus with advocates of state control.\u2014Keith Bradsher\nThis is not the meeting you\u2019ve been waiting for. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making committee convenes in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday, but it\u2019s not likely to make any changes in policy. The committee is expected to keep the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate near zero.\nThe real question is whether the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in December. Officials, who are likely to debate that issue in private, could provide some hints in the post-meeting statement.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum\nTwo reports come out on Tuesday that should give some sense of the American economy\u2019s momentum this fall, especially given headwinds from Asia and wobbles on Wall Street in August and September.\nFirst will be government data on durable goods orders for September \u2014 Wall Street is looking for a 1.3 percent decline, following a steeper drop in August. The headline figure is heavily influenced by volatile orders for aircraft, which are thought to have weakened last month. Economists will be looking at the underlying details to see if other sectors were stronger.\nSecond will be a report on consumer confidence in October from the Conference Board. Economists are expecting a slight drop from the September level because of the weak report on unemployment for September and signs that the economy may not be growing as quickly as it did in the second quarter. Stocks have rallied this month, however, which could provide a boost in sentiment.\u2014Nelson D. Schwartz\nOn Tuesday, Apple reports earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street will continue to focus on sales of the iPhone, which account for the bulk of Apple\u2019s revenue and profit. Investors will also pay close attention to Apple\u2019s performance in China to see whether the economic and market woes there affected the company\u2019s sales.\nApple has also released a few new products over the past year or so, including Apple Pay and Apple Music. But few analysts expect those initiatives to have an impact on Apple\u2019s financial results anytime soon.\u2014Katie Benner\nTwitter will report its third-quarter financial results on Tuesday. Jack Dorsey, who moved from interim to permanent chief executive this month, offered his analysis of the social media company\u2019s woes during the second-quarter call: The service is too hard to use.\nThis quarter, Wall Street will be looking for more details on how Mr. Dorsey plans to tame Twitter\u2019s troubles. Analysts have recently slashed their long-term forecasts for the company\u2019s revenue, and are predicting little or no user growth in the near future.\u2014Vindu Goel\nIt will be a busy week for auto company earnings, with both Ford and Fiat Chrysler reporting their third-quarter results. General Motors already set a high bar when it reported its quarterly earnings last week, which included larger-than-expected profits and an operating margin in North America of nearly 12 percent. Ford will be up first on Tuesday.\nThe company\u2019s flagship vehicle, the F-150 pickup truck, is finally at full production, and investors will be interested to learn how well the new mostly aluminum-bodied truck is doing. Analysts expect Ford to deliver a higher operating profit for the quarter than last year. Fiat Chrysler, which reports on Wednesday, is also expected to post higher year-over-year earnings. The company\u2019s Jeep division has been thriving as Americans flock back to trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u2014Aaron Kessler\nA half dozen of Europe\u2019s biggest lenders are reporting their third-quarter results this week, including the British lenders Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group; the Spanish bank Santander; the German lender Deutsche Bank; and the French bank BNP Paribas.\nSeveral investment banks, including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have reported disappointing results in the third quarter as uncertainty in the financial markets weighed on their results, particularly in bond and fixed-income trading.\nAnalysts also expect a number of banks in Europe to look to raise capital in the coming months as they seek to meet stricter requirements by regulators. Alongside its third-quarter results, Credit Suisse announced plans this month to raise 6.05 billion Swiss francs, or about $6.2 billion, as well as shrink its investment bank and cut costs.\u2014Chad Bray\nThe brewing giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller have until Wednesday under British takeover rules to complete their discussions on a potential merger. The world\u2019s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, struck an agreement in principle this month to acquire its closest rival, SABMiller, for about $104 billion and agreed to extend a deadline to complete a deal until this week. If the brewers aren\u2019t able to do so by Tuesday, it is possible that SABMiller will seek permission from British regulators to extend the deadline again.\nThe deal is expected to garner extensive regulatory scrutiny given the size of the combined company and its potential dominance in several markets worldwide, including the United States. If completed, the combination would create a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion.\u2014Chad Bray\nOn Wednesday, PayPal will post its first earnings report as an independent company since it was spun out from eBay in July. Analysts will be watching PayPal\u2019s mobile payments growth, which, along with total payments processed, has been steadily rising for years. Watch closely to see if PayPal\u2019s proposed acquisition of Xoom, the digital money transfers start-up, is finally closed.\u2014Mike Isaac\nOn Thursday, the Commerce Department will release its preliminary estimate of economic growth in the United States in the third quarter. Economists are looking for the economy to have grown at an annual rate of 1.6 percent over the course of July, August and September, well below the 3.9 percent rate recorded in the second quarter. \u2014Nelson D. Schwartz\nDeutsche Bank is expected to update investors on its strategy on Thursday, the same day that it will probably report a huge loss as part of its third-quarter results. The bank, one of the largest in Europe, said this month that it expected to post a net loss of 6.2 billion euros, or about $7 billion, in the quarter. The loss is expected to be driven by $1.3 billion in additional provisions for potential fines and settlements as it faces regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States, as well as a write-down of its investment in a Chinese bank, Hua Xia.\u2014Chad Bray\nExxon Mobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP will all report their third-quarter earnings this week, and the news is not likely to be good since oil and natural gas prices continued to slump in recent months. Investors will be hoping to hear that commodity prices have bottomed. But after the more than 50 percent decline in the value of a barrel of crude since the summer of 2014, executives are expected to warn that the coming year is going to be another tough one, with more cuts in exploration and production.\u2014Clifford Krauss"

        "title": "Business Technology Starts to Get Personal",
        "fulltext": "Last week, the heads of two of America\u2019s biggest companies said almost the same thing about what personalized technology would mean to the future of business.\nFirst, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said his consumer technology company was starting to address the business world, which people in tech call \u201cthe enterprise.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to make tools to help people change the world, and that means being in the enterprise,\u201d Mr. Cook said at a conference on Tuesday for Box, a company that makes online storage and collaboration\n                                        tools. It is, he said, \u201ca huge opportunity for us.\u201d\nJeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, endorsed that view later in the day. \u201cIndustrial companies have yet to feel the benefit of the Internet the way consumers have,\u201d he said in an interview.\n                                        \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\nEach man takes his stand relative to where he sits. Mr. Cook talked about the prospects for the kind of mobile Internet services delivered on iPhones and iPads and developed on Macs. Mr. Immelt is building a system\n                                        of sensors and so-called predictive data analysis that he hopes will deliver to G.E. $10 billion in revenue by 2020. That same year, G.E. is forecasting, there will be one billion connected electric meters, 100\n                                        million connected light bulbs and 152 million connected cars globally.\nBut what does it mean for business technology to be like consumer tech? Looking at consumer tech today, the answer is personalization.\nGoogle looks at your searches, emails and other online behavior and sends you a likely ad. Facebook reads your social behavior to the same end. Online media uses tracking cookies. The iPhone logs your location and sends\n                                        it to various places.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Tesla cars and Nest thermostats are designed to watch what you do with them and adjust themselves to better serve you.\nRemarkably, mass-produced goods increasingly personalize into something unique because of a lot of snooping on you. Few consumers turn personalizing features off, adjust use or boycott the products. In a conflict of\n                                        personalization and privacy, personalization has triumphed.\nMr. Immelt foresaw much the same kind of thing happening with machines. \u201cWe can now track every jet engine separately throughout its life,\u201d he said, giving each one the machine equivalent of a Facebook\n                                        page, which states where it is and how it is \u201cfeeling,\u201d making maintenance more efficient.\nChanging the behavior of devices will enable companies, he said, \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t allow any space between the customer and you.\u201d\nMr. Cook was less clear, but Apple\u2019s joint agreements with Cisco Systems and IBM aimed at business are almost certain to involve a lot of personal identification and location awareness, if only in the name of\n                                        corporate security. There are already office apps that interact with people depending on location and job status. Equipment and software like whiteboards or conference-call phones record who is in a meeting or tag\n                                        what was said.\nMany people expect to see machines develop relationships with their operators. \u201cA camera on every machine will identify who you are,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s digital business. \u201cIt\n                                        will configure itself optimally for the person using it, or be looking at you and others and figuring out the best practices for its own operation.\u201d\nTaking orders from a lathe, he noted, \u201ccould feel threatening, but it\u2019s the opposite \u2014\u00a0 it\u2019s effective on-the-job training.\u201d\nThat sounds like a high-tech version of Taylorism, the so-called \u201cscientific management\u201d pioneered by Fredrick Winslow Taylor a hundred years ago. Taylor timed workers doing things like shoveling and lifting,\n                                        broke their work into discrete steps and figured out the optimal speeds that work could be done.\nOptimal behavior became a quota, akin to the way packers in warehouses are timed today. A small problem: Taylor made up or fudged a lot of his \u201cscientific data,\u201d but the idea stuck.\nWe may see a big data version of the idea. \u201cIt will be based on billions of objective data points, not crude rules of thumb,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute\n                                        of Technology. \u201cIt will be personalized to individuals under different conditions and times of day, and it will be more flexible.\u201d\nMr. Brynjolfsson is one of the authors of \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d a book on an industrial world enchanted by computing. He foresees other peculiarities.\n\u201cWith enough data, you can infer drug use or political persuasions,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things that are racing ahead, and we haven\u2019t thought them through.\u201d\nThere will be benefits like buying a used car and knowing how it was driven and what is likely to go wrong with it. There may also be challenging effects from companies that collect and manipulate their data the best.\n\u201cThere is a huge opportunity for efficiency gains, but there will be side effects from taking out all the opacity around how things last and behave,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said. \u201cA product that is 30\n                                        percent, or even three-tenths of a percent, better will get ordered more.\u201d\nA good place, in other words, to be Apple or General Electric. The rest of us may have to be on our toes. It is likely that a lot of others will be. If it turns out like the consumer Internet, we\u2019ll be delighted\n                                        with the rewards of being spied on, even if we don\u2019t know what they are yet."

        "fulltext": "The technology industry in recent years has been shaped by a clash of the titans \u2014 Google, Apple, Amazon and one or two other companies, which are increasingly getting into each other\u2019s businesses as software\n                                        and hardware blend and mix.\nThe latest evidence of that clash happened Thursday whenAmazon declared that it would stop selling the streaming media players made by Apple and Google.\n                                        With the move, Amazon, which makes its own streaming media devices, was sending a clear message that it would use its retail clout to put its rivals at a disadvantage.\nAmazon\u2019s action drew immediate criticism. Wired called Amazon\u2019s wielding of power\u201cgross.\u201dGizmodo said the move was\n                                        a\u201csick burn\u201dof Amazon\u2019s rivals.

It\u2019s important that the streaming\n                                        media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion.

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mr. Manjoo is off this week, so Mr. Isaac is conversing with Jim Kerstetter, deputy tech editor.\nMike:Another week, another newsletter without Farhad Manjoo. Also known as \u201cvacation Manjoo.\u201d\nBut look! It\u2019s trusty deputy tech editor and guy-who-could-probably-fire-me Jim Kerstetter! Did I mention you\u2019re looking particularly svelte today, Jim?\nJim:Why thank you, Mike. Might I say your beard looks particularly lush? Are you using conditioner?\nMike:You noticed! Beard oil, actually. I\u2019m not kidding.\nSo it has been quite a week in our industry. Apple releasedanother record quarterof sales, and analysts all shrugged and predicted the eventual end of the iPhone boom, as they tend to do. Nintendo is preparing to release its first smartphone game, which for some reason does not involve Mario or anyone wearing overalls and a mustache. I predict catastrophe.\nJim:First of all, it\u2019s pretty astonishing that Nintendo is just now getting around to releasing a smartphone game. Did they think these smartphone things were a fad? My daughter\u2019s little Nintendo DS is sitting on a bookshelf in our living room. It has been sitting on that shelf for two years. As for Apple, what can you say? At some point when you\u2019ve saturated the United States, Europe and China, sales are going to slow down. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re at that point. But what goes up\u2026\nI\u2019d like to talk a little about Twitter. Mike, you\u2019ve covered them since the early days. Is Jack Dorsey intentionally trying to scare the daylights out of his investors? He has excelled attalking down expectations.\nMike:It\u2019s interesting. On the one hand, you could see Dorsey\u2019s response as pragmatism: He came into a situation where the product is difficult to understand, people aren\u2019t coming to Twitter in droves, and it\u2019s not an overnight fix. He\u2019s trying to tell people that he\u2019s in it for the long haul, and things may sting for a while.\nBut I think you\u2019re right, it has been a bit much with the doom and gloom of the last two earnings calls. Maybe next time he goes for something less David Lynch and more, uh, Steven Spielberg?\nAnother thing I want to mentionis this news aboutGoogle\u2019sChrome operating system eventually becoming the same thing as its Android system. Or something like that. It\u2019s not clear, really, except to say that something is happening. Eventually.\nLet\u2019s step back a bit into super wonky nerd history. Once upon a time, Google had two nascent software projects: Chrome, a web browser, and Android, a mobile operating system. As with all successful things, they started small and grew into powerhouses in their own respective industries. Google\u2019s Chrome browser has eaten up tons of browser market share. And Android, as we all know, is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. Google did well for itself.\nSo what? Well, The Wall Street Journalpublished an articleon Thursday saying the two systems \u2014 which have long been speculated to be on a collision course \u2014 will eventually be folded together under the Android brand and operating system.\nI have my thoughts here. But since I talk a lot and we have this opportunity to hear from a wise and benevolent editor, you tell me if we should all freak out and start looting stores for the last remaining Chromebooks.\nJim:Who said I\u2019m benevolent? No need to freak out. Let\u2019s not confuse Chrome, the web browser I am now using, with Chrome OS, the other operating system at Google. Chrome OS was built on top of Chrome, the browser, but it is not the same as the browser. The browser known as Chrome is not going anywhere, and the operating system known as Chrome OS is also not going anywhere, according to people who are aware of these things but won\u2019t say it on the record. They\u2019re not killing it. At least not yet.\nWhat Google does plan to do is make sure Chromebooks can work on Android. Makes sense. Chrome OS was always a head-scratcher. It came out after Android and seemed to be competing with Android for oxygen at the Googleplex \u2014 but Chrome OS lost. Google can\u2019t say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re dumping Chrome OS\u201d because they\u2019ve sold millions of Chromebooks into academia and people there would reasonably freak out if they did. What they can do, however, is create some sort of transition period between the two.\nA little side note: Sundar Pichai, who now manages the part of Alphabet (it\u2019s going to take a few years to get used to saying that) that is still called Google, ran development of Chrome OS in its early days. The man is clearly not a sentimentalist.\nDo you know anyone who owns a Chromebook?\nMike:My mom loves Chromebooks! The last time I met Pichai I showed him a text from my mom who was going nuts over her Chromebook. He was psyched. It\u2019s basically an email and Internet machine, which is good for people who aren\u2019t editing video or killing zombies on a powerful PC.\nShe has bought four of them in the past four years. My mom breaks things.\nJim:Now let\u2019s talk about two things happening next week:Hewlett-Packard finally splits in twoand San Francisco votes on wicked strict laws on Airbnb rentals.\nThis election in San Francisco on Tuesday is going to be fascinating: It\u2019s like the whole city decided to vote on what it thinks of the tech industry in a bunch of propositions, not just the Airbnb regulations. My neighborhood does not have a big tech population, but where I used to live, in Noe Valley, has completely changed since I moved there in 2000. It\u2019s the new Pacific Heights. And for those of you who don\u2019t live in San Francisco (And why wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s really nice.), that means it has gotten insanely expensive. Is there still room in the city for people who don\u2019t expect to have an equity event?\nHP reminds me of the old Yankee Stadium. Sure, it was iconic and historic and all that, but chunks of cement were falling off the darn thing. HP is, as they say, the foundational Silicon Valley company. But it has been going through this \u201cwho are we?\u201d corporate soul searching since the \u201990s. It has had a succession of C.E.O.s flame out spectacularly, and the amazing thing is it still employs 300,000 people. Will you be taking off your hat for a moment of silence Sunday when the old HP officially fades away?\nMike:It\u2019s funny. I grew up with a Gateway, then a Compaq, then a Dell, and I think an HP before switching to Macbooks. So I have a bit of sentimentality around the decline and fall of a storied institution in need of a serious reset.\nThat said, my HP printer in college was total garbage and the ink was a rip-off. So I\u2019m not super broken up about it.\nO.K., thanks for stopping by, Jim! Let me know if you ever want to take over for Farhad again. Permanently.\nJim:Thanks, Mike. This was fun. I hope our readers in San Francisco remember to vote Tuesday. By the way, beard oil?"

        "title": "The New Apple TV Invigorates the Set-Top Box",
        "fulltext": "I NEVER imagined I would get hooked on reading comic books on a TV screen. That changed last week after I picked upa new Apple TV.\nThe new device, which is similar to a set-top box and brings video and music from the Internet to a television, now has an app store. So I downloaded Madefire, one of the first apps available for the new device. Madefire adds a twist to digital comics with sound effects, music and motion, bringing the panels to life on the big screen. Within minutes, I was bingeing on a series about Superman turning into a corrupt dictator.\nPlaying with apps is just one new feature of the revamped Apple TV, which will ship this week. It\u2019s that plethora of innovations and apps that leads me to conclude that the upgraded $149 box is now the best TV streaming device you can get for your money.\nYou can trust me because after testing hundreds of new devices for nearly a decade in this line of work, I\u2019m usually blas\u00e9 about products. My editor was concerned that body snatchers had taken me when I said I was positive about Apple TV. But I reserve excitement for products that I think will make a difference, this being one of them.\nForApple, this type of reaction to Apple TV is important. The box, which made its debut in 2007, was long labeled a \u201chobby\u201d by the company, and it accounts for a single-digit percentage of its revenue. With the new device, Apple is aiming to push hard into consumers\u2019 living rooms, where it faces competition from players including the Microsoft Xbox and Amazon\u2019s Fire TV device.\n\u201cThis is the foundation of the future of TV,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,said recentlyat a conference about Apple TV. \u201cWhat has to happen in the TV land, it has to be brought up and modernized.\u201d\nAll the extra features have now put Apple TV in a position to become a powerful apps and games console, not just a box for streaming movies and TV shows.\nEven for those more basic elements, the device is better at streaming video content than less expensive products from Amazon, Roku and Google, all of which I tested over the last month. While the new Apple box has flaws, it also has a cleaner interface for finding things to watch and a niftier remote control \u2014 not to mention more compelling apps and games.\nRedesigned Remote\nOne of the biggest changes is a redesigned remote control, which has a touch pad and a few physical buttons. It is also thicker, which is actually an improvement because the previous version was so thin that it had a tendency to vanish between couch cushions. More important, the remote includes a microphone and a button to summon Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, for finding content.\nSiri for Apple TV can search for movies or TV shows across multiple streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu and HBO, along with Apple\u2019s iTunes Store, and play them right away. Pressing the Siri button and speaking the command \u201cFind \u2018Fresh Off the Boat\u2019\u00a0\u201d will find that the TV show can be streamed on Hulu and iTunes; selecting the streaming service will instantly show a list of episodes.\nSiri has other tricks, too. If you\u2019re watching something and missed what a character just said, you can ask Siri: \u201cWhat did they just say?\u201d and it will rewind the video about 15 seconds and replay that portion with subtitles turned on, before switching the subtitles off.\nApple still has some kinks to work out with Siri. When I asked it to look up Nicolas Cage movies, it failed to find any relevant titles because it misspelled his first name as Nicholas (and try as I might, I could not make a silent \u201ch\u201d even more silent). When I tried the \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d command, Siri occasionally failed to display subtitles for content on Netflix and Hulu. Apple acknowledged both problems as known issues and said it was working to resolve them.\nWe tested video streaming devices from Apple, Amazon, Roku and Google, and the Apple TV stood out. But it\u2019s not the best for everyone. Here are the pros and cons of each device.\nGaming and Apps\nGaming on Apple TV is off to a promising start. The remote control includes motion sensors so it can double as a game controller. The game Beat Sports relied on the remote\u2019s motion sensors \u2014 swinging the remote makes the on-screen character whack a ball with a bat; the object of the game is to swing and whack the ball to the beat of the music.\nSome other games I tried, such as Rayman Adventures and Crossy Road, relied primarily on the touch pad to control the games. The game Transistor, a role-playing title, was awkward with the touch pad and would benefit from a physical game controller, which is a supported accessory.\nGaming graphics were also on par with Nintendo\u2019s Wii U, and some of the casual games seemed to compete directly in Nintendo\u2019s sweet spot: lightweight, family-friendly gaming. I still don\u2019t see players of deep action games like Halo abandoning their PlayStation 4 or Xbox One to play on an Apple TV, at least not until we see some hard-core games on the Apple device.\nOther than the Madefire comic book app, other early apps on the new device make clever use of an Internet-connected big screen. The Airbnb app offers immersive pictures of apartment rooms you can rent. The Periscope app is a fascinating glimpse into what people around the world are streaming live from their smartphones (beware: Many people like to point cameras at themselves and make comments about their uninteresting lives in front of an audience of strangers, but hey, that\u2019s better than Chatroulette).\nScreen Savers\nThe new device comes equipped with extremely customizable screen savers. Before you yawn from boredom, consider this: A screen saver can turn a TV into a living piece of art that is constantly changing, which is a great conversation starter at parties.\nFor my Apple TV, I set up an Internet recipe with the siteIf This Then That, so that whenever I upload a photo to Instagram or \u201cLike\u201d a photo that my friend took on Instagram, it shows up on my Apple TV screen saver. That way, rather than relentlessly bombarding guests with selfies of my partner and me on vacation in Hawaii, my wallpaper is a window into moments captured by all the interesting people I know, not just snapshots from my life.\nIf that setup is too complicated, Apple offers some neat screen savers, including high-definition videos of different locations shot from the sky, including the Great Wall of China.\nBuying Advice\nWhile the Apple TV is my favorite all-around streaming device, there are some weaknesses.\nSetting it up can be tedious. When you install streaming apps like Hulu and Netflix from the App Store, you type in your login credentials by swiping left and right with the remote to select letters of the alphabet one at a time \u2014 you have no option to do this by speaking into the microphone or using a keyboard on a smartphone.\nThe Apple TV may also not be the best streaming device for everyone because of one missing feature: the ability to stream content available in Ultra HD 4K TV, the latest high-definition resolution supported by some of the newest TV sets.\nFor early adopters of 4K television sets, theRoku 4, priced at $130, is a better bet. The Roku is versatile, has a nice selection of apps and has a comfortable remote control. Amazon\u2019s $100Fire TValso supports 4K, but I recommend against it because of its cheap-feeling remote control and less polished user interface.\nAnother competing device is Google\u2019s $35Chromecast, a miniature dongle that pulls streaming content from a smartphone. It\u2019s a good option for people on a tight budget, but I found it unreliable \u2014 sometimes videos failed to stream from my smartphone to the device.\nThere are two storage models for the Apple TV. For $149, you get 32 gigabytes; $199 buys 64 gigs. In my tests, apps and games were pretty slim in terms of data size, so 32 gigs should be enough for most people. Those who plan to do a lot of gaming will probably be safer with 64 gigs.\nApple TV is on the path to turning the television set into a smarter connected screen. And though it\u2019s the most expensive of the bunch, it will accrue more value over time as software developers expand its capabilities with more apps and games."

        "title": "The Mysterious Case of Apple and the Elusive Angela Ahrendts",
        "fulltext": "Thenewsthat Microsoft is opening a flagship on Fifth Avenue, not far from an Apple store, reminded me of a question that has been niggling at me for the last few weeks \u2014 ever since the Metropolitan Museum of Artannouncedits fashion gala in May would be sponsored by Apple, and WME/IMGdebutedits all-fashion channel on Apple TV.\nWhat happened to Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail and online stores, and its biggest fashion hire? Where is she in all of this?\nIn 2013, when Ms. Ahrendts waspoachedwith great fanfare from Burberry, where she was chief executive, fashion speculated that she might become the friendlier, more stylish, face of Apple; in her former job, she had been known for her communication skills and charm, and Apple is not known for its female executives. The potential upside of having her as both a manager and an ambassador seemed high.\nYet since starting last year, aside from a few LinkedInpostson management techniques and the news that she wasthe highest-paid female executive in the United States in 2014, with a combined package of $82.6 million, she has largely disappeared from public view.\nInstead, it is Jonathan Ive, chief design officer of Apple, who has become the face of the brand. It is Mr. Ive who will be at the top of the Met\u2019s steps with Anna Wintour, welcoming guests to the gala asan official \u201cco-chair\u201d;Mr. Ive who popped up, somewhat surprisingly, onthe Vanity Fair best-dressed listlast month; Mr. Ive who has become the embodiment of Apple\u2019s ambitions in the fashion world.\nAnd despite the fact that the retail rollout of the Apple Watch was, presumably, partly Ms. Ahrendts\u2019s responsibility, even Paul Deneve, the former Saint Laurent chief executive who joined Apple to lead special projects, has been more visible than Ms. Ahrendts, showing up at the cocktail party for the introduction of the Herm\u00e8s Apple Watch during Paris Fashion Week, and hobnobbing with his old style-world compatriots.\nIn a recent Fortuneprofiletied to the publication ranking her asthe 16th most powerful woman, a rare interview since Ms. Ahrendts joined Apple (and which, the magazine said, she agreed to only when it was clear they were writing the article whether she participated or not), she explained her absence by saying she wanted to first listen and learn. Fair enough. Listening was one of her signature traits at Burberry. And according to Fortune, she has slowly been changing the company\u2019s retail culture. (The fact you get an email or text telling you when it\u2019s time for your Genius Bar appointment so you don\u2019thave to hang around and wait? Thank Angela.)\nBut it\u2019s been more than 16 months, and it\u2019s hard not to think Apple is missing a trick here. Especially if it is interested in casting itself in part as a fashion brand.\nTo this end, how effective would it be to have Ms. Ahrendts play a public part in the brand\u2019s personalization (personalization being a big thing in fashion), along with Mr. Ive? After all, when it comes to experience and understanding of the style sector, with all its byzantine value systems and preconceptions, not to mention understanding fashion consumers and appealing to them in a very direct way, it\u2019s doubtful anyone else in the company hierarchy comes close.\nOn the most basic level, in terms of optics, seeing the very well-dressed Ms. Ahrendts wearing an Apple Watch the way she used to sport a Burberry suit (with an iPad) could be a very convincing visual tool. On a more abstract level, Ms. Ahrendts is an aspirational figure. People want to be like her, down to wanting to buy like her.\nIf the tech retail wars are heating up, perhaps it\u2019s finally time to deploy her."

        "fulltext": "When \u201cThe Social Network\u201d came out in 2010, Iwrote a columnpraising it for the way it captured the obsessional quality that marks great entrepreneurs.\nThe movie, you\u2019ll recall, was about Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook. The screenplay was written by Aaron Sorkin, who won an Oscar for it. I knew that Sorkin had taken generous liberties with the facts, but hey, isn\u2019t that what always happens when the movies adapt a true story?\nAlthough I wasn\u2019t particularly knowledgeable about Facebook\u2019s origins, I nonetheless argued that the insights of \u201cThe Social Network\u201d into the culture of Silicon Valley trumped any niggling facts Sorkin might have ignored or distorted.\nBut now that I\u2019ve seen Sorkin\u2019s latest treatment of a Silicon Valley icon \u2014 Steve Jobs \u2014 I\u2019m revising that opinion. Unlike Zuckerberg, Jobs is somebodyI followed closelyfor much of my career, even spending a week in the mid-1980s embedded at NeXT, the company Jobs founded after being tossed out of Apple in 1985. And although \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d the movie, which opened in a handful of theaters on Friday, is highly entertaining, what struck me most was how little it had to do with the flesh and blood Steve Jobs.\nSorkin has arranged the movie like a three-act play, building it around three product launches, for the Macintosh computer in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998, after Jobs returned to Apple.\nAlthough this structure necessitates inventing virtually every moment in the film out of whole cloth, that\u2019s not the real problem. The structure would be fine if, within its contours, it had conveyed the complicated reality of Steve Jobs.\nBut it doesn\u2019t. In ways both large and small, Sorkin \u2014 as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs \u2014 has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense. Fassbender exhibits none of Jobs\u2019s many youthful mannerisms, and uses none of his oft-repeated phrases, like \u201creally, really neat\u201d when he liked something, or \u201cbozo\u201d for people he didn\u2019t think measured up. Jobs as a young man was surprisingly emotional \u2014 that\u2019s missing.\nThere are moments in the film, like the big \u201creconciliation\u201d scene with his out-of-wedlock daughter, Lisa, that are almost offensively in opposition to the truth. (Although Jobs\u2019s relationship with Lisa could be volatile at times, she had in fact lived with him and his family all through high school.)\nMore important, the film simply doesn\u2019t understand who he was and why he was successful.\nFor instance, one character mentions Jobs\u2019s ability to create a \u201creality distortion field.\u201d But we never see the charismatic man who could convince people that the sky was green instead of blue. Especially in the NeXT section, Sorkin\u2019s Jobs is a cynic who knows his product will fail, rather than the dreamer he was, certain his overpriced NeXT machine will \u201cchange the world.\u201d Most important, Sorkin fails to convey Jobs\u2019s unmatched ability to draw talented people to him, and get them to produce their best work.\nAs it turns out, Sorkin is quite proud of his disregard for facts. \u201cWhat is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy\u2019s sake?\u201d hetold New York magazinearound the time \u201cThe Social Network\u201d came out. The way he sees it, he is no mere screenwriter; rather, he\u2019s an artist who can\u2019t be bound by the events of a person\u2019s life \u2014 even when he\u2019s writing a movie about that person.\n\u201cArt isn\u2019t about what happened,\u201d he said in that interview. \u201cAnd the properties of people and the properties of \u2018characters\u2019 are two completely different things.\u201d\nThe problem is that Steve Jobs isn\u2019t just a \u201ccharacter\u201d; he was a real person who lived a real life. Tom Mallon, who writes wonderful historical fiction about politics, including books about Watergate, and most recently, Ronald Reagan, told me that he thought it was important, even in his fiction, not to rewrite the public record, and to try to capture the essence of the real person he is writing about, even though he is inventing thoughts and scenes and dialogue.\n\u201cIf you deviate too much from the actual historical record,\u201d he said, \u201cthe illusion is going to collapse.\u201d Mallon added, \u201cIf the real Steve Jobs is interesting enough to make a movie about, why go and create another character that the filmmakers presumably find more interesting?\u201d\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s current chief executive, has decried the recent spate of Jobs movies as \u201copportunistic.\u201d In the case of \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d at least, that strikes me as exactly right. Sorkin and his fellow moviemakers are taking advantage of the feelings people have for the real Steve Jobs to sell tickets, yet the Steve Jobs he created is a complete figment of his imagination. It\u2019s a con.\nIn a recentinterview with Wiredmagazine, Sorkin insisted that \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d was \u201cnot a biopic.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to call it.\u201d\nThat\u2019s easy. Fiction."

        "fulltext": "HALF MOON BAY, Calif. \u2014 Apple Pay may get a lift from Starbucks, among other restaurant chains.\nOn Thursday, Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said that some Starbucks stores will acceptApple Pay, a mobile\n                                        payments system, this year as part of a pilot program. Ms. Bailey made the announcement at the Code Mobile conference, a tech industry event, where she added that all Starbucks stores will accept Apple Pay sometime\n                                        in 2016, as will the restaurant chains KFC and Chili\u2019s.\nApple is helping quick-service restaurants like KFC, which \u201chave a need for fast payments,\u201d Ms. Bailey said.\nThe adoption of Apple Pay by the restaurant chains is the latest sign of the growth of the mobile payments system, which has been gaining partners as diverse asJetBlueandRite Aid. Some of the retailers that now use Apple Pay had earlier\n                                        declined to work with the system.\nApple introduced Apple Pay in September 2014. The system lets users pay for goods by holding their iPhone or Apple Watch near a credit card reader. Apple Pay works with the credit, debit, store and loyalty cards that\n                                        users have stored in their Wallet app.\nIn a statement, Starbucks said it would test Apple in some stores by year\u2019s end before rolling the service out next year in 7,500 stores. \u201cWe have been accepting Apple Pay in the U.K. over the past few\n                                        months, and it has been received well by customers,\u201d Starbucks said.\n\u201cChili\u2019s is focused on bringing guests the most innovative technology, and Apple Pay is transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to pay,\u201d Chili\u2019s said in a statement.\n                                        A Chili\u2019s spokeswoman also said that this was the first mobile payment system that the chain has adopted.\nKFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEven though Apple Pay is still a tiny portion of Apple\u2019s overall revenue stream, Ms. Bailey said that she had seen \u201ca sea change in acceptance at the merchant level,\u201d emphasizing that more businesses,\n                                        including small and midsize ones, are adopting the technology necessary to accept payment methods like Apple Pay.\nWhether Apple can use mobile payments to lock people into its product ecosystem remains to be seen. The number of people who use devices for mobile payments is growing fast, but it\u2019s still tiny.\nEMarketer, the research firm, said that there were 15.9 million mobile payment users in the United States in 2014 and that it expected that number to jump by 42 percent, to 22.6 million, this year.\nA version of this article appears in print on 10/12/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Using Apple Pay at Starbucks, KFC and Chiliu2019s."

        "fulltext": "A lot of your work is dedicated to showing what goes on behind the scenes at some institution with a big public presence \u2014 Apple, the White House, Facebook, cable news and so on. What about that sort of story attracts you?When I was 5 years old, the father of a classmate was in \u2018\u2018Fiddler on the Roof.\u2019\u2019 One day, we ended up backstage, and I remember standing there in awe and bewilderment. I was looking at someone in profile singing \u2018\u2018Miracle Of Miracles,\u2019\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t able to see the audience or anything. I have always liked it back there.\nYour work often centers on someone who has been publicly wronged or had an embarrassing failure, who then shows up his critics. As someone who has had his share of private struggles made public, do you see any parallels in your own work?Of course. I like these stories because I am dismayed at how entertained we have become at the expense of others. It doesn\u2019t speak well of us, and it\u2019s gotten much, much worse, obviously, with social media.\nWould you have entertained a Trump-\u00adwins-\u00adthe-\u00adnomination plotline on \u2018\u2018The West Wing\u2019\u2019?If the characters on \u2018\u2018The West Wing\u2019\u2019 were watching a TV show wherein a character like Trump was leading in the polls, they wouldn\u2019t find it believable.\nYou once described your past cocaine addiction as lonely, as if it was almost work. Does that experience with addiction inform your characters \u2014 especially Steve Jobs?It\u2019s very hard for me to think of that as productive at all, as anything other than suicidal. I understand Steve Jobs\u2019s intensity in other ways: He wanted perfection from the things he built because he knew he wasn\u2019t going to find it in life.\nCritics say today that we\u2019re living in another golden age of television. It seems to me that your work, especially the dialogue, brings to mind the first golden age \u2014 of Alfred Hitchcock and \u2018\u2018Playhouse 90.\u2019\u2019 Do you have an affinity for either era?I have an affinity for when we did live plays on television. And I think that doing something live is something that television can do that really nothing else can. It\u2019s the shared experience.\nYour shows often have these theatrical moments when everyone stops and pays attention to one character delivering a speech. It\u2019s sort of like performing a song.Yeah, a longer piece of music like a symphony or an opera will have an allegro, an adagio, a finale ultimo and so on \u2014 the highs and lows and different speeds and moods of a piece of music make it all come together. I wish that there were a way to say that without sounding pretentious.\nAnd I suppose your signature \u2018\u2018walk and talks\u2019\u2019 are sort of like choreographed dance numbers.Actually, that was simply a way to add visual interest to a visual medium that I only really use aurally.\nYou\u2019ve said you would fit in well in the 1940s. Do you long for that era\u2019s more firmly delineated cultural roles? Less moral ambiguity?Honest to God, what I meant was that men wore hats.\nYou don\u2019t seem very interested in the antiheroes who have become a clich\u00e9 of this era of television. Why not?I\u2019m more comfortable writing traditional protagonists. But \u2018\u2018Steve Jobs\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Social Network\u2019\u2019 have antiheroes. I like to write antiheroes as if they\u2019re making their case to God about why they should be allowed into heaven. I have to find something in that character that is like me and write to that.\nDo you think television is a force for good or evil?Some of it is bad. I don\u2019t mean bad in its execution \u2014 it\u2019s that, too \u2014 but I mean meanspirited, reaching for the worst in us and appealing to the worst among us. But when you can sit with your whole family and watch the presidential debates, I do think it\u2019s a national hearth.\nDo you think people find a similar shared experience over Twitter now?It feels to me like a lot of people talking and nobody listening. It\u2019s just a little quippy for me.\nIt is funny to hear Aaron Sorkin describe anything as too quippy.Yeah, I guess I\u2019ve got a lot of nerve."
