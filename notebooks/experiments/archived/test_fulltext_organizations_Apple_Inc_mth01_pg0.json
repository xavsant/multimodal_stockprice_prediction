        "full_text": "It is officially the first full week of the new year, and you know what that means: time to take note of what to watch for in 2015. I think it\u2019s going to be a doozy. Why? Well, here\u2019s what I have at the\n                                        top of my agenda:\n1) Oscar de la Renta and the red carpet\nTheGolden Globe awardswill be announced on Sunday, which means that the\n                                        red carpet watch has officially begun. Since the death in October ofOscar de la Renta,that designer\u2019s brand has been\n                                        among the best represented on the awards circuit. Celebrities in Manhattan, Hollywood and Washington \u2014 including Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lawrence, Tina Fey and Michelle Obama \u2014 have paid homage\n                                        to the designer\u2019s ability to make a woman feel beautiful.\nThis awards season will be the last chance to wear a design by the man himself, as the recent pre-fall collection was the last he touched. It might also offer a chance to unveil looks bythe brand\u2019s new creative director, Peter Copping,\n                                        whose first show bows at New York Fashion Week in February. I can\u2019t help but feel the Golden Globes will be a de la Renta bonanza. As of the week before Christmas, one dress from the pre-fall collection,\n                                        a strapless, tiered, midnight-blue number dotted with diamonds like stars in the night sky, had been requested by four different stylists for Golden Globe clients.\n2) John Galliano\u2019s return show\nIt\u2019s in a week! John Galliano willreturn to the fashion spotlighton Jan. 12 with his first couture show \u2014 for Maison Martin Margiela \u2014 sincehis final Christian Dior couture showin March 2011\n                                        (at which he did not actually appear, as he had just been dismissed). It\u2019s not exactly a step back into the lion\u2019s den. Instead of showing on the couture schedule with his peers in Paris, Mr. Galliano\u2019s\n                                        event will be two weeks earlier, just after the shows of London Collections: Men, and on the safe home ground of London. To me, this denotes a certain nervousness on the designer\u2019s part.\nIt will be interesting to see if Mr. Galliano\u2019s time away from the industry has incited a creative evolution, and whether he has tried to adapt his aesthetic to that of the brand he now represents. Hopefully\n                                        the answer to both questions will be yes; otherwise, he risks the whiff of irrelevance. We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n3) Frida Giannini\u2019s replacement at Gucci\nFrida Giannini\u2019slast Gucci showwill be in late February, and Kering, the brand\u2019s\n                                        parent company, says that an announcement on her replacement will not be made until March. But speculation will probably reach a fever pitch during the shows, with audience members watching eagerly for displays\n                                        of Gucci-isms on other runways.\nRumor has it that the leading contenders are Hedi Slimane of Saint Laurent, Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy, Joseph Altuzarra and Christopher Kane (the last two were recently snapped up by Kering, perhaps in part as an insurance\n                                        policy for just this sort of event). The suspense may even overshadow the debuts of Mr. Copping at Oscar de la Renta, ofNad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski at Herm\u00e8sand of Guillaume Henry at Nina Ricci. Also probably overshadowed will be the announcement about who will take the reins at Carven, now that Mr. Henry has moved on.\n4) The political catwalk\nIt\u2019s going to be a big year in politics, with the British general election in May, voting in Canada expected in October and Americans gearing up for contests in 2016. As Instagram increasingly becomes the social\n                                        media platform of choice, what the candidates wear and how they come across visually will become evermore important and considered. That means that there will be lots of fodder for watchers of sartorial strategy\n                                        and for public reactions. Goody.\n5) The Apple Watch goes on sale\nIt is one thing to unveil a new wearable object (and I am expecting big things from the Consumer Electronics Show, which officially opens on Tuesday with a keynote speech from a man who is fast proving himself to be\n                                        Mr. Fashion: Brian M. Krzanich of Intel), and to cause all sorts of buzz, but it is an entirely different thing to sell it.The Apple Watchwill finally become available in the first part of the year, and it will be fascinating to see whether consumers really put their money where their wrists are. If they do, expect a gigantic jump on the bandwagon\n                                        as far as wearables go. If not, we could be going back to the design board.\nI, for one, can\u2019t wait."
