        "fulltext": "FED\u2019S NEEL KASHKARI SAYS BANKS STILL TOO BIG TO FAIL|Neel Kashkari, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,\n                                                    worked tirelessly to save the nation\u2019s banks during the 2008 financial crisis. But now he thinks it istime to consider breaking them up,\nBinyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times.\nMr. Kashkari said at the Brookings Institute that the biggest banks were \u201cstill too big to fail and continue topose a significant, ongoing risk to our economy.\u201d\nHe described the threat of another crisis that might force the government to bail out large banks in remarks that caused a stir in Washington. Such views are common at both ends of the political spectrum,\n                                                    but Mr. Kashkari is a moderate Republican. \u201cThere are lines in your speech I can imagine a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren saying,\u201d said David Wessel, a former economics editor\n                                                    at The Wall Street Journal who moderated the event. \u201cIt\u2019s not what one expects from a Goldman Sachs Republican.\u201d\nMr. Kashkari also took apre-emptive shot at the banking industry, noting the \u201cendless objections\u201d its lobbyists have raised against stronger regulation. \u201cWe need to move before\n                                                    we as a society have forgotten the lessons of \u201908,\u201d he said.\n\nNO WINNERS IN ARGENTINE DEBT FIGHT|The hedge funds may claim victory in the battle of Argentina\u2019s debt, but there are no\n                                                    real winners in this sorry affair,\nSteven Davidoff Solomon writes in DealBook.\nArgentina has agreed to pay $1.35 billion to individual Italian bondholders who were holdouts. And Argentina has also settled with two hedge funds, Montreux Partners and Dart Management, and offered $6.5\n                                                    billion to settle the whole affair.\nBut there is still some way to go.The negotiations are continuing before a court-appointed mediator and the remaining holdouts appear to be resisting Argentina\u2019s offer, arguing that it favors\n                                                    other funds at their expense.\nSome funds sued to collect directly, winning a judgment for the face value of their debt, hoping that they could then use it to seize Argentine assets in other countries. But once the judgment was\n                                                    entered, the bonds stopped accruing interest and instead earned court-ordered post-judgment interest at about 0.5 percent.\nThe other hedge funds never enforced their debt, instead suing on the pari passu issue \u2014 a clause in bond contracts that says all bondholders should be treated alike \u2014 and collecting interest\n                                                    on the face value of the bonds, which they claim exceeded 100 percent a year. The second set of bonds is now worth much more because of the accrued interest.\nArgentina responded by offering one set of hedge funds, who did not sue on the pari passu clause, 150 percent of their judgement. Another set, that did not sue to collect on their bonds, but to enforce the\n                                                    pari passu clause, have been offered up to 72.5 percent of their claims.\nThe holdout hedge funds don\u2019t like the offer that Argentina has made because it doesn\u2019t compensate them for the higher rate of interest they feel they are entitled to.\nThe hedge funds who sued on the pari passu clause, but not to enforce their debt are getting more but not enough, merely because of the choice of legal strategy.\nAn entire country has been subject to the vicissitudes of luck and litigation strategy.\n\nSAFEGUARDS FOR $6.9 BILLION ADT DEAL|Apollo Global Management is buying ADT Corporation for $6.9 billion with theintention of merging it with Protection 1 and ASG Security,Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.\nIt is the largest leveraged buyout so far this year and an alarming size given the fear coursing through credit markets,Jeffrey Goldfarb writes in Breakingviews.\nBut this deal comes with safeguards. Apollo and its co-investors will provide $4.5 billion toward the transaction, nearly half the purchase price including debt. This will help keep ADT\u2019s debt comfortably\n                                                    below guideline multiples.\nThe deal will also be financed by $1.6 billion through new first-lien loans and $3.1 billion in second-lien loans, as well as $750 million of preferred securities through an investment arm of Koch Industries.The decision to merge ADT with another security firm is also likely to produce some healthy cost savings.\nIt might be a tall order to cover the 56 percent premium that Apollo is paying ADT shareholders, but it appears to have built in enough extra security both to complete the deal and to lock up a decent return.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Data onindustrial productionwill be published at 9:15 a.m. Minutes from the lastFederal Open Market Committee meetingwill be published at 2 p.m.James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, will speak at the CFA Society in St. Louis at 6 p.m.\n\nSTART-UPS BANKING ON MARIJUANA|Several start-ups have set up in Colorado and several other states,looking to help marijuana businesses solve the issue of dirty, dangerous, hard-to-track cash,Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook.\nVisa and MasterCard will not process transactions for pot dispensaries and most banks will not open accounts for them, even though the State of Colorado legalized marijuana for recreational use.\nDispensaries are dealing with a constant influx of cash and have nowhere to put it.Some have tried opening accounts under fake names or offering prepaid cards that can be used for purchases in dispensaries,\n                                                    though the legality of this is still unclear.\nStart-ups are now putting together software to help banks and dispensaries monitor and record transactions \u2014 with the aim of moving transactions away from cash.\nThey have focused on record-keeping, as this can answer the concerns of banks worried about violating antimoney laundering laws. These companies hope their software can allow banks to open up their\n                                                    accounts and payment networks to cannabis businesses.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nFairchild Rejects Chinese Takeover Bid Over Regulatory Concerns|Despite a \u201csuperior\u201d offer led by Chinese state-backed\n                                                    buyers, Fairchild was concerned about getting approval from American officials.NYT \u00bb\n\nStryker to Buy Physio-Control International|Stryker agreed to buy Physio-Control International from the private equity firm Bain\n                                                    Capital for $1.28 billion, continuing the medical technology firm\u2019s recent acquisition spree.the wall street journal\n\nQatar and China in Battle for Australian Freight Giant|Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management is planning a new $6.4 billion\n                                                    bid for the Australian port and rail firm Asciano with Qatar\u2019s sovereign fund, two sources told Reuters.reuters\n\nFosun Ends Phoenix Purchase|The Chinese conglomerate Fosun International has withdrawn from its deal to acquire the Israeli insurer\n                                                    Phoenix Holdings for more than $460 million \u2014 the firm\u2019s second canceled overseas purchase in the past two months as it pledges a more prudent investment strategy.bloomberg news\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Outlines Plans to Simplify Its Structure|The French bank also reported that net income rose 27.5 percent\n                                                    in the fourth quarter to 882 million euros, or $984 million, beating analysts\u2019 estimates.NYT \u00bb\n\nApple Plans $12 Billion Bond Sale for Buybacks and Dividends|Apple often uses the debt markets despite having $215.7 billion in\n                                                    cash, largely because most of that is abroad and would be taxed if brought home.NYT \u00bb\n\n2 More Top Executives to Step Down at A.I.G.|Brian Schreiber, who became chief strategy officer last year, and Seraina Maag, who\n                                                    led the company\u2019s regional management operations, will leave.NYT \u00bb\n\nRolls-Royce Prepared to Bring ValueAct on Board|Rolls-Royce is preparing to back a bid by ValueAct for a seat on the board, giving\n                                                    the activist investor influence over the Britain\u2019s flagship engineering company as it seeks to recover from several profit warnings.the financial times\n\nBain and Advent Said to Weigh I.P.O. of Nordic Payments Business|The private equity owners of Nets Holding may seek an equity\n                                                    valuation of about $3.5 billion, Bloomberg News reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.bloomberg news\n\nUniversity of Chicago to Get $50 Million From Venture Capitalist|In their latest donation to an educational institution, Michael\n                                                    Moritz and his wife, Harriet Heyman, are giving $50 million to the university.NYT \u00bb\n\nProsecutors Have Deal With Second Dewey & LeBoeuf Figure|A deferred prosecution agreement with the second figure, Zachary\n                                                    Warren, cuts the number of defendants to two in an accounting fraud case involving the now-defunct law firm.NYT \u00bb\n\nSpaniard to Face U.S. Trial in Art Scandal|The national court ordered the extradition to the United States of a Spanish businessman,\n                                                    Jes\u00fas \u00c1ngel Berganti\u00f1os D\u00edaz, accused in a major art market scandal that involved the sale of nearly $70 million in forged paintings through a New York gallery.NYT \u00bb\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives Passes Bill to Restructure $9 Billion in Debt|If the governor signs the bill into\n                                                    law this week, the plan must next survive a rate-setting process by a newly formed regulatory body.NYT \u00bb\n\nJurors Told that Stockbrokers\u2019 Trades on IBM Deal Tips Not Illegal|Lawyers for two former Wall Street stockbrokers urged\n                                                    jurors on Tuesday to reject a regulator\u2019s claims they illicitly traded on a tip about an IBM deal, saying their conduct did not constitute illegal insider trading.reuters\n\nWanted by U.S.: The Stolen Millions of Despots and Crooked Elites|Teams of government lawyers, the F.B.I. and Homeland Security\n                                                    are trying to recover assets the United States says were stolen by foreign officials.NYT \u00bb|Interactive Feature:\n                                                    They Held Power.

        "title": "Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly",
        "fulltext": "In Silicon Valley \u2014 if not Washington \u2014 Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, emphasized on Tuesdayin a letter to customersthat helping the F.B.I. essentially hack into one of the company\u2019s own phones would set a dangerous precedent. What\u2019s more, Apple said it would have to create new software to do this.\nBut while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud.\nThat may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple\u2019s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology.\nICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \u2014 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed.\nEvery few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.\nIn its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.\nApple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.\nBut the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\u2019s cooperation and its resistance is \u201ctechnically able.\u201d\nIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.\nICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.\nThere are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.\nIt is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\u2019s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a consumer-focused company, not a defense contractor,\u201d saidSteven M. Bellovin, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. \u201cIf someone loses their phone or forgets their password, they still want to be able to get their data back.\u201d\nThat could soon change. Just as Apple has updated encryption practices for devices \u2014 likeFileVault, which protects a Mac\u2019s start-up disk, for example \u2014 the company plans to strengthen encryption on other products, said two senior Apple executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans are not public.\nThat could include iCloud, if Apple can figure out a consumer-friendly way to keep the data under lock and key \u2014 a key Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to use \u2014 without making it inconvenient for people who need to retrieve backups.\nThat is no simple feat. Apple would have to find a way to let users retrieve their own data safely even without the company\u2019s help, while keeping out hackers and other sorts of data thieves.\nThere is reason to be cautious about mucking with iCloud\u2019s security. In 2014, for example, a number of private photoswere stolen from the iCloud accountsof celebrities like the actress Jennifer Lawrence. Apple said the episode was not a result of any widespread attack on the company\u2019s software products. But it was a cautionary note for consumers of the service.\nNone of this iCloud discussion would apply to iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary text messaging service. It uses technology called end-to-end encryption, which means messages sent using iMessage cannot be intercepted and decrypted. Only the sender and receiver, not Apple, have the keys to read such messages. Apple retains encrypted iMessages on its servers until they are read by the user or expire after several days.\nFor now, the best bet to protect your personal information from snoops may be to keep it off iCloud \u2014 and the many, many apps that may pass or store unencrypted information through data centers. It is safer on your device.\nJust try not to drop your phone in a swimming pool."

        "title": "In Poll on Apple, Public Sides with F.B.I.",
        "fulltext": "We are now nearly a week into the public fight between Apple and the F.B.I. andneither side appears ready to back down.\nIn case you missed it, the Federal Bureau of Investigation wants Apple to write software that would help investigators circumvent the security settings of an iPhone that belonged to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting.\nTechnically, this isn\u2019t about breaking encryption, it\u2019s about figuring out a password. The iPhone has a setting that would erase its data after 10 incorrect attempts at the password. What the F.B.I. wants, essentially, is for Apple to write software that would let it keep guessing until it hits the code.\nBut here is where it gets tricky: Apple says that would essentially amount to writing software to ruin its own security. And though the F.B.I. says this is a one-shot deal important to a terrorism investigation, Apple executives believe writing that software would open a can of worms for law enforcement in the United States and around the world.\nThere is also a free speech wrinkle to this fight. Many courts have ruled that writing software is akin to writing speech. Compelling Apple to do this, civil libertarians worry, would be like compelling Apple to say or write something in particular.\nStill following? It seems many Americans are, and so far they seem to be siding with the F.B.I. \u2014 51 percent to 38 percent, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Monday.\nBut Apple executives may be able to take comfort in the knowledge that a legal fight is not a popularity contest."

        "title": "Apple Is Said to Be Trying to Make It Harder to Hack iPhones",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Apple engineers have begun developing new security measures that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone using methods similar to those now at the center of a court fight in California, according to people close to the company and security experts.\nIf Apple succeeds in upgrading its security \u2014 and experts say it almost surely will \u2014 the company will create a significant technical challenge for law enforcement agencies, even if the Obama administration wins its fight over access to data stored on an iPhone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., rampage. If the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to get into a phone in the future, it would need a new way to do so. That would most likely prompt a new cycle of court fights and, yet again, more technical fixes by Apple.\nThe only way out of this scenario, experts say, is for Congress to get involved. Federal wiretapping laws require traditional phone carriers to make their data accessible to law enforcement agencies. But tech companies like Apple and Google are not covered, and they have strongly resisted legislation that would place similar requirements on them.\n\u201cWe are in for an arms race unless and until Congress decides to clarify who has what obligations in situations like this,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nCompanies have always searched for software bugs and patched holes to keep their code secure from hackers. But since the revelations of government surveillance made by Edward J. Snowden, companies have been retooling their products to protect against government intrusion.\nFor Apple, security is also a global marketing strategy. New security measures would not only help the company in its fight with the government, but also reassure investors and customers.\n\u201cFor all of those people who want to have a voice but they\u2019re afraid, we are standing up, and we are standing up for our customers because protecting them we view as our job,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said on Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\nThe company first raised the prospect of a security update last week in a phone call with reporters, who asked why the company would allow firmware \u2014 the software at the heart of the iPhone \u2014 to be modified without requiring a user password.\nOne senior executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, replied that it was safe to bet that security would continue to improve. Separately, a person close to the company, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this week that Apple engineers had begun work on a solution even before the San Bernardino attack. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on what she called rumors and speculation.\nIndependent experts say they have held informal conversations with Apple engineers over the last week about the vulnerability. Exactly how Apple will address the issue is unclear. Security experts who have been studying Apple\u2019s phone security say it is technically possible to fix.\n\u201cThere are probably 50 different ideas we have all sent to Apple,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, a security researcher.\nApple built its recent operating systems to protect customer information. AsMr. Cook wrote in a recent letterto customers, \u201cWe have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.\u201d\nBut there is a catch. Each iPhone has a built-in troubleshooting system that lets the company update the system software without the need for a user to enter a passcode. Apple designed that feature to make it easier to repair malfunctioning phones.\nIn the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. wants to exploit that troubleshooting system by forcing Apple to write and install new software that strips away several security features, making it much easier for the government to hack into the phone. The phone in that case is an old model, but experts andformer Apple employeessay that a similar approach could also be used to alter software on newer phones. That is the vulnerability Apple is working to fix.\nApple regularly publishes security updates and gives credit to researchers who hunt for bugs in the company\u2019s software. \u201cUsually, bug reports come in an email saying, \u2018Dear Apple Security, we\u2019ve discovered a flaw in your product,\u2019 \u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThis bug report has come in the form of a court order.\u201d\nThe court order to which Mr. Soghoian referred was issued last week by a federal magistrate, and tells Apple to write and install the code sought by the F.B.I. Apple has promised to challenge that order. Its lawyers have until Friday to file its opposition in court.\nIn many ways, Apple\u2019s response continues a trend that has persisted in Silicon Valley since Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations. Yahoo, for instance, left its email service unencrypted for years. After Mr. Snowden revealed the National Security Agency surveillance, the company quickly announced plans to encrypt email. Google similarly moved to fix a vulnerability that the government was using to hack into company data centers.\nApple\u2019s showdown with the Justice Department is different in one important way. Now that the government has tried to force Apple to hack its own code, security officials say, the company must view itself as the vulnerability.\n\u201cThis is the first time that Apple has been included in their own threat model,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Apple ever considered becoming a compelled arm of the government.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., signaled this week that he expected Apple to change its security, saying that the phone-cracking tool the government sought in the San Bernardino case was \u201cincreasingly obsolete.\u201d He said that supported the government\u2019s argument that it was not seeking a skeleton key to hack into all iPhones.\nApple, though, says the case could set a precedent for forcing company engineers to write code to help the government break into any iPhone. \u201cThe U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his letter.\nThe heated back-and-forth between the government and technology companies is, at least in part, a function of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy. The White House has said it will not ask Congress to pass a law requiring tech companies to give the F.B.I. a way to gain access to customer data. That has left the Justice Department to fight for access one phone at a time, in court cases that often go unnoticed.\nWhile it is generally accepted that Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants can outgun the government in a technical fight, the companies do face one important limitation. Security features often come at the expense of making products slower or clunkier.\nApple\u2019s brand is built around creating products that are sleek and intuitive. A security solution that defeats the F.B.I. is unworkable if it frustrates consumers. One of the impediments to encrypting all the data in Apple\u2019s iCloud servers, for instance, has been finding a way to ensure that customers can easily retrieve and recover photos and other information stored there.\n\u201cTelling a member of the public that they\u2019re going to lose all the family photos they\u2019ve ever taken because they forgot their password is a really tough sell,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said. \u201cA company wants to sell products to the public.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Obama administration officials met with executives of major technology and entertainment companies in Washington on Wednesday to discuss combating the activities of violent extremists online, according to industry and government officials.\nThe meeting was called by the White House, according to a person who attended and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The session began with government officials admitting their shortcomings in tackling the explosion of activity by terrorist groups online.\nJohn P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, started the meeting by saying that federal law enforcement had struggled to reach audiences that were responding to recruitment by violent extremists, according to the participant. Nick Rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, lauded some social media platforms for aggressively taking down accounts of suspected terrorists.\nThe hourslong meeting, which took place at the Justice Department, also included speeches by Megan Smith, the national chief technology officer; and Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism.\nThe event was another step toward coordinating government and private sector efforts on national security. After the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., last year, the White House and presidential candidates have pushed for Internet firms to clamp down on the use of social media by extremists to recruit new members, organize and broadcast their demands.\nLast month, the White House and tech chief executives held a securitymeetingin San Jose, Calif., to discuss the use of social media by terrorist groups and encryption practices by tech firms to keep consumer data private. Secretary of State John Kerry also met with Hollywood studio executives earlier this month, and entertainment firms have been asked by government officials to help create \u201ccounternarratives\u201d to those of terrorists on social media networks.\nWednesday\u2019s gathering was attended by company executives but few, if any, chief executives. Participants included representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr and Microsoft.\nThe meeting brought together tech companies in Washington at a time of heightened tension between the administration and Silicon Valley.Apple and the United States governmenthave engaged in a public fight over access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Some of the tech firms have expressed cautious support of Apple.\nMany of the tech companies are willing to work on ways to combat violent extremism on social media. The meeting on Wednesday, called the \u201cMadison Valleywood Project,\u201d in reference to the participation of marketing, tech and entertainment firms, focused on terrorists\u2019 use of social media to organize and recruit members for violent extremism.\nThe subject of encryption and Apple\u2019s resistance to being ordered to break through its encrypted software for law enforcement was not on the agenda.\nSome social media companies have stepped carefully with counterterrorism efforts, saying it is technologically difficult to weed out true terrorist activity. They have also expressed fears of stifling the free speech of users. Others, includingTwitter, have started to more aggressively shut down the accounts of suspected terrorists. Twitter had a representative at the meeting.\n\u201cOver the past year, organizations and companies across a range of industries have asked how they might contribute to efforts to counter radicalization and recruitment activities by ISIL and other violent extremists,\u201d said Marc Raimondi, the Justice Department\u2019s national security spokesman, using a term for the Islamic State.\n\u201cThe U.S. government recognizes that these private sector actors, which include N.G.O.s, social media companies and content producers, have a crucial role to play in developing creative and effective ways to undermine terrorist recruiting and counter the call to violence,\u201d Mr. Raimondi said."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Line in the Sand Was Over a Year in the Making",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Time and again after the introduction of the iPhone nearly a decade ago, the Justice Department asked Apple for help opening a locked phone. And nearly without fail, the company agreed.\nThen last fall, the company changed its mind. In a routine drug case in a Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors sought a court order demanding that Apple unlock a methamphetamine dealer\u2019s iPhone 5S running old, easy-to-unlock software. The company acknowledged that it could open the phone, as it had before. But this time, it pushed back.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being forced to become an agent of law enforcement,\u201d the company\u2019s lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, protested in court.\nThat stance foreshadowed this week\u2019s showdown between the Obama administration and Apple over the locked iPhone belonging to one of the suspects in the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage. By the time of Mr. Zwillinger\u2019s statement, Apple and the government had been at odds for more than a year, since the debut of Apple\u2019s new encrypted operating system, iOS 8, in late 2014.\nThe new technology repeatedly stymied investigators \u2014 the New York authorities said on Thursday that they had been locked out of 175 iPhones in cases they were pursuing. But both sides held out hope for a compromise that would avoid the type of confrontation that occurred this week when a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to comply with the Justice Department\u2019s request.\nWith last October\u2019s court filing, the confrontation became all but inevitable. The company left no doubt that it would fight any effort to crack its new, encrypted phones. The only real question was what crime the government would use to press its case.\nApple\u2019s stance that day in Brooklyn caught the Justice Department off guard. Despite the issue with iOS 8, the company had continued to cooperate. In the first half of 2015 alone, the company provided data in response to more than 3,000 law enforcement requests, Apple said. And company lawyers gave prosecutors no indication that the drug case against Jun Feng would be any different.\nMr. Feng, 45, claimed to have forgotten his passcode, making his cooperation a moot point even if he were willing to extend it, according to a government filing. Unlike the phone in the San Bernardino case, Mr. Feng\u2019s ran iOS 7, an older version of Apple\u2019s operating system that does not automatically encrypt its data. The Justice Department figured it would have the information from Mr. Feng\u2019s phone within a day.\nMr. Zwillinger said the drug case would be Apple\u2019s line in the sand. \u201cCustomer data is under siege from a variety of different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cNever has the privacy and security of customer data been as important as it is now.\u201d\nIt was a delicate period for the Obama administration, which was focused on finding a way to break into the new encrypted iPhones. The F.B.I., in particular, was lobbying hard to win support for that idea in the face of skepticism from Silicon Valley, Congress and the public.\ntranscript\nna\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, described data privacy as a human rights issue. Backed by leading technologists, Mr. Cook argued that if the company designed a way to defeat encryption for the United States government, that tool would be exploited by hackers or foreign governments like China.\nUnder the attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., the Justice Department was sympathetic to that point of view, even in the face of an aggressive campaign from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. Mr. Holder favored meeting with technology executives in the hope of finding common ground, current and former Justice Department officials said.\nOthers in the department strongly disagreed. National security and criminal prosecutors argued that, with the introduction of the encrypted iOS 8, Apple (along with Google, which had started its own encrypted Android phone software) had made thumbing its nose at the government a business strategy. The only hope, these prosecutors argued, was a court fight or an act of Congress requiring companies to provide the government unencrypted data.\nLocal law enforcement officials, too, were sounding alarms. \u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West in technology,\u201d Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference Thursday, echoing complaints he and others have made for many months. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201d\nWhen the attorney general Loretta E. Lynch and her deputy, Sally Q. Yates, took office last year, the F.B.I. and its law enforcement allies found more receptive ears. Ms. Yates, in particular, took up the issue, giving speeches and testifying before Congress alongside Mr. Comey.\nDespite the campaign, the White House showed no appetite for legislation. And Apple showed no signs of budging. In a few instances, the two sides appeared bound for a court fight,only to resolve it at the last moment. Last summer, Apple refused to give the Justice Department real-time access to iMessages \u2014 the company\u2019s proprietary text messages \u2014 in a gun case. The matter nearly escalated, but Apple eventually turned over some messages that had been backed up to the company\u2019s iCloud servers. It was not all that the government wanted, but authorities viewed it as a sign of cooperation.\nSuch compromises forestalled a major court showdown, but increased the frustration at the Justice Department. Several current and former career prosecutors involved in the issue said they viewed it as hypocritical that Apple encouraged its customers to save its data to iCloud \u2014 which it would turn over to the government \u2014 but regarded the cellphone as sacrosanct.\nThen came the Feng case. By refusing to help, the Justice Department thought Apple was sending a clear signal. If it would no longer cooperate with requests to help unlock old phones, there was little chance it would give in and build a way to unlock the new encrypted phones running iOS 8.\n\u201cForcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said.\nBy that time, 90 percent of Apple devices were running iOS 8 or newer versions. The F.B.I. warned that it was only a matter of time before its agents were locked out of a phone in a case with lives at stake.\nThe San Bernardino attacks, which killed 14 people, presented the F.B.I. with a seemingly perfect test case. One of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, was killed by the police and left behind a locked, encrypted iPhone 5c. The F.B.I. has not been able to unlock it.\nMr. Farook\u2019s phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep and Apple says it cannot break the encryption without the password. The F.B.I. wants to write a program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.\nBut Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.\u2019s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.\nThe authorities are still interested in more than just Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. On Thursday, a team of F.B.I. agents raided the Southern California home of his brother, Syed Raheel Farook, and carted off boxes of belongings. The authorities would not say what they were searching for.\nBut there is no telling what is on Mr. Farook\u2019s phone \u2014 maybe clues to accomplices or his inspiration, maybe nothing \u2014 but nobody in the government questioned the need for obtaining access to that data. From a public relations standpoint, Apple had been on the side of privacy advocates and civil libertarians. This case put the company on the side of a terrorist.\n\u201cThey need to figure that out now before there is that bigger body count. So this is as good a test case as any to have that fight,\u201d said Ron Hosko, who until 2014 led the F.B.I.\u2019s criminal division. \u201cCrack that thing for me now, Tim Cook, because it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d\nThis week, the Justice Department got its wish when Apple was ordered to override its defenses, even if it meant building a tool that did not exist.\nLaw enforcement officials cheered the ruling, though they acknowledged that the fight was not over. Apple promised to appeal. In New York, William Bratton, the police commissioner, held up a phone that he said was used by an associate of a man who shot and wounded two police officers in the Bronx recently.\n\u201cDespite having a court order, we cannot access this iPhone,\u201d Mr. Bratton said. \u201cJust one example, a very significant example in which two of my officers were shot, that impeding that case going forward is our inability to get into this device.\u201d\nThe case in Brooklyn continues, even though Mr. Feng has already pleaded guilty. While the Justice Department sees the San Bernardino incident as its ideal test case, Apple is hoping for a legal win in Brooklyn.\nJudge James Orenstein has given the company reason to be hopeful. In the past, he has been skeptical of the way the government uses an 18th-century law \u2014 the All Writs Act \u2014 that the Justice Department is now claiming gives it the authority to force Apple to unlock the phones. He once even described the Justice Department\u2019s use of it as a \u201cHail Mary play.\u201d\nBut he has yet to rule."

        "title": "Seeking iPhone Data, Through the Front Door",
        "fulltext": "THE government and Apple have chosen interesting ground on which to contest the limits of government access to data on mobile devices. The case involves an F.B.I. request for Apple\u2019s assistance in opening a phone once carried by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife was responsible for the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 wounded.\nOn one level, this should be comfortable space for the government. First, the phone is owned by the County of San Bernardino, which issued it to Mr. Farook, an employee of its health department. The county, as Apple\u2019s customer, has no problem having its phone opened. Second, Mr. Farook and his wife were killed in a gun battle with the police early last December. Under the law, dead people have no privacy rights.\nBut Apple is making a stand because the government wants it to create something against its will: code that would disable a feature that erases all content after 10 failed password attempts. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said that if this happens, the floodgates will open to similar law enforcement requests, putting customers\u2019 data at risk. And not just in the United States: Apple supporters have raised concerns that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are likely to follow suit.\nMr. Cook\u2019s position is hyperbolic, in our view. But beyond the legal case, there is an ethics issue unfolding here.\nUntil 17 months ago, Apple held the key that could override protections and open phones. Apple used this \u201cmaster key\u201d to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases. There was no documented instance of this code getting out to hackers or to the government. So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS 8, \u201cApple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants\u201d?\nSome believe that allegations by Edward J. Snowden of mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications by the National Security Agency stoked fears among Apple\u2019s customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn\u2019t unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.\nBut Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans\u2019 Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple\u2019s position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.\nApple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.\nApple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to \u201ccreate a back door\u201d into people\u2019s devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.\nWhat the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014. Complying with constitutionally legal court orders is not \u201ccreating a back door\u201d; in a democracy, that is a front door.\nMr. Cook says Apple\u2019s ultimate goal is to provide customers \u201csafety\u201d from \u201cattack.\u201d But Mr. Cook does not seem to be talking about the kind of attack that took 14 lives in San Bernardino. Presumably, he means attacks from hackers or what he may view as government intrusion \u2014 even when that intrusion is legal.\nThe phone in the San Bernardino case stopped uploading data to the cloud about six weeks before the killings. That suggests there may be information inside the device that was deliberately concealed. That could include the identities of terrorists who influenced or directed the attack; such information, if pursued, could prevent future plots. Or the iPhone might contain nothing of value. It is Apple\u2019s position that we should never know.\nThe ramifications of this fight extend beyond San Bernardino. Brittany Mills was a 29-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in Baton Rouge, La. Apple says it can\u2019t comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the police believe the identity of the killer is contained in her device.\nMs. Mills was an Apple customer. So were some of the people who died with iPhones in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks. How is not solving a murder, or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attack, protecting anyone?\nGoogle, which owns the Android system, now indicates that it will follow Apple\u2019s lead. For those companies, and others like them, there is a sound argument in not wanting, even indirectly, to become an arm of the government. But when you are the two companies whose operating systems handle more than 90 percent of mobile communications worldwide, you should be accountable for more than just sales."

        "title": "Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order",
        "fulltext": "A federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government\u2019s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company\u2019s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases.\nThe ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York\u2019s Eastern District, is the first time that the government\u2019s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.\nJudge Orenstein, in his 50-page ruling on Monday, took particular aim at a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act thatunderlies many government requestsfor extracting data from tech companies. The All Writs Act broadly says that courts can require actions to comply with their orders when not covered by existing law. Judge Orenstein said the government was inflating its authority by using the All Writs Act to force Apple to extract data from an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case.\nThe government\u2019s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.\nThe All Writs Act is also being invoked in the fightover an iPhonein the San Bernardino shooting, which has publicly pitted Apple against the government. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has refused to comply with a federal court order to help break into the phone, saying that he needs to protect the data of all customers. That has set off a far-reaching debate over privacy and security.\nBoth the F.B.I. and Apple have called for Congress to step in to help settle the question of when law enforcement should get access to citizens\u2019 private data. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, willtestifyabout balancing privacy and safety before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn\u2019t provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple\u2019s position. \u201cIt demonstrates that when the government\u2019s arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.\u201d\nIn a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said.\n\u201cThis phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\u201d the Justice Department said.\nA federal judge has denied the United States government\u2019s request to open up an Apple iPhone in a drug case in New York.\nAn Apple senior executive said Monday\u2019s ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress.\nJudge Orenstein\u2019s ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back.\nThe legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents.\nAfter federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to \u201csubstantially tarnish the Apple brand.\u201d\n\u201cThis reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,\u201d Apple said in a brief.\nThe government then called Apple\u2019s decision to side with the judge a \u201cstunning reversal.\u201d Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government\u2019s application in this case \u201cwas just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.\u201d\nDuring the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order.\n\u201cYou have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,\u201d Judge Orenstein said to Apple\u2019s lawyers during a hearing.\nUltimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn\u2019t use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an \u201cinformation services\u201d company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.\nStill, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer.\n\u201cFrom a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really have much of an effect in the California districts,\u201d Mr. Berg said. But \u201cif you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.\u201d"

The person said it was not clear when the show would be available.\nApple has been trying to make inroads into the living room, where viewers still watch tremendous amounts of content and advertisers still jockey for screen time.

The streaming device category is dominated by smart TVs, the Roku box and Google\u2019s Chromecast, data from the research firm eMarketer shows.\n\u201cThere has been such a proliferation of video streaming services and hardware in the past year that the only way Apple can get a leg up in the market is to differentiate with original content,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.\nBut Apple has struggled with content, while companies like Netflix and Amazon already have award-winning original shows.\nEddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, has been trying to put together a bundle of television shows for Apple TV that would be smaller than what cable companies offer, said a person with knowledge of the plan who declined to be identified because the discussions are private. But television and cable companies have balked at a deal. Apple has also held talks with film and television executives about financing original programs to be offered exclusively through Apple TV.\nCreating a show with Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, would help Apple overcome some of its content difficulties. Dr. Dre joined Apple after it acquired his Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. In addition to working with Apple Music, he produced the 2015 film \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which is based on his musical career.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, began his speech on Friday at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he got a standing ovation.\nAs Mr. Cook, 55, stood before the auditorium on Apple\u2019s campus, the audience \u2014 made up mostly of investors in the company \u2014 rose from their seats and applauded him.\n\u201cWhere we stand in times of controversy is a measure of our character,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, an Apple shareholder who attended the meeting. \u201cSome leaders only follow opinion polls. Others stand up for their principles, refuse to compromise, and mold opinion. We have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.\u201d\nThe meeting was a striking scene of support for Mr. Cook, who has led Apple into a battle against the United States government. The company isopposing afederal courtorder requiring it to help law enforcement officials break into aniPhoneused by one of the attackers in last year\u2019smass shootingin San Bernardino, Calif. Apple has said that the government is overstepping its bounds and that complying with the order could set a dangerous precedent, while law enforcement officials say the order is a one-time situation.\nApple is \u201ca staunch advocate for our customers\u2019 privacy and personal safety,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWe do these things because they are the right things to do. Being hard doesn\u2019t scare us.\u201d\nTechnology\u2019s largest companies are now also aligning themselves with Apple. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have said they will file one or more briefs in California federal court next week in support of Apple. More could join.\nCindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was also at the meeting, said she applauded Apple\u2019s leadership in fighting for the security and privacy of customers. She said the foundation would file a brief supporting Apple\u2019s refusal to comply with the court order.\nDuring the shareholder meeting, an energized Mr. Cook, dressed in his customary blue oxford shirt and jeans, also noted that Apple had released new versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems, which have the advanced security and encryption features that have frustrated the law enforcement agents who want access to data on Apple\u2019s devices. He said 77 percent of all active devices were using these most advanced and secure operating systems.\nOther social issues were also raised at the meeting. Mr. Cook said a pay study at the company had found that women earned 99.6 cents for every $1 that men did and that underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents for every $1 that white employees earned in similar roles. Mr. Cook said the company was taking measures to erase the discrepancy."
