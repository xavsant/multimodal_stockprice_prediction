        "title": "Switching From iPhone to Android Is Easy. It\u2019s the Aftermath That Stings.",
        "fulltext": "When I temporarily switched from an iPhone to an Android phone last week, I was bracing for a world of hurt. I\u2019ve owned only Apple phones ever since buying the first-generation iPhone in 2007. And, like many, I\u2019ve bought other Apple products that pair nicely, including AirPods, an Apple Watch and an iPad.\nThat type of loyalty is the basis of an antitrust case against Apple brought by the Justice Department, which has accused the company of using monopolistic control over the iPhone to harm competitors and deter customers from switching to other phones. To test that theory, I decided to briefly break up with my iPhone.\nI was initially surprised by how simple it was to shift my iPhone data to an Android smartphone made by Google. Just by installing anapp on my iPhone that Google madeto help people switch, I was able to copy my contacts list, photo album and calendar into my Google account. Then, presto \u2014 all that data appeared on the Android.\nI was almost done. After I called my carrier, Verizon, to transfer my phone number to the Android device, my mission was accomplished: I had become an Android convert.\nAt first, I was happy with my choice \u2014 I had upgraded to a fancy Google Pixel phone. But by Day 6, I was ready to switch back.\nA bunch of annoyances added up. Even though I could still use most of my Apple products, I started missing my Apple Watch, which requires an iPhone to fully work. For software, I was able to find Android alternatives for all my favorite apps \u2014 except for Notes. While switching phones wasn\u2019t technically hard, Apple\u2019s hooks were still in me.\nHow Apple keeps customers loyal to the iPhone \u2014 and whether its practices harm competition \u2014 is at the heart of thegovernment\u2019s antitrust suitagainst the Cupertino giant.\nApple and the Justice Department declined to comment.\nIn its 88-page complaint, the department said a number of Apple products protected the company\u2019s competitive advantage with the iPhone, including iMessage, Apple\u2019s Wallet app and the Apple Watch. How hard do those perks really make it to ditch your iPhone? Here\u2019s what I found.\nFor the most part, iPhone users and Android users can communicate with each other easily through email, phone calls and apps like Slack, but when it comes to text messaging, there is still an obvious split known as the\u201cgreen bubble versus blue bubble\u201d disparity.\nWhen iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like an animation of birthday confetti. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.\nBefore transferring my phone number to the Pixel phone, I used my iPhone to send iMessages to my blue bubble comrades warning them that our conversations would soon turn green. \u201cEw!\u201d a friend replied. But after many remarks made in jest, no one protested, and I soldiered on.\nNext, I had todetach my phone number from iMessage on Apple\u2019s websiteto ensure that my text messages would stop going through Apple\u2019s servers and arrive on my phone. Unless I did this, I would not receive texts from other iPhones. Eventually, the conversations turned green. I prepared myself for humiliation.\nBut no one gave me a hard time or excluded me. I did notice, however, that many friends had suddenly stopped texting me photos, perhaps because they knew the images would no longer look as good.\nFor years, some of my closest friends have texted me only through Signal, the third-party messaging app with strong privacy protections and many of the same features as iMessage. Signal is also available on Android, preserving that tradition.\nApple has announced that later this year, it willimprovetexts between iPhone and Android users by adopting rich communication services, a standard that Google and others integrated into their messaging apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will be higher quality.\nFor iPhones, the go-to app for making mobile payments in stores is Apple Wallet, and for Android users, the equivalent app is Google Wallet. The experience of using each wallet app was identical: I loaded up my credit cards and Clipper card for the Bay Area\u2019s rapid transit service.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s criticism of Apple Wallet centers on how Apple gives only its app access to the iPhone\u2019s payment chip, preventing competing wallet services from using that chip to make payments. But the way Apple designed its Wallet app had no impact on my ability to switch to an Android.\nFor an iPhone owner, a main incentive to buy more Apple products is that they work seamlessly together. A Mac laptop, for instance, uses many of the same apps for messaging, note taking and reminders as the iPhone, and the data is synchronized among the devices with Apple\u2019s iCloud. In theory, the more invested you are in Apple\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 and the more that Apple restricts its products from working with competing devices, the Justice Department says \u2014 the tougher it is to switch from an iPhone.\nAfter I switched to an Android phone, my feelings about using other Apple products ranged from moderate annoyance to deep frustration:\nThe iPad worked independently from the iPhone, but I could no longer see my text messages on the tablet anymore. This was minor because I don\u2019t do much texting on my iPad.\nMy AirPods Pro were OK \u2014 they connected quickly with the Pixel for playing music. But the downside is that the AirPods use Adaptive EQ, a technology that tunes sound quality to the shape of your ear, and it works only with software on the iPhone. So audio doesn\u2019t sound as good.\nI could not use my Android phone to locate my AirTags, the tiny Apple trackers I use to find my wallet and keys, on a map. But when my AirTags were in my pocket, the Android phone showed an alert that an \u201cunknown tracker\u201d was moving around with me, a safety feature for combating stalkers.\nThe Apple Watch requires an iPhone to set up, but its fitness tracking can work independently. Because I had already set up my watch, I could continue to use it at the gym alongside my Android phone. But I could no longer see my detailed workout data.\nI ran into other annoyances not specifically called out in the lawsuit and finally reached peak frustration when I tried to find a replacement for Apple\u2019s Notes, which I use regularly on my Mac, iPad and phone for work and personal errands. I used alternatives but didn\u2019t like them, and combined with the aforementioned issues, it was all too much.\nMy experience isn\u2019t universal. Some people would care more than others about how certain Apple products would change if they switched phones. Younger people would probably care a lot about lacking iMessage in schools, where a green bubble has been known to be an invitation for mockery and exclusion,according to education experts. Parents who use AirTags to track their children would view losing access to those as a deal breaker.\nThe upshot from this experiment is that while it\u2019s not technically hard to switch to a different phone, there are plenty of things that could make you regret it."

        "title": "\u2018Pay Later\u2019 Lenders Have an Issue With Credit Bureaus",
        "fulltext": "Shoppers in recent years have embraced \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d loans as an easy, interest-free way to purchase everything from sweaters to concert tickets.\nThe loans typically are not reported on consumers\u2019 credit reports, however, or reflected in their credit scores. That hasstoked concernsthat users might be taking on an outsize amount of debt that is invisible to both lenders and financial regulators.\nSo in February, when Apple announced it would start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later program to Experian, one of the three major U.S. credit bureaus, it looked like a watershed moment for the fast-growing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d category.\nBut none of the other major pay-later providers have followed Apple\u2019s lead. And while credit bureaus and lenders say they are interested in finding a way to work together, the gulf between the two sides remains wide \u2014 so much so that some pay-later firms are exploring creating an alternative credit bureau to handle their loans.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen really meaningful progress,\u201d said David Sykes, chief commercial officer of Klarna, one of the largest pay-later firms.\n\u201cBuy now, pay later\u201d loans allow consumers to pay for purchases over time, often in four installments over six weeks, interest free. They surged in popularity during the pandemic, when they helped fuel an online-shopping boom. The rapid growth has continued: The retail industry attributed its record-setting holiday sales in part to the popularity of pay-later products.\nBut economists at Wells Fargo warned last year that \u201cphantom debt\u201d from pay-later loans \u201ccould create substantial problems for the consumer and the broader economy.\u201d\nThe credit bureaus argue that incorporating pay-later loans into the reporting system would benefit consumers, who could build credit by repaying the loans on time, and lenders, who would gain fuller insight into consumers\u2019 borrowing.\nThe pay-later providers agree \u2014 in theory. But they worry that reporting the loans would end up hurting their customers. Existing scoring models penalize borrowers who take out many loans in a short period. That could be a problem for the pay-later industry because, unlike credit card purchases, each pay-later transaction is treated as a loan.\nSome consumer advocates share that concern.\n\u201cThe credit reporting system is a system that assumes monthly payments, it assumes longer-term loans, and it just isn\u2019t really cut out to handle \u2018buy now, pay later,\u2019\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a square-peg, round-hole kind of thing.\u201d\nThe consumer reporting industry in the United States has evolved over the decades to become a complex web of independent and sometimes competing players. Financial institutions \u2014 banks, mortgage brokers, auto lenders and others \u2014 report information on loans to three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Those bureaus compile the data and provide it to lenders and consumers, and also to companies like FICO and VantageScore, which use it to produce credit scores.\nThe major credit bureaus say they addressed the pay-later industry\u2019s concerns more than two years ago when they created a category for the loans. That should allow FICO and VantageScore to adjust their models to account for those loans\u2019 unique characteristics \u2014 and ultimately to incorporate them into credit scores without penalizing users. (For now, the loans would be included on consumers\u2019 credit reports but not visible to lenders or incorporated into scoring models.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road, but I think that we are finally hitting a turning point in the momentum toward getting the data reported,\u201d said Liz Pagel, a senior vice president at TransUnion who oversees the company\u2019s consumer lending business.\nThe pay-later industry, however, argues that the credit-reporting system still isn\u2019t ready. For one thing, the credit bureaus primarily receive data from lenders monthly, whereas pay-later loans are typically paid biweekly. (All three major credit bureaus said that while monthly reporting was the default, lenders could report more frequently if they wish.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fit-for-purpose yet,\u201d Mr. Sykes of Klarna said. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen anything from the bureaus that suggest it\u2019s about to be.\u201d\nKlarna reports loans to TransUnion and Experian in Britain, where the system works somewhat differently. A rival, Affirm, reports some longer-term loans to Experian in the United States and says it hopes to report shorter-term loans \u201ceventually.\u201d\nOther major pay-later providers, like Afterpay, PayPal and Zip, said their concerns with the credit reporting system\u2019s handling of pay-later loans had not been resolved.\n\u201cOur members continue to say it\u2019s still inadequate,\u201d said Penny Lee, president of the Financial Technology Association, which represents many of the largest pay-later companies.\nThat argument took a hit in February, however, when Apple announced that it would begin reporting loans made through its \u201cApple Pay Later\u201d product \u2014 essentially a copy of the pay-in-four loans offered by Klarna, Afterpay and similar firms \u2014 to Experian.\nApple declined to comment, but in an earlier news release said that while the loans would not immediately be incorporated into credit scores, it saw the move as a step toward \u201cproviding users with the opportunity to further build their credit.\u201d\nSilvio Tavares, chief executive of VantageScore, said in an interview that Apple\u2019s announcement showed the credit-reporting system\u2019s ability to handle pay-later loans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to be more sophisticated than Apple,\u201d he said.\nFar from joining Apple, however, pay-later providers appear to be exploring a system outside the traditional credit reporting infrastructure. Last year, two former industry executives founded Qlarifi, a data-aggregation platform specifically for pay-later loans. (Mr. Sykes of Klarna is an investor.)\nAlex Naughton, who left Klarna last year to help found Qlarifi and is now its chief executive, portrays the company as a nimble, more tech-savvy credit-reporting approach. It will be able to collect and share data in real time rather than monthly, the standard for the major credit bureaus.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the existing infrastructure is able to adapt as quickly,\u201d he said.\nThe lenders and the credit agencies agree that pay-later loans are unlikely to remain outside the credit scoring system forever. But it is unclear what will break the logjam. Ultimately, industry experts said, it will probably boil down to one of two things: Either regulators will force pay-later firms to start reporting or market forces will.\n\u201cEither it\u2019s going to be a market shift or it\u2019s going to be a regulatory shift,\u201d said Shane Foster, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig who specializes in financial regulation.\nRegulatory action seems unlikely soon, at least at the federal level. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau hashintedthat it would like to see pay-later loans incorporated into the credit reporting system. But while the agency oversees the credit reporting industry \u2014 enforcing policies to ensure that the data is accurate and that consumer rights are protected \u2014 it hasn\u2019t tried to require private companies to provide data to the bureaus.\nSeveral states, including California, have taken action to regulate the pay-later industry, and others, including New York, are considering doing so. But those efforts wouldn\u2019t immediately require the loans to be reported to credit bureaus.\nBanks and other traditional lenders report to the credit bureaus because the data is helpful in lending decisions and because it provides a stick to encourage borrowers to repay: If they don\u2019t, their credit scores will suffer.\nPay-later providers may not feel much pressure to begin reporting because their business is growing and most consumers are making their payments, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. But if the economy slows and more consumers start falling behind on payments, lenders might decide they need to join the credit reporting system to judge borrowers\u2019 reliability.\n\u201cDelinquencies are pretty low, the job market\u2019s been solid, so maybe that\u2019s not created the same urgency,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Buy now, pay later\u2019 has yet to have its real delinquency reckoning. People keep warning about it. Maybe that will ultimately be what spurs change here.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Beeper, theapp that brought iPhone messaging features to Android smartphones, has been acquired by Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, to support the development of a single service for sending and receiving chats from WhatsApp, Signal, LinkedIn and others.\nThe deal, which is valued at about $125 million, was announced on Tuesday. It comes asregulators in Europeand the United States pressure the biggest tech companies to open their messaging services to third parties. Regulators believe doing so will make it easier for people to communicate with friends and family and to switch messaging providers.\nAutomattic is betting that the changing regulatory environment will make people more interested in finding a unified messaging system like Beeper, said Toni Schneider, Automattic\u2019s interim chief executive.\nBeeper is Automattic\u2019s second messaging service acquisition. Last year, it bought Texts, an iPhone app that brings together messages from Instagram, iMessage and others. Mr. Schneider said Beeper and Texts employees would combine their systems into a single app that worked on iPhones and Android smartphones as well as computers.\n\u201cEveryone has this problem where they say, \u2018I know I had this conversation with this person, but I can\u2019t remember where,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cWe think we can innovate a lot in this space.\u201d\nEric Migicovsky, who co-founded Beeper in 2020, said Beeper and Texts would deliver their combined service this year. The teams that built those companies will meet in two weeks in Portugal to begin that process.\n\u201cThe real thing we have been competing against was apathy about new experiences in chat,\u201d Mr. Migicovsky said.\nLast year, Beeper released an app that offered Android phone users the ability to send encrypted messages and high-resolution videos to iPhones. The app added more than 100,000 users in three daysbefore Apple blocked it by changing its iMessagesystem.\nThough a Justice Department lawsuit accusing Apple of maintaining an iPhone monopoly did not refer specifically to Beeper, the problems highlighted by Beeper\u2019s conflict with Apple were mentioned in the complaint, which was filed in March. The department faulted Apple for making \u201ciPhone users less secure than they would otherwise be\u201d by \u201crejecting solutions\u201d for smartphone messaging like those provided by Beeper.\nBeeper will soon be open to anyone who wants to download it after a testing period that limited the app to about 100,000 users, Mr. Migicovsky said. The company had 466,000 people on a waiting list. About 60 percent of its users are on Android smartphones.\nAutomattic was an early investor in Beeper, which had raised $16 million from investors that included Y Combinator and Initialized Capital, Mr. Migicovsky said. Last week, Beeper\u2019s 27 employees officially began work at their new company."

        "title": "Apple Says It Was Ordered to Pull WhatsApp From China App Store",
        "fulltext": "Apple said it pulled the Meta-owned apps WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China on Friday on government orders, potentially escalating the war over technology between the United States and China.\nThe iPhone maker said that China\u2019s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration, ordered the removal of WhatsApp and Threads from its app store because of national security concerns. Apple said that it complied because \u201cwe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree.\u201d\nA Meta spokesman directed requests for comment to Apple. The Wall Street Journalearlier reportedApple\u2019s removal of the apps.\nA person briefed on the situation said the Chinese government had found content on WhatsApp and Threads about China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, that was inflammatory and violated the country\u2019s cybersecurity laws. The specifics of what was in the content was unclear, the person said.\nAn Apple spokesman denied that the Chinese government ordered the apps removed because of content on WhatsApp and Thread about Mr. Xi that was inflammatory.\nSeveral other global messaging apps had also been removed from Apple\u2019s App Store in China on Friday, including Signal, which is based in the United States, and Telegram, which is based in Dubai, according to Appfigures, a market research firm that analyzes the digital economy. Signal didn\u2019t immediately have a comment and Telegram didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe actions thrust Apple and Meta into an intensifying tussle over technology between the United States and China. In the United States, the House of Representatives was preparing tovote on a billas soon as this weekend that would force the Chinese internet company ByteDance to sell its popular video app TikTok or have it be banned in the United States. U.S. lawmakers have said TikTok poses a national security threat because of its ties to China.Chinese officials have condemnedthe push to force a TikTok sale.\nThe White House has also recently worked to restrict Beijing\u2019saccess to advanced technologiesthat could be used in war, as well as extend restrictions to American dollars that are used to finance the development of such technologies within Chinese borders. Beijing has responded by banning memory chips from the U.S. chipmaker Micron and moving to curb other American chip companies\u2019 sales.\nChina has long blocked American websites including Facebook and Instagram by using an elaborate system called the Great Firewall. While WhatsApp, one of the world\u2019s most popular messaging services, and Threads, an X-like app for digital conversation, were permitted in app stores, they were not used widely in China. The apps were dwarfed by Chinese ones such asWeChat, which is owned by the Chinese internet company Tencent.\nStill, Chinese users had been able to download WhatsApp and use it with the assistance of a virtual private network, or VPN, which are used to set up secure web connections and view prohibited content inside China.\nWhatsApp had been downloaded 15 million times on iPhones in China since 2017, while Threads had been downloaded 470,000 times, according to Appfigures.\nApple has been more vulnerable than most companies to the rising tensions between the United States and China. It became one of the world\u2019s most valuable public companies by tapping China\u2019s vast work force and manufacturing muscle to build its iPhones and then selling the devices to the country\u2019s growing middle class. China now accounts for about a fifth of Apple\u2019s annual sales, more than $68 billion last year.\nFor years, Apple hasbowed to Beijing\u2019s demandsthat it block an array of apps, including newspapers, VPNs and encrypted messaging services. It also built a data center in the country to house Chinese citizens\u2019 iCloud information, which includes personal contacts, photos and email.\nAs the relationship between the United States and China deteriorated, Apple began diversifying its supply chain and has started assembling iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches in India and Vietnam.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has been in Asia this week, where he has visited suppliers in Vietnam and spoke with Indonesia\u2019s president about building a manufacturing plant there.\nFor Meta, any fallout will likely be less direct, given that many of its apps were already banned in China. Still, Meta makes money from Chinese companies likeTemu and Shein, which pay to place advertising inside Instagram and Facebook.\nMeta and Apple have long had anuneasy corporate relationship. Apple has introduced greater restrictions on the types of tracking that companies could do across its devices, severely curtailing Meta\u2019s ability to gain insights into user behavior for its digital advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, has publicly railed against what he feels are Apple\u2019s overly restrictive privacy guidelines.\nIn the United States, the moves against TikTok have gained momentum in recent days, with House Speaker Mike Johnson packaging a measure to force ByteDance to sell the app with other bills onforeign aidfor Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\nHouse lawmakers are expected to vote Saturday on the package of legislation. If the package passes, the measures will be sent as a single bill to the Senate, which could vote soon after. President Biden has said he would sign TikTok legislation into law if it reaches his desk."

        "title": "Apple Lifts Some Restrictions on iPhone Repairs",
        "fulltext": "Apple said Thursday that it would relax limits on repairing newer iPhones with used parts like screens, batteries and cameras, a reversal from its previous practice of using software to encourage people to work with new and more expensive Apple-approved parts.\nThe change comes weeks after Oregon passed a law outlawing Apple\u2019s practice of tying parts to software, which is known as \u201cparts pairing.\u201d Similar bills are being considered in Colorado and more than a dozen other states. Apple had objected to the Oregon legislation before its passage, saying customers could be made vulnerable to security risks if Apple was required to allow lower-priced parts made by third-party suppliers.\nIn the past, if an iPhone owner broke a part \u2014 a screen, for instance \u2014 and installed a genuine, used Apple screen purchased from a source such as eBay, the replacement display would not work properly because its serial number did not match the one in Apple\u2019s database. The only way to install a fully functioning replacement part was if it was bought from Apple, which had the tools to pair the part with the phone.\nApple\u2019s new policy will remove those restrictions for the iPhone 15, which it released last year. Apple said the change would begin this fall and apply to genuine Apple parts, meaning those made by iPhone suppliers. When a genuine replacement part is installed, the phone will work with it automatically, without requiring a technician to provide a serial number to Apple. The replacement part will then work seamlessly with the iPhone.\nThe reversal comes about five months after The New York Times published ananalysis of Apple\u2019s increasing restrictions on iPhone repairs, which drove up costs for consumers.\nIn itsnews releaseannouncing the change, Apple said that the change would streamline its parts-pairing process on some iPhones for used Apple screens, batteries and other parts to simplify repairs \u2014 not those components made by third-party suppliers. Those parts are typically less expensive and could save customers money on repairs. Replacing a shattered screen at an Apple Store costs roughly $300, about $100 more than work done by an independent shop using a third-party screen.\nAn Apple spokesman said that people could install third-party parts but that iPhones would continue to use software to alert them when that was done because the company considered it important to customer security and safety. He pointed to astudy fundedby Apple that showed that the majority of third-party smartphone batteries had failed safety tests and that some had caused fires.\nNathan Proctor, who has lobbied states for repair legislation on behalf of U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit largely funded by small donors, said the move was a small step in the right direction. It never made technical sense for Apple to place restrictions on installing authentic Apple parts for repairs, he said.\n\u201cIt was always a preposterous and ridiculous practice,\u201d Mr. Proctor said.\nStarting in January, Oregon\u2019s law requires Apple and others to begin allowing customers to use any part they want in repairs \u2014 even those unapproved by the original smartphone maker. Apple would face a penalty of $1,000 a day for failing to comply with the law starting in 2027.\nWhen the Oregon bill was passed, Apple said it would support repair legislation but added that the \u201cbill does not offer the consumer protections Oregonians deserve.\u201d"

        "title": "FIFA Said to Be Close to TV Deal With Apple for New Tournament",
        "fulltext": "FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body, is close to an agreement with Apple that would give the tech company worldwide television rights for a major new tournament, a monthlong,World Cup-style competitionfor top teams that will be played for the first time in the United States next summer.\nThe agreement could be announced as soon as this month, according to three people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly because it has yet to be officially confirmed. It comes after several false starts for a competition championed by FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino. Plans to hold it in China in 2021 were scuttled because of the pandemic.\nThe value of the deal might be as little as a quarter of the $4 billion FIFA had first estimated, the people said. It is unclear if the deal with Apple will include any free-to-air rights, meaning the entire event could be available only to subscribers of Apple TV+, a factor over which senior executives at FIFA have raised concerns.\nShould the deal go through, it would be the first time that FIFA, which will stage the first expanded 48-team men\u2019s World Cup in the United States in 2026, has agreed to a single worldwide contract. It would also represent the latest foray into soccer for Apple, which in 2022 signed a 10-year, $2.5 billion agreement for the global streaming rights to Major League Soccer.\nStreaming services have become increasingly interested in live sports, as they seek to woo more subscribers.Peacockstreamed a National Football League playoff game last season and Amazon Prime has been streaming Thursday night N.F.L. games since 2022. Apple also has a deal to stream Major League Baseball games. Netflix focuses more on sports documentaries, though it recently pushed into live \u201csports-adjacent programming,\u201d including a multibillion deal to stream World Wrestling Entertainment\u2019s flagship weekly wrestling show, \u201cRaw.\u201d It also announced that it would stream a boxing match between the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and the social media influencer Jake Paul in July.\nFIFA was hoping that the tournament, which will feature a mix of successful teams from across the globe, including 12 from Europe, where most of the world\u2019s top talent plays, would create huge demand from broadcasters and commercial partners. But a combination of poor planning and delays prompted broadcasters to balk at the figures FIFA had sought. Sponsors have so far also been reluctant to commit the $150 million that the organization is seeking for sponsorship packages, according to the people.\nA global deal with a major company like Apple may give the tournament, which will be played every four years, the veneer of high quality that Infantino has been trying to secure. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. \u201cAs a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,\u201d FIFA said in a statement.\nFIFA has set aside June 15 to July 13 in 2025 for the tournament to be played. That comes after the long European season, and has traditionally been a time when no major events take place in order to allow players to rest in the off-season a year before the World Cup. Players unions have criticized FIFA for not consulting them before announcing the event.\nFIFA also faces significant costs by playing the event in the United States, where it will act as a tuneup for the World Cup. Some games will be in large arenas, including N.F.L. stadiums that must be leased. FIFA had hoped to secure major sponsorship partners willing to pay as much as the $100 million that World Cup sponsors pay per cycle, but with little more than a year to go, no title partners have been announced for the event.\nThe deal must be concluded soon in order to be announced ahead of the upfronts later next month, during which entertainment companies try to woo advertisers by talking about future programming.\nEuropean clubs have been pressing FIFA for months for concrete details of the event, including the cities where it will be staged, and even its name. FIFA had said the event would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA, but teams have now been told that is under review."
