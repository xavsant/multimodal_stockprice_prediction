        "fulltext": "Need a breakfrom impeachment season? Here\u2019s a quick catch-up on what happened this week on the business and tech fronts, and the news to know heading into Monday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnsonfinally managed to cobble together a new Brexit dealwith the European Union last week, three months after his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to get Britain out of the E.U. by the Oct. 31 deadline.Markets were temporarily buoyedby investors\u2019 optimism that the plan could actually get a nod from Parliament. But British lawmakers promptlydashed those hopeson Saturday, when they rejected Mr. Johnson\u2019s proposal and brought the whole mess back to square one. Three possibilities remain: a no-deal exit from the European Union, which could be economically disastrous; a second referendum on whether to leave at all; or a general election that could put new leaders in power.\nPresident Trumpwill host the next Group of 7 summitin June at Trump National Doral, his luxury resort near Miami. The choice of venue reignites questions about a conflict of interest: Is it O.K. for Mr. Trump to request that other countries pay for rooms at one of his own properties? Since taking office, he has denied making any profits from the Trump Organization \u2014 but the company hasnot disclosed its profits for the last several years, so who really knows? Critics say the decision potentially violates the emoluments clauses of the Constitution, which prohibit government officials (like, say, the sitting president) from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments.\nA Boeing pilot who worked on the technology for the 737 Max plane admitted in 2016 that there was a problem with a new automated system \u2014 and that he had lied, \u201cunknowingly,\u201d he says \u2014 to the Federal Aviation Administration about it. That was more than two years before two of the 737 Max aircraft crashed and killed 346 people, resulting in the whole fleet being grounded. Now thattranscripts of the pilot\u2019s messages have been made public, the F.A.A. is demanding to know why Boeing didn\u2019t provide them earlier. The Department of Justice is still conducting a criminal investigation of who\u2019s at fault for the jets\u2019 faulty systems.\nThe monthlong strike at General Motors, which has shut down over 30 auto factories,could be resolved soon. The United Automobile Workers union said on Wednesday that it had reached a tentative agreement with G.M. that would increase wages and provide a better way for temporary workers to become full-time. And not a moment too soon. Analysts say G.M. has hemorrhaged about $2 billion since the strike started, and the almost 50,000 striking workers have gone without their regular paycheck. But the proposed deal isn\u2019t finalized yet, and G.M. has held fast on several key points. (It won\u2019t reopen several plants that it recently idled, for instance.)\nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, will appear before Congress on Wednesday to defend Libra, the company\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency, which has been met with skepticism since Day 1 andis now losing backers left and right. Mr. Zuckerberg is also fighting accusations that his platform is enabling the spread of misinformation. The company announced last month that it wouldn\u2019t moderate or fact-check politicians\u2019 ads or content,saying free speech was in the public interest.\u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerbergsaid last week. No one\u2019s arguing with him there \u2014 but what kind of force it is remains up for debate.\nThe ratty pea green sweater that Kurt Cobain wore for Nirvana\u2019s famous 1993 performance on MTV\u2019s \u201cUnplugged\u201dwill be auctioned at New York\u2019s Hard Rock Cafe this Friday. Unwashed since Mr. Cobain wore it last (gross), the mohair-blend cardigan has been carefully preserved in tissue paper, complete with a cigarette burn, a spot where a button should be and several mysterious stains. It was last sold four years ago for just under $114,000, and auctioneers now expect it to fetch about $300,000.\nUberlaid off 350 employeeslast week, its third round of cuts in recent months, as it struggles to curtail losses after a disappointing initial public offering earlier this year. Speaking of troubled companies, Juul has nowsuspended all sales of its fruit-flavored e-cigarettesin the United States, both online and in stores, as the death toll of vaping-related lung illnessesrose to 33. On a brighter note, NASA\u2019s first all-female spacewalkfinally happened on Friday, after a spacesuit snafudelayed plansto do it earlier this year. (At the time, the space station did not have enough suits in the right sizes for the female astronauts.)"

        "title": "In House Antitrust Hearing, Lawmakers Focus on Harms to Privacy",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House lawmakers on Friday pressed experts on how the market power of major tech platforms could hurt consumer privacy, showing thatan antitrust investigationinto Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon is growing to include deeper questions about their business models.\nLawmakers from the Judiciary Committee heard testimony that the tech giants have amassed vast quantities of data that give them an advantage over rivals, and that their dominance allows them to get away with more aggressive data collection.\nBut some Republicans expressed concerns that efforts to regulate privacy, including aggressive data protection regulations in Europe, could hurt competition among internet firms.\nThe hearing was the latest in a wide-ranging antitrust investigation by the House into the companies. Google has also disclosed that it is the subject of a Justice Department investigation, while Facebook said this year that the Federal Trade Commission was looking at its practices. State attorneys general are investigating the two companies as well.\nAnd elsewhere in the world, some competition regulators are looking at the way that online data collection gives platforms an undue competitive advantage. Germany\u2019s antitrust authority, for example, has told Facebook that it cannot automatically share data among its different services, like Instagram and WhatsApp. A courtoverturned the actionin August, though the regulator has said it will appeal the decision.\nNow the antitrust questions being asked by lawmakers and regulators are increasingly becoming intertwined with the debate over how to regulate privacy online.\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the relationship between competition and privacy is not either-or,\u201d Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, said at Friday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThey\u2019re mutually reinforcing concepts that must be at the forefront as we consider proposals to restore the internet to its full promise.\u201d\nProponents of greater antitrust enforcement argue that cracking down on the platforms will make it harder for the companies to pursue a business model that relies on the aggressive monetization of consumer data.\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s so few dominant players, that opens up more abuses of privacy,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.\nBut policymakers and experts on the right have argued that efforts to protect consumer privacy and bolster competition may work at cross purposes. Roslyn Layton, a scholar who testified at the hearing, saidEurope\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation,which was created to let people request their online data, had simply entrenched the tech giants by burdening start-ups that could challenge them.\nIn August, Noah Phillips, a Republican member of the F.T.C., said in a statement that Google had cut off third parties\u2019 access to certain data last year, potentially hurting their ability to compete with the search giant while bolstering user privacy. He said that privacy \u201cis important\u201d but that consumers \u201cand policymakers alike must recognize, however, that it comes with trade-offs.\u201d\nThe House antitrust investigation is expected to continue into 2020. Last month, the committee asked tech companies for a tranche of documents, including emails from top executives like Larry Page of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. The panelalso contactedmore than 80 companies for information about competing with the four major players.\nMr. Cicilline said on Friday that the committee had received \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of documents in response to its requests.\n\u201cOur hope is to conclude our evidence collection end of this year, beginning of next year, with the idea that we will have a final report and set of recommendations in the first part of next year, providing us enough time to act on that\u201d before the end of the current congressional session, he said."

        "title": "Apple Enters Show Business With a Black-Carpet Premiere",
        "fulltext": "After all that \u2014 the billions spent, the deals with Big Bird, Oprah and Spielberg, the firing of a key producer, the secrecy, the breathless speculation \u2014 the moment is here. Apple is ready to take on Netflix, Amazon and Disney in the increasingly crowded entertainment industry.\nThe tech giant made its formal entry into show business on Monday with a spare-no-expense premiere at Lincoln Center for \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a program set in the world of morning television starringReese WitherspoonandJennifer Aniston.\nAt the fountain plaza, the carpet was black, not red. A glowing sign beamed the minimalist logo forApple TV Plus. Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston roamed the grounds, along with the Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Invited guests and fans along the rope line captured the scene with their iPhones.\nFrom the stage of David Geffen Hall, Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston spoke to an audience of 1,500 before the screening.\n\u201cThank you, Apple, for being our partners and trusting in us as your beloved flagship, I guess you would say,\u201d Ms. Aniston said. \u201cSomething like that?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon replied. \u201cIt\u2019s the launch.\u201d\nApple TV Plus, which goes live Friday, has been in the works for more than two years. With it, the Silicon Valley giant has shifted its focus from just creating tech products to making content. The streaming service costs $5 a month or comes free for a year with the purchase of a new Apple device.\nLed by the veteran Hollywood executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, Apple TV Plus has made deals with Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams and M. Night Shyamalan, among others.\nA lot rides on the success of \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d which anchors the company\u2019s first slate of streaming programs and films. Apple paid roughly $240 million for a two-season, 20-episode deal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that Apple is entering this business in such a way,\u201d Mr. Van Amburg said in an interview last week.\nNow the big question: Will it work?\nAsked to describe what will keep their bosses happy, Mr. Erlicht said, \u201cCritically acclaimed quality shows, first and foremost. Ultimately subscribers matter. But Day 1, high-quality, distinctive, critically acclaimed programming will drive everything.\u201d\nWell, the early reviews hit the internet this week and they weredecidedlymixed.\nIn addition to \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d several other Apple series have been made available to critics, including: \u201cDickinson,\u201d starring Hailee Steinfeld as the poet Emily Dickinson; \u201cSee,\u201d a fantasy epic starring Jason Momoa that takes place in a future where everyone has gone blind; and a space drama, \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d co-created by Ronald D. Moore.\nApple has gone Hollywood for a reason. With iPhone sales flattening, the company sought out other ways to generate revenue. In addition to Apple TV Plus, it has unveiled a credit card and started a video-game subscription service.\nUnlike Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, which have tentatively dipped their toes in entertainment, Apple has gone all-in. Within a year, Apple TV Plus could have as much content as longtime cable networks like FX or Showtime.\nApple is going into the business at a time when tech rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have a huge head start in making original streaming fare. Apple will also face vigorous competition from the Walt Disney Company, AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia unit and NBCUniversal. Disney Plus, offering decades of movies and shows, will be available Nov. 12. NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock streaming service andAT&T\u2019s HBO Maxwill be ready next year.\nThe next few months will suggest whether or not the executives in Cupertino, Calif., have the stomach for the unpredictable entertainment business. Before Apple TV Plus, the company only flirted with the idea, under Eddy Cue, its senior vice president for internet software and services. In 2017, Mr. Cue hired Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg, who were the top executives at Sony\u2019s television studio, as the heads of Apple TV Plus.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d Mr. Cuesaid last year, by way of explaining why the company had selected the pair, who had helped lead the studio behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\nThere were bumps in the road leading to the black-carpet premiere at Lincoln Center. Until last month, Apple kept some details about its productions under wraps, including plans for how much the streaming service would cost and how it would be marketed.\nCorporate secrecy may be the right strategy for selling the latest iPhone, but it rankled some entertainment-business veterans, who were also not impressed with the splashy Apple TV Plusrollout eventat the company\u2019s Cupertino headquarters in March.\nMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg have said little publicly in their 28 months on the job, a departure from how most Hollywood studios engage with the news media.\nThere has also been the endless litany of questions: How can it survive without a library? How will the shows portray Apple products? Will the content be P.G.-rated, so that it does not sully the Apple brand?\nFor that last one, there is an answer: No. As the audience saw on Monday night, \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d is filled with language that would not make the final cut of a network program. The first episode of \u201cSee\u201d features plenty of violence as well as depictions of masturbation and an orgasm. And the first episode of \u201cDickinson\u201d includes an oral sex scene.\nMr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht said they never intended Apple to be squeaky-clean, but admitted to telling agents and producers that violence, sex or language should not be \u201cgratuitous,\u201d Mr. Van Amburg said.\nThe use of the word \u201cgratuitous\u201d in those discussions, Mr. Van Amburg added, was \u201ctaken to an extreme and suddenly became something and that makes you realize how little people understand what that word means.\u201d\nThe executive added that Apple would not get in the way of the show creators they now rely on.\n\u201cIf we were to start to impose certain things like \u2018it has to be this\u2019 or \u2018it must only do this,\u2019 we would start to pull at a thread of authenticity and potentially be a place that didn\u2019t celebrate \u2014 as deeply and emotionally as we do \u2014 creative expression,\u201d Mr. Van Amburg said.\nApple will also stream shows for children, including a new animated version of \u201cPeanuts\u201d and programs made with Sesame Workshop.\nApple products do tend to pop up in the new programs, particularly \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d where the iPhone appears so many times that it becomes almost a character in itself. Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg have said there was no edict handed down from Cupertino on how the shows treat the iPhone and other Apple devices, a point confirmed by many of the producers.\n\u201cNot one person has ever said to us you need to make sure we represent hardware product in our shows or that these shows are a sales tool for hardware product,\u201d Mr. Erlicht said.\nUnlike its rivals, Apple will not have the luxury of being able to lean on an extensive library of programming. But Apple customers can use the Apple TV app to click to an episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d or selections from Showtime or Hulu, if they are subscribers to those services.\n\u201cFor us, it was always going to be about originals and our ability to help you discover all that other library product that exists in the world and exists in all these other places in this disaggregated way,\u201d Mr. Van Amburg said.\nThough Apple will soon be streaming, it has not committed to the binge model. For the debut, episodes of \u201cDickinson\u201d and its children\u2019s shows will be available all at once. The dramas will generally drop a few episodes at the start before easing into a weekly schedule. Apple\u2019s entertainment executives suggested that weekly releases create a consistent buzz in a way that, say, Netflix series do not.\n\u201cThe Morning Show\u201d is of outsize importance to Apple. Within three days of getting the job at the company in 2017, Mr. Erlicht told the Lincoln Center crowd on Monday night, he found himself in a room at the Creative Artists Agency, hearing the pitch for it.\n\u201cWe knew right away this was the one,\u201d he said.\nApple TV Plus was so new that the executives had to call Mr. Cue to get instructions on how to obtain cash, Mr. Erlicht said. A hard-fought battle ensued with multiple bidders, including Netflix and Showtime. Not long after a script was submitted, the creator of \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d Jay Carson, a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, was fired. Hollywood snickered.\n\u201cThe negotiation was not easy,\u201d Mr. Erlicht said from the Lincoln Center stage. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll say nothing about the show has been what I would describe as easy. But the great ones never are.\u201d\nHe did not mention the reviews."

        "title": "The Reason Your Photos Are About to Get a Lot Better",
        "fulltext": "Not too long ago, tech giants like Apple and Samsung raved about the number of megapixels they were cramming into smartphone cameras to make photos look clearer. Nowadays, all the handset makers are shifting focus to the algorithms, artificial intelligence and special sensors that are working together to make our photos look more impressive.\nWhat that means: Ourphonesare working hard to make photos look good, with minimal effort required from the user.\nOn Tuesday,Googleshowed its latest attempt to make cameras smarter. It unveiled the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, new versions of itspopular smartphone, which comes in two screen sizes. While the devices include new hardware features \u2014 like an extra camera lens and an infrared face scanner to unlock the phone \u2014 Google emphasized the phones\u2019 use of so-called computational photography, which automatically processes images to look more professional.\nAmong the Pixel 4\u2019s new features is a mode for shooting the night sky and capturing images of stars. And by adding the extra lens, Google augmented a software feature called Super Res Zoom, which allows users to zoom in more closely on images without losing much detail.\nApple also highlighted computational photography last month when it introducedthree new iPhones. One yet-to-be released feature, Deep Fusion, will process images with an extreme amount of detail.\nThe big picture? When you take a digital photo, you\u2019re not actually shooting a photo anymore.\n\u201cMost photos you take these days are not a photo where you click the photo and get one shot,\u201d said Ren Ng, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThese days it takes a burst of images and computes all of that data into a final photograph.\u201d\nComputational photography has been around for years. One of the earliest forms was HDR, for high dynamic range, which involved taking a burst of photos at different exposures and blending the best parts of them into one optimal image.\nOver the last few years, more sophisticated computational photography has rapidly improved the photos taken on our phones.\nGoogle gave me a preview of its Pixel phones last week. Here\u2019s what they tell us about the software that\u2019s making our phone cameras tick, and what to look forward to. (For the most part, the photos will speak for themselves.)\nLast year, Google introduced Night Sight, which made photos taken in low light look as though they had been shot in normal conditions, without a flash. The technique took a burst of photos with short exposures and reassembled them into an image.\nWith the Pixel 4, Google is applying a similar technique for photos of the night sky. For astronomy photos, the camera detects when it is very dark and takes a burst of images at extra-long exposures to capture more light. The result is a task that could previously be done only with full-size cameras with bulky lenses, Google said.\nApple\u2019s new iPhones also introduced a mode for shooting photos in low light, employing a similar method. Once the camera detects that a setting is very dark, it automatically captures multiple pictures and fuses them together while adjusting colors and contrast.\nA few years ago, phone makers like Apple, Samsung and Huawei introduced cameras that produced portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which sharpened a subject in the foreground and blurred the background. Most phone makers used two lenses that worked together to create the effect.\nTwo years ago with the Pixel 2, Google accomplished the same effect with a single lens. Its method largely relied on machine learning \u2014 computers analyzing millions of images to recognize what\u2019s important in a photo. ThePixel then made predictionsabout the parts of the photo that should stay sharp and created a mask around it. A special sensor inside the camera, called dual-pixel autofocus, helped analyze the distance between the objects and the camera to make the blurring look realistic.\nWith the Pixel 4, Google said, it has improved the camera\u2019s portrait-mode ability. The new second lens will allow the camera to capture more information about depth, which lets the camera shoot objects with portrait mode from greater distances.\nIn the past, zooming in with digital cameras was practically taboo because the image would inevitably become very pixelated, and the slightest hand movement would create blur. Google used software to address the issue last year in the Pixel 3 with what it calls Super Res Zoom.\nThe technique takes advantage of natural hand tremors to capture a burst of photos in varying positions. By combining each of the slightly varying photos, the camera software composes a photo that fills in detail that wouldn\u2019t have been there with a normal digital zoom.\nThe Pixel 4\u2019s new lens expands the ability of Super Res Zoom by adjusting to zoom in, similar to a zoom lens on a film camera. In other words, now the camera will take advantage of both the software feature and the optical lens to zoom in extra close without losing detail.\nComputational photography is an entire field of study in computer science. Dr. Ng, the Berkeley professor, teaches courses on the subject. He said he and his students were researching new techniques like the ability to apply portrait-mode effects to videos.\nSay, for example, two people in a video are having a conversation, and you want the camera to automatically focus on whoever is speaking. A video camera can\u2019t typically know how to do that because it can\u2019t predict the future. But in computational photography, a camera could record all the footage, use artificial intelligence to determine which person is speaking and apply the auto-focusing effects after the fact. The video you\u2019d see would shift focus between two people as they took turns speaking.\n\u201cThese are examples of capabilities that are completely new and emerging in research that could completely change what we think of that\u2019s possible,\u201d Dr. Ng said."

        "title": "Chinese Media\u2019s Attacks on Apple and N.B.A. Help Inflame Nationalism",
        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 The editorial was scathing.\nPeople\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, was taking aim at Apple, accusing it of serving as an \u201cescort\u201d for \u201crioters\u201d in Hong Kong by providing an app that allows protesters to track police movements.\n\u201cLetting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings,\u201dwarned the article, which appeared this week and was written under a pseudonym, \u201cCalming the Waves.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Apple responded by removing the app \u2014 known as HKmap.life \u2014 from the iPhone store. It had approved the app\u2019s sales just days before but said in a new statement that the company had realized that HKmap.life violated Apple guidelines \u201cand local laws.\u201d\n\u201cWe have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d the statement said.\nApple\u2019s sudden reversal came as the Chinese government ramped up pressure on multinational companies to stay out of the continuing protests in Hong Kong. The cancellation of two N.B.A. broadcasts this week over a pro-Hong Kong tweet by a Houston Rockets executive is part of the campaign.\nApple had already pulled the app for Quartz \u2014 an American news organization that has covered the protests \u2014 from the App Store in China.The company was facing further backlash over HKmap.life, with some internet users demanding a boycott of iPhones.\nAnalysts say the increasingly tough tone of the Chinese media is part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to inflame nationalism at home and intimidate multinational companies into toeing the party line.\nAs China and the United Statesstruggle to reach a trade deal, the war of words also reflects a broader geopolitical struggle.\n\u201cThe psychological cold war has really begun,\u201d said Yik Chan Chin, a lecturer in media and communication studies at the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China.\nMs. Chin said the crisis in Hong Kong, where demonstrations have continued for four months, had energized the state-run media because many mainland Chinese believe the protesters are seeking independence from Beijing.\n\u201cThe whole discourse now is shaped toward supporting China\u2019s position,\u201d she said.\nOn Wednesday, the N.B.A. continued to face criticism for the post on Hong Kong. The Shanghai Sports Federation announced that an N.B.A. fan event scheduled for Wednesday evening had been canceled. The league apologized to Chinese fans, but its leaders have also spoken about the importance of free speech and pursuing principles over profit, drawing a further backlash in China.\nThe scrutiny of Apple began over the weekend, after Chinese news outlets picked up on a Bloomberg report that Apple was allowing the app, HKmap.live, to be downloaded through its App Store. Tens of thousands of internet users took to Weibo, a microblogging site, to express outrage.\nApple had previously rejected HKmap.live from the App Store, saying it allowed people to evade law enforcement, the app\u2019s developer said in a Twitter message, but the company changed course last week.\nApple has previously shown a willingness toblock appsin China at the government\u2019s request. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe app is popular among protesters, who use it to avoid the police and tear gas during tense standoffs that have raged across the city. It is currently the most downloaded travel app in Hong Kong.\nFuror over the app intensified late Tuesday, after People\u2019s Daily published the editorial, which warned of unspecified consequences for Apple.\nChinese commentators often use pseudonyms, and \u201cCalming the Waves\u201d specializes in articles about the Hong Kong crisis with headlines like \u201cBan masks, sterilize and disinfect Hong Kong.\u201d The author, who began publishing about the demonstrations this month, has said that the protesters are \u201cutterly evil\u201d and that Beijing will not compromise with them.\nOn Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs weighed in on Apple\u2019s decision to make the app available.\n\u201cAnyone with a conscience and sense of justice should boycott and object to this instead of supporting and indulging it,\u201d Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said, according to Chinese news reports. Apple\u2019s decision to pull the app soon followed.\nDespite the caustic tone in the news media, some worry that nationalism could get out of hand and hurt China\u2019s global image.\nHu Xijin, editor in chief of Global Times, a state-run tabloid that is one of the Communist Party\u2019s most vocal cheerleaders, said the media would not go too far in criticizing Western companies. In a message sent by Twitter, he vowed not to \u201cnegate a certain American company over all because of one specific incident.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some more radical voices on the Chinese internet,\u201d Mr. Hu said, \u201cbut the formal media will keep a distance from those voices and be more objective and rational.\u201d\nSome free speech advocates expressed concern about the increasingly aggressive tone in the Chinese news media, saying it showed the government\u2019s eagerness to punish foreign companies until they embraced the party\u2019s point of view wholeheartedly.\n\u201cIf you show your willingness to back down and kowtow to the party, the party considers you a pushover,\u201d said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. \u201cThey will increasingly encroach on your bottom line.\u201d\nAlbee Zhang contributed research."
