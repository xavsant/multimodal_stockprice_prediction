        "title": "Justice Department Opens Antitrust Review of Big Tech Companies",
        "fulltext": "The federal government has turned its full investigative powers toward examining the world\u2019s biggest technology companies, building on a backlash against the industry that has been growing for over a year.\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it would start anantitrust reviewinto how internet giants had accumulated market power and whether they had acted to reduce competition. Similar inquiries are underway in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust oversight responsibilities with the Justice Department.\nThe action is the clearest sign yet that the longtime arguments that helped shield the tech giants from antitrust scrutiny are eroding. Since the 1970s,a consensus in antitrust circleshas been that if companies were focused on consumer welfare \u2014 for example, by offering low prices \u2014 they were not likely to attract federal intervention. Since companies likeGoogle and Facebooklargely provide free services, the thinking went, they were not subject to federal antitrust examination.\nBut that approach has evolved,pushed by scholars and others, as concerns about the clout and reach ofGoogle, Facebook, Amazon and Applehave grown. The Justice Department has recently been meeting with tech industry experts to learn what kinds of harm the companies may have caused, said two people with knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the meetings were confidential.\n\u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\u201d Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a statement. \u201cThe department\u2019s antitrust review will explore these important issues.\u201d\nAttorney General William P. Barr himself has plunged into the conversation about tech power. On Tuesday, he said in a speech in Manhattan thattech companies should stop using advanced encryptionand other security measures that effectively turn devices into \u201claw-free zones,\u201d essentially criticizing Apple and its iPhones without naming them.\nIn announcing its review, the Justice Department did not name specific companies, but said it would look into concerns about search, social media and some retail services \u2014 presumably putting Google, Facebook and Amazon on notice.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment beyond its announcement; Google and Facebook also declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple referred to comments made by Timothy D. Cook, its chief executive, in a recent television interview with CBS News.\n\u201cI think we should be scrutinized,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the time. \u201cBut if you look at any kind of measure about \u2018is Apple a monopoly or not,\u2019 I don\u2019t think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple\u2019s a monopoly.\u201d\nThe Justice Department\u2019s review may not lead to full-blown investigations of the companies. But the timing of the announcement ratchets up pressure on the tech giants. Across Washington in recent weeks, lawmakers and regulators have united to raise questions about Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.\nThis month, theF.T.C. voted to fine Facebookabout $5 billion for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, by far the agency\u2019s largest fine against a tech company. An official announcement of a settlement is expected as soon as Wednesday.\nLast week, Facebook faced lawmakers over two days ofgrilling for a new cryptocurrency initiativecalled Libra. Google was at the center of a Senate subcommittee hearing about censorship in search. And at aseparate House hearing, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat of Rhode Island who leads a subcommittee on antitrust law, said that the government stance for too long was to celebrate the new tech economy rather than scrutinize its corporate leaders.\n\u201cCongress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cAs a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cicilline sent letters to three of the companies at last week\u2019s hearing \u2014 Google, Facebook and Amazon. He said he was seeking answers to questions that the witnesses were asked but did not directly answer. Mr. Cicilline characterized those earlier replies as \u201cevasive, incomplete or misleading.\u201d\nThe Justice Department has stepped up its consideration of tech companies since May, said one person with knowledge of the discussions. Around then, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. split up potential antitrust investigations into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, this person said.\nThe review announced on Tuesday is a separate and next step beyond those moves with the F.T.C., this person added. In recent weeks, antitrust and tech policy experts have more frequently visited the Justice Department as it sought to understand harms the tech companies may have created. It has not yet settled on a theory of harm, this person said. In announcing its review, the Justice Department said it would look into whether the internet companies were \u201charming consumers.\u201d\nSam Weinstein, a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said the announcement was unusual because the agency tends to keep its work, usually investigations, under wraps.\nMr. Weinstein, a professor at Cardozo Law School, said the Justice Department could be signaling it wants to respond to concerns about the growing power of tech giants and to let their competitors know that the door is open for complaints.\n\u201cThere is a lot of criticism of the agencies that they are not doing enough about big tech and this is a way to respond to that criticism,\u201d he said.\nWhile the major American tech companies have largely avoided antitrust scrutiny at home, they have been investigated more aggressively around the world, especially in Europe.\nIn March,European authorities fined Google1.5 billion euros \u2014 about $1.7 billion \u2014 for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. The regulators said Google had violated antitrust rules by imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe. The fine was the third against Google by the European Union since 2017.\nThe United States, by contrast, had been seen as a lesser force in antitrust enforcement recently, with the Justice Department and F.T.C. moving more cautiously.\n\u201cIf the United States does not step up, competition policy will be set elsewhere,\u201d said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the F.T.C."

        "fulltext": "Good Wednesday. The Elon Musk-backed company Neuralink unveiled its plans to wire your brain to the internet last night \u2014 more on that below. (Want this by email?Sign up here.)\nLawmakers took shots at tech giants yesterday during three hearings on Capitol Hill. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google faced questions about their market power, perceived bias as gatekeepers of communication and, in Facebook\u2019s case, plans to reshape the financial industry.\nPerhaps the most revealinghearingwas before the House Judiciary Committee, where a subcommittee on antitrust gave the best look yet at how lawmakers are thinking about capping Big Tech\u2019s market power,Steve Lohr, Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper of the NYT write. Most of the questions were for Amazon and Facebook.\n\u2022 Representative David Cicilline, the Democratic head of the subcommittee, pushed them on whether tech companies\u2019 marketplaces \u2014 for goods, software apps and online ads \u2014 give them an unfair advantage over rivals who rely on those marketplaces to distribute their own products or services.\n\u2022 Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, zeroed in on their M.&A. He pointed out that Facebook owns four of the world\u2019s six largest social networks (itself, along with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp). \u201cWe have a word for that,\u201d Mr. Neguse said. \u201cIt is called monopoly.\u201d\n\u201cThe hearing performances were a telling moment, showing the rising force of the backlash against the tech giants,\u201d Mr. Lohr, Mr. Isaac and Mr. Popper write. \u201cNot long ago revered as treasures of American capitalism, they are now targets of political attacks from both parties, growing public criticism and regulatory scrutiny.\u201d\nMore:Google said it hadofficially scrapped its China search engine project, code-named Dragonfly. And the E.U. is reportedly set tobegin a formal antitrust investigationinto Amazon\u2019s dual role as seller and market platform.\nLawmakers made one thing clear at a Senate Banking Committee hearing yesterday: The largest roadblock to Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans is the company\u2019s reputation,Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper of the NYT write.\nThe hearing began with astinging critiqueby Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio:\n\u201cLike a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience. We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people\u2019s bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don\u2019t understand, like monetary policy.\u201d\nThings didn\u2019t get much betteras David Marcus, who leads Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency initiative, was questioned for more than two hours. Lawmakers brought up many of Facebook\u2019s missteps \u2014 including data privacy and Russian interference \u2014 to highlight concerns about the company\u2019s entry into finance.\nLibra critics are now lining up.In the last week alone, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Trump and the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, have all raised concerns about the project.\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Marcus struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been working, and are working hard to get better.\u201d\n\u2022 But when asked by Mr. Brown whether lawmakers could persuade Facebook to scrap Libra, Mr. Marcus said only that the company wouldn\u2019t move ahead until regulators\u2019 concerns were addressed.\nLibra faces another grilling todayas Facebook officials appear before the House Financial Services Committeeat 10 a.m. Eastern.\nMore:Facebook is said to have briefed government agencies on its Libra plans last month, but the meeting reportedlyonly amplified concernsthat the company wasn\u2019t more prepared to address major issues.\nPresident Trump has repeatedly and publicly tried to jawbone the Fed into lowering interest rates. But he may have found a better way to make that happen, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT writes:his own policies.\nIt\u2019s an odd time for the Fed to cut rates,givensigns of strength in the U.S. economy. Retail sales in June were strong, and manufacturing activity has picked up.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s trade wars have undermined the global economy, which is now struggling with China\u2019s slowdown and a drop-off in manufacturing.\nEconomic uncertainties \u201chave increased,\u201despecially around trade, Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, said at a conference in Paris yesterday. He said the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d\nSo that, rather than Mr. Trump\u2019s badgering, could force the Fed\u2019s handto cut rates, Ms. Smialek writes. Investors certainly seem to think the central bank will act that way, if pricing in federal funds futures markets is anything to go by. (The central bank\u2019s pre-meeting quiet period starts Saturday, so its chances to change that perception are increasingly limited.)\nMany of Wall Street\u2019s top banks have reported their second-quarter results this week, and the news has been largely positive. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned so far.\nTrading is mostly in a funk.BothCitigroupandJPMorgan Chasereported disappointing trading revenue, reflecting a prolonged slump in what had been Wall Street\u2019s most profitable business. The exception so far:Goldman Sachs.\nBanks are concerned about falling interest rates.JPMorgancut its forecast for net interest incomefor the rest of the year, briefly sending its shares lower despite beating analysts\u2019 overall profit expectations. And Wells Fargo said that lower rates wouldaffect its bottom line.\nConsumers are big business.JPMorgan touted its consumer-lending business, which reported a 22 percent increase in profits from the same time last year. And Goldman remains focused on building out projects like its Marcus banking unit and its Apple Card initiative, despitespending $1.3 billionon them so far.\nWe\u2019ll find out morewhen Bank of America reports today and Morgan Stanley tomorrow morning.\nNeuralink, a neuroscience company in which Mr. Musk has invested $100 million, officially unveiled its big product last night: a device that one day could connect your brain directly to the internet,John Markoff of the NYT writes.\n\u2022 \u201cNeuralink described a sewing-machine-like robot that can implant ultrathin threads deep into the brain.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe company showed a system connected to a laboratory rat reading information from 1,500 electrodes \u2014 15 times better than current systems embedded in humans. That\u2019s enough for scientific research or medical applications.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe company is hoping to begin working with human subjects as soon as the second quarter of next year.\u201d\n\u2022 The company said it could \u201chelp humans with an array of ailments, like helping amputees regain mobility or helping people hear, speak and see.\u201d\nOne of Neuralink\u2019s biggest challengeswill be living up to Mr. Musk\u2019s grand vision. \u201cIndependent scientists cautioned that results from laboratory animals might not translate into human success and that human trials would be required to determine the technology\u2019s promise,\u201d Mr. Markoff notes.\nWinston-Salem, N.C., has ambitions to become a center of biotech research. But so far that dream hasn\u2019t been realized \u2014 and it raises questions about whether midsize cities canever grow into thriving metropolises, Eduardo Porter of the NYT writes.\nThe post-World War II model is broken.Before, smaller cities were able to catch up by becoming manufacturing centers. But in the age of tech, it\u2019s harder to keep up with Silicon Valley and New York.\nBlame a variety of factors.Today\u2019s economy doesn\u2019t really value the kind of cheaper labor that such cities traditionally boasted of. Employers are instead setting up in centers with highly educated workers, and that kick-starts a virtuous circle of more amenities and funding, and then more workers. It\u2019s harder for midsize cities to compete.\nWinston-Salem\u2019s failed bid for Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a case studyof how that looks in practice. \u201cIf you go down the Amazon checklist, it requires all the things that we don\u2019t have,\u201d Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University, which is in Winston-Salem, told Mr. Porter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have mass transit. No Amtrak. No good airports. It\u2019s not a walkable city. It doesn\u2019t have great amenities.\u201d\nKim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader, has some serious wheels: top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benzes and Rolls Royces. That\u2019s just one sign that, despite the odds, North Korea has found a way to evade U.N. sanctions meant to block access to luxury goods,Ed Wong and Christoph Koettl of the NYT report.\n\u2022 \u201cHigh-end Western goods are making their way to North Korea\u2019s elite through a complex system of port transfers, secret high-seas shipping and shadowy front companies, according to research by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies,\u201d they write.\n\u2022 \u201cFrom 2015 to 2017, as many as 90 countries served as the sources of luxury goods for North Koreans,\u201d including China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.\n\u2022 A pair of Mercedeses took a long journey to Pyongyang: from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to China, Japan and South Korea \u2014 and then a mysterious stretch where the ship carrying them went off the grid.

        "title": "Trump Escalates Feud With Apple and Threatens Tariffs on France",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Friday that his administration would denya request by the electronics giant Appleto avoid stiff tariffs the United States had placed on Chinese imports and threatened to hit France with heavy tariffs in response to a new digital tax that will affect American tech companies.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments underscore the extent to which the president is wielding tariffs to punish not only trading partners, but also American companies that manufacture products overseas. Mr. Trump has increasingly used tariffs to extract concessions over a range of issues, including those unrelated to traditional trade practices. In June, hethreatened to tax all Mexican importsto resolve an immigration dispute.\nMr. Trump tweeted on Friday morning that Apple \u201cwill not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China\u201d and that the company should \u201cMake them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\nApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\nMr. Trump has placed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, including semiconductors, televisions and ball bearings. While the president insists the tariffs are being paid by China, American companies \u2014 which import both finished products and materials from China \u2014 are facing increased costs as a result of the trade war.\nTo help cushion the blow, the administration established a process that allows companies to apply for an exemption from the tariffs. Companies must demonstrate that the import cannot be obtained domestically. Some of those requests have been approved and administration officials have insisted the process is apolitical.\nApple products, which are largely assembled in China, have so far mostly evaded tariffs. Last year, the Trump administration told Apple\u2019s chief, Tim Cook, that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, according to a person familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting negotiations. It is unclear if the president\u2019s thinking has changed.\nLast week, Apple filed 15 requests with the United States trade representative to exclude certain products it imports from China from the tariffs. The requests covered a variety of imported components, like power cables and circuit boards, used in the Mac Pro desktop, a high-end computer that sells for around $6,000. In the requests, the company asserts it cannot acquire the products in the United States or other countries outside China.\n\u201cThere are no other sources for this proprietary Apple-designed component,\u201d the company wrote.\nBut Mr. Trump has shown little sympathy for American companies that insist they must manufacture or obtain their products abroad. He has blasted companies like Harley-Davidson that have shifted some production outside the United States and suggested that he will use tariffs on trading partners to force more manufacturing back to the United States. Last year, Mr. Trump placed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Japan, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, saying that would lead to a resurgence of American metal manufacturing.\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump threatened to punish France with tariffs, including taxing French wine, as retaliation fora new digital taxthat President Emmanuel Macron of France signed into law on Thursday. That provision falls heavily on American technology firms like Facebook, Google and Amazon.\n\u201cFrance just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies,\u201dthe president wrote on Twitter. \u201cIf anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA.\u201d\n\u201cWe will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron\u2019s foolishness shortly,\u201d the president added. \u201cI\u2019ve always said American wine is better than French wine!\u201d\nSpeaking at the White House later, Mr. Trump expanded on that threat, calling France\u2019s tax \u201cwrong\u201d and saying his administration was working on a possible wine tax.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked American wines better than French wines. Even though I don\u2019t drink wine. I just like the way they look,\u201d he told reporters.\nThe Trump administrationannouncedthis monththat it had started an investigation into whether the French measure, which places a 3 percent tax on the revenue some companies earn from providing digital services to French users, amounts to an unfair trade practice.\nIf the administration determines that the tax is an unfair trade practice, it would have the go-ahead under American trade rules to slap retaliatory tariffs on France, though France could always challenge such a step at the World Trade Organization.\nIn a statement on Friday, a White House spokesman said that the United States was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by France\u2019s decision to adopt the tax.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has consistently stated that it will not sit idly by and tolerate discrimination against U.S.-based firms,\u201d Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.\nIf the president taxes French wine, he may face accusations of a conflict of interest. The president\u2019s son Eric Trump oversees the Trump Winery outside Charlottesville, Va., and business entities associated with the winerywere included in Mr. Trump\u2019s 2015 financial disclosure form.\nMr. Trump\u2019s declaration that Apple\u2019s exemption request would be denied also runs afoul of the United States trade representative\u2019s posted rules for exclusions from the Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports.\nGuidelines published by the agencysay the trade representative \u201cwill evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the asserted rationale for the exclusion, whether the exclusion would undermine the objective of the Section 301 investigation and whether the request defines the product with sufficient precision.\u201d They allow 14 days after a request is posted online for anyone to submit comments in support or opposition of the request, and then give the original requester another seven days to respond.\nApple\u2019s requests were posted last Thursday.\nAgency officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nApple declined to comment. In the past, the company has called itself \u201can engine of economic growth in the United States.\u201d Last year, it spent $60 billion with 9,000 American suppliers, helping support 450,000 jobs.\nIn the 1980s, Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, wanted tomake Apple computers in the United States. He was fascinated with manufacturing trailblazers like Ford and Sony, and wanted to pave new ground for American manufacturing with a California factory that churned out the new Macintosh computer. Apple built the state-of-the-art plant in 1983.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t great for business,\u201d said Randy Battat, a former Apple engineer. The factory closed in 1992, in part because sales of the Mac computer never met the company\u2019s expectations.\nApple later discovered that outsourcing its manufacturers would be far cheaper and faster and provide it with more flexibility when sales fluctuated. Mr. Cook, Mr. Jobs\u2019s deputy, helpedbuild the company\u2019s sophisticated global supply chain, which sources parts from around the world, including the United States, mostly for final assembly in China. The innovation was one of the keys to Apple\u2019s enormous growth, and it helped elevate Mr. Cook to succeed Mr. Jobs as the company\u2019s chief executive.\nBut Apple\u2019s dependence on China has, at times, caused problems. It has drawn scrutiny of Apple\u2019suse of low-wage laborand elicited criticism from some customers and politicians.\nSo in 2012, Mr. Cook announced on prime-time television that Apple would make a Mac computer in the United States \u2014 the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers. The $3,000 Mac Pro would come with an unusual inscription: \u201cAssembled in U.S.A.\u201d\nBut manufacturing the Mac Pro near Austin, Tex.,quickly turned out to be a headache. Former employees who worked on the project said the plant was understaffed and materials were regularly out of place. Most important, the team struggled to get the parts they needed on time, such as tiny screws. While China has a huge manufacturing infrastructure that can produce enormous quantities of parts overnight, the Mac Pro team was relying on a 20-employee machine shop in Lockhart, Tex., that could produce at most 1,000 screws a day. The computer was delayed and the screws eventually came from China.\nLast month, news broke that Apple wouldmanufacture its new Mac Pro in China.\nThe president has long pushed Apple to make more of its products domestically. He and Mr. Cook met at the White House in March, in a meeting in whichMr. Trump famously called Mr. Cook \u201cTim Apple\u201das television cameras rolled."
