        "fulltext": "Want this delivered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.\nThat is the question at the heart of today\u2019s congressional grilling \u2014 er, hearing \u2014 with the C.E.O.s of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The virtual testimony on \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power\u201d kicks off at noon Eastern and is expected to run for at least five hours. The Times\u2019s tech team is covering the proceedings starting at 10 a.m. alongside video from the eventon our homepage.\nWhat\u2019s at stake.All of the companies are facing antitrust investigations, and bashing Big Tech has become a rare bipartisan pastime. But the C.E.O.s, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google, will argue that their companies \u2014 whose combined market cap approaches $5 trillion \u2014 aren\u2019t actually that powerful. The Timesexplains the thinkingbehind the strategy each executive is likely to employ under questioning.\n\u2022 The executives\u2019 opening statements are now posted onthe House Judiciary Committee\u2019s site. \u201cOur scale allows us to make a meaningful impact on important societal issues,\u201d Mr. Bezos will say, a point made by the others, too.\nWe have questions.The C.E.O.s will be defensive about their own companies\u2019 power (or, as they see it, lack of it). But they may not be as guarded about each others\u2019 businesses. If we could, we\u2019d ask the executives questions about the others on the panel. Their answers could be revealing.\n\u2022To Mr. Bezos:For years, users of the iOS Kindle app have been forced to buy e-books using a web browser because Amazon has refused to pay Apple the 30 percent cut it takes on all in-app payments. Do you believe that policy is an abuse of Apple\u2019s market power?\n\u2022To Mr. Cook:If Alphabet did not pay to make Google the default search engine on Apple devices, which search engine would you make your default? If Google is indeed the best search engine, regardless of the fee, do you believe its success relies on stifling competition?\n\u2022To Mr. Pichai:Amazon refuses to sell your Google Home and Nest products because they compete with its own Echo line of devices. Do you think Amazon has gainedits huge shareof the U.S. smart speakers fairly? Separately, your social network, Google+, failed. Do you think that was because of Facebook\u2019s dominance of the space?\n\u2022To Mr. Zuckerberg:None of your competitors own the kind of supervoting shares in their companies that you hold in Facebook. Are they less successful because of it? If not, why should you wield that level of power?\nThe Times editorial boardandStratechery\u2019s Ben Thompsonalso have great questions they\u2019d like to see answered. (And we\u2019ll be watching for other important details, like hidden messages in background bookcases, how skilled the execs are at using the mute button and any signs that they\u2019re wearing shorts under their suit jackets just out of view.)\nJoe Biden makes racial justice a core economic policy.The Democratic presidential candidateproposed$150 billion in financial support for minority-owned small businesses, a requirement that the Fed report regularly on racial economic gaps and other measures to address systemic racism in the nation\u2019s economy.\nMacKenzie Scotthas given nearly $2 billion to charities.Ms. Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of $60 billion, detailed ina Medium posthow she has allocated her donations, including $586 million to racial justice organizations.\nUniversal and AMC struck a landmark deal on movie release dates.Universal now can release films for premium video-on-demandjust 17 daysafter they run in AMC movie theaters, instead of the usual 90-day window. The pact could fundamentally change how Hollywood works.\nStreaming services dominated Emmy nominations.Netflixbroke HBO\u2019s recordfor the most nominations, with 160, the latest sign of its march toward media dominance. The Times\u2019s Ed Lee hasa good breakdownof the nominations by parent company. (Even the beleaguered Quibi collected 10 nominations.)\nThe Miami Marlins have thrownM.L.B. into chaos.After at least 17 of its members tested positive for the coronavirus, the teamsuspended playuntil at least Monday. That disrupts the schedules for the other teams in its division, leading Brian Cashman, the New York Yankees\u2019 general manager, to muse that the 2020 season may not be completed.\nMany big retailers have announced rules that customers must wear masks when shopping, asmeticulously trackedby The Times\u2019s Gillian Friedman. But however explicitly a company\u2019s policy is worded, enforcement is another issue. In an eye-opening story out today, The Times\u2019s Michael Corkery found that major companies are taking adecidedly hands-off approach.\nIt\u2019s often up to rank-and-file employees to enforce mask policies, and they didn\u2019t sign up for this. Chains like Walgreens and Walmart say that employees shouldn\u2019t bar maskless customers from entering a store or refuse them service once inside. This muddles the \u201cmandatory\u201d mask-wearing edict, creating opportunities for confusion and confrontation.\n\u2022 It\u2019s akin to Walmart\u2019s policy on bringing guns into its stores: discouraged, but not enforced. Those two policies are colliding, with an 18-year-old Walmart \u201chealth ambassador,\u201d who asks customers to put on masks before entering a store in North Carolina, telling Michael that he has noticed more customers carrying guns into the store, giving him extra pause about telling them to put on a mask.\nNo exceptions?Workers and unions say that companies need to take a stricter stance on masks, either by hiring security guards to refuse entry to unmasked shoppers or insisting that employees refuse service to those not wearing masks and summon a manager to deal with the situation.\n\u2022 Retailers, then, may end up following the airline industry, which has beenmaking mask rules stricterand leaving less room for interpretation. Southwest now says that only children under the age of 2 are allowed not to wear masks. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re doing this is we\u2019re simply seeing too many exceptions to the policy and this put our flight crews in a really tough spot,\u201d said Thomas Nealon, the airline\u2019s president.\nSteven Davidoff Solomon, a.k.a. the Deal Professor, is a professor at the U.C. Berkeley School of Law and the faculty co-director at the Berkeley Center for Law, Business and the Economy. Here, he runs down the reasons \u201cblank check\u201d companies are making a comeback.\nSpecial purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, arehaving a moment. They have raised around $19 billion so far this year, already more than in any full year in the past, according to SPAC Analytics.\nA SPAC, also known as a blank check company, is a firm that goes public with a singular mission: to acquire an unspecified company at some point in the future. DraftKings, Nikola and Fisker are three recent SPAC takeovers, while Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square just raised $4 billion for a SPAC that he pitches as a unicorn hunter.\nThe SPAC\u2019s return has revived all the old critiques,some of which I have aired here before. In short, they\u2019re expensive, have high rates of failure andgenerate low returns. They also tend to attract nontraditional players. In 2007, SPAC\u2019s previous heyday, the former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz was involved in a $430 million SPAC that lost most of its money on a Chinese bottled-water venture. Yesterday, Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics and \u201cMoneyball\u201d fame,launched a $500 million SPACwith RedBird Capital Partners to buy a company in the sports industry.\nSPACs are back \u2014 or put another way, they refuse to die \u2014 for three reasons.\nFirst, they come with a money-back guarantee. They typically have two years to make an acquisition or liquidate. And if a SPAC\u2019s shareholders agree to buy a company, they have the right to redeem their shares at the I.P.O. price plus interest, and get out before the vehicle merges with its takeover target. Hedge funds love this, because they can almost always get their money back.\nSecond, despite some iffy returns, SPACs help smaller and riskier \u2014 but potentially rewarding \u2014 companies go public. It is a useful function, since many of these wouldn\u2019t otherwise get the attention of I.P.O. underwriters, but it comes at a high cost. (That said, Mr. Ackman\u2019s vehicle eliminates a traditional 20 percent cut reserved for SPAC sponsors.)\nThe final reason is obvious. Market speculation is rife these days, and SPACs are the epitome of a risky gamble. In a manic market awash with day traders, SPACs are a no-brainer for Wall Streeters looking to sop up excess cash.\nSpend some quality time with us and our colleagues, on three conference calls featuring special guests and topics of interest to DealBook readers.\n\u202211 a.m. Eastern: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Place in a Pandemic World\u201d\nA DealBook Debrief call with the foreign affairs columnistThomas Friedman, taking a closer look at the geopolitics of the pandemic.

        "title": "Congress Doesn\u2019t Get Big Tech. By Design.",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nI\u2019ll make an easy prediction aboutWednesday\u2019s congressional hearinginto the power of big tech companies: Members of Congress will say dumb things.\nBut please don\u2019t believe that these people are too old or too clueless to exercise effective oversight of tech superpowers.\nThis idea, which is prevalent inside of tech companies, lets thetechgiants off the hook for what they do. It shows a smug superiority that is not a good look. And it ignores that tech companies are built around software that is designed not to be understood by outsiders.\n(Follow The Times\u2019s live coverage of the hearing.)\nAfter Mark Zuckerberg\u2019sfirst turns in the congressional hot seattwo years ago, people inside of Facebook thought thattheir boss had completely dominated those old fogies. I\u2019ve heard this from Facebook executives. Their conclusions have worried me.\nMembers of Congress were fairly blamed for not understanding Facebook, but Zuckerberg didn\u2019t get enough blame for failing to make Facebook understood. Hedodged,occasionally misledand essentiallytried to say as little as possibleabout how Facebook works. At points, he didn\u2019t seem to know how Facebook worked, either.\nExecutives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple ata hearing last yearlikewise seemed to intentionally deflect or dismiss what were generally excellent questions from lawmakers. (Seriously, I could have stared at C-SPAN for many more hours.) No one inside the big tech companies should have felt like they \u201cwon.\u201d\nTo be fair, that is part of the theatrics of all congressional hearings. Members of Congress grandstand and witnesses generally try to be inoffensive or run out the clock.\nYet it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to complete this set of hearingsand effectively address these central questions:Are these big technology companies cheating to get a leg up over competitors? If so, does that hurt all of us and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 should the government do about it?\nIf members of Congress are confused about how to ask and answer these questions, that\u2019s partly because big tech companiesareconfusing.\nFew people on the outside can truly understand how Amazon influences the prices of products we buy on its site orat other retailers; assess fears that Googlefunnels people to its own websitesor that Applesteers people to its own apps; or peer into Facebook\u2019sstrategy to squash rivals in their cribs. All of this is, by design, shrouded in secrecy and mystery.\nEven many of the big tech companies now say that there needs to be more federal oversight and rules regarding areas like protecting elections and what constitutes appropriate speech online.\nThat means everyone \u2014 the tech companies, lawmakers and you and me \u2014 have a vested interest in getting under the hood of these big companies and seeing how they work.\nThis is a worthy goal \u2014 just as it was to assess the big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Those banks also thought Congress was too clueless to question them effectively. Maybe so, butregulation came anyway.\nWhat questions do you have about the hearing and the power of big tech? Send them to ontech@nytimes.com, and Shira will answer a selection in an upcoming newsletter. Please include your full name and location.\nMe again, taking another moment to talk about Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 Sorry! Not sorry! \u2014 to explain what it is NOT about.\nHow big the tech companies are compared with the planet Jupiter:In hisprepared testimonyfor Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos cited competition from the grocery delivery service Instacart and mentioned the fast sales growth of Walmart\u2019s online shopping operation.\nSure, but online sales at those companies are a minuscule fraction of Amazon\u2019s. There will be a lot of slicing and dicing of data for misdirection like this. Please ignore.\nThe assessment of tech company power is not solely about their size or that of rivals. It is also about theirbehavior: Do big tech companies tilt the game to their advantage in a way that creates less competition?\nWhether these sites show political bias:We\u2019ll hear a lot about this today, because some conservatives and Republican politicians argue that big tech companies habituallysquash informationreflecting conservative perspectives.\nThere\u2019s little credible reporting to support this, but a root cause of the concern is what I mentioned above: Outsiders can\u2019t see or assess the software that determines what information we see online. Black boxes naturally create suspicion.\nHow tech companies influence what information we\u2019re exposed to, and how they fairly police what people say online, are complicated topics worthy of debate. However, I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a direct connection between those topics and the central question at Wednesday\u2019s hearing: Do big tech companies cheat to win?\nHow many American jobs they create:Ina letter to Congress, Google\u2019s chief executive touted a (delicious sounding) brownie shop in New York that drums up business from buying ads on Google. Bezostalked upAmazon training programs to pay for warehouse workers to move into higher-paying careers.\nThis is great! We want American companies to create jobs and contribute to economic growth. But companies that create jobs and support small businesses can still break the law by unfairly exercising their power and influence.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nHow to support alternatives to Big Tech:My colleague Brian X. Chen tells us how we canhelp tech\u2019s little guysif we\u2019re concerned about having choices. Brian suggests trying the search engine DuckDuckGo, the social network Mastodon and other alternatives to Big Tech products; advises us to buy used electronics to help repair shops and resellers; and asks us to consider paying for software we like from smaller companies rather than taking freebies from the tech giants.\nThat coronavirus video was tailored to go wild:My colleagues Sheera Frenkel and Davey Alba walked throughthe stagecraft of a viral videothat promoted an unproven coronavirus treatment as a miracle cure. With ingredients including an official-looking setting, people in white medical coats and the ability to clip the video and share it on social media easily, the video had been designed to appeal to those who don\u2019t trust public health officials and want quick fixes to get past the pandemic.\nCan facial recognition technology be effective, unbiased and do more good than harm?Those are questions raised bythis Reuters investigationinto the use of the technology at 200 Rite Aid drugstores in the United States.\nFacial recognition systems that were intended partly to notify store workers about potential shoplifters were more likely to be installed at stores in neighborhoods with a large share of lower-income or Black or Latino residents, and shoppers were not generally told that their images were being captured and analyzed. At times the facial recognition software also misidentified people. Rite Aid told Reuters it had suspended use of the cameras.\nThisdancing duet of a woman and catis just plain weird.

        "title": "How to Fight Against Big Tech\u2019s Power",
        "fulltext": "In the morning, you check email. At noon, you browse social media and message friends. In the evening, you listen to music while shopping online. Around bedtime, you curl up with an e-book.\nFor all of those activities, you probably used a product made or sold by Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook. There\u2019s no simple way to avoid those Big Four. Even if you subscribed to Spotify, you would probably still be using a Google Android phone, an Amazon speaker or an Apple iPhone to stream the music. Even if you deleted Facebook, you might still be using the Facebook-owned Instagram or WhatsApp.\nBeing beholden to a small set of companies that touch every corner of our digital lives is precisely why lawmakers have summoned the chief executives ofAmazon, Google, Facebook and Apple to testify in an antitrust hearingon Wednesday. Expect the tech titans to be grilled over whether their companies have become so powerful and far-reaching that they harm rivals and all of us, too.\nSo what can we do if we want to break out of the stranglehold of Big Tech?\nAt first glance, there may not seem like much we can do to escape. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can start shopping at local bookstores and put Amazon out of business,\u201d said Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, a Chicago-based company that offers productivity apps.\nBut the more I thought about this, the more I realized that there were some steps that we could take to better support tech\u2019s little guys, too. We would do ourselves and smaller businesses a favor by staying informed on alternatives, for one. We could change our consumption patterns so that we were not just buying new products from the tech giants. And we could show our support for indie developers who make the apps we love.\nAs Mr. Fried put it, \u201cWe can do things to change our own conscience.\u201d Here\u2019s how.\nStep One to becoming a more conscientious consumer is doing some research.\nWhile Google Chrome may be the most popular web browser, there are alternatives that collect less data about us. And while all of our friends are on Facebook, there are also smaller apps or methods we can use to stay connected with them. The key is to read news sites and tech blogs to learn about options.\n\u201cYou have to read and be informed,\u201d said Don Heider, chief executive of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re not going to have a clue of where to go and what to pick and what the impact is.\u201d\nMr. Heider pointed to a few examples: Instead of Google Chrome, people can download great browsers, includingDuckDuckGo,BraveandOpera, which focus on stronger privacy and security protections. Instead of Facebook, we can tell our friends to hang out with us on social media apps likeVeroandMastodon, which are both ad-free, he said.\nThe same goes for Amazon. Instead of ordering paper towels and hand sanitizer on Amazon, consider picking up those items at a local store. Instead of ordering a new dog collar on Amazon, consider buying a custom-made one from an independent merchant on Etsy.\nMr. Fried says he rarely shops on Amazon, takes cabs instead of Ubers and finds books viaIndieBound, a resource for buying titles from local bookstores. \u201cWhen the default is just Amazon, Amazon, Amazon, you\u2019re just feeding the flame,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking of alternatives, there\u2019s a different way to buy tech hardware altogether: Purchase gadgets used or refurbished.\nWhen you buy a new phone or computer, your dollars go directly to the tech giants who created the products. But when you buy used, you are supporting a broader community of small businesses that repair and resell equipment.\nMany of us generally shy away from used electronics because we fear the products may be in shoddy condition. The reality is that resellers work with technicians who restore products to their former glory before putting them up on sale \u2014 and the gadgets are often backed by a warranty.Reputable vendors of used goodsinclude GameStop and Gazelle.\nBuying used also contributes to a broader mission: the so-calledright to repair movement.\nUnlike car mechanics, small electronics repair shops have limited access to the parts and instructions that they need to service our smartphones, tablets and computers. Public advocacy groups and the repair community havepushed to pass legislationthat would require electronics manufacturers to share all of the components and information needed to fix our gadgets.\nIf more people opt to buy used or refurbished goods, that will show that there is demand for repaired products. That, in turn, puts pressure on manufacturers to make repair more accessible to independent technicians and consumers, said Carole Mars, the director of technical development and innovation at theSustainability Consortium, which studies the sustainability of consumer goods.\n\u201cIt comes down to accepting refurbished and demanding refurbished,\u201d Dr. Mars said. \u201cThat will lead you to ask, \u2018Why can\u2019t I get this product used or fixed?\u2019 It\u2019s because the company locked it down.\u201d\nSo try to make this a habit: Whenever you are shopping for an electronic online, check if there is a used or refurbished option. If there is one in good condition, go for it and save some bucks.\nA lot of what we do with our devices is made possible by smaller companies that produce our apps and games. One way to show our support to David rather than Goliath is to have some patience and empathy for the indie developers.\nPeople often get frustrated when an app or game they love gets a big software update and charges another $3 to $10 for the new version, for example. Try not to get irritated \u2014 these are small outfits trying to survive, not big corporations trying to milk you \u2014 and be willing to pay. It\u2019s the same amount of money as a cup of coffee or a sandwich, and you\u2019re polishing a piece of software that you love.\n\u201cIf you can pay for software that you like,\u201d said Brianna Wu, a game developer, \u201cyou probably have an ethical responsibility to do so in the same way that you\u2019d have the ethical responsibility to tip a waitress. The reality is that most of the time when you play an indie video game, that group of people have bet their entire company\u2019s future on you paying for it.\u201d\nKeep in mind also that small app developers lack the huge marketing budgets of our tech overlords. They rely largely on all of us to do grass-roots marketing in the form of written reviews or word of mouth, said David Barnard, founder of the app studio Contrast. So when you love an app, tell your friends about it.\nI\u2019ll close with an example: My favorite piece of indie software for the Mac is Fantastical, a calendar app, which does a better, more reliable job organizing my online calendars than Apple\u2019s calendar app.\nIt was an expensive calendar app \u2014 $50 \u2014 but it\u2019s kept me punctual, which makes it worth every penny."

        "title": "Your Trusty Maps App Can Help You Navigate the Pandemic",
        "fulltext": "If your town is partly closed or you\u2019re wary of travel during the Covid-19 pandemic, it might feel as if your phone\u2019s map app is just sitting there gathering digital dust. But even if you\u2019re not tappingApple\u2019s MapsorGoogle Mapsto explore an exotic vacation spot or to belt out turn-by-turn directions on a long road trip this summer, your interactive travel aid can be useful. Here are a few things you can do.\nMajor American cities have been in varying stages of closure for months, and it may be hard to remember which businesses are open. While a local government\u2019s website should have general guidelines posted, both the iOS Maps app from Apple and Google Maps (forAndroidandiOS) have been updating their map labels and listings pages for specific businesses to note adjusted hours, any curbside pickup service and temporary closures.\nBut what if you find outdated details? In Apple\u2019s Maps app, tap the name of the business on the map and, when its information page opens, scroll down and tap Report an Issue; you canreport other cartographic issuesby tapping the encircled \u201ci\u201d in the top-right corner of the map itself. In Google Maps, select a business and scroll down on its information page to the\u201cSuggest an edit\u201doption.\nMany dining establishments have struggled during the pandemic, as some have stayed open with reduced service while others have been forced to close. Apple\u2019s Maps app often notes temporary or permanent closures and operating hours on its Yelp-assisted restaurant listings pages. As part of itsCovid-19 updates, Google now adds a line on a restaurant\u2019s info page that lists the status of dine-in, takeout and delivery service.\nLike Google Maps, Apple\u2019s Maps includes the restaurant\u2019s phone number and website for details straight from the source. Use this contact information to confirm current delivery and takeout services \u2014 along with any outdoor-dining options.\nState and local health departments managetesting, but if you havecoronavirus symptomsor your medical provider advises you toget tested, find a facility. Apple and Google now include the locations of Covid-19 testing sites in their maps apps using data gleaned from government agencies, public-health departments and health care institutions.\nTo see places where you can potentially be tested, enter a variation of \u201cCovid-19 testing\u201d into the search box in the maps app. When you select a facility from the resulting list, it should show any additional requirements for getting a test there, like an appointment or a doctor\u2019s referral.\nIf you need to leave home for work, errands or other reasons and don\u2019t drive, both maps apps provide information on the current status of local public-transit service. But if your destination is walkable, going by foot offers exercise and a change of scenery \u2014 just tap the icon for walking directions.\nA quick search in either maps app for \u201cparks near me\u201d can lead you to local greenery; maps for larger parks often include footpaths and attractions within the park.\nFor cyclists, Google Maps displays thetypes of bicycle trailsavailable on a route (like dedicated traffic lanes or off-road dirt paths), along with landscape and terrain details when selected in the Layers menu. Apple\u2019siOS 14 software, coming this year, will enhance its Maps app features with routes showing things like bicycle lanes, bike-friendly roads, elevation and traffic information.\nPreventing the spread of the virus may discourage many people from taking trips this summer. But if you still want to explore new places, you can do a bit of virtual travel right in your maps app.\nFor example, when you search for a major city or landmark in Apple\u2019s Maps app, look for theFlyoverbutton or 3-D icon on the information page, and tap it to take an aerial tour. You can also do a street-level exploration of major cities by tapping the binoculars icon and using the app\u2019sLook Aroundfeature.\nFor years, Google Maps has included a similarStreet Viewfeature that shows panoramic photos of a location as if you were standing there.

        "fulltext": "Join us today for our DealBook Debrief call with The Times\u2019s foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman, who will discuss \u201cAmerica\u2019s Place in a Pandemic World.\u201d The struggle to contain the coronavirus is upending U.S. relationships with allies and emboldening adversaries. What happens next?R.S.V.P. hereto find out at 11 a.m. Eastern. (Want this delievered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.)\nFor more than five hours yesterday, U.S. lawmakers grilled Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg overthe power that their companies commandand the potential for abusing that power. Talk aboutZoom fatigue. (Or, technically, Cisco Webex fatigue.)\nThe chairman of the antitrust subcommittee set the tone early.Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, called Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u201cemperors of the online economy\u201d that \u201cenjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors.\u201d\nThese moments stood out to us:\n\u2022Jeff Bezos of Amazonfaced questions about his company\u2019s relationships with third-party sellers. When Representative Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat who represents Amazon\u2019s district in Washington, asked him whether the company misused sales data to develop products that competes with those merchants, a rattled Mr. Bezos said, \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no.\u201d\n\u2022Tim Cook of Applewas confronted over his company\u2019s iron-fisted control of its App Store and whether its demands of other developers were unfair. When Representative Jerry Nadler of New York asked whether Apple\u2019s pressing Airbnb and ClassPass for additional commissions for sales made through their appsconstituted \u201cpandemic profiteering,\u201dMr. Cook said the tech giant would \u201cnever\u201d do that \u2014 but said some such cases would require additional payouts to Apple.\n\u2022Sundar Pichai of Googleconfronted several questions about his company\u2019s dominance in advertising. The hearing began when Mr. Cicilline said documents showed the tech giant sought to create \u201ca walled garden that increasingly keeps users within its sites.\u201d Mr. Pichai responded, \u201cI\u2019m really focused on giving users what they want.\u201d\n\u2022Mark Zuckerberg of Facebookwas presented withawkward emails that he sent in 2012to Facebook\u2019s C.F.O. about acquiring smaller competitors, including Instagram. \u201cOne way of looking at this is that what we\u2019re really buying is time,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Less than an hour after sending that email, the Facebook founder sent another noting that, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d Mr. Nadler pressed him hard on this.\nHow they rated.The C.E.O.s appeared virtually, beamed into the hearing room where socially-distanced, masked lawmakers sat on a wood-paneled stage. The Times\u2019s Mike Isaac gave Mr. Bezosthe best marksfor the quality of his setup: \u201c8/10 for the cool Pacific Northwest dad office vibes. Two points subtracted for his connectivity issues.\u201d The Times\u2019s fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman,rated their attire, noting that they \u201clooked more like four guys dressed up in their first graduation suits \u2014 serious, sincere, a little uncomfortable \u2014 than the four horsemen of the digital apocalypse whose planetary power was a threat to one and all.\u201d\nBy the numbers.Mr. Cook drew fewer questions from lawmakers than the others,as compiledby The Times\u2019s Kellen Browning. But Apple\u2019s chief stood out for the number of times he shifted attention to competitors, or to China, arguing that their market power was more pressing: He employed this tactic 13 times during the hearing, twice as often as Mr. Zuckerberg, according to Kellen\u2019s calculations.\nWhat the C.E.O.sdidn\u2019tsay.The website Protocol listedall the questionsthat the executives responded to with some variation of \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that.\u201d Kellen notes that Mr. Pichai did this the most, 13 times, versus seven times for Mr. Zuckerberg and three each for Mr. Bezos and Mr. Cook.\n\u2022 Today, the executives will be on safer ground, as all four report quarterly earnings after the market closes. Will they stick to discussing income statements and balance sheets, or will they push back on what was said during yesterday\u2019s proceedings?\nPandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire on Friday.The extra $600 a week that many jobless workers in the U.S.have relied uponare likely to vanish afterPresident Trump undercutSenate Republicans\u2019 effort to negotiate a coronavirus aid package with Democrats.\nTikTok\u2019s C.E.O. tried to reduce the political heat.Kevin Mayer, the video app\u2019s American chief, offered toopen up some of its core algorithmsto address concerns about its treatment of user data and ownership by a Chinese tech giant. Republican lawmakers say a separate plan for TikTok to sell a majority stake to Western investorswouldn\u2019t allay their concerns.\nBig European corporates reported earnings.It was a mixed bag:Airbusreporteda big lossfor the first half and vowed to conserve cash;AstraZenecareported a26 percent rise in earningsfor its first half as sales of new drugs beat forecasts;Credit Suissebeat expectations, thanks to a surge in trading revenue; trading also aidedShell, which reporteda smaller-than-expected loss, andTotal, which disclosed a surprise profit; andNestl\u00e9announced an18 percent rise in first-half profitbut warned of slowing growth for the rest of the year.\nQualcomm struck a patent deal with Huawei.The U.S. chip maker announced that it hadsettled a long-running licensing disputeat a time when the Trump administration has cracked down on the Chinese tech giant. Shares in Qualcomm jumped 12 percent on the news.\nAshley Judd can sue Harvey Weinstein for sexual harassment.A panel of judgesoverturned a lower court\u2019s rulingthat the actress could not sue Mr. Weinstein for sexual harassment under California law because Ms. Judd and the movie producer did not have a specific business relationship at the time that she said the misconduct took place.\nThe Commerce Department will today publish a preliminary estimate of U.S. economic output for the second quarter. It\u2019s expected to be the worst result since quarterly G.D.P. statistics were first compiled more than 70 years ago.\nHow bad?The headline number is expected to show that G.D.P. fell 35 percent in the second quarter. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the economy shrank by more than a third in just three months,The Times\u2019s Ben Casselman explains. The U.S. reports these statistics using annualized rates, which amplify short-term changes. In fact, G.D.P. is expected to be about 10 percent smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first. (That would be about the same as Germany, which reporteda 10.1 percent declinein its G.D.P. this morning.) Still terrible, but not quite as eye-popping.\n\u201cThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.\u201dUnderscoring the economy\u2019s fragility,the Fed chairman Jay Powell notedat a news conference yesterday that containing the coronavirus was the \u201cfundamental\u201d factor that would determine the path of growth in the future. That path is \u201cextraordinarily uncertain,\u201d he said, adding that a rebound in the labor market was \u201cgoing to take a while.\u201d In the meantime, the central bank is \u201cnot even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates.\u201d (Compared with his last news conference, that\u2019s an extra \u201cthinking about.\u201d)\nAs the pandemic hit, prompting waves of furloughs and layoffs, many corporate leaders showed solidarity by cutting their pay. As it turns out, it often wasn\u2019t much of a sacrifice.\nTwo-thirds of C.E.O.s who reduced their pay took only a 10 percent hit at most,The Times\u2019s Peter Eavis reports, citing a study by the research firm CGLytics. The reductions typically hit executives\u2019 salaries, which form only a small part of their total pay. (Stock awards and bonuses are usually much bigger parts of their pay packages.)\nHere\u2019s how some C.E.O.s fared, compared with what they earned in 2019:\n\u2022Ed Bastianof Delta Air Lines took a 5.35 percent cut.\n\u2022Oscar Munozof United Airlines took a 3 percent cut.\n\u2022Bob Igerof Walt Disney took a 3.3 percent cut.\n\u2022Arne Sorensonof Marriott took a cut of less than 2 percent.\n\u2022Glenn Kelmanof the real estate brokerage Redfin took a $284,000 cut, worth 100 percent of his 2019 pay.\nIts stock price, for starters. Shares in the erstwhile photography pioneer soared in recent days as itwon a federal loanto produce ingredients for coronavirus treatments. But the timing of the trading has aroused suspicion.\nKodak\u2019s stock jumped more than 15 times higherthis week,representing a potential second act for a company that has struggled to find a new direction. Momentum begets momentum, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Kodak shares have becomea favorite of speculative day traderson the Robinhood app, where nearly 79,000 users added the stock to their portfolios in just 24 hours.\nSome have cried foul,pointing to heavy trading volumes ahead of Kodak\u2019s official announcement about the government loan. The Wall Street Journal reports that there is an explanation: Kodakhad briefed news outletsin its hometown, Rochester, N.Y. \u2014 but neglected to say that the information was not for public reporting at the time. Some of those tweets and stories were deleted shortly after posting, but not before eagle-eyed traders saw the news.\nDeals\n\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2019s C.E.O., Christian Sewing, rejected speculation that the German lender would seek to revive merger talks with its rival Commerzbank.

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After lawmakers collected hundreds of hours of interviews and obtained more than 1.3 million documents about Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, their chief executives will testify before Congress on Wednesday to defend their powerful businesses from the hammer of government.\nThe captains of the New Gilded Age \u2014Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2014 will appear together before Congress for the first time to justify their business practices. Members of the House judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommitteehave investigated the internet giantsfor more than a year on accusations that they stifled rivals and harmed consumers.\nThe hearing is the government\u2019s most aggressive show against tech power since thepursuit to break up Microsofttwo decades ago. It is set to be a bizarre spectacle, with four men who run companies worth a total of around $4.85 trillion \u2014 and who include two of the world\u2019s richest individuals \u2014 primed to argue that their businesses are not really that powerful after all.\nAnd it will be a first in another way: Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Bezos and Mr. Cook will all be testifying via videoconference, rather than rising side-by-side for a swearing-in at a witness table in Washington. Perhaps appropriately, their reckoning will be broadcast online.\n\u201cIt has the feeling of tech\u2019s Big Tobacco moment,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the Federal Communications Commission and a fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s law school, referring to the1994 congressional appearanceof top executives of the seven largest American tobacco companies, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive.\nThe hearing, which caps a 13-month investigation by the House subcommittee, will be closely watched for clues that could advance other antitrust cases against the companies. The Federal Trade Commission, for one,is preparing to deposeMr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives in its 13-month probe of the social network. The Justice Department may soon unveil a case against Google. And an investigation into Apple by state attorneys general also appears to be advancing.\nAs a result, preparations for the hearing have been frenetic \u2014 even with the event postponed by a few days this week to accommodate the commemoration of Representative John Lewis \u2014 as tech lobbyists jockeyed behind the scenes to influence the types of questions that lawmakers might ask.\nAt the hearing, which starts at noon on Wednesday, the 15 members of the antitrust subcommittee will have five minutes for each question. Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the subcommittee, will control the number of rounds of questioning, potentially stretching questioning into the evening.\nThe length of the hearing may also be prolonged since the antitrust issues facing Apple, Facebook,Google and Amazonare complex and vastly different.\nAmazon is accused of abusing its role as both a retailer and a platform hosting third-party sellers on its marketplace. Apple has been accused of unfairly using its clout over its App Store to block rivals and to force apps to pay high commissions. Rivals have said Facebook has a monopoly in social networking. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is dealing with multiple antitrust allegations because of Google\u2019s dominance in online advertising, search and smartphone software.\nDemocrats may also veer off the topic of antitrust and bring up concerns about misinformation on social media. Some Republicans are expected to sidetrack discussion with their concerns of liberal bias at the Silicon Valley companies and accusations that conservative voices are censored.\n\u201cThere was an attitude these were great American companies that created jobs and that we should have a hands-off approach and let them flourish,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said in an interview. \u201cBut there are a lot of serious issues we have uncovered over the course of the investigation that weren\u2019t apparent when we first began investigating.\u201d\nFacebook, Amazon, Google and Apple declined to comment.\nFor the chief executives, the hearing will be a test of how they perform under fire. Mr. Bezos, 56, hasnot previously testified to Congress, while Mr. Cook, 59, and Mr. Pichai, 48, have both testified once before. Mr. Zuckerberg, 36, the youngest of the group, has the distinction of being the veteran: He has answered questions at three congressional hearings in the past two years as Facebook has dealt with issues such as election interference and privacy violations.\nBut none are taking any chances for the event to go awry. Mr. Zuckerberg, who had been at his 750-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has been preparing for his testimony with the law firm WilmerHale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. And a small team is working with Mr. Bezos for his testimony in Seattle, said people with knowledge of the matter.\nFor weeks, the tech giants have also waged a lobbying battle to soften any blows. All four chief executives planned to call lawmakers on the House subcommittee in the days before the hearing, said three people with knowledge of the preparations who were not authorized to speak publicly.\nApple and Amazon also recently released studies to rebut claims of market dominance and anticompetitive practices. Last week, Apple publicized a study by a consulting firm called Analysis Group showing that the 30 percent commission it charges many apps for the right to appear on iPhones is close to what other platforms charge for distribution. The study left out that Apple helped popularize that 30 percent standard across the industry.\nAmazon-funded economic consultants have in recent months argued that the e-commerce company\u2019s business model, which is not grounded in selling ads like Google and Facebook, makes it less likely to violate antitrust laws. Last week, Amazon also releaseda report on small business, saying sales by third-party sellers grew 26 percent in the past year, outpacing Amazon\u2019s own sales directly to consumers.\nGoogle has said that the search and advertising tech markets that it dominates are changing fast. More than half of all searches for products on the internet originate on Amazon, Google\u2019s lobbyists have said.\nAnd Facebook\u2019s Washington staff has pointed to competition from China, particularly from the popular video appTikTok, as evidence that competition in social media abounds. The Chinese-owned app is in the cross hairs of the Trump administration, which hasthreatened to ban itfor national security reasons.\nBig Tech\u2019s rivals have also jockeyed to have their gripes brought up at the hearing, even if for just a few minutes. The House subcommittee has been flooded with proposed questions, documents and letters from the companies\u2019 competitors, according to congressional staff and rivals.\nSpotify, for instance, submitted questions about Apple\u2019s dominance of the App Store. GreatFire, a China-based group, sent a letter with nine questions for Mr. Cook about Apple\u2019s censorship of certain apps in China. Blix, a company whose email app competes with Apple and that is suing Apple in federal court for patent infringement, sent five questions to the subcommittee, including one on whyApple ranked its own apps ahead of rivals\u2019 offeringsin its App Store.\nThis month, David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management tool, said he also briefed lawmakers ona recent public spat with Apple. Apple had denied Basecamp\u2019s new email app from appearing in the App Store because it charged customers outside of Apple\u2019s payment system. After Mr. Heinemeier Hansson complained publicly, Apple permitted the app with some minor changes.\nThe subcommittee\u2019s members, who have already held five hearings about the tech giants, were informed and thoughtful during his briefing, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said.\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s already a great resonance,\u201d he said.\nEven if the hearing results in more theater than substance, some said the greatest risk to the tech companies was increasing momentum toward regulations.\n\u201cThe C.E.O.s don\u2019t want to be testifying. Even having this collective hearing creates a sense of quasi-guilt just because of who else has gotten called in like this \u2014 Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Banks,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a tech policy analyst at the investment firm Cowen. \u201cThat\u2019s not a crowd they want to be associated with.\u201d\nCecilia Kang reported from Washington, Jack Nicas from Chicago and David McCabe from Wellfleet, Mass. Daisuke Wakabayashi, Mike Isaac and Karen Weise contributed reporting."

        "title": "Grilled by Lawmakers, Big Tech Turns Up the Gaslight",
        "fulltext": "When Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of Congress two years ago, the Facebook chief executive\u2019s memorable retort to a clueless questioner was \u201cSenator, we run ads.\u201d After Wednesday\u2019s marathon appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg and three other tech titans at aHouse hearing on competitionin the tech industry, a more fitting quote might be \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what you would mean by \u2018threaten.\u2019\u201d\nThat was Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s evasive answer to a question asked by Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, about whether Facebook had ever threatened to squash smaller competitors by copying their products if they wouldn\u2019t let Facebook acquire them.\nIt was a good question with a clear-cut answer. Facebook\u2019s copy-and-crush approach has beenwell documentedfor years, and Ms. Jayapal brought even more receipts \u2014 previously undisclosed messages in which Mr. Zuckerberg issued thinly veiled threats to Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, about what would happen to his company if he refused to sell.\nAn honest Mr. Zuckerberg might have replied, \u201cYes, Congresswoman, like most successful tech companies, we acquire potential competitors all the time, and copy the ones we can\u2019t buy. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve avoided going extinct like MySpace or Friendster, and we\u2019re about to do it again withInstagram Reels,our new TikTok clone.\u201d That would have been an illuminating answer, and one that could have let lawmakers in on the kill-or-be-killed ethos of Silicon Valley. Instead, he dodged and weaved, trying to explain away the emails without admitting the obvious.\nHe did the same thing when Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, pressed him for answers about Facebook Research \u2014 an app that was used tosnoop on users\u2019 smartphoneusage and give Facebook detailed data about its competitors. Mr. Zuckerberg initially said he wasn\u2019t familiar with the app, even though Apple\u2019s decision to bar it from its App Storenearly causeda meltdown at his company last year. (He later said he misspoke, and that he remembered it.)\nI don\u2019t mean to pick on Mr. Zuckerberg. Every other witness at Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \u2014 also dodged lawmakers\u2019 most pointed questions, or professed their ignorance.\nThe result was a hearing that, at times, felt less like a reckoning than an attempted gaslighting \u2014 a group of savvy executives trying to convince lawmakers that the evidence that their yearslong antitrust investigation had dug up wasn\u2019t really evidence of anything.\nThe performance wasn\u2019t particularly convincing. You don\u2019t become a tech mogul by being sloppy or forgetful, and it strains credulity to imagine that these four hypercompetitive, detail-obsessed men \u2014 all of whom had many weeks to prepare for Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 simply didn\u2019t remember major decisions they\u2019d made.\nAt one point, Mr. Bezos was asked about a recentWall Street Journal reportthat Amazon had set up a venture capital fund to invest in start-ups, only to then introduce its own versions of those start-ups\u2019 products.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics of that situation,\u201d Mr. Bezos replied.\nAt another point, Mr. Pichai, asked to explain whether it was anticompetitive for Google to threaten to delist Yelp if it didn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s search engine to use its listings in its featured snippets, said he was \u201chappy to engage and understand the specifics\u201d at a later date. Yelp has complained publicly about Google\u2019s search engine for years.\nAnd confronted with emails acquired by House investigators in which Apple employees promised to fast-track a company through its App Store approval process \u2014 a seeming contradiction of Mr. Cook\u2019s assertion that it treated all developers equally \u2014 Mr. Cook responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, sir.\u201d\nGive the executives this: It\u2019s hard to have nuanced conversations about complex and often technical topics in front of an audience of hostile politicians, some of whom seemed more interested in generating fiery clips for their Facebook pages than investigating antitrust concerns. And the panel\u2019s format \u2014 rapid-fire rounds of questioning conducted over video conference, with each member given only five minutes at a time to question the witnesses \u2014 nearly guaranteed that the conversation would remain surface-level.\nIn addition, many Republican members of the subcommittee seemed to have no interest in antitrust issues at all, preferring instead to ride partisan hobby horses like claims of anti-conservative bias on social media.\nBut many Democratic members came armed with real, substantive questions that deserved a fuller airing. The executives\u2019 choice to sidestep these questions \u2014 or their inability to answer before being cut off \u2014 may signal that they still believe they can run circles around Congress without engaging in hard, detailed conversations about how they exercise their power.\nThat may have been a reasonable conclusion to draw after the past several years, a period in which Silicon Valley giants added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value while Washington barely gave it a passing glance. Despite plenty of clamoring, lawmakers have failed to pass any meaningful privacy or data protection laws during President Trump\u2019s time in office, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in any tech regulation that does not involve his own Twitter account.\nBut it is less clear that a say-nothing strategy will continue to work, now that lawmakers have begun doing their homework. Sure, some members of Congress may still need their iPhones explained to them, but there is real expertise on Capitol Hill that wasn\u2019t there even a year ago, and new allies who are willing to give Congress the ammunition it needs.\nWhen Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in 2018, tech expertise in Washington was a rare commodity. Now, antitrust experts schooled in the intricacies of tech platforms are helping Congress investigate.\nOne such specialist, Lina Khan, whoseanalysis of Amazon\u2019s anti-competitive business practicesmade her a star of the \u201chipster antitrust\u201d movement, appeared at Wednesday\u2019s hearing sitting behind Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, whom she now advises. Tech industry leaders, who once refrained from criticizing their fellow titans out of courtesy or cowardice, are nowspeaking upabout issues like the 30 percent cut Apple takes from purchases made through its App Store. And if Mr. Trump loses his re-election bid in November, the calls from Democrats to break up or regulate big tech companies will only grow louder.\nNone of this necessarily means that Congress is on the verge of reining in Silicon Valley\u2019s excesses. There are still plenty of lawmakers who would rather focus on promoting dubious claims of partisan censorship on Facebook, or complaining about fund-raising emails getting stuck in constituents\u2019 spam filters. And tech companies\u2019 generally good reputations with Americans \u2014 not to mention their deep lobbying pockets \u2014 may protect them in the end.\nBut at certain moments on Wednesday, each of the four tech executives appeared to be taken off guard by the rigor and depth of the questions they faced. If they were expecting to teach Tech 101 to a group of clueless lawmakers, they instead found themselves in the principal\u2019s office, being confronted with evidence of the spitballs they\u2019d thrown. And they must have realized, in those moments, that they were seeing the beginnings of accountability."

        "fulltext": "You can call it Techpalooza.\nThe chief executives of four of the most powerful tech companies in the world \u2014 Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon \u2014 have agreed to appear in late July before a congressional committee as part of an investigation focused on antitrust.\nRepresentative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who has become one of the biggest critics of Big Tech\u2019s enormous power, told me on Wednesday that Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple will testify in what could be an all-day event.\nMr. Cicilline said that the yearlong congressional investigation has included eight round-table discussions, 93 requests for information, 43 experts testifying and five hearings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first major look at antitrust in this industry in 50 years and a lot of people worldwide are watching how lawmakers deal with tech,\u201d he said. \u201cBut throughout, we know it is impossible to properly conclude this without hearing from the decision makers themselves.\u201d\nHe said that all of the chief executives agreed to appear voluntarily and that logistics are still being worked out for what he hopes will be an in-person hearing in Washington. But safety concerns over the coronavirus may mean that the executives end up testifying remotely.\nAnd while tech leaders have appeared before Congress in the past \u2014 and there is often less illumination than noise at these kinds of hearings \u2014 given the growing public alarm about the power of the tech giants, this gathering of the four horsemen of the Techopolypse could be an epic show. Winter may be coming for Silicon Valley.\nMr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Bezos had indicated in letters previously that they were open to appearing at a hearing, after being invited by Mr. Cicilline\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, while Apple had said that it was open to sending a top official.\nIt\u2019s clear that the chief executives wanted to appear together, not so much for support \u2014 frenemies is about as close as I would describe them, and there is intense dislike between some of the companies \u2014 but in the hopes that a group appearance will keep any one of them from being singled out for intense scrutiny. Some are suggesting that a multiday interrogation, with each chief executive facing a small number of experienced questioners, as well as real people they hurt, would be a better way to grill the tech moguls.\nStill, if the lawmakers do their job in the planned format and ask pointed questions about the true impact of these companies\u2019 power on competition, there could be some important moments.\nThis hearing will be part of a wider bipartisan inquiry into how the tech giants dominate the digital industry and hurt rivals and consumers.\nAlong with fines, politicians and regulators are contemplating new laws on privacy and competition, the repeal of a law that gives platforms broad immunity for content on their sites, and, perhaps most drastically, breaking them up.\nAnd while each company has different problems \u2014 such as a damaging role in the spread of disinformation and hate speech (Hello, Facebook!) \u2014 the near monopolistic power of their services and what to do about it is the focus of the House investigation.\n\u201cWe have very serious concerns about the absence of competition,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cSo we are interested in a wide range of things like their acquisitions, bullying, market power, their favoring of their products and services.\u201d\nWhile the House has been conducting its investigation, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have also been looking into competition in tech. So, too, have state attorneys general and also international regulators, most notably the European Commission under its antitrust head, Margrethe Vestager.\nToo bad Ms. Vestager won\u2019t be asking these tech titans the questions \u2014 she is the bane of the tech industry\u2019s existence, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. How the hearing will be conducted will be critical.\nNo surprise that I prefer public grillings with a side of shame, but more important will be how the companies portray themselves and how they differentiate themselves. While it\u2019s convenient to apply the catchall term \u201cBig Tech\u201d to them, they are not a monolith and some in this group are further along in understanding that with great power comes great responsibility \u2014 and, more important, accountability.\nHopefully, that is what we are going to finally see at the hearing. Mr. Cicilline said the House will issue a report of its findings later in the year, along with recommendations.\nHe also said that he had not been an expert in antitrust issues before he took over the helm of the antitrust subcommittee, but that \u201cthe more I have studied and learned, the more terrifying the power of their large digital platforms is made clear, including the impact on innovation and start-ups.\u201d\nAt the heart of these inquiries, of course, is how can we continue to innovate as power has become more concentrated than ever. I have done innumerable interviews with start-ups and investors in which they talk about the chilling effect of big companies on their business.\nAsk yourself, how easy it is to start an ad-based search engine, a social network, a major online retailer or an app platform when these companies completely cover the field with their money and power and might?\nAnswer: It\u2019s not easy, which is why I will try to grab a seat in the front row.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "fulltext": "A reminder to sign up for our DealBook Debrief call about \u201cTrump\u2019s Covid calculus\u201d with The Times\u2019s White House correspondent Maggie Haberman. It\u2019s on July 16 at 11 a.m. Eastern and you canR.S.V.P. here. (Want this in your inbox each day?Sign up here.)\nThree of America\u2019s six biggest banks released second-quarter earnings yesterday. The others report today and tomorrow. Based on the first batch of results,there\u2019s trouble ahead.\nCitigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo set aside $28 billion for loan-loss provisions, on top of $19 billion earlier this year. That pummeled second-quarter profits, which were collectively down more than 80 percent versus the same time last year. There could be some \u201ckitchen sinking\u201d \u2014 that is, dumping all the bad news into one quarter so future periods look better by comparison. Even so, there was little to be hopeful about.\nIt could get worse before it gets better.Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan said that unprecedented economic stimulus measures had delayed the effects he\u2019d expect in a \u201cnormal recession,\u201d like falling incomes, savings and property prices. \u201cIt\u2019s just very peculiar times,\u201d he told analysts on a conference call. If the economy picks up before stimulus programs expire, the banks\u2019 loss provisions could be excessive. But that\u2019s not what executives seemed to suggest:\n\u2022 \u201cMay and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of this recovery. And now we\u2019re really hitting the moment of truth, I think, in the months ahead.\u201d\u2014 Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan\u2019s C.F.O.\n\u2022 \u201cOur view of the length and severity of the economic downturn has deteriorated considerably from the assumptions used last quarter.\u201d\u2014 Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo\u2019s C.E.O.\n\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us and it\u2019s a rosy path ahead.\u201d\u2014 Mike Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O.\nIt\u2019s not all bad.Trading and underwriting revenue surged, helping JPMorgan and Citi offset the gloom elsewhere. Retail-focused Wells Fargo wasn\u2019t as lucky, recording its first quarterly loss in more than a decade. That could be particularly promising for Goldman Sachs, which reports today, and Morgan Stanley, which is up tomorrow. But ominously, lenders increased loss provisions for business loans more in percentage terms than they did for consumer debt, suggesting that they expect more corporate bankruptcies. (The Fed governor Lael Brainardwarned as muchyesterday).\nFun fact:Who needs cash when you\u2019re stuck at home? Wells Fargo said that A.T.M. transactions were down 28 percent from a year ago, but the average withdrawal per visit was higher.\nA European courtsided with the iPhone makertoday, potentially saving it a $15 billion tax bill. The court ruled that the E.U. competition authority failed to show that Ireland had unfairly given Apple low taxes.\nIt\u2019s a big loss for Margrethe Vestager, the E.U. competition chief.She has regularly targeted such arrangements, angering tech executives like Tim Cook of Apple, who derided the campaign as \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d (Even so, the bill would have amounted to a bit more than the tech giant earns in a quarter.)\nThe same court overturned a similar demandinvolving Starbucks last year. The directorate Ms. Vestager runs \u201cdid not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage,\u201d the court ruled. Expect Ms. Vestager to appeal the decision.\nAfter opposition from universities, Silicon Valley and 20 states, President Trumpbacked offa hard-line immigration proposal.\nThe White House abandoned a policy that would have stripped international students of their visasif they did not attend some classes in person. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to be a student or they\u2019re going to be 100 percent online, then they don\u2019t have a basis to be here,\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, said this month.\nThe rules could have led to a huge loss in international students, a valuable source of income for schools and skilled workers for American businesses, particularly tech companies. The Times notes that the one million foreign students who enroll at U.S. schools each year contribute $41 billion to the economy and support more than 458,000 jobs.\nUniversities sued to challenge the policy, led by Harvard and M.I.T., which argued that it was an effort to force schools to reopen. The pressure grew when tech giants like Facebook and Google joined in. Then, 15 Republican lawmakers urged the White House to reverse course.\nBut damage has been done,The Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell argues. Other immigration hurdles \u2014 including delays in visa processing and travel bans \u2014 will most likely contribute to a huge drop in international student enrollment this fall. (How steep? Between 63 percent and 98 percent, according to a new analysis.)\nModerna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine showed promise in a clinical trial.The vaccine, the first to be tested on humans,provoked a notable immune responseand appeared safe for the first 45 people to receive it, researchers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. It is to move to Phase 3 trials this month.\nPresident Trump signed a Hong Kong sanctions bill.Thenew lawgives him additional power to punish Chinese officials over a security act that gives Beijing more control over the territory. (Separately, The Times said it wouldmove part of its Hong Kong news operationto Seoul, South Korea, because of concerns over the law.)\nA federal judge scuttled Harvey Weinstein\u2019s civil settlement.Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the Southern District of New Yorkpicked apart the $25 million proposal, questioning its overall fairness and suggesting that the agreement was misconceived.\nDelta said its comeback had stalled.The U.S. airlinereported a $5.7 billion lossfor its latest quarter and said it would scale back its flight schedule.\nThe N.F.L. has no plan for its upcoming season.Training camps are scheduled to start July 28, but the leaguehas yet to figure outsocial distancing guidelines or the logistics that other leagues developed as part of their restarts.\nBritain, reversing course, said yesterday that it wouldstrip Huawei technologyfrom its 5G wireless network. President Trump claimed a victory in his battle against the Chinese tech giant.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson bowed to political pressure,after saying Huawei products could be used in Britain\u2019s networks on a limited basis. Huawei equipment purchases will be banned from December, and existing gear will be removed by 2027.\n\u2022 British critics, including in its national security agencies, worry that Huawei products could be used to spy for Beijing. The company strongly denies those allegations.\nMr. Trump celebrated the announcement.\u201cWe convinced many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei, because we think it\u2019s an unsafe security risk,\u201dhe saidat a news conference.\nThe move ends a relationship that began in 2005.Britain was the first European country to let Huawei sell products to its companies. Just last month, the Chinese company agreed to fund a $1.25 billion research center at Cambridge. And John Browne, the former BP chief and an elder statesman of British business, served as chairman of Huawei\u2019s U.K. board \u2014 though he will nowstep down.\nBritain faces potentially big consequences.It may have repaired strains in its relationship with the U.S., but the ban will add costs and delays to its 5G rollout. And Beijing threatened that Britain would \u201cbear the consequences\u201d of treating China with hostility.\nFor the past 25 years, Bank of America has surveyed fund managers about how they are positioning portfolios. When a consensus emerges, the bank\u2019s pollsters say, investors generally profit by betting against it.\nBuying tech stocks is now the \u201clongest \u2018long\u2019 of all-time,\u201dthe latest survey found. Nearly three-quarters of fund managers agreed that holding big U.S. tech stocks was the \u201cmost crowded\u201d trade in the market, the survey\u2019s strongest ever consensus. For contrarians, that\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s time to sell, Bank of America says.\nTech giants\u2019 dominance is a risk to long-term returns, Goldman Sachs analysts write in a new research note. The five largest stocks in the S&P 500 index \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 now account for 23 percent of its market cap. \u201cWe believe further equity upside would require participation from a broader subset\u201d of the index, the analysts say.

        "title": "Barr Urges U.S. Companies to Resist Serving as \u2018Pawns\u2019 for China",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Accusing American firms of engaging in \u201ccorporate appeasement\u201d of the Chinese Communist Party, Attorney General William P. Barr called on the private sector on Thursday to get tougher in resisting what he portrayed as corrupting efforts by China to cheat and bully its way into taking over the global economy.\n\u201cThe C.C.P. has launched an orchestrated campaign across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them,\u201dMr. Barr said in a speechat the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\u201cTo secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and our grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of a whole-of-society approach in which the public and private sectors maintain their separation but work together collaboratively in order to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy,\u201d he said.\nMr. Barr\u2019s was the third of four speeches on China by senior Trump administration officials, and it came as the White House was weighingimposing a sweeping ban on travelto the United States by members of the Chinese Communist Party as part of a broader confrontation with Beijing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to deliver a speech on China next week.\nMr. Barr denounced China as an authoritarian state that found willing \u201cpawns\u201d as it sought to infiltrate, censor and co-opt American private-sector institutions and steal technological know-how. He focused in particular on entertainment and high-tech businesses, both industries that Republicans sometimes view as too liberal politically.\nFor example, the attorney general criticized actors and directors for lecturing the United States at the Academy Awards each year about \u201chow this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s values\u201d even as their industry censored movies to avoid losing access to the Chinese market.\nMr. Barr cited Paramount Picturesaltering a scenein the 2013 zombie apocalypse movie \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d in which the characters had speculated that a virus outbreak had started in China, and the decision by the screenwriter of the 2016 movie \u201cDr. Strange,\u201d by Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, tochange the ethnicity of a major characterwho is Tibetan in the comic books to Celtic to avoid angering the Chinese government.\n\u201cMany more scripts never see light of day because writers and producers know not to test the limits,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cChinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup\u201d for China.\nHe also lambasted Silicon Valley companies, saying that Cisco had helped China build its massive system for censoring and surveilling the internet, and that \u201cGoogle, Microsoft, Yahoo and Apple have shown themselves to be all too willing to collaborate\u201d with China.\nHe focused on Apple, slamming it for removing Chinese users\u2019 ability to access pro-democracy songs and apps that provide news and can evade internet censorship; for agreeing to put iCloud data of Chinese users on servers in China; and for securing iPhones in a way that inhibits the F.B.I.\u2019s ability to scrutinize data on devices even with warrants \u2014 while, he insinuated, treating the Chinese government differently.\n\u201cDo you think when Apple sells phones in China, that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn\u2019t be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities,\u201d Mr. Barr said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman pointed to previous statements the company had made about its need to comply with Chinese laws, saying it would provide iCloud data in its possession about individual users in response to legal requests but \u201cnever bulk data.\u201d The company has also said there is no way to weaken its security features for the U.S. government without endangering all its users from other actors.\n\u201cWe sell the same iPhone everywhere,\u201d an Apple statement said. \u201cWe don\u2019t store customers\u2019 passcodes, and we don\u2019t have the capacity to unlock passcode-protected devices. In data centers, we deploy strong hardware and software security protections to keep information safe and to ensure there are no back doors into our systems. All of these practices apply equally to our operations in every country in the world.\u201d\nMr. Barr praised the recent decision by several tech giants tosuspend providing user data to Chinese law enforcementin response to its crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong. Noting that China has threatened criminal sanctions in response, Mr. Barr urged the companies to hold firm.\nBut the attorney general also asserted that American corporate leaders with economic interests in China were being pressured to carry out covert influence campaigns, suggesting that they could face legal liability if they lobbied for policies the Chinese government had directed them to support without disclosing the underlying relationship.\n\u201cYou should be alert to how you might be used \u2014 and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act,\u201d Mr. Barr warned. The law requires Americans who lobby the government on behalf of foreign powers to register with the Justice Department.\nOn June 24, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser,gave a speechsaying that assumptions that China would liberalize as it developed economically had proven wrong. Mr. O\u2019Brien equated President Xi Jinping of China to Josef Stalin, the Soviet dictator.\nLast week, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director,portrayedChina as \u201cthe greatest long-term threat\u201d to American economic and national security. He slammed China\u2019s use of economic espionage and cyberattacks to steal American-developed technology.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now reached the point where the F.B.I. is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours,\u201d Mr. Wray said. \u201cOf the nearly 5,000 active F.B.I. counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China.\u201d"
