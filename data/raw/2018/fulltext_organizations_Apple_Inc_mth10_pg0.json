        "title": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.",
        "fulltext": "The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.\nUnlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.\nOctober was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company.\nAfter a nearly decade-long bull market, investors have been increasinglyskittishabout how long the push higher could extend. And sweeping declines like the one that roiled stocks during October have prompted some to consider whether therally that began in March 2009 is indeed under threat.\nThe S.&P. 500 topped out on Sept. 20, up 9.6 percent for the year, and roughly half of the increase was fed by the performance of five huge tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. But in the weeks since that peak, the gains experienced by the benchmark stock index over the previous nine monthswere largely wiped out.\nAnd only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year.\nTheS.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And companies like the fertilizer and chemical giant DowDupont and the home-improvement retailer Home Depot have pulled the S.&P. 500 down by more than they ought to have, based on their size.\nThere are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\nChemical and materials companies have experienced steep declines faced with mounting concerns over global trade. DowDupont is still waiting for Beijing to approve one of its bioengineered soybeans to be imported into China, the world\u2019s largest soybean market. The approval process may be more complicated now that soybean exports from the United States to China are subject toa 25 percent tariffimposed by Beijing over the summer in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese-made goods.\nDowDupont is only the 39th largest company in the S.&P. 500, but its nearly16 percentdrop in October made it among the larger contributors to the index\u2019s downturn, according to the market data firmFactSet.\nHome Depot is the 23rd largest company in the S.&P. 500, but it played the ninth-largest role in the October sell-offthrough Monday.Its shares were down about15 percent in October as climbing interest rates slowed the housingmarket, a key factor in home improvement spending.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard and Visa \u2014 financial firms whose fortunes are closely linked to the economy\u2019s overall health and are sensitive to rising interest rates \u2014 have also helped pull down the market.\n\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm.\nThe biggest tech companies have also played a part in the broad decline, of course. The stock market benchmarks, such as the S.&P. 500, are weighted by market value, meaning the vast size of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft give them significant influence over how the index moves.Amazon\u2019s20 percent dropin October \u2014 much of it coming after an earnings report that contained a disappointing outlook for the holiday season \u2014 helped make it the single biggest drag on the S.&P. 500 during the recent sell-off.\nMicrosoft shares dropped more than 6 percent in October. Alphabet fell around9 percent. Facebook was down more than7 percentfor the month after rebounding on Wednesday upon the release of its quarterly earnings report.\nThe only big tech company left to report for the quarter is Apple, which is scheduled to release its results on Thursday. The company\u2019s stock price was off about3 percentin October, faring far better than the overall market.\nThe tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.\nEven with companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet having outsize sway over market benchmarks, the losses in other sectors suggest that when it comes to the falling indexes, the tech giants\u2019 tumbles have been more of a symptom than a cause."

        "title": "Apple iPhone XR Review: A Cheaper Phone Suited to Most of Us",
        "fulltext": "Good news, Apple loyalists: You won\u2019t have to burn $1,000 on your nextiPhone. That\u2019s because for about $750, you can have the iPhone XR, which is just as fast and nearly as capable as its more expensive counterparts.\nThe cheaper iPhone, which becomes available this Friday, is the model that most people should buy. This year\u2019s other iPhones \u2014 namely theXS and XS Maxdevices, which cost about $1,000 and $1,100 and are already in stores \u2014 are luxury devices better suited for enthusiasts willing to spend a premium for superior cameras or a jumbo screen.\nFor everyone else, the XR is perfectly adequate and has few downsides. Its 6.1-inch screen, which is based on LCD, an older display technology, looks ever so slightly inferior to the OLED screens on the XS phones \u2014 but you would need to be a movie buff to notice the difference.\nThe XR\u2019s single-lens camera is also less capable than the dual-lens cameras on the XS models. Yet the XR can still produce very satisfying photos of people using portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.\nThe XR is slightly less durable than its more expensive cousins. Its glass back is not as tough as the one on the XS. Its casing, or chassis, is composed of aluminum instead of the more robust stainless steel on the costlier phones. Yet these differences are negligible. (I recommend that people use a case to protect those parts of the phone anyway; carrying a phone without a case is a bit likedriving a car without bumpers.)\nAll of these minor negatives add up to a win for price-conscious consumers, especially assmartphone prices keep climbing\u2014 iPhones a few years ago started at about $650, while prices for Android phones from Google and Samsung have also shot up to between $700 and $1,000.\nAfter I tested an XR for four days, here are the highlights.\nApple developed a new kind of LCD to improve color accuracy and squeeze the XR\u2019s screen into the corners of the phone. The result is what Apple calls a Liquid Retina display, which looks better \u2014 brighter and more vibrant \u2014 than past iPhone LCD screens.\nI confess that I struggled to see a difference between the Liquid Retina screen and the OLED on an iPhone XS. The distinction is most evident in blacks: If you look at a photo taken in the dark, you will notice that the blacks on the XR\u2019s screen have a faint blue glow, which is coming from the backlight used to illuminate the screen, while the blacks on the XS look darker and more realistic because the OLED technology turns off individual pixels to make them black.\nWhile browsing Instagram on the XR and the XS, I came across a few photos that clearly looked better on the XS\u2019s OLED screen.One examplewas a professional photo for a New York Times Cooking article about cherry season. In the photo, which shows a variety of cherries in colorful baskets, the reds and cyans looked more accurate on the XS than on the XR, and some of the red stains on the wood table were more visible on the XS.\nThese downsides were trivial. The vast majority of your time on a phone will probably be spent looking at amateur photos taken by friends and family anyway, so it\u2019s worth saving $250 to have this slightly less vibrant screen.\nIf you are debating between an XS and XR, your buying decision will probably come down to the camera. The XR\u2019s single-lens camera takes excellent, clear photos with lifelike colors, but because it lacks a second lens, it is less capable at taking those DSLR-like portrait mode shots, which are a lot of fun.\nTo do portrait mode with the XR\u2019s single lens, Apple used machine learning, which involves computers analyzing images to recognize people in the photo and properly sharpen them while blurring the background. Apple decided to limit its machine-assisted image processing on the device specifically to human subjects.\nIn contrast, the second lens on the XS camera helped the device do portrait shots of a wider variety of subjects, like dogs and objects. In addition to the help of machine learning, the two lenses worked together to create a depth-of-field effect that kept the main subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.\nWhen you attempt to take a portrait photo of a nonhuman, the XR camera will display the message \u201cNo person detected.\u201d This was the biggest downer to me as a dog owner and foodie (and what ultimately drove me to buy an XS).\nIn contrast,Google\u2019s $800 Pixel 3also has a single lens and, with the help of machine learning, did a fantastic job in my tests producing portrait mode photos featuring dogs, food and people.\nApple said that for the XR\u2019s portrait mode, the company wanted to focus on getting photos of people to look just right.\nThat said, people who are less dog crazy and more interested in shooting photos of, well, people probably won\u2019t mind this limitation on the XR. In my tests, the XR was excellent at taking portrait photos of my partner, properly sharpening details of her head, including her hair strands, while blurring the background.\nLet\u2019s speed through what else you need to know about the XR:\nApple said the XR had the longest battery life among the new iPhones. It gets 16 hours of video playback, compared with 15 hours on the XS Max. In my tests, I didn\u2019t notice a meaningful difference. Both iPhones had long enough battery life to get me through the day.\nIn speed tests measuring a single computing core with a benchmarking app, the XR was just as fast as the XS, 49 percent faster than Google\u2019s Pixel 3 and 45 percent faster than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9.\nThe body of the XR is about half a millimeter thicker than the XS partly because the cheaper phone had to make room for the backlighting used to illuminate its LCD screen. In addition, the XR\u2019s 6.1-inch screen is a bit bigger than the XS with a 5.8-inch screen. As a result, it felt bulkier in the pocket than the XS. (Of course, the XS Max with a 6.5-inch screen felt the bulkiest.)\nThe XR lacks 3D Touch, the iPhone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. Instead, placing your finger over a button, like the camera shortcut on the lock screen, and holding it down results in haptic feedback. This is a negligible omission: I forgot that 3D Touch even existed because I rarely use it.\nThe XR comes in six colors: white, black, blue, yellow, coral and red. The XS phones come in three: gold, white and black.\nAs is often the case for new gadgets, good things come to those who wait. If you resisted splurging on the XS to wait for the XR, you will be rewarded with a great phone \u2014 and some extra cash lying around."

        "title": "Apple News\u2019s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines",
        "fulltext": "Many of Apple\u2019s employees moved into a glisteningnew $5 billion glass headquartersin Cupertino, Calif., this year. A mile west, at Apple\u2019s old campus on 1 Infinite Loop, a project antithetical to Silicon Valley\u2019s ethos is now underway.\nIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.\nOne morning in late August, Apple News\u2019s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company\u2019s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\nNational news sites were leading that day with stories that the Justice Department hadbacked an affirmative-action lawsuitagainst Harvard University \u2014 a good proxy that the story mattered, said Ms. Kern\u2019s deputy, a former editor for The New York Times whom Apple requested not be named for privacy reasons. He and Ms. Kern quickly agreed that it was the day\u2019s top news, and after reading through a few versions, selectedThe Washington Post\u2019s reportbecause, they said, it provided the most context and explanation on why the news mattered.\nAnother story drawing wide coverage: racial barbs on the first day of the Florida\u2019s governor race. Ms. Kern and her deputy said they wanted a piece that covered the topic thoughtfully because race is a sensitive subject. They selected a nuancedMiami Herald piecethat examined the comments, their context and the debate about them.\nThey also later picked aCBS News videoof John McCain\u2019s memorial service, anSB Nation storyon Serena and Venus Williams facing off in the United States Open, and aBloomberg featureon 20-hour flights. Ms. Kern said her team aimed to mix the day\u2019s top stories with lighter features and sometimes longer investigations, much like the front page of a newspaper. They largely chose from a list of contenders compiled that morning by three editors in New York who pored over the home pages and mobile alerts of national news sites, as well as dozens of pitches from publications.\n\u201cWe put so much care and thought into our curation,\u201d said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.\u201d\nApple has waded into the messy world of news with a service that is read regularly by roughly 90 million people. But while Google, Facebook and Twitter have come underintense scrutinyfor their disproportionate \u2014 andsometimes harmful\u2014 influence over the spread of information, Apple has so far avoided controversy. One big reason is that while its Silicon Valley peers rely on machines and algorithms to pick headlines, Apple uses humans like Ms. Kern.\nThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.\nTheir work has complicated the debate about whether Silicon Valley giants are media or technology companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter have long insisted they are tech entities and not arbiters of the truth. The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and others have bet heavily on artificial intelligence to help them sort through false news and fact-based information. Yet Apple has unabashedly gone the other direction with its human-led approach, showing that a more media-like sensibility may be able to coexist within a technology company.\nApple\u2019s strategy is risky. While the company has long used people to curate its App Store, the news is far more contentious. The famously secretive company has also provided little transparency on who is picking the stories for Apple News and how those people avoid bias.\nFor the first time recently \u2014 and after extensive negotiations on the terms of the interviews \u2014 Apple agreed to let a Times reporter in on how it operates Apple News.\nThere are ambitious plans for the product. Apple lets publishers run ads in its app and it helps some sign up new subscribers, taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Soon, the company aims to bundle access to dozens of magazines in its app for a flat monthly fee, sort of like Netflix for news, according to people familiar with the plans, who declined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Apple also hopes to package access to a few daily-news publications, like The Times, The Post and The Wall Street Journal, into the app, the people said.\nApple\u2019s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. \u201cThere is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,\u201d Ms. Kern said.\nBut there are early signs that Apple is not the industry\u2019s savior. Many publishers have made little on ads in Apple News, and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of subscriptions it helps sell does not help. Having experienced Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s disruption of their industry, many publications are wary of Apple, according to conversations with executives from nine news organizations, many of whom declined to comment on the record for fear of upsetting the trillion-dollar corporation. Some were optimistic that Apple could be a better partner than other tech giants, but were leery of making the company the portal to their readers.\n\u201cWhat Apple giveth, Apple can taketh away,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Journal, Bloomberg and other publications. Once readers are trained to get their news from Apple, he said, news organizations will realize: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of Apple.\u201d\nFor decades, newspapers had one of industry\u2019s most direct relationships with customers: Broadsheets and tabloids reported the news, printed it and delivered it to your door.\nThen the internet arrived, and Google and Facebook became the middlemen between publishers and their readers, while leveraging that position to dominate digital advertising and decimate newspapers\u2019 advertising business model.\nThe rise of Google and Facebook in news was partly driven by algorithms that provided enormous scale, enabling them to surface millions of articles from thousands of sources to their billions of users. The algorithms were largely designed to keep users engaged and clicking, meaning they tended to promote posts that drew clicks and shares, which often meant the sensational. That elevated fringe and partisan sites that produced intentionally misleading, highly partisan or downright false content.\n(A Google spokeswoman said the company aimed to avoid misinformation by screening publishers before letting them into Google News. She added that Google this year began helping news organizations sell subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company helps publishers reach more readers, earn ad revenue and sell subscriptions. She said Facebook\u2019s algorithm recently decreased the visibility of pages that share clickbait.)\nInto that environment came Apple. In late 2015, the iPhone maker released a free news app to match users with publications they liked. People selected their interests and favorite publications, and the app returned a feed of relevant stories.\nThe announcement attracted little fanfare. Three months later, Apple announced an unusual new feature: humans would pick the app\u2019s top stories, not algorithms.\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, Americans learned that partisan trolls and Russian agents hadused Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spread divisive messages to voters, gaming their algorithms. The revelations prompted scrutiny of the companies\u2019 influence over media and society. To better police their sites, the companies promised to hire more humans \u2014 and add more algorithms.\nApple said it remained convinced of the benefits of people.\n\u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s chief of apps and Ms. Kern\u2019s boss, said about Apple News. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to let it be a total crazy land.\u201d\nTo create its newsroom, Apple needed journalists. Starting in 2015, it poached editors from The Times, The Journal, CNN and Bleacher Report, among other publications. To lead them all, an Apple recruiter found Ms. Kern, a rising star in the New York magazine world.\nMs. Kern, born in Ardmore, Okla., to a lawyer who later became a federal judge and a former reporter forThe Daily Ardmoreite, got her journalism start at an alt-weekly, the Houston Press, while attending Rice University in 1996. In 2004, she joined New York Magazine as an editor.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t generally have the whole package, but she did,\u201d Adam Moss, New York Magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said of Ms. Kern\u2019s news judgment, story ideas and work ethic.\nIn 2010, Ms. Kern joined The New York Times Magazine as deputy editor. Four years later, Mr. Moss lured her back to New York Magazine as executive editor. In that role, she shepherded the magazine\u2019shigh-profile coveron women whoaccused Bill Cosby of rapeand editedthe storiesabout the chief of Fox News, Roger Ailes, and hishistory of sexual harassment.\nLast year, Mr. Moss said, Ms. Kern came into his office with the news that Apple had approached her about a job.\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Moss. \u201cWith the literary skills and the artistic skills Lauren had, to go into a company that was really dominated by engineers was a recipe for enormous frustration.\u201d\nMs. Kern said it was an opportunity to help journalism from the other side. Going to tech also came with a raise; she would not say how much. She moved from Brooklyn to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes, where she bought a car for the first time in 13 years, a golden retriever named Leo for her son, and a spacious house with chicken coops in the back. (She plans to leave the coops empty.)\nIn interviews, Ms. Kern was lighthearted but matter of fact. Friends and former colleagues described her as fiercely dedicated to two things: her son and her job.\n\u201cShe has an executive\u2019s brain. Most places I work, journalists are such poor managers,\u201d said Noreen Malone, a former colleague at New York Magazine. \u201cIt was always clear Lauren was going to run something.\u201d\nNow Ms. Kern leads roughly 30 former journalists in Sydney, London, New York and Silicon Valley. They spend their days consuming news across the internet, fielding 100 to 200 pitches a day from publishers, and debating which stories get the top spots.\nUltimately, they select five stories to lead the app, with the top two also displayed in a prominent window to the left of the iPhone home screen. They also curate a magazine-style section of feature stories. The lineup typically shifts five or more times a day, depending on the news. A single editor in London typically chooses the first mix of stories for the East Coast\u2019s morning commute before editors in New York and then Cupertino step in.\nMs. Kern said she prioritizes accuracy over speed. When a 24-year-old gunmankilled two people in Augustat a video-game competition in Jacksonville, Fla., headlines on Google News, Facebook and Twitter blared that the shooter hated President Trump \u2014 a sensational detail that drove clicks and helped spread the story.\nOn Apple News, the prominent stories about the incident did not mention this factor. Ms. Kern had told her staff to be especially wary of reports immediately after mass shootings. \u201cAfter every shooting, there\u2019s always a \u2018this person is associated with a terror group\u2019 and then it turns out not to be true,\u201d she said. She was proved right: Within days, the killer\u2019s alleged hatred for Mr. Trumpturned out to be false.\nThat approach also led Apple News to not run an ABC News bombshell in December about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. The story alleged that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Mr. Trump had directed him to contact Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. It rocketed across the internet, boosted by Google, Facebook and Twitter, beforeABC News retracted it. (A spokeswoman for ABC News said the story it offered Apple did not include the inaccuracy.)\nMs. Kern said she and her team did not run the story because they didn\u2019t trust it. Why? It\u2019s not a formula that can be baked into an algorithm, she said.\n\u201cI mean, you read a story and it doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test,\u201d she said.\nMs. Kern said Apple News also strives to provide readers with views from both sides of the political debate. When Apple in June unveileda special sectionon the midterm elections, it highlighted Fox News and Vox as partners. Apple said there are as many people reading traditionally left-leaning publications as traditionally right-leaning publications on Apple News.\nStill, human editors have the potential for bias \u2014 or at least accusations of it. Conservative politicians and pundits, including Mr. Trump, have in recent years criticized Google, Twitter and Facebook,accusing them of silencing voiceson the right. The companies have tried to deflect that criticism by letting algorithms take control.\nFacebook in 2014 hired people to pick \u201ctrending topics\u201d that the site highlighted on its website. But in 2016,former employees saidit had a liberal bias. Three months later, Facebook laid off the human editors andput algorithms in charge.\nMs. Kern criticized the argument that algorithms are the sole way to avoid prejudice because bias can be baked into the algorithm\u2019s code, such as whether it labels news organizations liberal or conservative. She argued that humans \u2014 with all their biases \u2014 are the only way to avoid bias.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so much more subtly following the news cycle and what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only legitimate way to do it at this point.\u201d\nNot all of the stories in Apple News are handpicked. Algorithms still deliver stories based on which new sources or topics users have followed, such as sports, cars or entertainment. Algorithms also pick the five prominent \u201ctrending\u201d stories below Ms. Kern\u2019s team\u2019s curated stories. Those items tend to focus on Mr. Trump or celebrities. Making the list on Oct. 2: aPeople magazine headlinereading \u201cKate Middleton Is Back from Maternity Leave \u2014 with a New Haircut and Old Boots!\u201d\nApple executives said they are convinced that Apple News is not only a cure for the ills of how people consume news in the internet era, but also a lifeline for journalism \u2014 and democracy.\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tim said we have a responsibility to help the news industry,\u201d said Mr. Rosner, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to democracy.\u201d\nIn actual newsrooms, there is skepticism that a tech giant will rescue the industry.\nExecutives at nine news organizations said they were hopeful Apple News could help boost business, but were cautious of betting on it. Those from major news sites said Apple News had quickly become a crucial source of traffic, in some cases surpassing Facebook, which this yearchanged its algorithmto reduce the visibility of publishers and sent referrals plummeting.\nDaniel Hallac, chief product officer for New York Magazine, said traffic from Apple News has doubled since December to now account for nearly 12 percent of visits to the magazine\u2019s website. Traffic from Facebook has dropped about a third, to 8 percent of visits, while Google\u2019s share has increased slightly to nearly half of the site\u2019s traffic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Apple News,\u201d he said.\nBut in return for that traffic, publishers are stuck with Apple\u2019s less-than-ideal terms. Apple News readers typically stay in Apple\u2019s app, limiting the data that news organizations learn about them and curbing their ad revenues. Slatereported last monththat its Apple News readers had roughly tripled over the past year but that, on average, it earned more money on 50,000 views on its site than the six million views it averaged per month in Apple News.\nEddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees its services push, said publishers can run their own ads alongside their stories in Apple News and keep all of the revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d he said. He noted most major publishers take advantage of that feature. Apple also places ads for publishers for a 30 percent cut.\nBut news publishers said selling ads for Apple News is complicated, and that advertisers\u2019 interest was limited because of the lack of customer data. Slate also attributed its issues to minuscule revenue from the ads Apple placed. Apple recently made it easier for publishers to place their own ads, but Mr. Cue conceded Apple is not terribly good \u2014 or interested \u2014 in advertising.\nAnother potential issue is that Apple News mostly helps a small coterie of publishers. In July, Florida\u2019s largest newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times, received 79 percent of its outside web traffic from Google and 20 percent from Facebook, said Conan Gallaty, the paper\u2019s digital chief. Apple accounted for 1 percent, he said.\n\u201cOf the major three \u2014 Facebook, Google and Apple \u2014 Apple probably kept the furthest distance in engaging with regional and local publishers,\u201d he said.\nMs. Kern said she has directed her staff to source news from local publications \u201cwhenever there\u2019s a local story that rises to kind of national interest.\u201d She said Apple News used The Sacramento Bee forcoverage of California wildfiresand The Kansas City Star when atour boat capsized in Missouri. But most days, Apple features stories from national publications.\nMr. Cue said Apple is most interested in helping publishers sell subscriptions. Apple News now enables people to subscribe at the tap of a finger, leveraging many iPhone owners\u2019 preloaded credit cards.\nBut there is concern here, too. Apple nabs 30 percent of subscription revenues the first year and 15 percent each subsequent year. In contrast, Google takes a 5 percent cut; Facebook takes nothing. Apple also owns the customer relationship, unlike Google or Facebook, refusing to pass along even subscribers\u2019 email addresses.\nGiven those terms, some news executives said Apple News could cannibalize future subscribers, leaving news organizations with less revenue and less data per customer.\nMr. Cue said Apple primarily delivers customers who wouldn\u2019t have subscribed otherwise and that its revenue share was \u201ca relatively small cut,\u201d in part to offset its costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge moneymaking business,\u201d he said.\nIn April, Apple bought Texture, an app that lets readers pay $10 a month for access to about 200 magazines. It now plans to incorporate the service into Apple News, drastically expanding its reach, according to people familiar with its plans.\nGiven Apple\u2019s ambitions and growing team of former journalists, will it ever start producing the news and not just aggregating it?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future plans, but that\u2019s certainly not what we set out to do,\u201d said Mr. Rosner.\nSo there\u2019s a chance?\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said."

Want this by emailSign up here.\nBloomberg Businessweekpublished an investigationyesterday alleging that Chinese spy chips were embedded in data center equipment used by the likes of Apple and Amazon, and that the U.S. government was investigating.\nShares in Super Micro, the company whose motherboards were reportedly compromised by Chinese subcontractors, plummeted by over 40 percent yesterday.\nBut the companies involved have made heated denials:\n\u2022Amazon says\u201cthere are so many inaccuracies in this article\u201d that \u201cthey\u2019re hard to count,\u201d adding that \u201cat no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in Super Micro motherboards.\u201d\n\u2022Apple saysthat it \u201chas never found malicious chips, \u2018hardware manipulations\u2019 or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,\u201d and is \u201cnot aware of any investigation by the F.B.I.\u201d It adds that it is \u201cdeeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg\u2019s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed.\u201d\n\u2022Super Micro saysit \u201chas never been contacted by any government agencies either domestic or foreign regarding the alleged claims.\u201d\nBloomberg says the report is based on more than 100 interviews, \u201cincluding government officials and insiders at the companies,\u201d and that it stands behind the article.\nWhoever is correct, Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s Shira Ovidemakes a good point:\n\u201cPerhaps the only surefire prevention is for Google, Apple, the U.S. government and others to build every circuit and computer chip by hand and make sure the parts and equipment never leave the sight of people they trust. This seems impossible.\u201d\nThe Tesla C.E.O. agreed to have the company monitor his messages to investors as part of his recent legal settlement with the S.E.C. Did it review the tweets he sent last night?\n\u2022 He appeared to call the agency \u201cthe Shortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201d\n\u2022 He again declared that short-selling \u2014 betting against a stock \u2014should be illegal.\n\u2022 He accused investment firms like BlackRock ofcolluding with short-sellers.\nUnder his settlement with the S.E.C. over fraud charges, Mr. Musk agreed that he could not deny wrongdoing. But there\u2019s apparently nothing in it about needling the agency.\nLegal experts don\u2019t think this is wise. John Coffee of Columbia Law School told the NYT: \u201cEveryone else knows that youlet sleeping dogs lie, particularly in the case of the S.E.C.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Mr. Musktweeted a linkto a music video by Naughty by Nature.

Now, he hopes to use it as a playbook.\nThe underlying principle? As the WSJ points out, it\u2019s thatdoing business with the U.S. is a privilege, and requires adopting policies that America wants.\nProblem is, Canada and Mexico were trying to save a pact that has underpinned their economies for a quarter-century. The E.U. and Japan, both in trade talks with the U.S., won\u2019t be so desperate. As Andre Sapir, a former E.U. economic adviser, told the WSJ: \u201cI don\u2019t think Europe will want to enter into such an agreement \u2014 it would want to have balanced agreement.\u201d\nThe Labor Department will publish payroll data.Economists expect job growth to have slowed in September.

Ina WSJ op-ed, Judge Kavanaugh defended his impartiality but regretted some of his testimony last week.\nIt was a year ago today that the NYT published its investigation into decades of sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Since then, #MeToo hastaken down many leading figures\u2014 Kevin Spacey, Les Moonves, Steve Wynn and Al Franken among them.\nJo Ellison of the FT describeswhat has changedas women become more comfortable calling out sexual misconduct:\nThe off-the-cuff remarks, the \u201chandsy\u201d office politics, the clubbable sexism are all being noted. And slowly, the penny is dropping. We don\u2019t much care for sexist opinion. And we\u2019re really not impressed by your Rabelaisian past.\nThe movement appears likely to continuetransforming the workplace.\nBut Ms. Ellison adds that many accused men, like the comedian Louis C.K., are working again. And the debate over balancing the rights of the accused with those of the accusers is far from over, as the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination shows. For #MeToo, this may just be the beginning.\nThe sight of Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top Washington official, sitting behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at last week\u2019s Senate nomination hearing angered many at the social network. They saw it as a kind of an endorsement from the company.\nFacebook\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, tried to calm concerns during a staff meeting last Friday.That didn\u2019t work, according to Mike Isaac of the NYT:\nThis week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.\nThe tensions compound Facebook\u2019s problems, including itslargest-ever data breach, thedepartures of Instagram\u2019s co-foundersand continued concerns about misinformation on its platform.\nAfter the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. \u2014 still in the pact \u2014 began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. There\u2019s more at stake than one agreement.\nWhat the Europeans devised is a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks won\u2019t. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others haven\u2019t \u2014 and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)\nTheconsequences could be lasting, as Peter Eavis of DealBook explains:\nThe danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.\nBonus:U.S. prosecutors accused a top executiveat the Chinese oil company CEFC of trying to broker arms sales to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.\nG.E.\u2019s new C.E.O.,Larry Culp, could makeover $21 million a yearif he succeeds in reviving the stock price.\nC.E.O. tenures are growing shorter.

        "title": "That New Apple Watch EKG Feature? There Are More Downs Than Ups",
        "fulltext": "Thenewest versionof the Apple Watch will featurea heart monitor app that can do a form of an electrocardiogram.Many have greeted this announcement as a great leap forward for health. The president of the American Heart Association even took part in the product launch.\nFor a more measured response, it\u2019s worth looking at potential downsides, and it turns out there are a few.\nThe upside potential is twofold. First, doctors could monitor \u2014 at a distance \u2014 how patients with known heart problems are functioning outside the office. Second, the device could diagnose heart problems in people who don\u2019t know they have them, picking up abnormal heart rhythms earlier than would otherwise be possible.\nWith respect to monitoring from a doctor, the Food and Drug Administration \u201ccleared\u201d the app \u2014 an easier hurdleto surmountthan \u201capproval.\u201d But it specifically said people with diagnosedatrial fibrillation, one of the most common heart arrhythmias, should not be using the app.\nIf that\u2019s the case, the major potential for the device \u2014 which will arrive later this year \u2014 is to pick up arrhythmias in otherwise healthy people. That\u2019s still a big selling point. Picking up abnormal function earlier could theoretically lead to improvements in health, such as reductions in strokes.\nBut just because something seems like a good idea doesn\u2019t mean it is. No screening test is perfect. In the simplest sense, whenever we consider the results of medical tests, they can be \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d\nIn general, we would like people who are sick to have a positive screening result, and people who are well to have a negative result. Unfortunately, people who are sick sometimes have a negative result. Those are false negatives. People who are well sometimes have a positive result. Those are false positives.\nBoth of these outcomes are worrisome. A false negative might leave someone who needs medical help with a mistaken sense of assurance. Given that relatively few people have serious, undiagnosed arrhythmias with no symptoms (if people did, we would be screening for this more often), this isn\u2019t the major concern. False positives are, because they cost us time and money, as well as cause emotional distress.\nThe health care systemis already busy, if not overloaded. No physician wants to field calls from patients who have no problems. Such patients will require visits and further testing, and will potentially receive interventions. They\u2019ll generate bills and harms without benefits.\nThe watch will also have an \u201cirregular rhythm\u201d notification feature, which alerts people to potential problems. There\u2019s every reason to believe it will generate many false positives. Beforegranting clearance, the F.D.A. reviewed data collected bythe Stanford Heart studyfor 266 people who got such a notification. Most of the notifications were wrong.\nThe study wasn\u2019t peer reviewed, so we don\u2019t know for sure, but this was also a population for whom atrial fibrillation might be more common than in those who might use the watches. People who buy the latest Apple watch will most likely be younger, healthier, wealthier and more plugged into the health care system \u2014 and less likely to remain undiagnosed.\nThis is one of the major problems with such a device. The people most in need of it, those who might benefit from tests and distance monitoring, are the least likely to get it. If we truly believed this was a medical test beneficial to the general population, insurance should pay for it. No one is suggesting that should happen.\nIn fact, many experts don\u2019t think it makes sense to have universal cardiac monitoring of the general public. The United States Preventive Services Task Forcehas issueda \u201cD\u201d recommendation for screening asymptomatic adults at low risk. The group doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s enough evidence torecommend screeningof adults at intermediate or high risk. It doesn\u2019t even think there\u2019s enough evidence to recommend screening adults 65 or older, who are at higher risk,for atrial fibrillation.\nThe task force bases these recommendations on good research. Alarge randomized controlled trialof echocardiographic screening for many heart problems did not demonstrate that such screening offered any benefits in reducing death or the risk of heart attacks or stroke in middle-aged people. And these are scans much more robust than will be available with the new Apple Watch.\nNone of this prevented the American Heart Association fromheraldingthis new function, although it\u2019s not clear where the group\u2019s enthusiasm comes from. Dr. Ivor Benjamin, the association president, appeared at the official announcement of the watch and praised the advancement for tools that \u201chelp fight heart disease.\u201d (The A.H.A. does not officially endorse the watch, or any other specific products.)\nI happen to own an Apple Watch. I find the other functions useful and fun. I even enjoy aspects of the activity monitoring. But I\u2019munder no illusionthey will help me lose weight or exercise more or improve my heart health. I own one because I want it, not because I need it. That\u2019s the same criterion you should use, too."

        "title": "Senators Call for Federal Investigation of Children\u2019s Apps",
        "fulltext": "Two Democratic senators are calling on federal regulators to investigate whether children\u2019s apps improperly collect personal data and whether app stores are misleading parents by labeling the apps as child-friendly.\nSenators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday saying they were concerned that thousands of apps may \u201cimproperly track children and collect their personal information.\u201d\nThe senators asked the agency to examine whether the apps, and the advertising companies they work with, were violating a federal law to protect children\u2019s privacy online.The law requires sites and appsaimed at children under 13 to obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting personal details from a child like an email address, a precise location, a phone number or persistent digital ID codes that are used for behavioral advertising.\nThe senators also asked the agency to examine how app stores like Google Play vet the apps they categorize as child-friendly and ensure the apps comply with the privacy law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that many companies are violating that law,\u201d Mr. Markey said in a phone interview, \u201cand that we need to put a spotlight on it and ensure that that type of activity is stopped cold.\u201d\nThe letter citeda New York Times articlepublished last month that described how multiple children\u2019s apps sent personal information, including precise location and tracking ID numbers, to outside companies. The apps, with names like Fun Kid Racing and Masha and the Bear: Free Animal Games for Kids, offered animated games and videos. Many of them are so simple a toddler could play them.\nThe Times also found programs in Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store that were labeled appropriate for children but, once downloaded, sent personal data without verifiable parental consent. Apps on the Apple platform sent less data over all.\nThose findings were consistent withacademic researchpublished this year. The researchers analyzed nearly 6,000 free children\u2019s Android apps and found that more than half shared data in ways that could violate the law.\nLast month, the New Mexico attorney general sued the maker of Fun Kid Racing, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies. The suit accused the companies of violating the children\u2019s privacy law. It also argued that Google misled parents by allowing the apps to remain in the children\u2019s section of its store and failed to act swiftly when researchers contacted the company with concerns that thousands of apps might be improperly tracking children.\nA Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said its family program \u201crequires developers\u201d to comply with the federal children\u2019s privacy law and that the company would \u201ctake action\u201d if an app was found to violate its policies.\nAn Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, said developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children\u2019s apps.\nIn their letter, Mr. Markey and Mr. Blumenthal asked the Federal Trade Commission to determine the extent to which app developers and their advertising partners were complying with the children\u2019s privacy law. They called on regulators to examine the kinds of personal details that apps collect from children and share with advertising companies, as well as how app developers make sure their products adhere to the law.\nThe senators also asked the agency to scrutinize how advertising firms with policies prohibiting children\u2019s apps from using their services make sure app developers comply.\nThis week, The Times retested one of the apps from the earlier article, Masha and the Bear, and found that the Android version continued to send precise location information and other data to tracking companies. The iOS version also still sent a tracking ID number to an advertising company, although it did not send location data.\nGoogle and Apple did not respond to specific questions about that app. In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was working on \u201csolving this problem in order to avoid committing this violation in the future.\u201d"

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Apple Goes on the Attack",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, folks. I\u2019m Jack Nicas, a reporter for The Times\u2019s bureau in San Francisco, where two of us are rooting hard for the Red Sox, to the chagrin of our boss. (Those two are me and the editor who edited this, so we slipped it in.) I cover Apple, and this past week the news out ofthe world\u2019s most valuable public companywas not a new gizmo or doodad, but rather a withering critique of the technology industry from one of its most prominent members.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, rebuked his Silicon Valley peers ina speech to European officialson Wednesday, criticizing them for building a \u201cdata industrial complex\u201d in which our personal information \u201cis being weaponized against us with military efficiency.\u201d\nAs a result, he said, algorithms have magnified our worst tendencies and \u201crogue actors and even governments\u201d have used our data against us \u201cto deepen divisions, incite violence and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false.\u201d\nIn one piercing portion, Mr. Cook criticized how companies like Facebook and Google \u2014 while taking care not to mention them by name \u2014 deliver personalized news feeds that lead to so-called filter bubbles and confirmation bias.\n\u201cYour profile is then run through algorithms that can serve up increasingly extreme content, pounding our harmless preferences into hardened convictions,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIf green is your favorite color, you may find yourself reading a lot of articles \u2014 or watching a lot of videos \u2014 about the insidious threat from people who like orange.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.\u201d\nWhew. Those are strong words, particularly from one of tech\u2019s most powerful people.\nMr. Cook and Apple have been clear leaders in Silicon Valley inprotecting user privacy. But the speech also struck some in the tech industry as self-serving.\nApple\u2019sbusiness modelrelies on people buying more iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other gadgets, many of which don\u2019t need much user data to work well. Google, Facebook and increasingly Amazon, however, have prodigious advertising businesses that rely on building detailed profiles of what people read, buy and like.\nIn his speech, Mr. Cook endorsed \u201ca comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\u201d which could help undercut the businesses of Apple\u2019s rivals.\nSoftware made by Google and Apple, for instance, backs nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones. Apple built such a strong smartphone business by offering sleek, high-end devices that \u2014 as Apple has increasingly advertised lately \u2014 value your privacy.\nGoogle has captured most of the global market, particularly in the developing world, by giving its software away to phone makers. In return, Google hashistorically forced themto put its free services front and center on devices. That prompts people to conduct more Google searches, watch more YouTube videos and ask for more directions on Google Maps \u2014 all activities that allow Google to collect more personal data and serve more personalized ads.\nMr. Cook and Apple clearly don\u2019t like that approach. But the market proves that plenty of people would rather opt for a cheap Android phone \u2014 essentially paying with their personal data and dealing with more ads \u2014 than splurge on an iPhone. (The cheapest new iPhone is $750.)\nOther technologists, such asAlex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former security chief, called Mr. Cook hypocritical for trumpeting the importance of privacy when Apple is so deeplyintertwined in China.\nApplerecently began storingits Chinese users\u2019 data on servers in China run by a state-owned company. Apple has said it, not its Chinese partner, retains the encryption keys for that data, but the company regularly complies with lawful data requests from governments around the world. In the last six months of 2017, Apple said, it provided data from about 580 accounts to the Chinese government, compared with about 5,905 to the American government.\nApple has also taken other moves at the behest of the Chinese government, such as removing apps from its App Store in China thathelp people circumventthe government\u2019s internet censorship and even news apps like the The New York Times. Apple has argued that it complies with the laws of the countries it is in, and that it is better served by trying to change China from within than from the sidelines.\nIn other news:\n\u25a0 If you read one tech story from the week, make itthe bombshell reportby my colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Katie Benner on how Google shielded executives accused of sexual misconduct, in one case sending the creator of Android off with a $90 million pay package.\n\u25a0 I lovedthe incisive analysisby our columnist Farhad Manjoo on how the problems with WhatsApp \u2014 the messaging app that has been shown to spread misinformation \u2014 are probably just due to human nature. \u201cWhen you offer everyone access to free and private communication, lots of wonderful things may happen,\u201d Farhad wrote. \u201cBut a lot of terrible things are bound to happen, too \u2014 and it might be impossible to eliminate the bad without muzzling the good.\u201d\n\u25a0 Cade Metz wrotea smart articleon how American companies are struggling to find qualified employees to work on an increasingly important technology called quantum computing. The scarcity threatens to set the country behind other world powers in building new kinds of computers that could potentially crack modern encryption.\n\u25a0 And finally, in a shameless act of self-promotion, I recommendmy look into Apple News, the news app now read regularly by 90 million people. Compared with other tech firms, Apple is taking a radical approach to the news, hiring humans rather than depending on algorithms to pick the headlines. But like other tech companies of the past, Apple is also aiming to help save journalism \u2014 an assurance that actual newsrooms are approaching warily."

        "title": "Apple Used to Know Exactly What People Wanted \u2014 Then It Made a Watch",
        "fulltext": "Apple opened a routine product-launch event last month with a gag. An establishing aerial shot of Apple\u2019s new circular headquarters set up a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it\u2019s an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple\u2019s depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 and it\u2019s not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation.\nThe subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them,\u201d he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, \u201cthey would have said, \u2018Faster horses.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era.\nThe company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn\u2019t succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They\u2019re for Instagram or Facebook; they\u2019re for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple\u2019s competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple\u2019s core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history\u2019s most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers.\nThe Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch \u2014 with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting \u2014 was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself.\nFour years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn\u2019t yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process \u2014 and still in charge \u2014 of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It\u2019s a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious.\nIn its announcement,and in mass-marketing materials, the new Apple Watch displays its broader, busier face, resplendent with data: the time and date, the weather, the UV index. There are indicators in various states of progress, recording a life of constant action: timers counting down; steps counting toward a goal; a song nearing completion. Up top, a reminder: 11:15 A.M. TRAINING WITH KRISTA. These carefully chosen marketing images represent a plausible day in the life of no one so much as the very Apple executives presenting the product onstage, many appearing to be in some advanced stage of the reverse-aging epidemic that has afflicted Silicon Valley in recent years.\nDuring the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d \u2014 attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It\u2019s the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you\u2019re snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up \u2014 that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn\u2019t have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for.\nOver the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what\u2019s going on with, and inside, its wearers\u2019 bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device\u2019s body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won\u2019t be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer\u2019s heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance.\nFor now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that \u2014 it\u2019s a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple\u2019s relative commitment to privacy \u2014 at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording.\nAs Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple\u2019s stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple\u2019s devices and software.\nThis is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple\u2019s latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry.\nThere may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can\u2019t remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device \u2014 or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Fears of the Supply Chain in China",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHello, everyone. I\u2019m Paul Mozur, a reporter based in Shanghai, and I have covered technology in Asia for eight years. Though lately the big story has been internet companies, hardware and the supply chain remains close to my heart. Maybe that\u2019s why the tech news bombshell a little over a week ago has been so fascinating to me.\nAnastonishing piecereleased by Bloomberg on Oct. 4 described a worst-nightmare supply-chain hack in which the Chinese military implanted tiny chips on circuit boards that then made their way to American corporate users, including government contractors.\nSince then, people in the security community havequestioned the claimsin the piece, while the companies named, including Apple and Amazon,dispute it. Bloomberg publisheda follow-upthat spurredeven more debate.\nInstead oflitigatingdetails, I\u2019d like to use the Bloomberg article to do something that tech journalism probably doesn\u2019t do enough: Dig into the juicy politics of the global electronics supply chain. Jack Ma and Elon Musk may get more headlines, but it\u2019s the circuitous route taken by the innards of smartphones and servers that really defines the most important diplomatic relationship in technology.\nFor years, China and the United States have squabbled over the supply chain, which sits mostly in China but is under the charge of companies from dozens of countries.\nAfter Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about how the United States used American companies tospy overseas, China accelerated a campaign to build just about every piece of advanced tech itself. That quest for self-reliance led it to introduce quotas on foreign-made products and require so-called tech transfers for market access. Those policies helped pave the way to the current trade war between the United States and China.\nNot surprisingly, the United States has had the same spying concerns as China. Congresseffectively blockedChina\u2019s Huawei and ZTE from selling their equipment to major telecom carriers in the United States in 2012, and more recently made it harder for Huawei to sell phones.\nThe fact that the two sides share the same fears shows how difficult it can be to ensure security in a world in which the design, production and assembly of electronics occur across multiple countries.\nThe American block on Huawei isn\u2019t completely effective against hypothetical supply chain hacks. That\u2019s because European and Japanese telecom equipment brands also have a good chunk of their supply chains in China. On the other hand, China\u2019s control of a huge portion of the supply chain doesn\u2019t ensure its security, because high-end design and production often happens elsewhere.\nNeither side is happy with this. Both China and the United States will probably continue to winnow their mutual tech reliance. It won\u2019t be easy. They are working against 40 years of economic integration and a tremendously complex web of big and small companies.\nA different approach would be to identify the key things that need to be protected. In a discussion I had the other day with Samm Sacks, a tech policy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, she put forward the idea of having a \u201csmall yard and a high fence.\u201d\nThe point is to identify key products that cannot be compromised and come up with solutions to protect them. Obviously, companies should always do their best to ensure security. But that doesn\u2019t have to lead to ripping apart the global supply chain.\nFor example, regular Americans shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about buying Huawei phones. Senators and admirals, on the other hand, should probably stick with something more closely guarded. That could involve building small, secure supply chains closer to home or special audits of phones used by people who could be high-profile targets. Even if it\u2019s a bit expensive.\nIn China, instead of expending untold state resources to build industries that don\u2019t exist in the country, Beijing might come up with ways to audit and certify foreign-designed products that the government would procure. Then it could focus more on future technology, instead ofcreating competitors from scratchin industries that are already largely established, like memory chips.\nEither way, it\u2019s worth remembering that even if a brand of electronics is from one country, what\u2019s inside it could come from six others. Country of origin also doesn\u2019t ensure security. It makes me glad I\u2019m a journalist and not in charge of The New York Times\u2019s cyber defenses.\nAnd now on to the other news of the week:\n\u25a0 In news that shows the game of spies will continue no matter what happens to the supply chain, a Chinese intelligence official wasextradited to the United Statesto face espionage charges. The official, Yanjun Xu, stands accused of trying to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation, one of the world\u2019s top jet engine suppliers.\n\u25a0 In a leaked transcript from a meeting this summer, a Google executive said he hoped the company would be able to introduce a censored version of its search engine in China insix to nine months, or sooner. Revelations about the project, code-named Dragonfly, have spurred criticism from all corners, including within Google.\n\u25a0 My colleagues Kate Conger and Cade Metz examined the fallout from Dragonfly and other Google plans to work on Pentagon projects with a look at how tech workers arebeginning to demand more informationabout what they\u2019re helping to make.\n\u25a0 Technologists and scientists have often proved shortsighted. But sometimes it\u2019s hard to know how technology will change the world. I\u2019m not sure anyone foresaw how a social network that linked college students could become one of the most important geopolitical actors in the world just over a decade after it was created. From the front lines of Facebook\u2019s global problem with fake news, my colleague Alexandra Stevenson examined howfact-checkers in the Philippines feel overrunand disappointed in Facebook.\n\u25a0 Our lead consumer technology writer, Brian X. Chen, had practical advice on that front, offering his ideas forhow to break up with Facebook and Instagramif all that social media squabbling is getting you down. Ghosting does not mean jumping to Snapchat.\n\u25a0 Google isshutting down its onetime challenger to Facebookafter discovering a security vulnerability that exposed the data of up to 500,000 users. Google did not disclose the issue when it found out about it last spring, out of fears about regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, will probably have a chance to explain that decision when he meets with lawmakers in Washington before the end of the year."

        "title": "Apple Unveils New iPad and MacBook Air",
        "fulltext": "Apple showed off a slate of new computers with better screens, faster processors and higher price tags on Tuesday, including an iPad Pro that the company is trying to position as a primary work computer.\nThe announcements included a new MacBook Air, the first major update since 2011 of Apple\u2019s slimmest laptop, and a new Mac mini, Apple\u2019s entry-level home computer.\nApple tried to make its new iPad Pro the star of the show \u2014 one of its slick product-release events, this time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Like Apple\u2019s iPhone released last year, the new iPad has much smaller borders around its screen, eliminating space for a home button. Instead, owners will unlock the device just by looking at it, and control it with a series of swipes on the screen.\nThe change allowed Apple to make its larger iPad Pro about the size of a standard piece of paper, with 25 percent less volume than the last model, while retaining its 12.9-inch screen and increasing its speed and storage capacity. Apple also introduced a new iPad keyboard, a new stylus that charges wirelessly and connects magnetically to the iPad, and new iPad apps like Adobe Photoshop.\nApple executives repeatedly compared the iPad Pro with laptops and stressed that it could be a primary computer \u2014 an idea Apple is trying to push after years of sluggish iPad sales. The company promotes smartphones as something different from traditional computers, although they have become the primary personal computing device for most people.\nPositioning the iPad Pro as a primary computer means Apple has also priced it like one, with the device costing more than many laptops. The old iPad Pro models cost between $650 and $1,280; the new models range from $800 to $1,900.\nThe new iPad also eliminates the headphone jack; a converter will cost $9. (And you can\u2019t use the headphone-jack converter from your iPhone because the new iPads switched to a USB-C port from Apple\u2019s Lightning port.)\nApple additionally updated one of its best-selling laptops, the MacBook Air, the ultraslim computer that the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs pulled out of a manila envelope at a product introduction a decade ago. Apple made the MacBook Air faster, smaller and louder, and gave it a much sharper screen. It also increased its starting price to $1,200 from $1,000.\nApple made its Mac mini computer faster and more powerful, too, while increasing its starting price to $800 from $500. The company said it had developed a new aluminum alloy from shavings of recycled aluminum that it is using to encase the new MacBook Air and Mac mini, significantly reducing their carbon footprint."
