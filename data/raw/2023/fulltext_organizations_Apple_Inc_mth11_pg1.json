        "title": "This Is Why Google Paid Billions for Apple to Change a Single Setting",
        "fulltext": "Areportin The Guardian in August that lawyers who had had business before the Supreme Court gave money to an aide to Justice Clarence Thomas for a Christmas party was surprising. Just as surprising was the way the publication learned about it: from the aide\u2019s public Venmo records. Brian X. Chen, the consumer technology writer for The Times,wrotethat even he was surprised that such records of money transfers could be public.\nA few years ago it became known that Alexa, Amazon\u2019s voice device,recorded and sentprivate conversations to third parties, that Amazonstaff members listenedto recordings and that the companykept an extensive archiveof recordings by default.\nBoth companies responded to these startling violations of privacy by suggesting that the burden to keep this information from going public was on users, who could, they said, opt out of devices\u2019 default settings to ensure privacy. This is often the standard industry response.\nEven if you\u2019re aware of these problems, how easy is it to protect your privacy? Chenhelpfully sharedinstructions for opting out of Venmo\u2019s public disclosures.\n\u201cInside the app, click on the Me tab, tap the settings icon and select Privacy. Under default privacy settings, select Private,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen, under the \u2018More\u2019 section in Privacy, click \u2018Past Transactions\u2019 and make sure to set that to \u2018Change All to Private.\u2019\u201d\nGot all that? I did, and changed my settings, too, as I had also been in the dark.\nThe bigger problem is not the sometimes ridiculous difficulty of opting out, it\u2019s that consumers often aren\u2019t even aware of what their settings allow, or what it all means. If they were truly informed and actively choosing among the available options, the default setting would matter little, and be of little to no value.\nBut companies expect users to accept what they\u2019re given, not know their options or not have the constant vigilance required to keep track of the available options, however limited they may be. Since the power in the industry is concentrated among few gatekeepers, and the technology is opaque and its consequences hard to foresee, default settings are some of the most important ways for companies to keep collecting and using data as they want.\nSo, how much are default settings worth?\nIn April 2021, Apple changed the default settings on iPhones and other devices so that users could not be tracked automatically via a unique identifier assigned to their Apple device. For many companies, and even for entire industries whose business models are based on tracking people online, it was a cataclysmic event. No longer would people have to opt out of such tracking by going into their settings and changing the permissions. Now the apps had to ask for and receiveexplicit permissionbefore they could have access to that identifier.\nIn 2021, Snap, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube wereestimatedto have lost about $10 billion in total because of the change. In early 2022, Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company,saidit alone stood to lose $10 billion. Industries like mobile gaming, in which revenue largely depends on tracking users, also suffered.\nAnother valuation of default settings became clear in the current Google antitrust trial. During the trial, Google revealedthat it paid$26.3 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various platforms, with a substantial portion of the money going to Apple. That $26.3 billion was equal to more than a third of the entire 2021 profit of Google\u2019s parent company,Alphabet. That was more than the 2021 revenue of United Airlines and even of many tech companies, including Uber. An expert witness for Google testified that as part of that deal, the company was paying Apple 36 percent of its search advertising revenue to be its products\u2019 default search engine.\nEven when you might think you know what your default settings are, you can be surprised. On more than one occasion I discovered that my privacy settings had changed from what I thought they were. Help forums are full of similarly befuddled users. Sometimes it\u2019s a bug. Other times, when I dug into it, I realized that another change I had made had surreptitiouslyswitched me back into tracking. Sometimes I learned that there wasyet another setting somewhere elsethat also needed to be changed.\nI\u2019m not a tech novice: I started programming in middle school, worked as a developer and study these systems academically. If professionals can be tripped up, I\u2019d argue that an industry rife with information asymmetries and powerful, complicated technologies needs to be reined in.\nRegulators can require companies to have defaults that favor privacy and autonomy, and make it easy to remain in control of them. There are already good efforts underway. Californiaallows peopleto make a single opt-out or delete request to getalldata brokers to deletealltheir information, rather than having to appeal to them one by one. Coloradoalso recently passedsimilar universal one-stop opt-out mechanisms.Other stateshave made similar privacy protection moves.\nI would go further: Data brokers should not be allowed to amass information about people unless they first get explicit permission. But that\u2019s not sufficient, since it is difficult for individuals to evaluate all the implications of their data \u2014 professionals, experts and the companies themselves keep getting surprised.\nA few years ago, aggregate maps generated by the running app Strava, which showed where users were running, seeminglyrevealedthe location of what could have been a secret Central Intelligence Agency annex in Mogadishu, Somalia. It appears that even the C.I.A. hadn\u2019t anticipated this, and instructed its personnel to change the setting. If that\u2019s the case, what chance do ordinary people have to evaluate all future implications of their data?\nThere need to be stronger guardrails, including for data that is legitimately collected. The default should be the most restrictive setting, with additional protections. For example, companies should have expiration dates for how long they can hold data needed for a particular service, limiting the data use to that service alone, with explicit consent required for different uses.\nThe process by which companies get such permissions also needs strong oversight to ensure accountability and transparency. After all, this is the industry that invented \u201cdark patterns\u201d: user interfaces designed to deceive customers into \u201copting in\u201d to choices without fully realizing what was happening. Many apps have already been trying to get around Apple\u2019s privacy restrictions by carefully engineering how to get people to opt in or by figuring out other ways to fingerprint devices.\nWhat about all the benefits we derive from services based on personalized data, including location tracking? I use such tools all the time, but there are certainly ways to provide services and value without this level of unchecked surveillance. But it\u2019s wishful thinking to expect companies to provide those services in a more privacy-preserving manner without regulation that forces them to do so.\nI was happy to see Apple switch the defaults for tracking in 2021, but I\u2019m not happy that it was because of a decision by one powerful company \u2014 what oligopoly giveth, oligopoly can taketh away. We didn\u2019t elect Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, to be the sovereign of our digital world. He could change his mind.\nNotably, Apple\u2019s change followed years of intense public criticism of Facebook, privacy scandals, the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and so on. None of that seemed to have made a substantial dent in Facebook\u2019s business. A single decision by Cook did, clearly demonstrating where the real power over this industry lies.\nIt\u2019s time that our own elected officials got smarter \u2014 and prioritized the public interest rather than cozy arrangements with the tech industry \u2014 to exercise that power. If the federal government can\u2019t or won\u2019t, states can follow California and Colorado\u2019s lead. In 1966, California forged ahead alone to set high emission standards for cars, which then pulled along the rest of the nation and the industry.\nIf it were all as simple as people changing their settings, Google wouldn\u2019t be forking over a sum larger than the G.D.P. of entire countries to have Apple users start with one setting rather than another. The default way the technology industry does business needs to change now.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Consumer Bureau Seeks to Supervise Digital Payment Apps",
        "fulltext": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to extend its watchdog powers to cover digital wallets and payment apps run by companies like Apple, Google, PayPal and Block, which do not have traditional banking operations.\nThe bureauproposed a ruleon Tuesday that would subject large companies \u2014 those that process more than five million financial transactions per year \u2014 to the same supervisory examinations the bureau conducts on banks and credit unions. About 17 companies, which together handle $13 billion in transactions a year and hold an 88 percent share of the market in the United States, would be subject to the rule, according to a bureau official.\n\u201cPayment systems are critical infrastructure for our economy,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, the bureau\u2019s director. \u201cToday\u2019s rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight.\u201d\nThe proposed rule could take effect as soon as next year. One of the payment industry\u2019s largest trade groups, the Electronic Transactions Association, had a fairly mild response to the proposal.\n\u201cE.T.A. supports the C.F.P.B.\u2019s goals of robust consumer protections for payments and a consistent regulatory environment for both banks and fintechs,\u201d said Jodie Kelley, the group\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is critical that the final rule encourages continued innovation and competition in the payments space.\u201d\nBanking trade groups have long pressed for nonbank companies to face the same kind of audits and oversight that banks do. Lindsey Johnson, the chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, called the proposed rule \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\nMr. Chopra has been open about his desire to apply greater regulatory scrutiny to large technology companies. Last month,he warned about the \u201csurveillance and censorship\u201dthat such companies can impose on consumers\u2019 financial transactions, citing the wealth of personal details that can be gleaned from the payment trail recorded by apps like PayPal\u2019s Venmo and Block\u2019s Cash App.\nASeptember reportfrom the bureau spotlighted the ways Apple and Google use their dominance as mobile phone makers to steer customers toward their own tap-to-pay digital wallet products.\nConsumers moved $893 billion through payment services last year \u2014 including digital wallets, payment apps and Zelle, a system owned by a consortium of banks \u2014 according toan estimate cited by the consumer bureau, and keep billions of dollars stored in those apps. Americans have been slower than consumers in other countries to adopt digital payments, but the pandemicsharply accelerated their use.\nNearly 56 million shoppers made an in-store purchase with Apple Pay \u2014 the most popular mobile payment service in the United States \u2014 in April, according to the consumer bureau. Starbucks\u2019 digital app and Google Pay, the next most widely used retail payment apps,trail Apple. (The draft rule contains language excluding payment apps that can be used only with a specific retailer or loan servicer, which would put Starbucks outside the rule\u2019s reach.)\nThe consumer bureau already has enforcement powers over digital payment companies because it regulates electronic fund transfers, but adding supervisory oversight would significantly expand its visibility into the operations of the market\u2019s largest operators. It would allow the agency to obtain and review detailed corporate records and to send its financial examiners to companies\u2019 offices to interview employees, scrutinize policies and safeguards, and flag problems as they spot them.\nThe public can comment on the 69-page proposal until at least January. After that, the agency can move to make the regulations final."

        "title": "Apple Says It Will Improve the Green vs. Blue Texting Experience",
        "fulltext": "Starting next year, it should be less frustrating for iPhone and Android users to text one another.\nApple says photos and videos sent between those devices will be of higher quality. Group messaging will be more reliable, and users will also be able to turn on read receipts and send their locations in texting threads.\nThe changes will come once Apple adds support for a technology called rich communication services, also known as RCS, next year, the company said. RCS islike the more modern cousinof short message service, or SMS.\nGreen message bubbles signal that they are coming from an Android or other non-iPhone user. But they have come to be associated with an unpleasant texting experience for iPhone users, whose messages are blue to indicate that they have been sent via iMessage. The green bubble is here to stay, however: It will signal when RCS is in use.\nThe technology \u201cwill work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nUntil now, Apple had shown no desire to make the changes.\nWhenasked at last year\u2019s Code Conferenceabout the texting technology by an attendee who expressed difficulties with sending videos to the attendee\u2019s mother, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, responded, \u201cBuy your mom an iPhone.\u201d\nThe about-face may have been set off by pressure from competitors, such as Google and Nothing, a mobile technology company, and theEuropean Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\n\u201cApple is really the only major company that hasn\u2019t, until now, adopted RCS standards,\u201d said Caitlin Seeley George, the campaigns and managing director for Fight for the Future, a nonprofit digital rights group. The group has pushed Apple to adopt the technology.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a good sign that Apple is making this shift and a sign that maybe they\u2019re listening to the public on this one,\u201d she said.\nMs. Seeley George said that enabling the texting technology would also allow users to see whether someone is typing and whether their messages were received.\nGoogleadopted RCSyears ago, and the company has tried to pressure Apple into doing so practically ever since.\nGoogle started a campaign last year calledGet the Message, whichincluded a videomocking an Apple product release video and included a pager with features such as \u201coutdated messaging tech,\u201d \u201ctexting nightmares\u201d and \u201cbroken group chats.\u201d\n\u201cBy not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\u201d Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google\u2019s senior vice president,wrote on social medialast year.\nIn a statement, Google said it was \u201chappy to see Apple take their first step today by coming on board to embrace RCS.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone deserves to communicate with each other in ways that are modern and secure, no matter what phone they have,\u201d the statement said.\nApple also faces budding competition from Nothing, the mobile tech company.\nNothing recentlyintroduced Nothing Chats, an app that allows non-iPhone users to send iMessages as if they are using iPhones. The app, which is in beta mode, replaces the green bubbles with blue ones and allows for group chats, voice notes, high-resolution media sharing and more between those devices.\n\u201cIf messaging services are dividing phone users, then we want to break those barriers down,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads.\nApple\u2019s announcement also comes before Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act goes into effect in 2024, which could lead to greater scrutiny of its messaging system.\nThe law will apply toso-called gatekeeper platforms, including Apple, and is aimed at forcing those companies to loosen their grip on the market. Apple, for example, may have to allow alternatives to its App Store.\nMs. Seeley George called Apple\u2019s announcement a \u201cpretty big swing in a new direction.\u201d But there was still important work to be done, she said, namely on end-to-end encryption.\nMessages sent between iPhonesare encrypted, but messages between iPhone and Android users cannot be encrypted without RCS, she said. Fight for the Futurehas also pushedApple and other companies to embrace encryption.\n\u201cThis is a big concern for a number of vulnerable communities that are often under surveillance or targeted by law enforcement,\u201d Ms. Seeley George said,pointing to a teenager in Nebraska who was sentenced in July to 90 days in jailafter the police obtained her Facebook messages about plans to end her pregnancy."
