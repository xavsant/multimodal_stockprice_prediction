        "title": "The Future of Streaming (According to the Moguls Figuring It Out)",
        "fulltext": "When the media titans Brian Roberts, John Malone and Barry Diller cast off in early February on Mr. Diller\u2019s 156-foot, two-masted yacht, named Arriva, the waters off the coast of Jupiter, Fla., were placid.\nThe same could not be said for their sprawling entertainment businesses.\nThe three men meet occasionally to discuss the state of the industry, and lively disagreements have a been a staple of their discussions. But by the time they met on the yacht, they had all agreed that the money-losing status quo in the streaming business was unsustainable. The old cable model was a melting ice cube.\nBut what will take its place?\n\u201cThere was peace in the valley for a period of time,\u201d Mr. Malone mused in a rare recent interview, recalling the days before video-streaming upended the lucrative cable business. \u201cNow, it\u2019s quite chaotic.\u201d\nThat is likely an understatement: The once-mighty Paramount, which owns the famed Paramount studio, CBS and a bevy of cable channels, recently replaced its chief executive and failed to sell itself after months of negotiations. Warner Bros. Discovery is frantically paying down its $43 billion in debt. Disney laid off thousands of workers and pushed out its chief executive as streaming losses mounted, and had to fend off a proxy contest from the activist investor Nelson Peltz.\nThe stocks of legacy media companies are a fraction of their former highs: Paramount is near $10 a share and Warner Bros. Discovery is hovering around $7, both down drastically from levels reached during the past year. Even Disney, at about $102, is down more than 16 percent from the price reached in March.\nNo wonder: Paramount, the media empire controlled by Shari Redstone, lost $1.6 billion on streaming last year. Comcast lost $2.7 billion on its Peacock streaming service. Disney lost about $2.6 billion on its services, which include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Warner Bros. Discovery says its Max streaming service eked out a profit last year, but only by including HBO sales through cable distributors.\nAt the same time, shares of the disrupters \u2014 Netflix and Amazon \u2014 are close to record highs.\nMr. Malone, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Diller all came of age during the golden era of television. Mr. Malone, 83, clawed his way to a multibillion dollar fortune by building a cable empire, and is an influential shareholder in Warner Bros. Discovery and a longtime mentor to its chief executive, David Zaslav. Mr. Roberts, 64, succeeded his father as chairman, chief executive and the most influential shareholder of Comcast. Since then, he has transformed Comcast into a broadband giant and, by acquiring NBCUniversal, into a media powerhouse. Mr. Diller, 82, is chairman of IAC, the digital media company, and a veteran TV and movie executive. His long and successful tenure in entertainment and media has earned him a position as one of the industry\u2019s most sought-after senior statesman.\nBy comparison, the heads of the disrupters, Netflix and Amazon, are younger, brash newcomers, with little attachment to Hollywood\u2019s golden age.\nTed Sarandos, 59, co-chief executive of Netflix, worked his way up through the now-defunct DVD industry before going straight to Netflix when the company was still renting DVDs by mail. Mike Hopkins, 55, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, was steeped in digital as chief executive of Hulu, the pioneering streaming service owned by Disney, Fox and NBCU,before joining Sony as head of its television unit in 2017. He came to Amazon in 2020 and reports to the company\u2019s chief executive, Andy Jassy, 56, who has no professional background in entertainment.\nOver the past five months, The New York Times interviewed those three older executives, and the two younger ones, as well as numerous other owners and senior executives of major media companies to assess the problems facing the industry and what the future landscape could look like.\nRarely do these executives speak so candidly, on the record, about the challenge in front of them. And the meetings on the yacht aside, rarely do executives in that stratosphere get together to discuss strategy. Not only are many of them fierce rivals \u2014 Mr. Roberts famously drove up the cost of Disney\u2019s 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets by bidding against Disney\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger \u2014 but meetings among direct competitors might attract unwelcome attention from antitrust regulators.\nIn our conversations, there were still plenty of disagreements, but some consistent themes emerged as well \u2014 all with major implications for investors, advertisers and audiences.\nStreaming has long been hailed as a promising business, because companies like Netflix can add additional subscribers at little extra cost. The more paying subscribers a service has, the more the company\u2019s costs can be spread out over a large base, lowering the cost per subscriber.\nBut those subscribers want lots of options, and the costs of making enough programming can be enormous. As a result, a streaming service\u2019s profitability depends in large part on how many paying subscribers are needed before those TV shows and movies become cost-effective.\nThere was a time when industry executives hoped that number might be as low as 100 million.\nBut now the consensus among many of the executives interviewed is that the number is at least 200 million, and possibly more.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a full entertainment service with live sports and tent-pole blockbusters today, 200 million is a number that can give you the scale with the hope for growth over time,\u201d Mr. Hopkins of Amazon said.\nBob Chapek, Disney\u2019s chief executive until 2022, also agreed that 200 million was the number that meant \u201cyou\u2019re big enough to compete.\u201d\nNetflix has reached that, and then some, with about 270 million paying subscribers. Moreover, those subscribers pay an industry-leading average of more than $11 per month.\nNetflix is highly profitable, with operating margins of 28 percent. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix reported revenue of $9.4 billion, and $2.3 billion in net income. No one else comes close.\nDisney and Amazon are the only other streaming services with more than 200 million subscribers. While Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the number of its Prime Video subscribers, Mr. Hopkins said the number was well above 200 million and growing. Disney+ and Hulu, which is also owned by Disney, have just over 200 million subscribers combined.\nIn May, Disney said its entertainment streaming services eked out a small profit. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose profit margins or losses, and streaming is embedded in a package of Prime services. But Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Andy Jassy,has saidthat Prime Video will be \u201ca large and profitable business\u201d on its own.\nThe costs of attracting \u2014 and keeping \u2014 those millions of customers is no cheap feat.\nOverall, Netflix has said it will spend about $17 billion this year on programming, about what it did before last year\u2019s Hollywood strikes depressed production. That level of spending has produced a golden age for A-list writers and actors, many of whom are flocking to the company. A new series, \u201c3 Body Problem,\u201d debuted a few months ago on Netflix at a reported cost of about $20 million per episode. It spent more than $200 million on \u201cThe Gray Man,\u201d starring Ryan Gosling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tall order to entertain the world,\u201d Mr. Sarandos of Netflix said. \u201cYou have to do it with regularity and dependably.\u201d\nFor Netflix, $17 billion represents only about half of its total revenue. But almost no competitor can match that spending level, the executives said, except for maybe Amazon. Amazon spent $300 million for six episodes of the spy thriller \u201cCitadel,\u201d or $50 million per episode \u2014 one of several major bets it has made.\nNot all of those pay off. But when they do, the impact can be huge, like wildcatters when they hit a gusher. Amazon paid $153 million for one season of \u201cFallout,\u201d a series based on the popular post apocalyptic video game. In April, \u201cFallout\u201d was the top streaming title, racking up over seven billion viewing minutes, according to Amazon.\nMr. Sarandos held out the company\u2019s recent \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d series as a prime example of why companies have to keep spending: because viewers expect a nearly endless supply of options, or they will hit the unsubscribe button.\n\u201cWhen you finish \u2018Baby Reindeer,\u2019 there\u2019s something else just as good,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that this notion of these other services, that they have nothing to watch problem, and that once you do a show and then you drag it out over 10 weeks or doing one episode at a time, you still end up in the same place, which is there\u2019s nothing to watch after it.\u201d\nThe data appear to bear him out. When cable TV was in its heyday, 1.5 to 2 percent of subscribers churned monthly, abandoning or suspending their service. The average churn across all streaming services is more than double that, according to data from analytics firm Antenna, with the churn rate of some smaller streaming services, like Paramount+, as high as 7 percent. Only Netflix has a churn rate below 4 percent.\nSome executives who oversee rivals to Netflix and Amazon say their companies can reduce spending by only producing hits. But that\u2019s been the holy grail ever since Hollywood was created, and no one has succeeded over the long term. Even Disney\u2019s Marvel franchise has stumbled at the box office lately.\nThat means streaming services need the resources to invest in a wide variety of projects, knowing there will be some, even many, relative failures for every hit. (\u201cCitadel\u201d is a case in point \u2014 it never made Nielsen\u2019s top 10 streaming shows.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s still more art than science,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said.\nAdding to the cost pressure, the executives said, is the soaring cost of sports programming. Even in the bygone era of traditional television, the broad appeal of sports was obvious. The big networks paid billions for must-see events like the Super Bowl and the N.B.A. Finals and much of what was left over went to Disney and Hearst-owned ESPN, one of the most lucrative cable franchises ever created.\nBut that was before streaming and the arrival of the deep-pocketed tech giants. Amazon now offers football games from the National Football League, NASCAR races, the W.N.B.A. with its newly minted star Caitlin Clark, the National Hockey League in Canada and Champions League soccer in Germany, Italy and Britain.\nApple TV+ also features Major League Baseball, as well as Major League Soccer.\nAlphabet\u2019s YouTube offers N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, a lineup of out-of-market football games. Even Netflix, which long shunned live sports, announced in May that it would stream N.F.L. games on Christmas Day for the next three years.\nThe appeal of live sports is both unique and twofold: They attract new streaming subscribers and reduce churn since viewers want to watch sports live. It is also a big draw for advertisers as streaming services look to grow their ad businesses.\nIt may not be an overstatement, the executives said, to say that a streaming service can\u2019t survive as a stand-alone business without sports.\nComcast\u2019s Peacock scored a huge success in January with its exclusive N.F.L. playoff game between Kansas City and Miami. The game was the biggest livestreaming event ever, with about32 million viewers. (Comcast\u2019s NBC network pays $2 billion annually for a package of N.F.L. broadcast rights.)\n\u201cSports seems like the simplest and most interesting thing,\u201d Mr. Malone said.\nThe result is bidding wars unlike anything experienced before in the media industry, currently on display during the protracted negotiations for a new 10-year N.B.A. rights contract. The rights, which are now shared by ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s Turner cable network, are being chased by NBC and Amazon, as well as ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery.\nWhile ESPN, Amazon and NBC are finalizing deals for their packages, Warner Bros. Discovery is seen at risk of being outbid, though executives at Warner Bros. believe they have the legal rights to match Amazon\u2019s bid. Many in the industry expect that the final deal will be more than triple the last N.B.A. contract.Which raises questions that executives didn\u2019t have a clear answers to:\nAs the cost of rights soars, will the streaming services actually make money on them? Or will marquee sports events function as loss leaders, drawing viewers to other fare, as they once did for the old broadcast networks?\nWall Street analysts and investors in streaming once fixated entirely on the number of subscribers, ignoring losses, in the belief that prices would someday rise substantially. That changed with dizzying speed in early 2022, when Netflix announced it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade.\nIt\u2019s now clear that price increases won\u2019t be the answer to streaming profitability for most services, the executives said. Netflix is the industry price leader and has pushed its monthly fee in the United States to $15.49 a month without ads. Few believe the monthly fee can get much above $20 a month for the foreseeable future.\nAfter years of championing an ad-free consumer experience, Netflix introduced an ad-supported subscription in 2022 at a steep discount of $6.99 a month. Disney+, Hulu, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s Max, Peacock and Paramount+ all offer cheaper, ad-supported subscriptions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to get price-sensitive consumers,\u201d said Mr. Chapek, who introduced an ad-supported tier while running Disney. \u201cHeavy users will still come and pay the higher monthly fee.\u201d\nMr. Chapek acknowledged that advertisers covet \u2014 and will pay more for \u2014 mass audiences. As a result, the streaming services have a strong incentive to produce programs with broad appeal instead of more niche content, including some of the kind that generates critical acclaim.\nNetflix shocked many in the industry last year when for the first time it revealed its most-watched programs over the prior six months. At the top were \u201cThe Night Agent,\u201d an action-thriller, and \u201cGinny and Georgia,\u201d a comedy-drama about a mother and daughter trying to forge a new life. Both shows were snubbed by Emmy voters, with a lone nomination for a song from \u201cGinny and Georgia.\u201d (\u201cSquid Game,\u201d developed in Korea, is Netflix\u2019s most-watched program ever.)\nAdvertisers, the executives say, also like that streaming services can target ads to specific users and demographics.\nThe results have been explosive. Netflix is on pace to generate roughly $1 billion in advertising revenue this year, according to estimates from eMarketer, and Disney has already generated $1.7 billion this fiscal year.\nThat kind of success suggests that streaming ads are here to stay. And some of the executives said streaming services predicted that companies would raise prices aggressively on ad-free tiers in an effort to drive consumers to ad-supported versions.\nHow many streaming services will consumers support? That was one of the great mysteries of the nascent streaming world, and the answer is coming into focus: not very many.\n\u201cCan your current business be a successful player and have long-term wealth generation, or are you going to be roadkill?\u201d Mr. Malone mused. \u201cI think all the small players will have to shrink down or go away.\u201d\nArecent Deloitte studyfound that American households paid an average of $61 a month for four streaming services, but that many didn\u2019t think the expense was worth it.\nThat suggests the once-unthinkable possibility, many of the executives said, that there will be only three or four streaming survivors: Netflix and Amazon, almost certainly. Probably some combination of Disney and Hulu. Apple remains a niche participant, but appears to be feeling its way into a long-term, albeit money-losing, presence, which it can afford to do. That leaves big question marks over Peacock, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s Max, and Paramount+.\nPeacock, with just 34 million subscribers, isn\u2019t trying to be another Netflix. By focusing on North America, and not trying to be all things to all customers, Mr. Roberts believes Peacock can achieve success on its own terms.\nPeacock also has the advantage to being embedded in the much larger Comcast, with its steady cash flow.\n\u201cWe all have a different calculus to define success in streaming,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cAs online viewing increases and internet usage skyrockets, I believe we have a special set of assets that put us in position to continue to monetize and more importantly innovate as this transition happens.\u201d\nAfter years of go-it-alone strategies, \u201cbundling\u201d \u2014 offering consumers a package of streaming services for a single fee \u2014 has become the latest strategy for reaching profitability among the smaller services.\nIn May, Comcast announced it would offer its broadband customers a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for $15 a month. Disney has bundled Disney+ and Hulu, with Max to be added this summer at an as-yet undisclosed price. Venu, a new sports streaming joint venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, is planning its release this fall.\nHowever innovative the arrangements, the executives said, the economics of bundling are complicated. Participants need to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t already subscribe to their individual channels at full price. They must also puzzle through how revenue should be divided among bundling participants of unequal stature.\nIt\u2019s also unclear that bundling will achieve the scale that participants may be hoping for. Many customers already subscribe to one or more of the bundle options. So it\u2019s not a matter of simply adding up subscribers. And if multiple subscriptions are offered at a discount to attract customers, the average revenue per user declines.\nJason Kilar, the founding Hulu chief executive and former chief executive of WarnerMedia, has called for an even more radical approach than bundling: a new company that would license movies and TV shows from the major studios and pay back close to 70 percent of the revenue to those studios.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call it the \u2018Spotify for Hollywood\u2019 path, where a large number of suppliers and studios contribute to a singular experience that delights fans,\u201d Mr. Kilar said. \u201cThe studios would be the ones that would be taking the majority of the economic returns from such a structure.\u201d\nMedia companies have started to embrace licensing deals after a period of avoiding them. During AT&T\u2019s ill-fated ownership of WarnerMedia, the company insisted that its content be shown exclusively on its Max streaming service. Disney pulled back on licensing deals when it started Disney+ in an effort to force fans to subscribe. Before he returned to Disney, in 2022, Mr. Iger compared licensing the company\u2019s franchises to selling nuclear weapons to \u201cthird-world countries.\u201d\nBut AT&T subsequently abandoned streaming, merging WarnerMedia into Discovery, and Mr. Iger has since embraced the nuclear option. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are again licensing their content to rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nOne company embodies the embrace of the licensing strategy: Sony Pictures Entertainment.\nSony, the studio behind \u201cSpider Man\u201d and \u201cMen in Black,\u201d rejected general entertainment streaming services years ago. Tony Vinciquerra, the company\u2019s chief executive, instead adopted what he has called an \u201carms dealer\u201d strategy, selling movies and TV shows to companies like Disney and Netflix.\nThe exception is that Sony operates a niche streamer, Crunchyroll, that focuses on anime, Japanese-style hand-drawn animation. Its success suggests that a small (more than 14 million subscribers worldwide) and low-cost operation can be profitable without going up against Netflix.\nMr. Vinciquerra pointed out that Sony\u2019s rivals running big streaming businesses were losing money on those services while at the same time seeing their traditional cable networks in decline.\n\u201cI\u2019m still scratching my head wondering what these companies will do here,\u201d Mr. Vinciquerra said, referring to the declining cable networks. \u201cThey all have these massive albatrosses around their neck that they can\u2019t do anything about right now.\u201d\nSo far, Sony\u2019s strategy appears to be working. Sony\u2019s Pictures Entertainment generated almost $11 billion of revenue in 2023, a 2 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, according to filings. In 2021, Sony struck deals to license movies to both Netflix and Disney worth an estimated $3 billion annually. Profits were roughly $1.2 billion, 10 percent lower than the previous year because of the actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes.\nUnlike Paramount or Disney, Sony Pictures is part of a sprawling global consumer electronics conglomerate. Sony recently teamed up with the private-equity giant Apollo Global Management to make a $26 billion bid for Paramount. But Sony is interested only in Paramount\u2019s film library and characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and has contemplated selling the rest of it \u2014 including the Paramount+ streaming service. But Sony has since backed away from its offer.\nThat\u2019s just the latest indication that expectations for merger deals have faded. Paramount is still looking for a buyer after months of tortured negotiations and is revamping its streaming strategy in the meantime. So far as is known, no one is pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery, free since April, to buy or be sold under the terms of its separation from AT&T. Potential buyers like Comcast are understandably wary of their decaying revenue bases in cable. And Disney is shackled with its own cable issues and is loaded with debt from buying 21st Century Fox.\nAll of these changes have had a big upside for viewers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a golden age, even with prices rising,\u201d Mr. Chapek said. \u201cYou get entire libraries built over decades plus all this new content, and you watch at your leisure.\u201d\nBut a change is underway, he said: \u201cNow we just have to make it viable for shareholders.\u201d\nThat will necessarily mean higher prices for customers, more advertising, and less \u2014 and less expensive \u2014 content. That\u2019s already happening. On average, consumers spend 27 percent more on streaming than they did a year ago, according to the recent Deloitte study, while satisfaction has declined. While some of that may be because of the limited new content offered last year during the Hollywood strikes, Disney and pretty much everyone except Netflix and Amazon have vowed to reduce spending and produce less new content.\nThe rise of advertising may be a windfall for streaming services, but the quest for the mass audiences that advertisers seek risks turning the streaming landscape into a sea of police procedurals and hospital dramas punctuated by major sports events and blockbuster concerts. Ironically, that\u2019s pretty much the old model once dominated by the four ad-supported broadcast networks.\nNetflix and Amazon executives acknowledge the risks to high-quality programming but promise that won\u2019t happen on their watch. They contend they have enough scale that their prestige programs can be profitable and reach a vast audience \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of their overall subscriber base.\n\u201cWe can do prestige TV at scale,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t only do prestige,\u201d he added, citing popular shows like \u201cNight Agent.\u201d\nMr. Hopkins of Amazon said \u201cprocedurals and other tried and true formats do well for us, but we also need big swings that have customers saying \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe that just happened\u2019 and will have people telling their friends.\u201d\n\u201cWe want rabid fans,\u201d he said.\nBryan Lourd, chief executive and co-chairman of the powerful Creative Artists Agency, said media executives needed to put aside financial engineering and remember that creativity \u2014 and entertaining customers \u2014 was the only way to win in the long run.\n\u201cThe task at hand is to keep the customer at the front of your brain,\u201d Mr. Lourd said. \u201cWhen people stop doing that is when things start to go wrong.\u201d\nOn Mr. Diller\u2019s yacht that day in February, Mr. Malone\u2019s advice to Mr. Roberts was simple: In light of the challenges facing the industry, Comcast should continue its current strategy of investing in other areas like theme parks.\n\u201cNow, are they large enough to be the biggest?\u201d said Mr. Diller, speaking generally about streaming services besides Netflix. \u201cNo, that game was lost some years ago. Netflix commands not all the territory, but they command the leading territory right now. They essentially are in a position of dictating policy.\u201d\nBut Mr. Diller, like many of the other executives interviewed for this article, sees a path forward for streaming companies once they stop trying to be Netflix. (That\u2019s the strategy already adopted by Mr. Roberts of Comcast.)\nThe focus, according to Mr. Diller, needs to be on what \u201chas been true since the beginning of time.\u201d\nThe business, he said, \u201cis based on hit programming, making a program, a movie, a something that people want to see.\u201d"

        "title": "Can Apple Rescue the Vision Pro?",
        "fulltext": "When I first got my hands on anApple Vision Proearly this year, it felt like magic.\nI loved the $3,500 \u201cspatial computing\u201d headset, even though Icouldn\u2019t really figure outwhat it was for. For weeks, I took it everywhere, enduring judgmental glares (or were they jealous stares?) from colleagues at the office, strangers at coffee shops and fellow passengers on airplanes. I even used the Vision Pro in the back seat of a self-driving Waymo car, which I believe qualifies me for some kind of \u201cMr. San Francisco\u201d award.\nBut novelty fades, and today I barely use the Vision Pro at all. Every few weeks, I strap it to my head to do some focused writing, or watch a movie in bed while my wife sleeps. Otherwise, it sits on a shelf collecting dust.\nApple hasn\u2019t released sales figures, but analysts\u2019 estimatessuggestthat the device has been a flop, selling fewer units than expected. Social media isn\u2019t buzzing with videos of enthusiastic\u201cVision Bros\u201dwearing their headsets in public, as it was in the days after the device\u2019s release. Some early adoptersreturned their Vision Prosfor refunds, and lightly used headsets aresellingfor as little as $2,500 on resale websites.\nWhen I took a casual poll of other Vision Pro owners I know \u2014 mostly journalists and tech workers \u2014 I learned that few of them were using theirs, either.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t touched mine in a month,\u201d one friend texted. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I was so bullish.\u201d\nAt itsannual developer conferenceon Monday, Apple announced a few new features for the Vision Pro, including a new version of its VisionOS operating system, new gesture controls and a way of turning old photos into 3-D \u201cspatial photos\u201d that can be viewed on the device. Apple also said it would soon begin selling the Vision Pro in countries including China, Japan and Britain.\nBut these were modest tweaks, not the sweeping overhaul that many Vision Pro fans were hoping for. And the Vision Pro got upstaged by Apple\u2019s newer, shinier project \u2014 generative A.I., which the company is calling \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d and is pushing into many of its products and services, including asouped-up version of Sirithat will be available on iPhones this year.\nIt\u2019s enough to make me wonder: Is Apple giving up on the device that, just months ago, itsexecutives were heraldingas the future of computing?\nYou probably don\u2019t own a Vision Pro, so I won\u2019t bore you with a full list of my gripes about the product, or the reasons I suspect that Apple is losing interest in it. But here are a few of its most glaring shortcomings:\nThe first, and most obvious, is the cost. Apple may consider $3,500 a fair price for a first-generation device. (It may evenbea fair price, considering all the pricey, cutting-edge components that are packed in.) But $3,500 is simply more than the vast majority of consumers will consider spending on an experimental device that doesn\u2019t replace their smartphone or laptop, and that doesn\u2019t fill an obvious need in their life.\nI don\u2019t mind the headset itself, although, as many reviewers have pointed out, it\u2019s too heavy to be worn comfortably for long stretches. (My longest Vision Pro session was three hours, and I felt slightly hung over afterward.) But there are plenty of other annoying hardware issues. Carrying around an external battery pack is a bummer, it doesn\u2019t work well in dark or dimly lit rooms, and there\u2019s no good way to input text \u2014 so if you want to use the Vision Pro for any kind of text-based work, you have to use a Bluetooth keyboard.\nThe Vision Pro also still lacks some basic features. You can\u2019t make or receive phone calls with it, the way iPhone users can with the Mac and the iPad. The Vision Pro is compatible only with Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad, not with Bluetooth mice. And the guest mode \u2014 the way you show the Vision Pro to your friends, when they ask to try it for themselves \u2014 is a mess. (This week, Apple announced that the next version of the Vision Pro\u2019s operating system, which will arrive this year, will have improved mouse support and a better guest user experience.)\nBut the biggest disappointment with the Vision Pro is how few good apps there are. Several months after its debut, there\u2019s still no native YouTube or Netflix app. There\u2019s no Spotify, no Instagram, no DoorDash. (You can still use some of these services in a web browser, or use unofficial third-party apps, but it\u2019s a worse experience.)\nSome of these apps are missing because of corporate infighting. (Google and Meta, for example, have their own virtual reality ambitions and presumably don\u2019t want to give Apple\u2019s product a boost by making apps for it.) But others amount to a lack of confidence. Developers don\u2019t want to make apps for platforms that nobody uses, and their reluctance so far \u2014 only about 2,000 apps have been developed for the Vision Pro, Apple said on Monday \u2014 says something about the device\u2019s tepid reception.\nApple has also been slow to update its own offerings for the Vision Pro, like a series of \u201cimmersive videos,\u201d filmed on special 3-D cameras and released through Apple TV. These videos \u2014 which included a prehistoric nature film and a \u201crehearsal room\u201d video of Alicia Keys and her band as they perform a song \u2014 were designed to show off the Vision Pro\u2019s high-definition graphics and its \u201cspatial audio\u201d feature, and they are among the best things you can do with a Vision Pro.\nBut Apple hasn\u2019t released new immersive videos at a regular clip. And once you run out, what you end up watching on the Vision Pro is mostly the same two-dimensional stuff you\u2019d watch on a TV or an iPad. It\u2019s fun to throw on the Vision Pro occasionally to watch \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d on a screen the size of a basketball court, but most of the time, it\u2019s not worth the trouble.\nI still think the Vision Pro is a remarkable piece of technology. Every friend who has tried mine on has oohed and aahed, and said how futuristic it felt. (Although tellingly, none have gone out and bought their own.) And if Apple is content to have the Vision Pro remain a niche entertainment device, that\u2019s its right.\nBut if Apple wants the Vision Pro to appeal to the masses, it needs to make some changes. It should lower the price. (Yes, even if it means selling headsets at a loss.) It should fix the bugs, polish the rough spots and release more immersive content. Most urgently, it should find and fund potential killer apps \u2014 new games, productivity tools and entertainment experiences that take advantage of the Vision Pro\u2019s features, and that could be reason enough for a person to buy one.\nIn fairness, the Vision Pro is still new, and other Apple products have taken a generation or two to find their footing. (The Apple Watch famously fizzled when it was launched as a high-end fashion accessory, until Apple discovered that fitness tracking was the killer feature.) The company has said repeatedly that it considers the Vision Pro an early experiment \u2014 \u201ctomorrow\u2019s technology today,\u201d asTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, put it\u2014 not a fully formed product.\nBut I worry that the Vision Pro has slipped into a dangerous purgatory. It\u2019s not Apple\u2019s flashiest new project \u2014 that\u2019s all the A.I. stuff, which Wall Street is clamoring for and which many users are excited about. And it\u2019s not one of Apple\u2019s big, established cash cows, like the iPhone or the iPad, that people will buy even if each version is only slightly better than the last.\nTo live up to its potential, the Vision Pro needs a little more love and, well, a little more vision. Apple needs better answers to basic questions like: What is this for? How will it improve my life, or make me more productive than other things I could buy for $3,500? What can I do on it that I can\u2019t do on my laptop, or a big TV?\nOtherwise, the Vision Pro may be destined for obsolescence. And I and my fellow Vision Bros may emerge as theGoogle Glassholesof 2024 \u2014 a brave but ultimately foolish tribe of nerds who took a gamble on a futuristic new technology and lost."

        "title": "What the Arrival of A.I. Phones and Computers Means for Our Data",
        "fulltext": "Apple, Microsoft and Google are heralding a new era of what they describe as artificially intelligent smartphones and computers. The devices, they say, will automate tasks like editing photos and wishing a friend a happy birthday.\nBut to make that work, these companies need something from you: more data.\nIn this new paradigm, your Windows computer will take a screenshot of everything you do every few seconds. An iPhone will stitch together information across many apps you use. And an Android phone can listen to a call in real time to alert you to a scam.\nIs this information you are willing to share?\nThis change has significant implications for our privacy. To provide the new bespoke services, the companies and their devices need more persistent, intimate access to our data than before. In the past, the way we used apps and pulled up files and photos on phones and computers was relatively siloed. A.I. needs an overview to connect the dots between what we do across apps, websites and communications, security experts say.\n\u201cDo I feel safe giving this information to this company?\u201d Cliff Steinhauer, a director at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a nonprofit focusing on cybersecurity, said about the companies\u2019 A.I. strategies.\nAll of this is happening because OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT upended the tech industry nearly two years ago. Apple, Google, Microsoft and others have since overhauled their product strategies, investing billions in new services under the umbrella term of A.I. They are convinced this new type of computing interface \u2014 one that is constantly studying what you are doing to offer assistance \u2014 will become indispensable.\nThe biggest potential security risk with this change stems from a subtle shift happening in the way our new devices work, experts say. BecauseA.I. can automate complex actions \u2014 like scrubbing unwanted objects from a photo\u2014 it sometimes requires more computational power than our phones can handle. That means more of our personal data may have to leave our phones to be dealt with elsewhere.\nThe information is being transmitted to the so-called cloud, a network of servers that are processing the requests. Once information reaches the cloud, it could be seen by others, including company employees, bad actors and government agencies. And while some of our data has always been stored in the cloud, our most deeply personal, intimate data that was once for our eyes only \u2014 photos, messages and emails \u2014 now may be connected and analyzed by a company on its servers.\nThe tech companies say they have gone to great lengths to secure people\u2019s data.\nFor now, it\u2019s important to understand what will happen to our information when we use A.I. tools, so I got more information from the companies on their data practices and interviewed security experts. I plan to wait and see whether the technologies work well enough before deciding whether it\u2019s worth it to share my data.\nHere\u2019s what to know.\nApple recently announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of A.I. services and its first major entry into the A.I. race.\nThe new A.I. services will be built into its fastest iPhones, iPads and Macs starting this fall. People will be able to use it to automatically remove unwanted objects from photos, create summaries of web articles and write responses to text messages and emails. Apple is also overhauling itsvoice assistant, Siri, to make it more conversational and give it access to data across apps.\nDuring Apple\u2019s conference this month when it introduced Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, shared how it could work: Mr. Federighi pulled up an email from a colleague asking him to push back a meeting, but he was supposed to see a play that night starring his daughter. His phone then pulled up his calendar, a document containing details about the play and a maps app to predict whether he would be late to the play if he agreed to a meeting at a later time.\nApple said it was striving to process most of the A.I. data directly on its phones and computers, which would prevent others, including Apple, from having access to the information. But for tasks that have to be pushed to servers, Apple said, it has developed safeguards, including scrambling the data through encryption and immediately deleting it.\nApple has also put measures in place so that its employees do not have access to the data, the company said. Apple also said it would allow security researchers to audit its technology to make sure it was living up to its promises.\nApple\u2019s commitment to purging user data from its servers sets it apart from other companies that hold on to data. But Apple has been unclear about which new Siri requests could be sent to the company\u2019s servers, said Matthew Green, a security researcher and an associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, who was briefed by Apple on its new technology. Anything that leaves your device is inherently less secure, he said.\nApple said that when Apple Intelligence is released, users would be able to see a report of what requests are leaving the device to be processed in the cloud.\nMicrosoft is bringing A.I. to the old-fashioned laptop.\nLast week, it began rolling out Windows computers called Copilot+ PC, which start at $1,000. The computers contain a new type of chip and other gear that Microsoft says will keep your data private and secure. The PCs can generate images and rewrite documents, among other new A.I.-powered features.\nThe company also introduced Recall, a new system to help users quickly find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read or websites they have browsed. Microsoft compares Recall to having a photographic memory built into your PC.\nTo use it, you can type casual phrases, such as \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a video call I had with Joe recently when he was holding an \u2018I Love New York\u2019 coffee mug.\u201d The computer will then retrieve the recording of the video call containing those details.\nTo accomplish this, Recall takes screenshots every five seconds of what the user is doing on the machine and compiles those images into a searchable database. The snapshots are stored and analyzed directly on the PC, so the data is not reviewed by Microsoft or used to improve its A.I., the company said.\nStill, security researchers warned about potential risks, explaining that the data couldeasily expose everything you\u2019ve ever typed or viewedif it was hacked. In response, Microsoft, which had intended to roll out Recall last week, postponed its release indefinitely.\nThe PCs come outfitted with Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 11 operating system. It has multiple layers of security, said David Weston, a company executive overseeing security.\nGoogle last month also announced a suite of A.I. services.\nOne of its biggest reveals was a new A.I.-powered scam detector for phone calls. The tool listens to phone calls in real time, and if the caller sounds like a potential scammer (for instance, if the caller asks for a banking PIN), the company notifies you. Google said people would have to activate the scam detector, which is completely operated by the phone. That means Google will not listen to the calls.\nGoogle announced another feature, Ask Photos, that does require sending information to the company\u2019s servers. Users can ask questions like \u201cWhen did my daughter learn to swim?\u201d to surface the first images of their child swimming.\nGoogle said its workers could, in rare cases, review the Ask Photos conversations and photo data to address abuse or harm, and the information might also be used to help improve its photos app. To put it another way, your question and the photo of your child swimming could be used to help other parents find images of their children swimming.\nGoogle said its cloud was locked down with security technologies like encryption and protocols to limit employee access to data.\n\u201cOur privacy-protecting approach applies to our A.I. features, no matter if they are powered on-device or in the cloud,\u201d Suzanne Frey, a Google executive overseeing trust and privacy, said in a statement.\nBut Mr. Green, the security researcher, said Google\u2019s approach to A.I. privacy felt relatively opaque.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that my very personal photos and very personal searches are going out to a cloud that isn\u2019t under my control,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Welcome to the Era of the A.I. Smartphone",
        "fulltext": "Every year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, like cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are focusing on reinventing our phones with artificial intelligence.\nAt its annual software developer conference on Monday, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming this fall to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. The new tools include arevamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an A.I. system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles and craft responses to text messages and emails.\nApple\u2019s news followed Google\u2019s Android announcements last month, which included an A.I. system that automatically summarizes audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam and helps students with homework.\nBecause A.I. tech is still new, it\u2019s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages \u2014 also known as thegreen bubble. Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to communicate for more than a decade.\nApple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android this fall. Here\u2019s what to know about how our smartphones will change.\nApple said it had completely reworked Siri, its 13-year-old virtual assistant.\nThe assistant will soon be powered by Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s version of a \u201clarge language model.\u201d That type of A.I. technology uses statistics and complex algorithms to guess what words belong together, similar to the autocomplete feature on your phone. It\u2019s the same type of underlying technology we\u2019ve seen powering chatbots likeOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPTandGoogle\u2019s Gemini. Apple said its system was more private than others\u2019 because people\u2019s data would remain on their iPhones.\nThe upgrade will make Siri capable of processing the context of a conversation, and allow users to speak more naturally with the virtual assistant. For instance, you could say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in Santa Cruz? Oh, wait, I meant San Francisco,\u201d followed by \u201cSchedule a coffee meeting there tomorrow at 9 a.m.\u201d\nThe new and more capable Siri will also be able to handle more complex tasks, such as searching your photo album for an image of your driver\u2019s license and pulling the ID number to paste into a form, Apple said.\nIn contrast, the old version of Siri could react only to a database of commands and questions it was programmed to understand, such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d and \u201cSchedule a coffee meeting in San Francisco.\u201d\nApple Intelligence will also enable iPhone users to automatically generate images inside messages, Apple said. For instance, if you wish a friend a happy birthday, the A.I. could review your photo album for an image of that friend, after which it could generate an avatar of that person with balloons.\nThe A.I. will also be usable in writing apps like Mail and Notes. Users can highlight text for proofreading or rewriting in a different style. Inside the Safari web browser, users can also highlight articles to generate short summaries.\nApple said it had formed a partnership with OpenAI so that Siri could tap into ChatGPT for help with tasks like generating a list of recipe ideas.\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and its partner Microsoft for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\nThe A.I. features are arriving only on the newest, fastest iPhones, including the iPhone 15 Pro, this fall.\nOnlyowners of Google\u2019s Pixel phonescan use most of Google\u2019s latest A.I. features; support for other Android devices is expected later this year.\nFor the past year, Google has let users test Gemini, its new A.I. assistant, whichrequires downloading an app. (By default, Android phones will still come loaded with Google Assistant, the virtual assistant that is similar to Amazon\u2019s Alexa and the older version of Siri.) Similar to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Gemini acts like a chatbot that generates responses to whatever prompt you throw at it, including \u201cWrite a poem about dogs in San Francisco.\u201d\nA new version of Gemini, called Nano, focuses on handling A.I. tasks directly on Pixel phones rather than processing the requests on Google\u2019s servers, for privacy purposes.\nOne feature for scam detection involves using A.I. to listen to your phone calls. If the conversation fits the pattern of a scam, such as a fraudster\u2019s asking for your online banking password, an alert is sent to your phone.\nAnother feature, Circle to Search, lets users circle an image to ask Google for information. This feature has now been expanded to let students circle a math or physics problem for help. Google\u2019s A.I. will then generate a list of steps on how to solve the problem.\nGemini Nano can also take a transcript automatically generated from an audio recording and create written summaries, which could be useful for meetings. Another tool, Magic Compose, can be used inside Google\u2019s Messages app to quickly rewrite a message in a different style.\nFor more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have confronted the green-versus-blue bubble divide. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.\nApple is finally taking a step toward bridging that divide. It said that in iOS 18, its messages app would adopt Rich Communication Services, a standard that Google and others integrated into their apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will be higher quality.\nThe result will probably be profound. Many iPhone and Android users said they felt discouraged sending messages to each other because the image quality was poor. The Justice Department, which this yearaccused Apple of placing restrictions on its phones to maintain a monopoly, viewed the messaging incompatibility as a pressure tactic to persuade people to buy iPhones.\nApple also said it was bringing a feature to its iMessage app that might feel long overdue: the ability to schedule a message to send later. That could help iPhone users respect one another\u2019s boundaries by scheduling a message to send when the recipient is off work, for example."

        "title": "Hollywood Sharpens Aim at Online Pirates",
        "fulltext": "In recent years, Hollywood has become much better at hunting pirates. Just last week, five men were convicted of operating Jetflicks, an illegal streaming site that federal prosecutors said offered astolen lineupof TV shows and movies that was larger than the combined catalogs of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.\nBut thieves are also getting better, moving operations overseas and taking advantage of the rising popularity of streaming to steal more content.\nSo entertainment companies \u2014 already under pressure from Wall Street to improve streaming economics \u2014 are intensifying their antipiracy efforts, hiring a former F.B.I. official to lead the drive and renewing a push for federal legislation to combat online thievery overseas. The companies, which include Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery, are also expanding their piracy policing to include live sports.\nOn Monday, the Motion Picture Association, a trade group that represents those companies and others, said it had hired Larissa L. Knapp, a 27-year veteran of the F.B.I., as its top pirate chaser. In her time at the bureau, Ms. Knapp served in senior positions in national security, counterterrorism, intelligence and cybersecurity. She got her start at the F.B.I. as a special agent investigating computer hacking and intellectual property crimes and ultimately became the bureau\u2019s fourth-highest-ranking official and highest-ranking woman.\nHer formal title at the Motion Picture Association will be executive vice president and chief of global content protection. Ms. Knapp succeeds Jan van Voorn, a Dutch antipiracy expert who left in March to run IP House, a private-equity-backed start-up that focuses on copyright enforcement.\n\u201cLarissa\u2019s relationships in law enforcement will be enormously helpful to us,\u201dCharles H. Rivkin, the Motion Picture Association\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from guys on street corners selling counterfeit DVDs. This is global organized crime. The people stealing our movies and television shows are also involved with sex trafficking, money laundering \u2014 all the ills of society.\u201d\nThe association\u2019s antipiracy effort is known as ACE, which stands for the innocuous-sounding Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment. Started in 2017, ACE is a coalition of more than 50 media companies around the world. Before its creation, the Motion Picture Association was completing about a dozen antipiracy actions a year; it now executes a dozen or more actions a week. There were 1,400 illegal streaming sites in North America in 2019, according to Mr. Rivkin. The number is now closer to 200.\n\u201cACE has been remarkably successful since its 2017 launch, but the battle against piracy continues,\u201d Ms. Knapp said in an email. \u201cThe idea of working with an organization strong enough to take this on is extremely appealing to me.\u201d\nFighting piracy overseas \u2014 particularly in Asia \u2014 remains arduous. MUSO, a piracy tracking firm, said in January that video sites stocked with stolen content attracted 141 billion visits worldwide in 2023, up 12 percent from 2019.\n\u201cThe bad guys have left for other places where it is more difficult for us because the rule of law is not as strong,\u201d Mr. Rivkin said. \u201cThe top three English-language piracy sites are all located in Vietnam.\u201d\nTo that end, the Motion Picture Association has started to campaign on Capitol Hill for a new tool: court-mandated site blocking. Studios want a law that gives them the ability \u2014 under a process overseen by a federal judge \u2014 to force internet service providers to block access to overseas piracy sites. In recent years, more than 60 countries have adopted similar legislation, Mr. Rivkin said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s time for it to happen in America.\u201d\nSome entertainment companies see antipiracy efforts as a way to deliver growth. In countries like Spain and Mexico, for instance, ACE-facilitated shutdowns of piracy sites have resulted in tens of thousands of new customers for legitimate services.\nHollywood in some ways is still stinging from the 2012 failure of the more aggressiveStop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which was also aimed at overseas sites. The Motion Picture Association was badly beaten by Google and other technology companies, which argued that the legislation would, in effect, allow the government to censor the internet.\nSince then, the proliferation of legitimate streaming services has made it easier for pirates to steal content. \u201cThey can take a movie on one of our streaming services in less than four seconds and upload it three seconds later,\u201d Mr. Rivkin said.\nHow much resistance from tech lobbyists will the Motion Picture Association face this time? It\u2019s unclear. Since the SOPA fight, Apple and Amazon have both moved into Hollywood, and Netflix has become a full-fledged member of the Motion Picture Association. While Apple TV+ and Amazon are not formal members, they are deeply involved with ACE.\nOne technology trade group has made its displeasure known: the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which counts Google and Meta \u2014 and Amazon and Apple \u2014 as members. At acongressional hearingin December, Matthew Schruers, president of that association, said there was \u201ca long history of site-blocking injunctions leading to overreach.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt is simply not possible to craft a uniquely American, speech-protecting site-blocking regime.\u201d"

        "title": "Hey, Siri! Let\u2019s Talk About How Apple Is Giving You an A.I. Makeover.",
        "fulltext": "Each June, Apple unveils its newest software features for the iPhone at its futuristic Silicon Valley campus. But at its annual developer conference on Monday, the company will shine a spotlight on a feature that isn\u2019t new:Siri, its talking assistant, which has been around for more than a decade.\nWhat will be different this time is the technology powering Siri:generative artificial intelligence.\nIn recent months, Adrian Perica, Apple\u2019s vice president of corporate development, has helped spearhead an effort to bring generative A.I. to the masses, said two people with knowledge of the work, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the effort.\nMr. Perica and his colleagues have talked with leading A.I. companies, including Google and OpenAI, seeking a partner to help Apple deliver generative A.I. across its business. Apple recently struck a deal with OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, to fold its technology into the iPhone, two people familiar with the agreement said. It was still in talks with Google as of last week, two people familiar with the conversations said.\nThat has helped lead to a more conversational and versatile version of Siri, which will be shown on Monday, three people familiar with the company said. Siri will be powered by a generative A.I. system developed by Apple, which will allow the talking assistant to chat rather than just respond to one question at a time. Apple will market its new A.I. capabilities as Apple Intelligence, a person familiar with the marketing plan said.\nApple, OpenAI and Google declined to comment. Apple\u2019s agreement with OpenAI was previously reported byThe InformationandBloomberg, which also reportedthe name for Apple\u2019s A.I.system.\nApple\u2019s move into generative A.I. will test whether the company can once again enter a new market and redefine it. While Apple didn\u2019t make the first digital music player, smartphone or smartwatch, it transformed those categories with the iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch. Now, after two years of watching Microsoft, Meta, Google and Samsung integrate generative A.I. into products, Apple is going from observer to potential challenger.\nWeaving generative A.I. into iPhones is also set to be a key moment for the technology, which can answer questions, create images and write software code. Apple will broaden generative A.I.\u2019s reach to more than a billion users and determine how useful it is for everyday iPhone customers.\nTo date, the technology\u2019s promise has been undercut by its flaws. Google has introduced and pared back generative A.I. search abilities thatrecommended people eat rocks, while Microsoft has beencriticized for the security vulnerabilitiesof a personal computer that uses A.I. to record every second of activity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still figuring A.I. out because it\u2019s so complicated,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, president of Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. \u201cApple is pretty conservative when it comes to everything, so I don\u2019t know that they will \u2018wow\u2019 people. But they have to do this because it will be how we interact with technology going forward.\u201d\nWall Street investors, and not Main Street consumers, are a major reason Apple is jumping into A.I. The technology has lifted the values of Microsoft, a big player in generative A.I., andNvidia, which sells A.I. chips. In January, Microsoftdethroned Appleas the world\u2019s most valuable public tech company.\nThe market reshuffle happened as Apple stayed silent about A.I. The company has a policy of not sharing future product plans, but as its stock position dropped, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, broke protocol and told Wall Street analysts in a call in May that it would soon introduce generative A.I. offerings.\nApple\u2019s share price has rebounded since Mr. Cook made that commitment. As of Friday, Apple\u2019s stock had risen 6 percent this year, less than Microsoft\u2019s 14 percent increase and Nvidia\u2019s 151 percent jump.\n(The New York Times hassuedOpenAI and Microsoft over usage of copyrighted articles related to A.I. systems.)\nApple has long been under pressure to revamp Siri, which wowed people when it was released in 2011 but then did not change much over time. The talking assistant\u2019s shortfalls were eventually featured by the comedian Larry David during the final season of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d in a scene wherehe yelled at Sirias it repeatedly provided the wrong directions.\nEnter OpenAI, which has positioned itself at the forefront of the generative A.I. movement with ChatGPT. Apple plans to complement what OpenAI offers withtechnology that it developed in-houseto do select iPhone tasks. Its system will help Siri set timers, create calendar appointments and summarize text messages.\nThe company also plans to promote its revamped Siri as more private than rival A.I. services because it will process many requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers. Apple\u2019s privacy focus proved to be a sticking point during negotiations with OpenAI and Google because it wanted to limit what iPhone data partners received, a person familiar with the negotiations said.\nIt\u2019s possible that Apple may look to offer the improved Siri as a service, analysts said. By charging $5 a month for people to use the talking assistant, the company could generate $4 billion to $8 billion in annual sales, according to Morgan Stanley.\nThough it has been late to the generative A.I. race, Apple has pursued the idea of a digital personal assistant for about 40 years.\nIn 1987, it released aconcept videoshowing a professor speaking to an assistant called the Knowledge Navigator, which could manage his calendar and pull up his lecture notes. The video helped inspire a group of A.I. researchers atSRI International, an independent research laboratory, tocreate a virtual assistantcalled Siri in 2008.\nIn 2010,Apple bought the technologyfor $200 million. The companyreleased Siri a year lateron the iPhone, demonstrating its ability to provide the time in Paris or pull up a list of 14 Greek restaurants.\n\u201cWe set in motion a user-interface paradigm that no one has really improved upon,\u201d said Tom Gruber, a Siri co-founder who worked at Apple until 2018. \u201cBut we still don\u2019t have a personal A.I. \u2014 an assistant that knows my life. With generative A.I., it\u2019s feasible now.\u201d\nCade MetzandBrian X. Chencontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple Jumps Into A.I. Fray With Apple Intelligence",
        "fulltext": "Nearly two years after OpenAI ignited a race to add generative artificial intelligence into products, Apple jumped into the competition on Monday, as it revealed plans to bring the technology to more than a billion iPhone users around the world.\nDuring a two-hour presentation from its futuristic Silicon Valley campus, Apple said that it would be using generative A.I. to power what it is calling Apple Intelligence. The system will prioritize messages and notifications and will offer writing tools that are capable of proofreading and suggesting what users have written in emails, notes or text. It also will result in a major upgrade for Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant.\nApple\u2019s plans to offer A.I. in its iPhones represents the next step in bringing artificial intelligence into the consumer mainstream. Apple, the marquee name of Silicon Valley, could do more than any other company to add credibility to a technology that has more than a few critics, who worry that it is mistake-prone and could add to the flood of misinformation already on the internet.\nApple\u2019s new A.I. features could also help calm concerns that the iPhone maker had slipped behind its biggest rivals in the tech industry\u2019s embrace of artificial intelligence. The value of other tech companies, like Microsoft and Nvidia, has ballooned because of their aggressive A.I. plans. Earlier this year, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the most valuable technology company in the world.\nWhile introducing its new A.I., Apple emphasized how it planned to integrate the technology into its products with privacy in mind. The company said that the technology, which can answer questions, create images and write software code, would perform sensitive tasks. It showed how the system would be able to automatically determine if a rescheduled meeting time would complicate plans to attend a child\u2019s theater performance.\nIt said that the computer processing would be done on an iPhone rather than in data centers, where personal information has a greater risk of being compromised. For complex requests that require more computing power, it has created a cloud network with Apple semiconductors that, it said, is more private because it\u2019s not stored or accessible, even by Apple.\nApple struck a deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to support some of its A.I. capabilities. Requests that its system can\u2019t field will be directed to ChatGPT. For example, a user could say that they have salmon, lemon and tomatoes and want help planning dinner with those ingredients. Users would have to choose to direct those requests to ChatGPT, ensuring that they know that the chatbot \u2014 not Apple \u2014 is responsible if the answers are unsatisfying. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, attended the Apple event.\nApple\u2019s deal with OpenAI, which already has a close partnership with Microsoft, is another indication that the young San Francisco company has clearly become the tech industry\u2019s leading developer of A.I. technology\n\u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to be sure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products,\u201d said Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. \u201cIt has to be powerful enough to help the things that matter the most to you. It has to be intuitive and easy to do.\u201d\nApple also said that it would be making improvements to its iPhone software system. This fall, messaging will add the ability to schedule messages and respond to messages by tapping back with more emojis. Apple will also release a redesigned Photos app to make it easier to browse images by topics like pets and travel. And it said that iPhone users would be able to send high-resolution images to Android smartphones.\nApple brings several strengths to the A.I. race. Its semiconductor development team is among the most talented in the industry and has been making chips that power complex A.I. functions for years. The company has also marketed itself as being better at protecting people\u2019s personal information than its rivals because it makes money by selling devices, not by advertising.\nBut Apple has several weaknesses that could slow its A.I. development. The secretive company hasstruggled to recruit and retain leading A.I. researchersbecause it limits how much research it publishes. It has also sought to license published material andobjected to collectingit without permission, as other generative A.I. companies have done to build and train their technology.\nThough Siri has been around for more than a decade, Apple has let the voice assistant languish. The assistant has frustrated users with its failure to recognize various requests, and its ability to actually converse is limited because it is programmed to follow each individual command.\nGenerative A.I. could improve Siri because it has been trained on spoken conversations pulled from podcasts and videos. The result is a system that can mimic the way people talk.\nApple said that Siri would be able to remember the context of something that a user has raised with it. For example, if someone asks for the weather in Muir Woods National Monument and later asks to schedule a hike there, Siri will now know that the hike it is scheduling is in Muir Woods.\nSiri will also understand more of the things that people want to get done in iPhone apps. For instance, users can ask it to show a photo of a friend and it will find and surface those images for people in the Photos app. It also will be able to perform tasks for people like finding an image of a user\u2019s driver\u2019s license and filling it out into a form.\nOther generative A.I. capabilities that Apple demonstrated included automatically summarizing audio recordings, allowing customers to create movies from photos by writing a description, and cleaning up photos by removing distracting images in the background.\n\u201cThis is the biggest event for investors since the iPhone because they have to infuse A.I. into their products to thrive,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, which invests in emerging technology companies. \u201cToday was about showing that they will make A.I. a core competency and that they can deliver an A.I. experience that consumers want.\u201d\nThe event was an important milestone in Apple\u2019s relationship with developers, as well. Tensions have flared between the company and app makers over the past year, asApple has resisted new rules in Europedesigned to loosen its grip on the App Store. The rules require Apple to allow third-party payment alternatives that could circumvent the 30 percent fee it collects on app sales. But developers say that Apple has responded by introducing alternatives that would make such a change prohibitively expensive.\nApple is facing similar challenges in the United States. A federal judge in San Jose, Calif., is weighing whether the company canproceed with a plan to collect 27 percentof sales on alternative payment systems. And theJustice Department also sued Applefor rules that prevent other companies from offering cloud-streaming game apps, digital wallets and other alternatives on iPhones.\nAgainst that backdrop, Apple sought to emphasize the benefits it offers developers. During the event, it showed how its Apple Intelligence tools would be available to make apps more useful to customers.\nApple said that later this month it would be expanding sales of the Vision Pro, its mixed reality headset, beyond the United States to China, Japan and Europe. The company also unveiled new capabilities for the headset, including the ability to view older photographs in three dimensions and to create a giant, virtual display for a Mac."

        "title": "That Much-Despised Apple Ad Could Be More Disturbing Than It Looks",
        "fulltext": "If you haven\u2019t yet seenthe new and already-infamous Apple ad\u2014 the one in which a giant mechanical compactor violently crushes a bunch of musical instruments, books, sculptures, art supplies and toys, turning them into an iPad Pro \u2014 then Apple\u2019s executives are probably happy. They\u2019ve seen the headlines: \u201cApple iPad Ad Is Bad\u201d; \u201cWhy the Stink of That Bad, Bad iPad Ad Won\u2019t Go Away\u201d; \u201cApple\u2019s New iPad Ad Is a Neat Metaphor for the End of the World.\u201d They\u2019ve seen the mocking posts on social media. They\u2019re aware that Hugh Granthas weighed in. (\u201cThe destruction of the human experience,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cCourtesy of Silicon Valley.\u201d) In response, Apple has done what it hardly ever does: Itapologized. \u201cWe missed the mark with this video, and we\u2019re sorry,\u201d one of its vice presidents said. Apple won\u2019t air the ad on TV. It wants to move on, and it wants you to do the same.\nBut I can\u2019t quite move on, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone. The ad \u2014 titled \u201cCrush!\u201d \u2014 is simply too good. I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s clever, wise or uplifting. I mean that, like many Apple products, it was clearly made with exacting, no-expenses-spared attention to detail. The slow-motion, high-resolution focus on each object\u2019s destruction \u2014 the way we watch up close as they bend before breaking, as if resisting the inevitable \u2014 has a visceral effect that\u2019s hard to shake. The electronics company LG madeessentially the same adin 2008, as an advertisement for its Renoir camera phone, but it lacked that Apple touch. Unfortunately for Apple, \u201cCrush!\u201d achieves every ad maker\u2019s goal: It imprints in the mind\u2019s eye.\nJust as transfixing is the real-world back story it implies. Picture it: A team of experienced, well-paid professionals spent months refining a strategy. Ideas were pitched, culled, refined, mocked up. Eventually, after countless steps, a winner emerged, and somehow it wasthis. They could have depicted all that gear being cheerfully shrunken and squeezed into one iPad, awaiting creative fun. Instead, they went with just demolishing it all. Did no one point out that people are increasingly wary of tech companies\u2019 impact on the creative professions? That people have soured on Silicon Valley\u2019s apparent desire to monetize human creativity in as many ways as possible, from extractive streaming arrangements to harvesting human-made art as A.I.-training material? Did no one sense howbadthis would look? It\u2019s not just that the ad is a car crash \u2014 it\u2019s that the people who poured so much work and money into something so off-putting appear to have thought they were orchestrating a parade.\nIt wasn\u2019t solong ago that tech companies could advertise by telling us about new possibilities. Whatever their flaws, they really were injecting genuine novelty into the human experience: Suddenly you could carry thousands of songs in your pocket, take a decent picture on your phone and instantly share it, make a video call to someone on the other side of the planet. It wasn\u2019t hard for ads to set an optimistic tone; they simply showed people using new products in their daily lives and having new flavors of fun doing it.\nThis has largely ceased to be the case. We\u2019re no longer accustomed to the Apples and Googles of the world wowing us with new products. They have tried \u2014 with the Metaverse, with assorted wacky headsets \u2014 but for years now, nothing has really stuck. Instead, there are refinements and variations on existing products. The difference from one phone to the next is mostly for connoisseurs to parse. Improvements in processing power make little difference for average users. Online stores and streaming platforms are basically indistinguishable. From the people who brought you the iPod, here come \u2026 some TV shows?\nEven the companies themselves often seem at a loss for something to say about new products. For all its lavishly detailed smashes and splatters, \u201cCrush!\u201d contains not one representation of something a human might use an iPadfor; it contains no humans, full stop. All we learn about the new iPad is that, in addition to being the \u201cmost powerful\u201d ever, it\u2019s \u201calso the thinnest,\u201d as though anyone were walking around finding iPads unbearably chunky.\nThe campaign for the new Google Pixel phone has similar deficits. A key feature advertised is the A.I.-powered \u201cMagic Editor,\u201d which makes it easy to manipulate photos. One user isshown altering a shotof a man throwing a child in the air, making it look as if the baby went higher than it did. (She also erases everyone from the surrounding beach.) This isn\u2019t a new experience; it\u2019s a new tool for falsifying the record of experience. Arecent Photoshop adis even more bizarre, showing a young woman taking a picture of her subway car, editing it to look like a restaurant, then AirDropping the image to everyone in range. No one has ever done this, and if someone ever tries to AirDrop you a file on public transit,do not accept it.\nBut people didn\u2019t just find \u201cCrush!\u201d puzzling or ineffective. They found it gross and offensive. This is because we haven\u2019t just discarded our expectation of novel new technology. We\u2019ve also replaced it with a growing awareness of tech\u2019s aims: the data-harvesting, the desire to increase screen time at any cost, the monopolistic business practices, the A.I. tools that threaten artistic careers. After a decade during which it felt as if computers were empowering human creativity, they now feel like a symbol of the forces that stand in creativity\u2019s way and starve it of oxygen. We make ourselves feel better about these developments by trashing evidence of them \u2014 like \u201cCrush!\u201d \u2014 on social media. We retweet Hugh Grant. We gawk indignantly when tech sells solutions that no one wants: Did you see what the chief executive of Bumble said? That maybe the future of online dating istwo people having their A.I. \u201cconcierges\u201d talk to each other? Whoarethese people?\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tech companies started to internalize this public distrust \u2014 and compete to broadcast how well they understand our fears. Soon after Apple released \u201cCrush!\u201d Samsung released a spot of its own with the hashtag #UnCrush. It shows a young woman walking through what appears to be the scene of the Apple ad, surveying the wreckage. She finds a battered acoustic guitar that survived the destruction and starts strumming it, humming out a melody. She consults sheet music on a Samsung tablet. \u201cCreativity cannot be crushed,\u201d reads the overlaid text.\nIt\u2019s a warmer, less menacing ad than Apple\u2019s destructo-fest, and we can probably expect more of its kind: cozy reassurances thatthisgiant tech company is operating with utmost concern for all that is most precious to us. Shake off the warm feeling, though, and you see that \u201cUnCrush\u201d is as hollow as its predecessor. It\u2019s an ad for the Samsung Galaxy S9 tablet series, the company\u2019s first to be billed as \u201cA.I.-powered.\u201d How does A.I. enhance sheet music? The ad contains no suggestion. Its only real content is:Whatever Samsung might be, it is in some unspecified way not Apple.\nWatch the two ads back to back, and you see that they\u2019re more similar than different, equally vague in their hand waving about similar products. In this sense, we may come to see the harsh repulsiveness of \u201cCrush!\u201d as a useful gift \u2014 a reminder of the sort of rot to look out for as ad makers learn from their mistakes. We\u2019re used to distrusting ads because of their tendency to deceive. \u201cCrush!\u201d might be something different: an unintentional artifact of the truth, not yet compressed beyond recognition by the machine.\nPeter C.

        "title": "Apple Is First Company Charged Under New E.U. Competition Law",
        "fulltext": "Apple is imposing unfair restrictions on developers of applications for its App Store in violation of a new European Union law meant to encourage competition in the tech industry, regulators in Brussels said on Monday.\nApple is the first company to be charged with violating the Digital Markets Act, alaw passedin 2022 that gives European regulators wide authority to force the largest \u201conline gatekeepers\u201d to change their business practices.\nThe charges signal that the European Union, already known as an aggressive regulator of the tech industry, plans to intensify its crackdown. Amazon, Google and Meta are also facing investigations under the new competition rules, while TikTok and X are facing probes under another law intended to force internet companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content.\nThe E.U. rules threaten to fragment the global tech market as companies delay the releases of certain products and services because of regulatory concerns. Last week, Apple said it would not release a software update for iPhone users in the European Union that included new artificial intelligence features because of \u201cregulatory uncertainty.\u201d Meta did not release Threads, its Twitter-like service, in the bloc until five months after it was available in the United States for similar reasons.\nThe charges brought on Monday further escalated a tussle between Apple, which says its products are designed in the best interest of customers, and E.U. regulators, who say the company is unfairly using its size and considerable resources to stifle competition.\nAfter initiating an investigation in March, E.U. regulators said Apple was putting unlawful restrictions on companies that make games, music services and other applications. Under the law, also known as the D.M.A., Apple cannot limit how companies communicate with customers about sales and other offers and content available outside the App Store. The company faces a penalty of up to 10 percent of global revenue, a fine that could go up to 20 percent for repeat infringements, regulators said. Apple reported $383 billion inrevenuelast year.\n\u201cToday is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the D.M.A.,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy. She said Apple\u2019s App Store policies make developers more dependent on the company and prevent consumers from being aware of better offers.\nE.U. regulators said the charges were preliminary and gave Apple a chance to respond. A final decision will be announced by next March.\nApple defended its practices, saying that its rules and fees were a fair trade for providing such a large platform to reach consumers. Developers could also point consumers to websites to make purchases outside the App Store, the company said.\n\u201cThroughout the past several months, Apple has made a number of changes to comply with the D.M.A. in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law.\u201d\nTommaso Valletti, a former top economist for the European Commission on cases involving the tech industry, said regulators were \u201ctrying to establish a reputation for being tough,\u201d but faced a challenge when it came to forcing companies like Apple to change business practices. They could be heading toward a legal fight that could take years to conclude, but may set a precedent for future regulation of the tech industry and the digital economy.\n\u201cThe European Commission would like Apple to open its ecosystem, and Apple is saying no way,\u201d said Mr. Valletti, now an economics professor at Imperial College London. \u201cApple is basically saying, \u2018See you in court.\u2019\u201d\nApple\u2019s regulatory woes show how government scrutiny of the tech industry is growing worldwide. In the United States, Apple is being sued by the Justice Department over claims that it has an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market. It also is arguing in U.S. federal court that it has the right to take up to 27 percent of certain app sales through third-party payment systems, which developers argue violates a 2021 judicial ruling.\nJapan and Britain, which is no longer part of the European Union, have advanced rules to curb Apple\u2019s control of the App Store, as well.\nThe European Union has long been at the center of regulatory efforts to clamp down on the world\u2019s largest tech companies, but the Digital Markets Act gives officials new powers to intervene without the drawn-out process of filing traditional antitrust lawsuits, which can take years to resolve.\nAnother new law, called the Digital Services Act, gives regulators more power to govern social media platforms and illicit online content, including material that is harmful to children. Meta, TikTok and X are under investigation for possible violations.\nIn January, Appleannounceda list of changes to its App Store policies in an effort to comply with the Digital Markets Act, including allowing users to download rival app stores for the first time. Apple also reduced the service fees it charges companies for sales through the App Store to up to 17 percent, from 30 percent.\nApple has made other changes that have upset developers, including charging them a \u201ccore technology fee\u201d of 50 euro cents for every download of their app after it has been downloaded one million times or more within 12 months. Spotify and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, were among the companies that said the changes amounted to a new anticompetitive tax and called for regulators to intervene.\nThe European Commission said it was initiating a separate investigation into Apple\u2019s technology fee, saying it may \u201cfall short of ensuring effective compliance with Apple\u2019s obligations under the D.M.A.\u201d"
