        "title": "Apple Reaches Deal With Investors to Audit Its Labor Practices",
        "fulltext": "Apple will conduct an assessment of its U.S. labor practices under an agreement with a coalition of investors that includes five New York City pension funds.\nThe assessment will focus on whether Apple is complying with its official human rights policy as it relates to \u201cworkers\u2019 freedom of association and collective bargaining rights in the United States,\u201d the company said in afilinglast week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe audit comes amid complaints by federal regulators and employees that the company has repeatedly violated workers\u2019 labor rights as they have sought to unionize over the past year. Apple has denied the accusations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big apparent gap between Apple\u2019s stated human rights policies regarding worker organizing, and its practices,\u201d said Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who helped initiate the discussion with Apple on behalf of the city\u2019s public worker pension funds.\nAs part of its agreement with the coalition of investors, which also includes other pension funds for unionized workers, Apple agreed to hire a third-party firm to conduct the assessment, the coalition said in a letter to the company\u2019s chairman on Tuesday.\nThe letter also laid out recommendations for the assessment, which include hiring a firm that has expertise in labor rights and that does not advise companies on how to avoid unionization. It recommended that the firm be \u201cas independent as practicable.\u201d\nApple\u2019s federal filing did not refer explicitly to a third party, and the company declined to comment further.\nMembers of the investor coalition controlled about $7 billion worth of Apple stock as of last week, out of a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. In its financial filing announcing the assessment, Apple offered few details, saying that it would conduct the assessment by the end of the year and that it would publish a report related to the assessment.\nLast year, workers voted to unionize at two Apple stores \u2014 in Townson, Md., and Oklahoma City \u2014 and workers at two other stores filed petitions to hold union election before withdrawing them.\nMany workers involved in union organizing at the company said they enjoyed their jobs and praised their employer, citing benefits like health care and stock grants and the satisfaction of working with Apple products. But they said they hoped that unionizing would help them winbetter pay, moreinput into schedulingandmore transparencywhen it comes to obtaining job assignments and promotions.\nIn May, Apple announced that it was raising its minimum hourly starting wage to $22 from $20, a step that some workers interpreted as an effort to undermine their organizing campaigns.\nWorkers have also filed charges accusing Apple of labor law violations in at least six stores, including charges that the company illegallymonitored them,prohibited union fliersin a break room,interrogated themabout their organizing,threatened themfor organizing and that it stated that unionizingwould be futile.\nThe Communications Workers of America, the union representing Apple workers in Oklahoma City, has also filed achargeaccusing Apple of setting up an illegal company union at a store in Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one created and controlled by management with the aim of stifling support for an independent union.\nThe National Labor Relations Board has issued formal complaints in two of the cases, involving stores in Atlanta and New York.\nApple has said that \u201cwe strongly disagree\u201d with the claims brought before the labor board and that it looks forward to defending itself. The company has emphasized that \u201cregular, open, honest, and direct communication with our team members is a key part of Apple\u2019s collaborative culture.\u201d\nThe investor coalition that pushed for the labor assessment argues that Apple\u2019s response to the union campaigns is at odds with its human rights policy because that policy commits it to respect the International Labor Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, whichincludes\u201cfreedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\u201d\nMr. Lander, the New York comptroller, said that the coalition initially reached out to Apple\u2019s board last spring to discuss the company\u2019s posture toward the union organizing, but that it did not get a substantive response.\nThe coalition then filed ashareholder proposalin Septemberurging Apple to hire an outside firm to assess whether the company was following through on its stated commitment to labor rights. The company responded late last year and the two sides worked out an agreement in return for the coalition withdrawing its proposal, according to Mr. Lander.\nA coalition of some of the same investors, including the New York pension funds, has filed asimilar proposalat Starbucks, where workers have voted to unionize at more than 250 company-owned stores since late 2021. Like Apple, Starbucks hascitedits commitment to the International Labor Organization standards like freedom of association and the right to take part in collective bargaining.\nBut Starbucks hasconsistently opposedits employees\u2019 attempts to unionize, and Starbucks has not engaged with the coalition of investors to work out an agreement. Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer of Trillium Asset Management, one of the investors pushing proposals at both companies, said he expected the Starbucks proposal to go to a vote of the company\u2019s shareholders. The company declined to comment.\nThe federal labor board has issued a few dozen formal complaints against Starbucks for violations including retaliating against workers involved in organizing and discriminating against unionized workers when introducing new benefits; the company has denied breaking labor laws."

        "title": "A Short Seller Costs an Indian Giant Billions",
        "fulltext": "The Adani Group, one of India\u2019s most powerful and prominent industrial conglomerates, is continuing to reel from accusations by a short seller that it had perpetrated stock manipulation and fraud in \u201cthe largest con in corporate history.\u201d\nThe criticism has wiped about $70 billion of market value off Adani\u2019s various listed companies (and whacked the net worth of the group\u2019s founder, Gautam Adani). It has also stoked concerns about the conglomerate\u2019s efforts to raise money, including through a huge stock offering.\nThe Adani Group has gone on offense,issuing a413-page rebuttalto the fraud accusations by Hindenburg Research, a small New York-based firm run by Nathan Anderson. The Adani Group called Hindenburg\u2019s report baseless and said the investment firm\u2019s shorting of Adani-related companies\u2019 overseas-traded bonds and derivatives was securities fraud. For good measure, the company said Hindenburg\u2019s conduct amounted to a \u201ccalculated attack on India.\u201d\nHindenburg, which made a name for itself taking on S.P.A.C.s and crypto firms, said it stands by its report, adding \u201cfraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism.\u201d\nInvestors seem to be siding with Hindenburg, for now.Shares of several listed Adani companies, including Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy, were down 20 percent this morning, though its flagship Adani Enterprises was up 5 percent.\nA bigger concern is that the Adani Group is falling short of its goal of raising $2.5 billion through a stock offering: Investors havebid on just a fractionof the 45.5 million shares on offer, according to stock exchange data. \u201cThe issue is not even at the halfway mark, and tomorrow is the closing date,\u201d Saurabh Jain, an equity analyst with SMC Global Securities in Delhi, told DealBook. \u201cThis will be a big 24 hours.\u201d\nAdani Group\u2019s connectionsto the Indian government are also under scrutiny.Gautam Adani has close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his empire has won a number of government concessions in recent years that helped it expand into the media, energy and cement sectors. Last summer, Mr. Adaniovertook Mukesh Ambanito become India\u2019s wealthiest man.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if those connections will help: Modi and his government have stayed out of the fight so far. And it\u2019s not certain if or how Indian regulators could intervene, as Hindenburg is shorting the Adani Group\u2019s non-Indian securities.\nThe battle is affecting investor confidence in India.The Nifty 50 index, which includes the country\u2019s largest companies \u2014 including Adani Enterprises \u2014 is down 2.5 percent over the past week, after having outperformed the S&P 500 last year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of volatility in the Indian markets,\u201d Mr. Jain said of the recent market sell-off, adding that the decline has derailed a January stock rally.\nNissan and Renault reshape their alliance.The carmakers said on Monday that they wererebalancing their relationshipso that each would own a 15 percent stake in the other; Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan, far more than the Japanese company\u2019s share of its French ally. The revamped partnership could lead to increased cooperation in developing electric vehicles.\nThe S.E.C. is reportedly looking into Elon Musk\u2019s role in Tesla\u2019s self-driving claims.The regulator is examining whether the carmaker\u2019s chief executiveinappropriately made forward-looking statementsabout the company\u2019s technology, according to Bloomberg. The inquiry is part of a broader look at what Tesla has said about self-driving cars, a key part of its business strategy.\nTikTok\u2019s C.E.O. will testify before Congress.Shou Chew will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23 asthe sole witnessat a hearing focused on the Chinese-owned video app. It\u2019s an opportunity for a newly Republican-led House to grill Chew about TikTok over data security concerns.\nUnilever taps a board member as its new C.E.O.The British consumer gianthired Hein Schumacher, who is also the head of a Dutch dairy cooperative, as its chief executive. The hiring of Schumacher, who began his career at Unilever, had the support of Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian, which had sought to shake up the conglomerate.\nMainland China\u2019s stock exchanges officially entered a bull market on the first day of trading after the weeklong pause for the Lunar New Year, as investors were heartened by signs that the country\u2019s economy was recovering after three years of Beijing\u2019s zero-Covid social restrictions.\nChinese consumers appear to be spending again.Official data showed thatspendingon travel and entertainment, including bookings for theater tickets and hotels, was up compared with previous years, according to Bloomberg. Outbound air travel more than quadrupled year-on-year as well, suggesting that high-spending Chinese tourists will flock abroad once more.\nAll that has Western companies optimistic about an economic rebound.\nWill China finally let consumers lead its economy?Over the weekend, Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, said the government planned to make consumer spending the\u201cmain driving force\u201dof China\u2019s economy. But Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, said it was unclear if the government was prepared to limit the state\u2019s role in the economy: \u201cBeijing wants to boost the role of consumption without absorbing any of the costs of such a major structural adjustment, but that isn\u2019t likely to be an option,\u201d hetweeted.\nMeanwhile, tensions with the West are still growing.Among the latest signs:\nJapan and the Netherlands agreed last week to U.S. demands to imposerestrictions on exporting advanced chip-making equipmentto China. Noah Barkin, an expert on Europe-China relations at the Rhodium Group consultancy, told DealBook that the move showed more international alignment with Washington\u2019s approach to China: \u201cThis is one more economic challenge for Beijing to overcome, on top of the property crisis, high household debt levels and a shrinking population,\u201d he added.\nA four-star U.S. Air Force general warned in an internal memo that Americacould be at war with Chinaby 2025, according to NBC News. (A Pentagon representative told NBC News, \u201cThese comments are not representative of the department\u2019s view on China.\u201d)\nThe arrest of Charles McGonigal, a former senior F.B.I. official, on charges of helping a Russian oligarch sent shock waves through the national-security community.\nMr. McGonigal may have been turned by the aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska \u2014 as reported byThe TimesandInsider\u2014 for work that violated U.S. sanctions. Prosecutors portrayed the case as the tale of a U.S. investigator being corrupted by someone he had investigated. (A representative for Mr. Deripaska denied to The Times that the billionaire had ever hired Mr. McGonigal; a lawyer for Mr. McGonigal declined to comment.)\nThe U.S. had sought to recruit Mr. Deripaska as an informant.The billionaire had spent years trying to buy respectability in the West, and had even cooperated with the U.S., including spending $25 million of his own money trying to rescue an F.B.I. agent who had been captured in Iran.\nHe was known to be close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia (though Mr. Deripaska\u2019s representative denies this) and to have ties to organized crime, and gained heightened attention from Washington in 2016 when it emerged that he had employed the onetime Trump adviser Paul Manafort.\nMr. McGonigal was well-placed to help.Until his retirement in 2018, he ran the counterintelligence bureau of the F.B.I.\u2019s New York office \u2014 and investigated Russian oligarchs. It isn\u2019t clear how he entered Deripaska\u2019s orbit, but prosecutors say Mr. McGonigal, while still employed by the F.B.I., was introduced to an employee of the Russian in 2018.\nAccording to the charging documents, Mr. McGonigal was asked to help the daughter of the Deripaska employee, known in the indictment as Agent-1, get an internship at the New York Police Department. (Insider reports that the daughter never became an intern.) After Mr. McGonigal retired, he introduced Agent-1 to an international law firm to help get the sanctions against Mr. Deripaska lifted, and signed on as a consultant and investigator. He met with Mr. Deripaska in London and Vienna, and later was in talks to work directly for the Russian oligarch.\n\u2014 Theowner of a Wall Street delideflects a question about whether he ever asks his customers for stock tips.\nJobs, inflation and earnings \u2014 here\u2019s what to look for this week.\nMonday:The I.M.F. publishes its biannual world economic outlook at 8:30 p.m. Eastern.\nTuesday:Exxon Mobil, McDonald\u2019s, Pfizer, Samsung and Spotify headline earnings calls.\nWednesday:It\u2019s Fed decision day.

        "title": "Streaming Changed TV. Is TV Changing Streaming Back?",
        "fulltext": "This is not a review of\u201cKaleidoscope.\u201dOne reason for this is that the Netflix heist series, which arrived on Sunday, is not especially noteworthy, except for one gimmick. The other reason has to do with the nature of that gimmick.\nThe episodes, set before and after an elaborate robbery attempt, are served to Netflix viewers in random order (except for the episode depicting the actual heist, which runs last). So in a way, I can\u2019t review the series as you might see it, because I can\u2019t know which of [tries to summon my knowledge of factorials from middle-school math]a lotof possible permutations you could experience.\nThat\u2019s the interesting part of \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d And let\u2019s be honest, at this point, it\u2019s not that interesting! A few years ago, sure; the series would have seemed like a bold experiment in the ways new technology might change TV.\nNow, for much the same reason, \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d feels like a throwback. It\u2019s one in a series of attempts to use streaming to alter the space-time fabric of television, to make it less linear and in some cases more interactive \u2014 many of which have gotten attention, but none of which have really stuck.\nNetflix has been the platform most active in these experiments, maybe because it was the most invested in the idea that it was an alternative not only to cable or broadcast networks but also to the genre and business of television itself.\nIts 2013 revival of \u201cArrested Development\u201d was a kind of deconstructed puzzle, its episodes appearing out of chronological order and from different characters\u2019 points of view. Its interactive film/show/game\u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201dallowed viewers to choose the path the story followed. So did the \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d special \u201cKimmy vs. the Reverend\u201d; the animated \u201cCat Burglar\u201d added a trivia-game element. Netflix was not alone in this either, with Steven Soderbergh going the choose-your-own-adventure route in the HBO series/app\u201cMosaic.\u201d\nAfter all this, a good decade or so into the streaming revolution, TV today looks \u2014 well, it still looks a lot like TV. Attempts at interactivity have gotten no more traction thanSmell-o-Vision, maybe in part because our culture already has a popular and relatively young form of interactive amusement, the video game. (One of those,\u201cThe Last of Us,\u201dis being adapted by HBO as a conventional TV drama.)\nTV\u2019s dominant format continues to be the static season, in which episodes are served up in a set progression. Often \u2014 even on streaming \u2014 they arrive once a week. The only choosing viewers do is what to watch, when to watch and whether to fill their couch-side snack bowl with chips or pretzels.\nIn other ways, streaming has absolutely changed the business and aesthetics of TV. AsI wrote in 2015, giving viewers the option to binge when they please has encouraged a form of storytelling more focused on the season and less on the episode. Netflix\u2019s philosophy of \u201cthe first season is the pilot\u201d \u2014 itself an outgrowth of the serial approach of networks like HBO \u2014 has led to a more long-game form of narrative, and not only on streaming platforms.\nIncreasingly, TV series of the past decade have aimed less at hooking viewers from the first minutes than at getting them to sink in, as into quicksand. In an interview with Rolling Stone,Tony Gilroy, the showrunner of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequel series \u201cAndor\u201d on Disney+,dismissed\u201cthe idea that you have to wrap up every episode in a bow\u201d and defended the series\u2019s slow-burn start as a necessary \u201cinvestment.\u201d (Granted, it\u2019s easier to get audiences to pony up that investment when you\u2019re selling one of the world\u2019s most famous franchises.)\nAll this has made a difference for better and for worse. It has added to TV\u2019s bag of tricks, giving creators the option of making more unitary long-form works. (Among other things, the streaming era has been the heyday of the multi-hour limited series.) Other times it imposes the expectation of length where it\u2019s not needed. One thing \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d has in common with many streaming series is the feeling of being a two-hour movie pitch that was repackaged and padded into a TV season.\nThe experience of TV, meanwhile, has become less tied to the cable box and the network schedule. A generation of viewers is now used to watching TV at the time, and in the portion size, of its choosing. FX, a pioneer of the High Cable Era of the early aughts, is now as much a boutique subplatform of Hulu as it is a cable channel. There is still a distinction between HBO (the premium channel) and HBO Max (the streamer), but I\u2019m not sure anyone outside the TV business thinks much about it anymore.\nLately, however, it seems as if we\u2019re hitting the limits of how much change TV can handle and how much audiences want. It turns out that TV wants to be linear. Not necessarily in chronology \u2014 since the flashbacks and -forwards of \u201cLost,\u201d TV has become suffused with in media res openings and Vonnegutian unstickings in time. But in almost every case you progress, scene by scene, episode by episode, through a narrative order chosen by a creator, not by you or by the roll of some automated dungeonmaster\u2019s eight-sided die.\nCritics of build-your-own-TV experiments often use the restaurant analogy: You want the chef to prepare your dinner; you don\u2019t want to have to cook the ingredients yourself. But that doesn\u2019t mean you want to eat hamburgers every night for the rest of your life. Within that traditional structure \u2014 a creative artist deciding what you get, in what order \u2014 people are willing to change up the number of courses (episodes) or opt for a family-style experience in which the entire meal (season) arrives to the table at once.\nThis flexibility goes both ways. As more streaming competitors have come online, some have opted for a more, well, TV-like release schedule. Apple is fond of introducing series with a few episodes, then releasing one a week. Disney favors a one-at-a-time, tune-in-next-week pattern for its tent-pole Marvel and Star Wars series. Even Amazon, which once mirrored Netflix in dropping its seasons all at once, went with a weekly schedule for its mithril-plated Tolkien series,\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a certain school of TV fan andcritic\u2014 call them theepisodicists\u2014 who will hail these changes as proof that the old ways are the right ways. TV needs tightly constructed individual episodes, goes the argument, and the audience craves thecommunal experienceof tuning in at the same bat-time to the same bat-channel (or -platform).\nI think something more nuanced is going on: Decision by decision, TV is collectively feeling its way toward figuring out which viewing experience works best for which kind of series. As the critic Kathryn VanArendonk wrote in Vulture, a well-crafted TV season is not simply \u201caten-hour movie.\u201d But neither does every show in 2023 need to be structured and experienced like \u201cDragnet.\u201d\nSome shows benefit from the giddy feeling of unwrapping a new present every week. \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d though its episodes only occasionally focused on single stories, might not have become as big a phenomenon without the weekly hype cycle.\nOn the other hand, FX on Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Bear,\u201d whose entire season dropped at once last summer, prompted more buzz and discourse than many of FX\u2019s weekly series. It may be that this kind of dramedy \u2014 character-based, relatively short, not driven by big plot detonations \u2014 is better taken in one gulp.\nElsewhere in streaming, TV-like practices seem to be returning out of the sheer dollars-and-cents realization that the business is not limitless.\nNetflix has gone from saving canceled shows toaxing series like \u201c1899\u201dafter a single season, like an old-time broadcaster with an itchy trigger finger. As for streaming as an infinite video library \u2014 well, it\u2019s looking more finite, with titles like \u201cWestworld\u201dpulled from circulationto cut costs, in a return to the pre-VCR days when a canceled show simply vanished into memory.\nFor now, at least, streaming and TV seem to be meeting in a still-coalescing middle, with elements of media\u2019s future and its past. The talent is still flowing to streaming; the director Rian Johnson (\u201cKnives Out\u201d), for instance, is about to premiere his first series, \u201cPoker Face,\u201d on Peacock. But rather than a mind-melting narrative experiment in the mold of his movie \u201cLooper,\u201d it is a case-of-the-week detective story, \u00e0 la NBC in the 1970s.\nAs for Netflix, amidrecent signsthat it can\u2019t keep growing explosively forever, it has introduced something that used to be anathema to it: a subscription tierwith ads. A decade ago, Netflix defined our current conception of streaming. Its next phase may involve turning itself into TV."

(Ms. Swift herself is not scheduled to show up.)\nExpect lawmakers to pepper Live Nation\u2019s president and C.F.O., Joe Berchtold, with questions about whether its grip on ticket sales for the concert and events industry \u2014 it controls about 70 percent, bysome critics\u2019 reckoning\u2014 is too tight.\n\u201cHowever you look at it, that\u2019s a monopoly,\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee,told Rolling Stone. Critics have accused Live Nation of using its market dominance to charge high fees and of threatening to ice out venues from Live Nation events if they don\u2019t use Ticketmaster. (The Times reported in November that the Justice Department waslooking into the company.)\nTaking on Ticketmaster is a bipartisan affair: Standing beside Ms. Klobuchar in announcing a hearing on concert ticketing last fall was Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. \u201cIt strikes me asbeing kind of problematicthat they\u2019re the only game in town,\u201d Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, told The New Republic.\nTicketmaster is no stranger to criticism over its dominance.In 2019, Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut,urged the Justice Department to investigatethe \u201cbroken\u201d ticket industry.\nArtists have long complained about Ticketmaster\u2019s role. The band Lawrence, whose co-founder, Clyde Lawrence,wrote a Times Opinion essayon the topic last year, included the line \u201cLive Nation is a monopoly\u201d in its 2021 song \u201cFalse Alarms.\u201d Perhaps most famously, Pearl Jam filed an antitrust complaint against Ticketmaster in 1994 \u2014 16 years before it merged with Live Nation \u2014 kicking off a federal investigation that ultimately fizzled.\nLive Nation strongly denies breaking antitrust law.After the Swift fiasco, itattributed Ticketmaster\u2019s dominanceto \u201cthe large gap that exists between the quality of the Ticketmaster system and the next best primary ticketing system.\u201d It also argues that Ticketmaster is far from having a monopoly in the secondary market. (Jack Groetzinger, the C.E.O. of SeatGeek, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday as well.)\nStill, according towritten testimonyreleased ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Berchtold of Live Nation will say that \u201cthere are several things we could have done better.\u201d He will also seek to blame scalpers\u2019 bots swarming Ticketmaster\u2019s site for ultimately denying fans the ability to buy tickets for the Swift tour, and he has a letter from the country star Garth Brooks calling on Congress to make scalping illegal.\nSam Bankman-Fried gave $400 million to an obscure crypto trading firm.Federal prosecutorsare investigatingwhether the investment in Modulo Capitalwas made with funds belonging to customers of FTX, Bankman-Fried\u2019s bankrupt crypto exchange, The Times reports. Raising concerns: Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s close personal ties to Modulo, and its founder\u2019s business partner. Neither of the Modulo founders have been accused of wrongdoing; through an attorney, they declined to comment.\nThe Justice Department will reportedly sue Google over its digital ad dominance.Prosecutorsmay file a lawsuitas soon as this week, according to Bloomberg. It would be the department\u2019s second antitrust suit against Google in recent years, and part of a broader crackdown on tech giants.\nAnother activist investor reportedly emerges at Salesforce.Jeff Ubben of Inclusive Capitalhas taken a stake in the business software giant and spoken with its co-founder, Marc Benioff, according to CNBC. That would make the third activist to invest in Salesforce, after Starboard Value and Elliott Management.\nElon Musk says he could have secured funding to take Tesla private.At a trial over his 2018 effort to buy the carmaker, Mr. Musk said that his \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet referred not only to his belief that Saudi Arabia would help finance the deal, butalso to his stake in SpaceX, which he could theoretically have borrowed against. Under questioning, he acknowledged he hadn\u2019t mentioned the SpaceX stake in a 2021 deposition.\nA former senior F.B.I. official is charged with helping a Russian oligarch.Prosecutors accused Charles McGonigal, who oversaw some of the agency\u2019s most sensitive counterintelligence operations, oftaking money from Oleg Deripaskain exchange for helping to get him off the U.S. sanctions list. It\u2019s a rare accusation against a senior F.B.I. official.\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to invest another$10 billion in the company behind ChatGPTcould add to the troubles at Salesforce, which is already dealing withactivist investors, aleadershipshake-up andlaying offthousands of workers. Microsoft plans tointegrate ChatGPT technologyacross products like email, slide shows and spreadsheets.\nBut DealBook has learned that Microsoft expects this technology to improve its software that manages a company\u2019s interactions with customers \u2014 Salesforce\u2019s main business.\nMicrosoft is doubling down on customer relations software.Last year, Microsoft launched an app calledViva Salesthat automates some customer relationship management, or C.R.M., functions across its products, including Teams and Outlook. The app can, for example, automatically write a meeting summary, which it then uses to track progress on goals discussed.\nChatGPT boosts this sector\u2019s revenue potential for Microsoft.The product \u201cwill only get better with GPT,\u201d Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, said, adding that the technology could also help curate content ideas or automate repetitive tasks like email.\nThe Guggenheim PartnersanalystJohn DiFucci estimates that C.R.M. could eventually be a $7 billion opportunity for Microsoft, up from the roughly $3 billion it brings in today. \u201cI always wondered why Microsoft wasn\u2019t a more major player \u2014 especially given that they have Outlook, which is sort of a C.R.M. system,\u201d he said.\nBut Salesforce has a strong incumbent position.The company has been experimenting with its own artificial intelligence; its C.E.O., Marc Benioff, isa declared fan of ChatGPT. And for companies that use Salesforce, the costs of switching providers are high. Still, Microsoft is a formidable competitor and its products are already ubiquitous in corporations.\nThe addition of A.I. to that arsenal could make its products \u201cmore intelligent than what Salesforce has today,\u201d according to Sid Nag, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd Salesforce has to tell the world how they will respond to that.\u201d\nAfter Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, announced the biggest round of job cuts in its history, senior executives of the tech giant spoke before restive employees to explain why the company had laid off 12,000 of their colleagues so abruptly \u2014 and why those who remain shouldn\u2019t lose heart.\nHighlights from Monday\u2019s town hall meeting, according to news reports:\nIt was impossible to give managersmore warningabout the cuts, Alphabet\u2019s chief people officer, Fiona Cicconi, said: \u201cIn an ideal world, we would have given managers a heads-up, but we have over 30,000 managers at Google.\u201d\nTop executives willhave their bonuses cutby an unspecified amount.\nRuth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s C.F.O., denied that investors \u2014 including the activist shareholder TCI, which disclosed a stake in the company and demanded cost cuts \u2014had driven the layoff decisions.\nLaid-off workers saw their access to internal systems cut immediately out of an abundance of caution, according to Royal Hansen, Google\u2019s vice president of security. The move irked some employees.\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s C.E.O., reminded employees that2023 would be pivotalas the company confronts a host of business challenges. \u201cIt will be an important year given the rapid advancements in A.I.,\u201d he said, echoing the company\u2019s \u201ccode-red\u201d warnings about threats like ChatGPT.\n\u2014Ken Griffin, C.E.O. of the hedge fund, Citadel, on how the GameStop frenzy helped raise his firm\u2019s profile with potential hires.\nSweeping layoffs, looming regulatory trouble, the prospect of upstarts like ChatGPT causinga \u201ccode red\u201d disruptionat tech giants \u2014 none of these challenges appear to bother investors.\nThe Nasdaq Composite has gained 8.6 percent so far this year.Investors have been buying tech stocks in the belief that inflation is easing enough for the Fed to begin slowing the pace of its interest rate increases.\nTech titans are among the best-performing stocks in 2023, with the FANG+ Index \u2014 which includes such tech giants as Amazon, Apple, Meta and Netflix \u2014 up 14.8 percent in 2023, on pace for its best month since August 2020.\nBut the rally could hit trouble as soon as Tuesday.Microsoft will report earnings after markets close, the first of the big tech companies to do so. Investors will be paying close attention to its full-year outlook for any signs of a pickup in customers\u2019 I.T. spending. Before the recent rally, analysts had been cutting their earnings forecasts for tech companies, speculating that a slowing economy would crimp revenues and profits.\nSome warn that the January rebound could fade \u2014 and fast.\u201cInvestors should not assume that the easy times in the market are coming back,\u201d David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, a wealth management firm, wrote in an investor note on Monday. \u201cWe expect enhanced volatility\u201d as the prospect of a recession still looms.\nDeals\nThe activist investor Elliott Management has reportedlytaken a big stakein a Japanese conglomerate that makes components for electric vehicles and smartphone screens.

        "title": "The S.E.C.\u2019s Crypto Crackdown Intensifies",
        "fulltext": "Washington\u2019s legal crackdown on crypto is intensifying, with the S.E.C. accusing some of the biggest names in the sector of operating an illegal lending service that racked up huge losses for customers.\nThe S.E.C. complaint:The agency charged the crypto lender Genesis Global Capital and its erstwhile business partner, the crypto exchange Gemini, with selling unregistered securities through a high-yield financial product called Gemini Earn. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, founded by the crypto magnate Barry Silbert; Gemini is run by the billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.\nThe firms are accused of leveraging the popularity of Gemini Earn\u2014 which promised customers a return on their investment of up to 8 percent \u2014 to raise billions. The problem: They violated securities laws by failing to adhere to \u201cdisclosure requirements designed to protect investors,\u201d said the S.E.C. chair, Gary Gensler.\nThe losses are massive.The S.E.C. says 340,000 Earn customers are out of pocket by about $900 million. The complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and payback \u201cof ill-gotten gains.\u201d In atweeton Thursday, Tyler Winklevoss said Earn was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and the company had complied with all rules. He added that the S.E.C. charges were \u201ccounterproductive\u201d as the firms worked to recover customer funds. (Genesis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\nGenesis and Gemini were already feuding over the funds.After the crypto exchange FTX imploded in November, Genesis froze withdrawals, leaving Earn customers stranded. Negotiations between the Winklevosses and DCG have since broken down into a nasty public spat.\nThe S.E.C. has zeroed in on crypto lending.Last year, the agency reached a$100 million settlementwith thenow-bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi. In 2021, Coinbaseabandoned plansto launch a yield-generating product and blamed the S.E.C. for deeming it a security.\nMeanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried went on defense in the court of public opinion.The 30-year-old founder of FTX is facing criminal fraud charges and awaiting trial at his parents\u2019 Silicon Valley home. He has an ankle monitor restricting his movements, but he still has internet access, and he took to Substack to reiterate a narrative that prosecutors, regulators and industry experts have previously rejected.\nBankman-Fried denied claims he siphoned billions from his companies.\u201cI didn\u2019t steal funds,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Bankman-Fried pointed a finger at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, saying it should not be allowed to work on the FTX bankruptcy because it advised the company on transactions in the past. The firm is under increased scrutiny,including from senators, about its work as counsel to FTX.\nElsewhere in crypto:\nBill Ackman, C.E.O. of Pershing Square Capital Management, again came to the defense of Mr. Bankman-Fried,asking his nearly 600,000 Twitter followersnot to rush to judgment.\nThe exchange Crypto.comannouncedit would lay off 20 percent of its staff, its second round of cuts in six months as the wider rout in crypto asset prices takes a toll.\nFinancial giants report mixed results.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, two of the world\u2019s biggest banks and bellwethers for the health of the U.S. economy, beat Wall Street expectations ashigher interest rates padded their bottom lines. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and BlackRock reported revenue that fell short of forecasts. Larry Fink, C.E.O. of BlackRock, said theturbulent marketsweighed on its results.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s consumer lending unit lost more than $3 billion in the past three years.The bankrevealed the lossesfor the first time, days after making more than 3,000 layoffs and launching its biggest cost-cutting drive since the global financial crisis. Goldman will release earnings next week.\nTesla slashes prices in the U.S. and Europe by up to 20 percent.The carmakermade the moveafter discounting its vehicles in China and missing Wall Street estimates for deliveries in 2022. At 7:30 a.m. Eastern, Tesla shares were down more than 5 percent in premarket trading.\nApple\u2019s C.E.O. takes a pay cut of more than 40 percent.The iPhone makerreduced Tim Cook\u2019s compensationto $49 million this year, down from $99.4 million in 2022, after shareholder criticism and a request from Mr. Cook himself.\nA special counsel will investigate classified documents found in President Biden\u2019s home and office.Attorney General Merrick Garlandpicked Robert K. Hur, a veteran prosecutor and Donald Trump appointee, to lead the inquiry in a bid to avoid accusations of partisanship.\nBed Bath & Beyond is in talks with the private equity firm Sycamore Partners to sell assets, including its Buy Buy Baby stores, as part of a possible bankruptcy process, people familiar with the matter told DealBook. The retailer is also in talks with other suitors about possible transactions.\nBuy Buy Baby\u2019s fall hasn\u2019t been as sharp as that of its parent.The infant and children\u2019s goods chain generated about$1 billion in salesin 2020, according to an investor presentation. And while Bed Bath & Beyond overexpanded and struggled to remain competitive, Buy Buy Baby has maintained a strong position in a clearly defined market, and its fall in sales has beenless pronounced.\nA spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond reiterated that multiple paths \u201care being explored.\u201d The company has previously said that it was considering all options.\nA spokesman for Sycamore declined to comment.\nSycamore knows the distressed retail market well.The firm has bought up everything from Staples to the department store Belk and the women\u2019s apparel retailer Talbots, and the firm\u2019s co-founder,Stefan Kaluzny,has years of experience and relationships in the retail and consumer sectors. His interest in pieces of Bed Bath & Beyond may foreshadow the kind of deal making we will see this year if the traditional financing market remains stuck.\nBed Bath & Beyond\u2019s stock has taken off.In shades of the meme-stock frenzy of 2021, its shares have more than tripled over the past five trading sessions, coinciding with the company\u2019sbankruptcy warning.\n\u2014Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital, sharing regrets that the venture capital firm was misled in its dealings with FTX, in which it invested $225 million.\nProsus, the international investment arm of South Africa\u2019s Naspers, is a global tech colossus, with a $250 billion empire that includes food delivery, online learning, e-commerce companies \u2014 and a roughly 28 percent stake in Tencent, the Chinese internet giant.\nThat gives Prosus a unique vantage on the global business landscape. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Bob van Dijk, sat down with DealBook to discuss coping with the pandemic and economic slowdowns, China and more. Here are highlights from that conversation.\nOn shifting economic realities:Many of Prosus\u2019s business lines \u2014 including online restaurant and grocery delivery, e-commerce, online payments and online education \u2014 flourished during the pandemic. But even as coronavirus restrictions were lifted, those divisions didn\u2019t really suffer the sort of sharp snapback that pandemic darlings like Zoom and Peloton did, according to Mr. van Dijk. Of online food delivery, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have that same surge of new customers, but you retain those customers that you\u2019ve got and they\u2019re growing all the time into high-frequency and high-value ones.\u201d\nBut as economies across the globe slow down, Prosus has urged its portfolio companies to focus less on explosive growth and more on turning a profit. (Cost-cutting hasextended to Prosus itself.) That task has become somewhat easier as others have pulled back from free-spending bids for growth, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s less irrational competition.\u201d\nOn China:Tencent suffered one of its toughest years last year, as regulators launched a wide-ranging crackdown on the tech sector and the pandemic sapped the Chinese economy.\nMr. Van Dijk said Tencent\u2019s fortunes were improving as authorities eased their restrictions on the sector and ended their zero-Covid policy (though he largely avoided discussinghow that process played out). He said he had observed \u201can even more pro-business shift in tone\u201d from Beijing.\nOn investing:Prosus announced 69 deals over the past two years, according to PitchBook, but economic shifts, notably a rise in interest rates that\u2019s made financing more expensive, have changed its approach. \u201cWe\u2019ve said no to more things than we previously had,\u201d Mr. van Dijk said. How much more selective has Prosus become? \u201cI think we said yes to about one in 100 opportunities before. It\u2019s probably more like one in 200 or so now.\u201d\nThe slowdown in deal making may also be as much about lack of supply as lack of demand. Mr. Van Dijk said many start-ups that loaded up on capital in the past two years now want to avoid fund-raising again for fear of being forced to accept lower valuations. \u201cThat somehow needs to shake out,\u201d he said \u2014 though he believes many of those companies might change their minds \u201csomewhere in the next 6 to 12 months\u201d as they run out of money.\nOne market where start-ups still have the upper hand: India, one of Prosus\u2019s largest markets. \u201cValuations haven\u2019t come down very much there,\u201d Mr. van Dijk said. \u201cIndia is firing on all cylinders.

        "title": "Regulators Find Apple\u2019s Secrecy Violates Workers\u2019 Rights",
        "fulltext": "As employee unrest simmered at Apple in late 2021, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, sent an email reminding staff that the world\u2019s most valuable company would do everything in its \u201cpower to identify those who leaked.\u201d\nThe email spoke to the tech giant\u2019s strictly enforced culture of secrecy that had kindled frustration among a group of former and current employees who collected accounts ofverbal abuse, harassment and discrimination at Apple. Two of those former employees complained about the company\u2019s policies to the National Labor Relations Board.\nMore than a year later, the labor board has found merit in the claim that Apple and its top executives have violated federal law with actions and policies that discourage employees from joining together to advance their interests.\nA spokeswoman for the labor board said on Tuesday that it had determined that Apple\u2019s work and confidentiality rules \u201cinterfere with, restrain or coerce employees\u201d from collective action. If the parties are unable to settle the case, the board will issue a formal complaint against Apple and hold a hearing.\nAn Apple spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately have comment.\nThe labor board responded to five charges brought in late 2021 by two former Apple employees, Ashley Gjovik, an engineering program manager at Apple for six years, and Cher Scarlett, an engineer on the company\u2019s security team. (After using a pseudonym to protect her anonymity, Ms. Scarlett said, she legally changed her name in 2021.) Both women were involved in the early days of what would become the activist group #AppleToo, which began by collecting accounts of abuse, harassment and retaliation at the company.\nActivists in the #AppleToo initiative shared a belief that the company\u2019s strict culture of secrecy discouraged workers from airing concerns about problems at work with one another, family or the media. As a result, they said, problematic managers went unchecked and the company\u2019s business conduct was seldom questioned.\nIn their claims to the labor board, the former employees accused Apple of trying to prevent the group from collecting wage data from employees, including through harassment. They also said the company\u2019s work rules prevented them from discussing wages, hours and conditions of employment.\nMs. Scarlett also complained to the labor board about Mr. Cook\u2019s email to staff. Shortly after anall-hands meeting, Mr. Cook sent an email to staff warning that the company did \u201cnot tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it\u2019s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting.\u201d He said people who leaked did \u201cnot belong\u201d at Apple.\nDuring the labor board\u2019s review, a regional office \u201cfound merit to a charge alleging statements and conduct by Apple \u2014 including high-level executives \u2014 also violated the National Labor Relations Act,\u201d a spokeswoman for the board said.\nApple has continued to face challenges from workers since then, including over its corporate return-to-office policy and retail workers\u2019 efforts to unionize."

        "title": "Easy to Use, Mobile Payment Apps Are Also Easy to Misuse",
        "fulltext": "The use of mobile payment services has surged \u2014 along with worries about financial risks.\nServices like Venmo and Zelle let people pay others or receive payments almost instantly, with a few taps on their phone. To use them, you typically download the app and link it to a bank account or credit card. Well over half of Americans use the payment tools, according to a 2022 survey by Consumer Reports.\nBut while they\u2019re fast and easy, the apps can have serious drawbacks. Users can lose money if they accidentally pay the wrong person, mis-type a dollar amount or succumb to afraud or a scamthat tricked them into making a payment. About a quarter of bank customers in an October survey by J.D. Power said they or a close relative had experienced fraud via a peer-to-peer service. And according to Consumer Reports, 12 percent of frequent payment app users reported sending money to the wrong person.\nUsers are mostly on their own in those situations because payment apps fall into a regulatory \u201cgray area\u201d and lack the robust loss protections of credit and debit cards, said Delicia Hand, director of financial fairness with Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a user-beware situation,\u201d she said.\nInan analysispublished this week, the consumer magazine determined that none of the four popular payment apps \u2014 Apple Cash, Cash App, Venmo and Zelle \u2014 reimburse users when a payment is mistakenly sent to the wrong person, because such transactions are considered \u201cauthorized.\u201d\nThe report said the apps also wouldn\u2019t compensate clients if a criminal tricked them into sending money \u2014 perhaps by impersonating someone the users know or pretending to represent their bank \u2014 because the users, in a sense, had approved the transaction.\nWhen contacted, representatives of the apps did not directly challenge Consumer Reports\u2019 characterization of their reimbursement policies. But they indicated that they do encourage customers to reach out to them for help if they encounter a problem or suspect fraud.\n\u201cEach situation is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, as we strive to help any customer experiencing challenges resolve their issue,\u201d a spokesperson for PayPal, Venmo\u2019s parent company, said in an email.\nThe apps are more likely to reimburse users when they are the victims of fraud and didn\u2019t actively authorize the payment in any way \u2014 such as when their phone or password was hacked or they lost their device. Several cap your loss at $50 if you notify them quickly, but your potential loss may rise to $500 after a few days. And if you wait longer than 60 days, you may get nothing. (Venmo says it covers the full amount if you notify the company within 60 days.)\nRepresentatives of the apps said they had taken steps to protect customers and help prevent payment mishaps, and they urged users to follow advice on the app websites.\nAlladviseusing the tools only with friends, family or others who can be trusted, and the apps all include safety reminders or warnings. Apple Cash, for instance, sends a warning if users try to send money to someone outside their contact list. Venmo sends a \u201cflag\u201d if the app detects that the user may not know the recipient. The sender may get a pop-up prompt to verify the last four digits of the recipient\u2019s phone number.\n\u201cThe security and privacy of all Venmo customers and their information is a top company priority,\u201d PayPal said in a statement.\nFormal changes may be coming. Zelle, which is owned by a group of seven big banks through a company called Early Warning Services, is said to be weighing new rules that wouldreimburse customersduped by certain kinds of scams. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering issuing guidance that could make banks bear more liability for customer losses on peer-to-peer transactions.\nThe report also raised concerns about privacy risks because the apps may collect and share personal information widely, often for \u201cvague\u201d purposes, and some make it difficult for users to delete their data, Consumer Reports said. (Apple Cash states clearly that it does not sell data to third parties, the review found.)\nIn general, \u201cslow down when using the apps,\u201d said Rachel Gittleman, financial services outreach manager for the Consumer Federation of America. Their speed is handy, she said, but it\u2019s easy to slip up.\nBefore hitting the button, confirm the recipient\u2019s user name, phone number or email address. \u201cDouble, triple and quadruple check\u201d that you are sending the money to the right person, Ms. Hand said.\nIt\u2019s also wise to send a small \u201ctest\u201d payment \u2014 say, $1 \u2014 and confirm the correct person received it before sending a large sum.\nThink of the payments as cash, said Jennifer White, senior director of banking and payments intelligence at J.D. Power. \u201cYou would not hand someone you did not know cash, and so you shouldn\u2019t send cash to anyone you are not personally connected with.\u201d\nOther tips: Use the identity verification options your app offers, like two-factor authentication, Ms. White said. They may slow things down a bit, but they can help avoid problems.\nCheck your accounts at least once a week to see if anything looks amiss. And if you no longer use an app, delete it from your phone so it won\u2019t be vulnerable to hacking.\nWhile people may leave funds in the apps indefinitely and use them as a payment source, it\u2019s wise to transfer funds into your own bank account as soon as possible. But consumers may be reluctant to do so quickly since some apps may charge fees for \u201cexpedited\u201d transfers, Ms. Gittleman said.\nHere are some questions and answers about payment apps:\nThe apps offer suggestions on their websites.Venmo, for instance, advises sending the person a request for payment, in the same amount that you paid, along with a note asking the person to repay you the money you sent by mistake. This \u201cmay help you get your money back faster\u201d than contacting Venmo support, the website says. If that doesn\u2019t work, the site says, contact support \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019ll do our best to help.\u201d\nBut the do-it-yourself approach depends on the cooperation of the recipient. And some may be skeptical because banks also warn mobile app users to be wary of requests to refund mistaken payments, as they could be fraudulent. TheAmerican Bankers Association, for example, advises users to \u201cnever\u201d send a payment to someone who says you got an accidental payment via one of the payment services. Instead, it says, contact the payment app about the error.\nBe suspicious of unexpected requests for payments, theFederal Trade Commissionadvises, such as someone pretending to be a loved one needing quick cash for an emergency. Confirm, by speaking to the person, that the request is real and not from someone who hacked into the person\u2019s account.\nBe aware that some scams may use messages that appear to come from your bank or from the transfer app itself.Apple Cash, for instance, warns about scammers posing as Apple tech support claiming to have found a problem with your device. They may ask you to test the device by sending a payment via Apple Cash. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make this payment,\u201d Apple Cash\u2019s website says.\nThe American Bankers Association recommends contacting both the app and your bank, as well as theFederal Trade Commission.Complainto the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and to your state attorney general\u2019sconsumer fraudoffice, Ms. Gittleman advised."
