        "title": "Bill Campbell, Coach of Silicon Valley Stars, Dies at 75",
        "fulltext": "Bill Campbell, one of the most influential background players in Silicon Valley, who was known as \u201ccoach\u201d there for his work advising technology industry stars like Steve Jobs at Apple and Larry Page at Google, died on Monday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 75.\nHis family said the cause was cancer.\nMr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.\nThe term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.\nAs recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.\nMr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.\nMr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.\nIt was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.\nStrikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.\nAt Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\n\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201d\nMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.\nMr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.\nHe later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.\nWilliam Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.\nAs a 165-pound linebacker, he was captain of Columbia\u2019s football team when it shared the Ivy League championship in 1961, the program\u2019s only Ivy title. After graduating in 1962 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics, he went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in economics as well and became an assistant coach. After six years as an assistant at Boston College, he returned toColumbia as head coach. While coaching he married Roberta Spagnola, an assistant dean. The marriage ended in divorce.\nMr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.\nIn 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.\nHe was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.\nHis survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.\nMr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201d"

Moreover, they asserted that the iPhone would most likely produce \u201cminimal evidentiary value\u201d anyway, because it was last used two years ago and the phone\u2019s owner, Jun Feng, and the other defendants in the methamphetamine case had already pleaded guilty.\nEmily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said on Friday that the help prosecutors were seeking from Apple was minimal. And she noted that Apple had provided similar assistance 70 times before without objection until recent months.\n\u201cApple has said it would take them only a few hours to open this kind of phone, because they already have the mechanism that would allow them to do so,\u201d Ms. Pierce said."

Just open the folder and press down on the app\u2019s icon until it (and all the other apps on the screen) begins to wiggle; the wiggling means you can move them around the iPad\u2019s home screen or delete them from your tablet.\nWhen you have the folder open, just put your finger on the single app inside and drag it onto the home screen. Once the folder is empty, it disappears. Press the Home button and the icons should stop jiggling and return to their normal static behavior.\nIf you want to transplant the app into a more populated folder, drag it out of its original location with your finger and position it over the folder you want to use; you can drag it across different home pages by moving to the edge of the screen and continuing on. Take your finger off the screen when the app \u201cdrops\u201d into the new folder and then press the Home button to finish the job.\nIf youuse iTunes to sync your iPad, you can also organize and rearrange the apps on your device when it is connected to your computer.

        "title": "With Finality, F.B.I. Opts Not to Share iPhone-Unlocking Method",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. closed the door Wednesday to the possibility of giving Apple the technical solution that the government bought to unlock the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nThe decision leaves Apple in the dark about the technical details of how the F.B.I. \u2014 with help from an unknown outside group that was apparently paid at least $1.3 million \u2014 managed to bypass the company\u2019s vaunted encryption.\nAfter two months of tense sparring over the San Bernardino iPhone, the government\u2019s decision was a clear rebuke to Apple. Its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has declared publicly that the company should not have to develop new software so the F.B.I. can unlock its phones. The F.B.I. on Wednesday appeared eager to return the favor by refusing to divulge how it finally broke in.\nThe decision upset some technology industry executives, who said it appeared to run counter to the Obama administration\u2019s promises to promote security and transparency in the nation\u2019s technology operations.\nApple declined to comment on Wednesday.\nF.B.I. officials maintained that what they bought from the outside company amounted only to a tool for getting into the phone, and not a blueprint exposing the actual security flaws in the device.\nAs a result, F.B.I. officials decided not to send the issue on to a special White House panel that reviews the question of whether software vulnerabilities discovered by American intelligence officials should be shared with the software designer to enhance security.\nThat review panel could have determined that the technical fix bought by the F.B.I. should be shared with Apple.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. purchased the method from an outside party so that we could unlock the San Bernardino device,\u201d said Amy S. Hess, executive assistant director for science and technology.\n\u201cWe did not, however, purchase the rights to technical details about how the method functions, or the nature and extent of any vulnerability upon which the method may rely in order to operate. As a result, currently we do not have enough technical information about any vulnerability that would permit any meaningful review\u201d by the White House examiners, she said.\nSoon after the government said that a third party had successfully gotten data from the phone, after giving the F.B.I. a demonstration of its method in February, many security professionals were hopeful that the method would be made public.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the position of Obama administration that security flaws should be disclosed to the parties that can fix them,\u201d said Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla. She added that the fact that the F.B.I. did not take the necessary steps to understand how the outside group opened the phone shows that the review process over all needs to be more transparent.\nThe government\u2019s decision simply to hire the locksmith and ignore how that lock was opened \u201ccreates a gap in the review process\u201d that is \u201cnot transparent and has not been set in legislation,\u201d she said.\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s carefully worded statement reveals that law enforcement authorities have found a loophole in the vulnerability review process created by the administration\u2014 hire the hacker to extract the data, but be careful to not know how he got the job done.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. is intentionally exploiting a known vulnerability and enabling people to profit off of it,\u201d said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer at HackerOne, a security company in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for corporations. \u201cThe collateral damage done by this lack of transparency and the possible ongoing existence of the flaw is serious.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s claim that it does not have enough details to provide any information to the review process is not unusual. \u201cOver the last 10 years as cellphones became more important to criminal investigations, law enforcement would hire digital forensics teams, would extract data for investigators without necessarily buying the capability to do it themselves,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the co-founder of the security start-up Carbon Black.\nThe F.B.I. decided not to send the issue to the White House to review under a classified and little-known system known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.\nThere are often \u201clegitimate pros and cons\u201d in deciding whether a flaw should be disclosed to the designer, a senior official said in a2014 White House blog post\u2014 one of the few times the review process has been publicly discussed.\nBecause the government relies on Internet security, wrote Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president on cybersecurity, \u201cdisclosing vulnerabilities usually makes sense. We need these systems to be secure as much as, if not more so, than anyone else.\u201d\nBut Mr. Daniel acknowledged that the United States government could sometimes exploit the security flaws itself if it does not disclose them.\n\u201cDisclosing a vulnerability can mean that we forgo an opportunity to collect crucial intelligence that could thwart a terrorist attack, stop the theft of our nation\u2019s intellectual property, or even discover more dangerous vulnerabilities that are being used by hackers or other adversaries to exploit our networks,\u201d he said."

        "title": "How to Switch to iPhone From Android: Patience and Persistence",
        "fulltext": "WHENApple first released the iPhonein 2007, I wrotea blog postwith the headline: \u201cWhy my phone won\u2019t be an iPhone.\u201d I laid out several reasons I would not be giving up myPalm Treo 700pfor Apple\u2019s gadget, including the poor voice and data service of Apple\u2019s lone wireless partner, AT&T, and the lack of third-party apps.\nThe iPhone has obviously come a long way since then. It can now be used on any carrier. Its voice and data quality are stellar. Some of its built-in apps, such as Apple Pay, are best in class. There are 1.5 million apps created by outside developers.\nI have finally caved in: My phone is now an iPhone.\nAnd I got there the way that many others have: by switching from an Android-based smartphone. About six weeks ago, I swapped my two-year-oldSamsung Galaxy S5for a new iPhone 6S to better understand Apple\u2019s flagship product as I began a new assignment about the company.\nFaced with slowing sales growth, Apple is counting on millions of people like me to give up their Android phones, which can be bought new for as little as $30 in some countries, to purchase iPhones, which cost $400 or more.\n\u201cWe were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told Wall Street in January. \u201cWe see that as a huge opportunity.\u201d\nAs someone who has since 2010 used high-end phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, I have experienced a rocky transition, like moving to a faraway city. The landmarks are unfamiliar, the customs are different, and I miss my old haunts even as I explore new ones.\nSwitching phone operating systems should in theory be simple. First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one. Then you reinstall your favorite apps. Finally you customize the settings for features like ring tones and notifications and learn the quirks of your new device.\nApple has adetailed guideand a special app to help those switching from an Android. Apple also offers assistance at its retail stores as well as 90 days of free telephone support. Google, which does not itself sell most of the phones that run on Android, has aweb page of tipsfor those switching from an Apple.\nBut as I learned, many things can go wrong, and my experience is not unusual.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through the things that are most valuable to you and make sure it\u2019s all there,\u201d said Jonathan S. Geller, editor in chief of BGR, a tech news site that reviews phones and writes frequently about switching. \u201cFor a normal consumer, it\u2019s reasonably frustrating.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what happened when I switched:\nThe problems began at the outset. I downloaded Apple\u2019s switching app,Move to iOS, to my Samsung and paired the two phones. The app got stuck in the middle of the data transfer and eventually froze.\nVerizon, my mobile carrier, offers its own method of transferring data calledVerizon Cloud. I tried it but could not get the two phones to sync directly. I had to back up the Samsung to the cloud, then download the data to the iPhone.\nA lot of contacts and photos never made it through. It was as if a moving company had lost half my stuff during a cross-country haul.\nApple later told me that I could have called a toll-free number for help, gone to an Apple store or erased everything and started over. The company lent me another iPhone 6S to try the Move to iOS app again \u2014 and this time it did transfer my data. But it failed to do the other half of the job: download the Apple versions of my Android apps to the new iPhone.\nAs many phone switchers do, I had to manually reinstall my apps. Popular apps like Facebook, Uber and Amazon were easy to find. But some of my standbys \u2014 including a simple public transit app,BART Runner\u2014 were not available for the iPhone, and I have yet to find a perfect replacement.\nOn the flip side, I can now communicate with my relatives onFaceTime, Apple\u2019s video chat service, andread missed issues of The New Yorkerduring long commutes, something that is much harder to do on Android.\nI am also now more likely to get early access to cutting-edge apps, since American app makers tend to build for the iPhone first. Last year, for example, when I wanted to tryTwitter\u2019s new Periscope live-streaming app, I had to borrow my wife\u2019s iPhone because Periscope was not yet available for Android.\nThe most fundamental difference between iPhones and Androids is the level of conformity dictated by each company. This is where personal preferences play a big role in customer satisfaction.\nApple exercises great control over the look, feel and features of iPhones to deliver its idealized version of what it thinks people want. Android is free-form and adaptable \u2014 so much so that the look and feel can vary widely from one phone maker to the next, especially in Asia.\nOne consequence of Apple\u2019s approach is that the iPhone is more stable. Every Android phone I have ever used has suffered mysterious hardware and software problems like random reboots and crashing apps. These happen much more rarely in iOS.\nBut Apple\u2019s control has its downsides. The company makes its apps the permanent default options for common services like maps, web browsing and email.\nGoogle also requires most phone makers to make its services the initial default on Android phones, but Android users can change those defaults. For example, if you don\u2019t want to use Google Maps for navigation, you can set your phone to automatically accessHere MapsorWazeevery time you encounter an address.\nIn my case, I have a Windows laptop; my employer, The New York Times, uses Google\u2019s enterprise apps; and I depend on Google\u2019s search technology to find airline tickets, email addresses and old photos stored in my various digital pockets. My life is deeply enmeshed in the Google ecosystem.\nTo make my iPhone more familiar and my data easier to find, I put my favorite Google apps on my home screen and mostly use them instead of Apple\u2019s apps. Google has knitted its iPhone apps together so that Gmail uses Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, when you click on a link in an email, and Google\u2019s calendar uses Google Maps when you click on an address.\nGiven the headaches of switching, most people avoid it.\nMichael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which surveys smartphone users in the United States, said only about one out of five people activating a new iPhone or Android was switching from the other platform. \u201cIn the past two years, the loyalty and switching rates have gotten very, very set,\u201d he said.\nOver all, I am getting more comfortable with my iPhone. I like Apple\u2019s fingerprint reader and have finally figured out how to align my fingertips precisely enough to unlock the phone (at least most of the time).\nWill the iPhone ever feel like home? Check back in two years, when I am due for my next upgrade."

        "title": "What the Apple Watch Does, One Year Later",
        "fulltext": "A YEAR ago this month, Apple made its Apple Watchavailable for sale. In the 12 months since, the smartwatch has received mixedreviews, and manypeople are still uncertainabout what the device can do.\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s uses, of course, partly depend on the apps available for it. On that front, the news is good \u2014 the list of apps for the watch is ever-growing. Here are some of the best ones to try.\nMy favorite Apple Watch app is one of the simplest. It\u2019s calledFacer, and it does one thing: It puts a different background image on the screen of your watch every time you raise it to see the time. This is weirdly rewarding. I love glancing down to see a new or interesting image when checking the watch, and it reminds me that this device really is a piece of 21st-century technology.\nThere are a few limitations to Facer. The biggest is that you are stuck with only one watch face design \u2014 the simplest, which shows only an image and the time. That means you will not see features like alerts or weather information that you can see on other watch faces. You also have to pay for some of the images, which can cost $1 and up.\nThe most useful watch app I have installed isGrocery Shopping List Free \u2014 Buy Me a Pie!, which works on both the watch and iPhone.\nThe idea is that when you survey your shelves and refrigerator, you use the iPhone app to pull together a shopping list. The app makes this easy, offering prearranged options for items you may regularly buy, like bread, milk, bagels and so on. You can color-code each item to make identifying different categories of products easy, and items the app does not already have can be typed in. You can also set up multiple lists, and share them with others.\nWhen shopping, you can view your shopping list on your watch, without having to fish out your phone. This is a fabulous memory aid. Swiping the items on the watch screen to mark them as bought is satisfying. And you can use dictation on the watch to add items to a list, which is great when you suddenly remember something you need to buy.\nThe app is easy to read and use. It is also free (though with limited features, and ads). A similar free app calledBring!has much the same utility, but with more iconlike graphics and a slightly more modern user interface. It\u2019s good, but I prefer the simplicity of Buy Me a Pie.\nPromoting health and fitness is a great use for the watch, and the $3HeartWatchis particularly helpful. The app shows your most recent heart rate reading, as well as an indication of your average heart rate and the maximum and minimum for that day.\nAt a glance this can tell you if your heart has been speeding, which is useful after a jog, for example. By using Force Touch \u2014 pressing hard on the watch \u2014 you can add a note to that day\u2019s readings, or add a measurement to your Apple Health app, including weight, body temperature and many more.\nThe accompanying iPhone app is well designed and can display lots of heart health statistics, most of which are easily readable thanks to clever graphics. You can also use it to track your sleeping habits.\nA better sleep tracking option, though, is the freeSleep++. This works by measuring your movements during the night via your Apple Watch, giving an indication of how restless you were.\nThe app has one button to turn the sleep-detecting mode on, during which it displays your bedtime and how long you have been sleeping. There is also a single button to turn the sleep mode off, after which the app shows some sleep statistics. The accompanying iPhone app displays detailed information about sleep patterns.\nThe one downside of this app is that the watch must be worn during the night, which may be uncomfortable for some.\nCyclesis another useful free health app, delivering at-a-glance information about a menstrual cycle. Its accompanying iPhone app lets people log many more details and set up alerts.\nFinal mentions go to the eye-pleasing weather appWeather Underground, which I prefer to Apple\u2019s own weather option;Meetup,a great location-based watch app that is good for meeting like-minded people for work or for shared pastimes; andGlyphica, a text-based adventure like so many classic adventure games that you can actually play on your watch. These are all free.\nSony has a new Android app,PlayStation Video, which lets PlayStation owners stream to a phone or tablet films and shows they have purchased or rented from the PlayStation store. It\u2019s the first time this sort of service has been available on Android proper. PlayStation Video is free."

The Brooklyn phone had become the latest battleground in the fight between Apple and the Justice Department over issues of privacy and security.\nLast month, in a higher-profile case that set off a national debate, prosecutors dropped their demand that Apple develop software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage in December. The F.B.I. unlocked that phone after paying an outside party to demonstrate how to do so.\nIn the Brooklyn case, the drug dealer\u2019s phone was running an older operating system that lacks the encryption features of the San Bernardino phone, so unlocking that device would involve much less technical sophistication even without the passcode.\nApple had voluntarily helped prosecutors unlock phones in some 70 earlier cases involving phones with the older operating systems, but it changed its stance last fall and began challenging the Justice Department\u2019s legal authority to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to force its technical assistance in such cases.\nProsecutors had said for months that they needed Apple to provide what amounted to a technical passkey to the Brooklyn phone because the owner, a confessed methamphetamine dealer named Jun Feng, claimed to have forgotten the passcode.\nThat changed on Thursday evening, when someone gave the government the passcode, prosecutors said in the letter to the court. Officials would not say whether it was Mr. Feng or someone close to him who provided the passcode.\n\u201cBecause we now have access to the data we sought, we notified the court of this recent development and have withdrawn our request for assistance,\u201d said Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman. \u201cThis is an ongoing investigation and therefore we are not revealing the identity of the individual.\u201d\nA judge sided with Apple in the Brooklyn fight in February, issuing a stinging 50-page ruling that said prosecutors had overstepped their legal authority. The Justice Department had beenseeking to overturnthat ruling and force Apple\u2019s cooperation, but that now becomes a moot issue.\nApple, which declined to comment on Friday, has raised similar objections to unlocking iPhones in a Boston case and in at least several dozen others elsewhere, most of which are under court seal.\nAlex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has supported Apple in the recent encryption fights, said that the latest development in Brooklyn was \u201cvery welcome news.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a debate that should be had in Congress before asking the courts to weigh in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be better for everyone\u2019s digital security.\u201d\nIn the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. was able to get into the phone after a fierce court fight that stretched for two months and drew international attention. The bureau\u2019s director, James B. Comey, indicated this week that the group that demonstrated how to unlock the phone waspaid at least $1.3 million."

        "title": "F.B.I. Lawyer Won\u2019t Say if Data From Unlocked iPhone Is Useful",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The epic fight between the F.B.I. and Apple over a locked iPhone is now over, but a central question in the case has remained unanswered: What secrets did the phone, used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage, actually hold?\nThe question has persisted with all the anticipation of Geraldo Rivera\u2019s ill-fated unlocking of Al Capone\u2019s secret vault on live television 30 years ago \u2014 which produced only a few empty liquor bottles and a stop sign.\nOn Tuesday, the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer shed a bit more light on the question, a week after the Justice Department announced that it hadgotten into the iPhonewithout Apple\u2019s help. The lawyer, James A. Baker, the bureau\u2019s general counsel, told an audience of privacy professionals in Washington that the F.B.I. had extracted data and was putting it to use.\nHe would not say, however, whether he considered the data \u2014 the subject of a monthlong legal battle between Apple and the F.B.I. that ended when an undisclosed outside firm helped investigators unlock the phone \u2014 to be \u201cuseful.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working on that, I guess is the answer,\u201d he said.\nBut he added: \u201cIt was worth the fight to make sure that we have turned over every rock that we can with respect to the investigation. We owe it to the victims and the families to make sure that we pursue every logical lead.\u201d\nMr. Baker would not say for certain whether the content would be made public.\n\u201cIf and when it becomes appropriate to disclose it, we will,\u201d he said.\nAfter Apple fought the F.B.I.\u2019s efforts to force it to help unlock the phone, the bureau paid the outside firm an undisclosed amount to demonstrate for its investigators how to get around two defensive mechanisms that had kept them out.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nWhile the results were good news for the F.B.I., they have concerned privacy advocates, who say that Apple\u2019s vaunted encryption methods may now be vulnerable.\nF.B.I. officials have been talking with Apple executives about the issue since they unlocked the phone, Mr. Baker said. But he added that \u201cwe have not shared the solution with Apple to date.\u201d\nFor weeks, law enforcement officials have played down expectations about what might be found in the phone, which was used last year by Syed Rizwan Farook before he and his wife carried out the California attack, in which 14 people were killed.\nMr. Farook and his wife destroyed several other mobile devices, and it was seen as unlikely that he would keep sensitive information related to the December attack on an intact phone issued to him by the San Bernardino County government.\nInvestigators have hoped that the phone might help them answer two lingering questions: where the couple went in the minutes after the shooting, and whether any unidentified people in the United States or overseas may have been involved in the plot.\nThe only personcharged criminallyso far in connection with the attack is Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor accused of providing the couple with the assault weapons used in the attack, and of conspiring with Mr. Farook in an earlier, unexecuted plot. The F.B.I. has executed search warrants at the homes of the attackers\u2019 family members, but no relatives have been charged.\nMr. Baker\u2019s comments came at a public appearance before theInternational Association of Privacy Professionals. Michael Sussmann, an electronic privacy lawyer who interviewed Mr. Baker for the event, said afterward that the F.B.I.\u2019s ability to extract any data from the phone after such a prolonged struggle was significant, even if the information did not prove particularly eye-opening.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s more information in the phone \u2014 more contacts, more communications, more of anything \u2014 that\u2019s a success for the F.B.I.,\u201d he said."
