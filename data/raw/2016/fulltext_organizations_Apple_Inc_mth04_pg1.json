        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple created more than a decade\u2019s worth of new gadgets to fuel its historic growth.\nBut the technology company\u2019s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday \u2014 a casualty of Apple\u2019s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers.\nApple, the Silicon Valley giant that has spent much of the last five years as the world\u2019s most valuable company,said on Tuesdaythat revenue for its second fiscal quarter, which ended in March, declined 13 percent to $50.6 billion as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, fell, with little else to take its place.\nNearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries. Rival smartphone makers using Google\u2019s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.\nOver all, Apple sold 16 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s best days are behind it,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. \u201cThe company grew at astronomical rates, and it\u2019s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\nApple\u2019s disappointing quarter is the latest in a string of bad reports from the biggest technology companies. While the reasons vary \u2014 including the long slump in personal computer sales and slipping prices for online ads \u2014 a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, described the decline as a \u201cpause,\u201d not a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business.\n\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright.\u201d\nBut investors were not so sure. Net income fell 22 percent to $10.5 billion, or $1.90 a share. Apple\u2019sresultsfell well short of Wall Street expectations, and its shares were down as much as 8 percent in after-hours trading. That wiped out about $47 billion in stock market value.\nSales fell faster in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, than in any other region, down 26 percent compared with the previous year. Sales in mainland China, Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States, fell 11 percent as the country struggled with a slowing economy. Apple\u2019s prospects there remain uncertain since the governmentrecently shut down Apple\u2019s e-book and digital movie serviceswithout explanation.\nApple\u2019s forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.\nAmit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the personal computer market a decade ago.\nMr. Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a common theme across technology companies,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple\u2019s iPhone. The company\u2019s larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple\u2019s stock to a record high.\n\u201cIf you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it\u2019s increased 80 percent,\u201d he said.\nApple\u2019s newest phone, the four-inch iPhone SE, went on sale March 31 \u2014 too late to affect the second quarter\u2019s results \u2014 and Mr. Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.\nApple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone, but declined to provide specific figures.\nThe iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr. Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.\nApple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to $175 billion.\nApple\u2019s services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 percent. The company ended the quarter with $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\n\u201cWhen we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Although unit sales were down 16 percent, \u201cwe continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\u201d\nDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company\u2019s growth challenges and worries about its position in China.\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.\nThe company has been embroiled in awell-publicized battle with the federal governmentover unlocking encrypted iPhones. But Mr. Maestri said it had not seen any impact on sales, positive or negative, from the controversy."

        "title": "F.B.I. Director Suggests Bill for iPhone Hacking Topped $1.3 Million",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The director of the F.B.I. suggested Thursday that his agency paid at least $1.3 million to an undisclosed group to help hack into the encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nAt a conference on global security in London, a moderator asked James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone\u2019s encryption.\n\u201cA lot,\u201d Mr. Comey said, as audience members at the Aspen Institute event laughed.\nHe continued: \u201cLet\u2019s see, more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. had been unwilling to say anything at all until Thursday about how much it paid for what has become one of the world\u2019s most publicized hacking jobs, so Mr. Comey\u2019s cryptic comments about his own wages and the bounty quickly sent listeners scurrying in search of their calculators.\nThe F.B.I. director makes about $185,100 a year \u2014 so Mr. Comey stands to earn at least $1.35 million at that base rate of pay for the remainder of his 10-year term.\nThe F.B.I. declined to confirm or deny Thursday whether the bureau had in fact paid at least $1.3 million for the hacking, and it declined to elaborate on Mr. Comey\u2019s suggestive remarks.\nBut that price tag, if confirmed, appears in line with what other companies have offered for identifying iOS vulnerabilities.\nZerodium, a security firm in Washington that collects and then sells such bugs, said last fall that it would pay $1 million for weaknesses in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 operating system. Hackers eventually claimed that bounty. The iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman ran iOS 9.\n\u201cA number of factors go into pricing these bounties,\u201d said Alex Rice, the co-founder of the security start-up HackerOne CTO, who also started Facebook\u2019s bug bounty program. Mr. Rice said that the highest premiums were paid when the buyer didn\u2019t intend to disclose the flaw to a party that could fix it.\n\u201cThe cost of keeping a flaw secret is high,\u201d Mr. Rice said. He added that buyers like Zerodium\u2019s customers and the government might not work to fix problems.\nWhen companies run bug bounty programs, they may pay about $100,000 to hackers that show them system vulnerabilities that must be fixed. \u201cWhen you sell at a high price, you have to be O.K. with the possibility that the person you sold the flaw to could do something bad with it,\u201d Mr. Rice said.\nWhile Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks appeared to address the lingering mystery of how much the F.B.I. paid to get into the San Bernardino phone, he said nothing that would indicate the actual identity of the outside group behind the hacking. Some media reports have named an Israeli software company that might have helped the F.B.I., but numerous law enforcement officials have said that company was not involved.\nAfter an intense courtroom fight in Southern California, the F.B.I. disclosed three weeks ago that it had managed to get access to the data inside an iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino rampage, which killed 14 people, by paying the outside group.\nThe Justice Department had gone to court to try to force Apple to develop a new operating system to allow access into the encrypted phone, setting off an intense national debate about privacy versus national security. But it withdrew its case after the outside party came to the F.B.I. and demonstrated a way around the phone\u2019s internal defenses, which would have destroyed the data inside after 10 failed password attempts and would have meant longer and longer intervals in between guesses.\nWith those mechanisms disabled, the F.B.I. was able to use what is called a brute force attack \u2014 using computers to guess vast numbers of password combinations at once \u2014 in order to get inside the phone.\nBut the Justice Department is still trying to force Apple in court to help unlock encrypted phones in Brooklyn, Boston and elsewhere."

The new rules are an attempt to make top employees accountable for the longer-term consequences\n                                                    of their risk-taking.\nIt is already an industry standard to wait three years to release stock-based bonuses, but banks have been less consistent about seizing pay if bankers\u2019 actions lead to losses. Under these new rules,bankers are vulnerable to clawbacks for seven years after pay is received.\nRick Metsger, the vice chairman at the National Credit Union Administration, which was one of the agencies responsible for drafting the rules, said that politicians and the public\u201cwant senior executives at large financial institutions held accountable if their desire for personal enrichment leads to decision-making that results in material losses.\u201d\nThe public will have until July to comment on the new rules, and the rules are likely to go into effect several months after that.\n\nVALEANT SAID TO PICK NEW C.E.O.|The pharmaceuticals company Valeant iscompleting a contract with Joseph Papa, the chief executive of Perrigo,The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.\nValeant aimed to announce as soon as next week that he would succeed J.

Is it possible to download these albums to my iPhone and iPad? If so, how?\nA.If you have the music in your iTunes library, moving it can be as simple as connecting the device to the computer with the USB cable that came with the iPad and iPhone. Once you have everything plugged in, open iTunes andlook for the iPhone/iPad iconin the upper-left corner of the iTunes window.\nClick on the icon and in the left panel of the iTunes window, click on Music. In the main part of the iTunes window, click the box next to Sync Music andchoose what you would like to sync\u2014 all your iTunes music and playlists, or just sections from your collections. Click Apply and then Sync to copy the music to the iOS device over the USB cable.

I\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019m getting really tired of saying that. We\u2019ve alreadychatted on Facebook Livethis week. We keep up a regular banter on Slack and Twitter. And then there\u2019s this newsletter, week in and week out. You\u2019re a nice guy, but \u2026 don\u2019t you think we\u2019re just too involved?\nMike: Is this you trying to break up with me? Don\u2019t ever leave me, Farhad. I\u2019m too fragile.\nFarhad: Er, let\u2019s just talk about tech news. It was another big week for corporate earnings. Let\u2019s summarize:Apple made $10.5 billion in three months, which would be a record for just about any other company on the planet, but for Apple it was an embarrassing comedown from its year-ago peak. Now people are wondering whether Apple\u2019s best days are in its past. Hey, whose aren\u2019t, am I right?\nMike: My mom says my best days are ahead of me. But she also said I was the coolest kid in school which, uh, turned out to be a slight exaggeration.\nFarhad: Twitteralso disappointed investors: The company added some new users, but it fell short of revenue projections, sending people on Twitter into a panic. Amazon, meanwhile,crushed it. The company\u2019s sales grew 28 percent, and it posted a profit of $513 million, a record for Amazon. For those keeping score at home: That\u2019s about what Apple makes every four days. Amazon\u2019s stock went predictably nuts.\nMike: Man, what if your job was looking at how much companies\u2019 profit margins grew or shrank every day? Just thinking of being surrounded by Excel spreadsheets and punching in figures makes me want to cry.\nFarhad: While we\u2019re on the boring subject of earnings, let\u2019s note some recent boardroom shuffles. So Yahoo \u2014 remember them? Used to be kind of famous \u2014 gave in to one of its fiercest tormentors this week: the hedge fund Starboard Value, often described as an activist investor. Yahooallowed Starboard to have four seats on its board, a way to ease some tensions in advance of a potential sale of Yahoo\u2019s core bus\u2014 oh, my God, I\u2019m bored already. Anyway, that\u2019s the Yahoo update.\nMike:Holy moly, I am bored out of my mind. I need a place to sleep now.\nFarhad:Funny you should say that! Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post and theauthor of a new book about sleep, hasjoined the board of Uber. Also, the Huffington Postrecently killeda story critical of Uber. Coincidence, I\u2019m sure.\nMike: Maybe she can tell me the best way to sleep in an Uber. She\u2019s willing tojoin us on rides, apparently.\nFarhad: Maybe we should chat about Facebook? Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social behemoth announcedhuge growth and profits this week, beating out even the most optimistic of analysts\u2019 expectations.Zuck also announced his intention to become a kind of world-historic deity, creating a new stock structure that would allow him to give away his money so that he can do things like \u2014 I kid you not, this is a real goal,written down on paperand everything \u2014 \u201ccure all diseases by the end of this century.\u201d\nSo you cover Facebook. Tell me, why are they doing so well? More important, can anything stop them?\nMike:I think we talked a little bit about this in our Facebook Live discussion this week. (Tune in every week!) It\u2019s an important thing to highlight, so let\u2019s dive in again.\nFor one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone.\nThat killed \u2014 or at least deeply wounded \u2014 quite a few successful companies. Remember Zynga? That place was raking in the cash from FarmVille-loving moms on the desktop. Suddenly, everyone is playing Candy Crush Saga on the iPhone and all those cash crops are lying fallow. Zynga still hasn\u2019t recovered or found a viable way out.\nAnyway, Facebook nailed mobile ads in the news feed, and now 82 percent of the company\u2019s ad revenue comes from people viewing those ads on smartphones. That\u2019s a shift in just a few years, and it\u2019s insane.\nFarhad:It\u2019s all the more remarkable considering how unlikely the transition looked a few years ago. Just after the company\u2019s I.P.O. in 2012, investors were almost universally convinced that Facebook couldn\u2019t get people hooked on its app the way it had seduced us on desktops. And analysts were constantly sounding an alarm that Facebook was just a fad \u2014 \u201cTeenagers Leaving Facebook!\u201d became an evergreen tech headline \u2014 and everyone was constantly on the lookout for the next great social network.\nFacebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasn\u2019t dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used. Kind of like how you and I can\u2019t stop chatting no matter what machine we\u2019re on.\nMike:Yes, isn\u2019t it great? Now, Facebook gets to make all these huge bets on the future to figure out where the next enormous platform for consumers will be and really try to dominate that long before it\u2019s backed into a corner and forced to.\nNo one puts Zuck in the corner, ever again.\nThat means huge gambles on acquiring start-ups like Oculus, the virtual reality company, and WhatsApp, the messaging app, for billions upon billions of dollars.\nI\u2019m nervous to give Facebook too much in the way of props, only because it\u2019s already a lovefest with analysts and what goes up must eventually come down. I think Isaac Newton said that. Or Gordon Gekko.\nFarhad: Yeah, I don\u2019t think we should go overboard. Their bets on the future still face huge questions: Can WhatsApp ever make money? Will Facebook Messenger really become a place for commerce and services? Will virtual reality become entrenched in society, or could it end up as the next 3-D TV? And then there\u2019s the biggest vulnerability: Will the new Farhad and Mike Facebook Live show convince people to delete Facebook forever?\nMike: I\u2019ve got people unfriending me after that show already \u2014 99 percent of the comments were insults.\nAnyway, for now, Facebook is still the company to beat. I guess they get to keep taking victory laps.\nFarhad: Not for long, friend. We\u2019re doing another Facebook video next week. That\u2019ll show them. See you then!"

        "title": "Why Apple\u2019s Stand Against the F.B.I. Hurts Its Own Customers",
        "fulltext": "Two weeks ago, privacy advocates across the country celebrated as the Federal Bureau of Investigation backed off its request for Apple to help gain access into the iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.\nOn Friday, the F.B.I. again sought Apple\u2019s assistance \u2014 this time to help crack an iPhone belonging to a convicted drug dealer \u2014 by requesting that a federal judge overturn an earlier decision in Brooklyn supporting Apple.\nApple had argued in part that it didn\u2019t want iPhone hacking by the government to become routine. That the F.B.I. so soon wants access to another iPhone would seem to prove Apple right and to vindicate the company\u2019s principled resistance, right? Wrong.\nApple\u2019s decision not to help in the Farook case was ultimately bad for the company and its customers. Apple has lost leverage in legal cases and the average iPhone user is significantly more vulnerable \u2014 both to government access and to criminal hacking \u2014 than if Apple had assisted the government in the first place.\nThe F.B.I. has already found a company able to access Mr. Farook\u2019s phone without Apple\u2019s assistance, presumably taking advantage of a vulnerability that Apple has either not yet identified or not yet patched. That means that the F.B.I. should be able to access information on similar iPhones. (Even though it may have the technical means to access the Brooklyn phone, the Justice Department argued in its letter to the court that \u201cthe government continues to require Apple\u2019s assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant.\u201d)\nApple is now asking the F.B.I. to \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclose the vulnerability so that Apple can rapidly patch it. Apple\u2019s request is predicated on a White House process, created in 2014, that explicitly requires the government to weigh the trade-off between the security benefits of eliminating a vulnerability in a piece of consumer software and the intelligence benefits of continuing access.\nRelying on this White House process may not help much, though. First, as Ben Wittes of the Brookings Institution has pointed out, the F.B.I. has no legal obligation to disclose the vulnerability. While the White House made clear that its process was \u201cbiased toward responsibly disclosing\u201d vulnerabilities, it also went out of the way to note that it would not \u201ccompletely forgo this tool as a way to conduct intelligence collection.\u201d\nMoreover, it\u2019s certainly possible, indeed likely, that the company that cracked the iPhone made nondisclosure a condition of giving the government this information; after all, finding vulnerabilities is presumably a moneymaking endeavor for the company (and thus, this vulnerability is conceivably available in the marketplace to the highest bidder), and voluntarily letting Apple fix it doesn\u2019t seem like a great business plan.\nWhile the F.B.I. has refused to say whether it will ultimately share the vulnerability with Apple (and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and vice chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence committee, has suggested that it should not), Apple\u2019s previous position is almost certain to make the government more likely to withhold the information. Apple has made it clear that it will fight tooth and nail the government\u2019s effort to get lawful access, and will implement as many technical measures as necessary to limit such access.\nGiven that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the government decided in favor of leaving this back door open so it could continue to access iPhones.\nWhy does all this matter? Simple: The longer it takes Apple to patch this vulnerability (either because the government discloses it to Apple or because Apple figures it out on its own), the longer iPhone user data is at risk \u2014 both from the government and from criminals.\nSo privacy advocates should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of Apple\u2019s decision for both the company and its customers. If Apple had complied with the California court\u2019s order, it could have used a method to obtain access that was known only to the company. The vulnerability would be safe, or at least, safer (hackers could eventually re-create this method).\nFor those of us concerned with government overreach and privacy, there would be three clear benefits to Apple\u2019s cooperation. First, by forcing the government to come to it in the first instance, Apple retains the ability to litigate court orders \u2014 assuming its position is not to refuse to cooperate no matter the particular facts \u2014 and thereby challenge the government in specific cases of possible overreach.\nSecond, Apple can choose to protect the method for lawful access as closely as it wants, including by storing it in the same way that it stores its source code or its software signing keys. And, perhaps most important, Apple would leave it to the courts do their job to figure out whether the F.B.I. has probable cause for a search.\nUltimately, the question is this: For lawful access to material important to terrorism investigations, would we rather trust Apple itself under the close supervision of the courts, or the F.B.I. and some private company that makes money selling cellphone hacks? The latter, which is where we clearly are, seems bad for the privacy and security of iPhone users around the globe."

        "fulltext": "This is what to expect from the week ahead:\nFor fans of tech stocks, this week is a cornucopia of earnings information. IBM kicks things off on Monday, followed by Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday, Google and Microsoft on Thursday and other companies throughout the week. That is a pretty diverse bunch of giants, but they share a common theme: How are they coping? IBM has suffered multiple tough quarters as people move from its high-priced services, while Intel is hoping its cloud computing data centers will make up for missing the smartphone boom. Google is starting to play catch-up in cloud services against Amazon. Microsoft, another cloud provider, has to move its old software businesses to the new computing system. Yahoo, which lost out to Google and others, is coping with something else entirely: On Monday,bids to buy all or part of the companyare due.Quentin Hardy\nThe last of the big banks will report their first-quarter earnings this week, with Morgan Stanley announcing its results on Monday and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Both banks have set low expectations, in line with the lackluster profits and revenues that theother big banks declaredlast week. The other banks reported particularly weak results in their Wall Street divisions. That does not bode well for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, given that they are the most Wall Street-focused firms in the industry. Analysts will seek more information about the cost cuts that Morgan Stanley announced last quarter. Similar cuts may be in store at Goldman.Nathaniel Popper\nOn Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on new housing starts in March. After a5.2 percent jumpin February, the biggest monthly increase since September, construction growth is expected to have moderated but still rise slightly for the month. Buoyed by low-interest rates and steady jobs growth, the real estate market has been fairly strong, which is helping the economy even as other sectors like manufacturing soften.Nelson D. Schwartz\nA battle over encryption is heading again to Capitol Hill as Apple and F.B.I. officials appear before House members to defend their positions. In a hearing on Tuesday before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and the F.B.I.\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, Amy Hess, will testify on separate panels. The issue has pitted the technology sector against law enforcement in a broader debate over privacy and security. The F.B.I. has pushed for access to encrypted data in terrorist and other criminal investigations. Apple has fought back, saying some of the F.B.I.\u2019s demands to decrypt technology would weaken its products\u2019 security and infringe on users\u2019 privacy. The company\u2019s court battle with the F.B.I. over a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack was recently resolved, but the two parties continue to fight over the unlocking of an iPhone used in aNew York drug case.Cecilia Kang\nUnitedHealth Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Last year\u2019sprofits sufferedbecause the company said it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars selling individual policies under the federal health care law. UnitedHealth\u2019s chief executive said the company would leave the exchange if it could not make money. Investors will be watching for signs that the company has turned the business around \u2014 or has plans to make good on its promise to exit the exchange.Reed Abelson\nThe European Central Bank will meet on Thursday in Frankfurt, but is not expected to make any changes to policy. At its last meeting in March, the bank\u2019s Governing Councilannounced a battery of stimulus measuresaimed at raising inflation, which is near zero, back to the official target of below 2 percent. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, is expected to argue on Thursday that the measures, which include paying banks to make loans, will be enough to avert a downward spiral of consumer prices that could be disastrous for growth and jobs.Jack Ewing\nGeneral Motors on Thursday will report first-quarter earnings that are expected to improve, primarily because of continued strong sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in its core North American market. Its performance in international divisions is expected to be uneven, with modest gains forecast in Europe and possibly weaker results in China. On Friday, G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, will release compensation figures for 2015 for its senior executives, including Mary T. Barra, its chief executive and chairwoman.Bill Vlasic\n\nVolkswagen faces a Thursday court deadline to present a plan to fix nearly 600,000 diesel cars in the United States that are polluting more than allowed. Some lawyers in the case were optimistic there would be a broad agreement to compensate Volkswagen owners and settle enforcement actions brought by state and federal governments. Other lawyers were more cautious, saying the settlement talks remained difficult. Last month Judge Charles R. Breyer for the Federal District Court in San Franciscosaid he would hold a trialthis summer if Volkswagen is not able to reach a settlement.\nVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\nThe company\u2019s supervisory board on Friday may also disclose some of the findings of aninternal investigationon who was responsible for programming 11 million diesel cars, mostly in Europe and the United States, to evade emissions limits. The investigation is being conducted by the law firm Jones Day on behalf of the supervisory board. The damage to Volkswagen\u2019s reputation has been elevated by the company\u2019s failure, seven months after thefraud came to light, to explain the circumstances behind it.Jack Ewing\nEurozone and European Union finance ministers will hold two days of meetings in Amsterdam starting on Friday. The bloc\u2019s 19 eurozone ministers are expected to seek an agreement with Greece on reforms in exchange for more bailout aid so that Greece can pay back debt that matures in July. Among the numerous issues that have held up agreement is the push by the International Monetary Fund to ease the repayment burden on Greece as a condition for helping to finance last year\u2019s86 billion euro bailout, the nation\u2019s third in five years. The bloc\u2019s 28 finance ministers are also scheduled to discuss proposals requiring companies to disclose more data about their offshore arrangements. The proposals were announced in the wake of the Panama Papers, which exposed ways the rich and powerful use tax havens.James Kanter\nThe big moves for General Electric are in the rearview mirror. Its post-financial crisis campaign ofreturning to its industrial rootsand shedding much of its once-bloated finance arm is complete. On Friday, when G.E. reports its quarterly results, analysts will scout for signs of health in the industrial economy. Expect a mixed picture, with strong sales of jet engines and power generators strong and weak oil field equipment sales. Even if G.E. does well, the stock price may not respond. Its price-earnings ratio is high, Wall Street figures. Big moves stir excitement in a way steady execution does not.Steve Lohr"

        "title": "Samsung Profits Are Up, Thanks to Its Galaxy 7 Smartphone",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 Samsung performed better than expected at the beginning of what it has said will be a tough year, thanks to a product that recently has been its Achilles\u2019 heel: smartphones.\nThe South Korean electronics maker said on Thursday that its operating profit for the first three months of this year rose about 10 percent over the same period a year ago. The increase was slightly less than the fourth quarter\u2019s, but better than many analysts had expected. Much of that performance came from sales of its curvy new Galaxy S7 smartphones, analysts said.\nThe results indicate that even as the company has faced moderating growth, it has the potential to surprise with new products that catch consumers\u2019 eyes.\nSamsung probably cannot return to the heady days of 2013, when strong smartphone sales powered its transformation into a global device company and helped it make nearly $10 billion a quarter. But the strong smartphone sales are a welcome return to form for a part of the company that has been squeezed at one end by cheap Chinese smartphone makers and at the other by Apple.\n\u201cSales will start to stabilize not because Samsung is doing anything new, but because all the bad things that happened to them have already happened,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an independent technology analyst atStratechery.com.\nMr. Thompson said the major factors that hurt Samsung \u2014 including Apple\u2019s release of a handset in China\u2019s largest telecom service provider, China Mobile, and its decision to offer a big-screen iPhone \u2014 are in the South Korean company\u2019s rearview mirror.\n\u201cThere is a population that wants a high-end Android phone,\u201d he said, referring to the operating system from Google that many of Samsung\u2019s phones use, \u201cand the reality is Samsung is good at making hardware. They make a good phone.\u201d\nSamsung said that operating profit would be 6.6 trillion won, or about $5.7 billion, in the fourth quarter compared with 6.0 trillion a year earlier. The numbers released Thursday are preliminary; Samsung will post its final earnings later this month.\nAnother factor helping Samsung has been a change in the way the company manages its new product rollouts, said Peter Yu, a BNP Paribas analyst. Last year, the company missed strong demand for its Edge series of phones, in part because it imitated Apple\u2019s hype-filled product release, and early sales of limited supplies that sell out, Mr. Yu said.\nThis year, Samsung limited the number of countries where it was releasing the phones, and made sure it had already shipped phones across many of its channels, he said.\n\u201cThere was a better sell through this year compared to last year,\u201d Mr. Yu said.\n\u201cThere was a production issue too,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that they have climbed the learning curve, the production is there. So they have the production, the costs are lower and without those constraints they found that the Edge is selling better than they thought.\u201d\nWhile smartphone sales have helped solidify earnings, the company is still likely to face weak demand for its components this year on soft global demand for electronics. The conglomerate, whose products include smartphone screens, memory and microchips, has been broadly exposed to economic weakness.\nThis year, Samsung also has to work to replace some of the microchip business it had with Apple, which it lost when Apple shifted orders to its Taiwan semiconductor rival TSMC.\nEven so, analysts expect Samsung, which has leading technology in sectors like screens and memory chips, to perform better whenever conditions improve."

You may be prompted to provide this information when you first try to play a purchased song or video. You can also press the Control and B keys to activate the iTunes menu bar so you can go to the Store menu and select Authorize This Computer before you try to play anything. (Your Apple ID credentials can also be used todownload past purchasesfrom the iTunes Store to the new PC free.)\nIf you are not using a migration program,installing a new copy of the iTunessoftware on the Windows 10 PC and thencopying the iTunes folder over from the old computermight be one of the easier alternatives for moving your collection. However, before you move the folder to the new computer, you may want toconsolidate your libraryto make sure everything you play through iTunes is actually in the iTunes folder before you move it.\nIf the iTunes menu bar is not showing, press the Control and B keys to display it. Go to the File menu to the Library submenu, choose Organize Library and turn on the checkbox next to Consolidate Files before clicking the OK button.\nNext, you need to locate your iTunes folder on the old computer. By default, it should be in your PC\u2019s Music folder. Depending on the size of your iTunes media collection, you can move the iTunes folder to an external hard drive or to an online storage drive connected to your old computer. Once the iTunes folder has been copied, connect the external drive or log onto the online storage drive on the new computer and copy the iTunes folder into the Music folder on the Windows 10 machine.\nTo make sure the new copy of iTunes sees your old library folder, go to the Edit menu, choose Preferences and click the Advanced tab. In the iTunes Media Folder Location area, click the Change button and navigate to the place on the PC where you moved your older iTunes folder.\nLastly, if you do not plan to use the old PC any longer or want to erase the drive before getting rid of it, be sure todeauthorize the computerfrom your iTunes account so it no longer counts as one of the five computers that can play your iTunes purchases. In iTunes on the old computer, go the Store menu and choose Deauthorize This Computer."

The question is whether it will get any better this week.\nSome of tech\u2019s largest companies will post financial results over the next few days, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Some of their smaller brethren are also on deck, including Twitter, eBay andLinkedIn.\nThe good news is that many of the factors that hurt the results of tech companies that reported last week are not as strong in the earnings that will coming out this week. Of the companies that stumbled last week, several \u2014 likeIBMandIntel\u2014 were navigating the tricky transition from selling hardware and software primarily around personal computers to a mobile computing and cloud era. That\u2019s less an issue for companies like Apple and Amazon, as they have led the way in mobile devices and cloud computing.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it will be all roses this week. Apple is grappling with a slowdown in the sales of its iPhones and the aftermath of a bruising battle with the F.B.I. over the privacy and security of its devices. Amazon\u2019s cloud business has been thriving, but the company faces scrutiny for its prolific spending and thin profits.\nAnd Facebook remains a disrupter. AsQuentin Hardy and Mike Isaac explainin their most recent story, the vision of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, of connecting the world will have plenty of ripple effects on other tech companies.\nThat\u2019s because Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s vision will require a lot of equipment \u2014 and Facebook will want that gear at a cheaper price. So he has embraced open-source concepts to drive down the costs of tech equipment, which will inevitably ripple out to big hardware makers like Cisco Systems and Nokia."
