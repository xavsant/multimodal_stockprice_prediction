        "fulltext": "Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a willingness, and sometimes a relish, to pick public fights with an array of targets, including advertisers, tech giants, employees and more.\nBut over the weekend, Musk publicly attacked two figures, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Yoel Roth, Twitter\u2019s former head of trust and safety, in ways that may resonate with far-right audiences and gin up user engagement \u2014 but are likely to deter wary advertisers from flocking back to the social network anytime soon.\n\u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,\u201dMusk tweeted on Sunday, scoring points with both critics of the use of nonbinary pronouns and of Mr. Fauci, America\u2019s top immunologist, who disagreed with President Donald Trump on how to reopen the country in 2020. Mr. Musk has previously criticized pandemic lockdowns, having defied one that affected Tesla\u2019s factory in California, and remote work. (Mr. Fauci himself wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay how political divisiveness hashampered public health campaigns.)\nMusk\u2019s tweet drew predictable responses, including support from far-right figures likeRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greeneof Georgia and rebukes from Democratic lawmakers likeSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Some on Twitter noted that Musk\u2019s own predictions about the pandemicfell drastically short of reality.\nMr. Musk also spread misinformation about Mr. Roth,misleadingly suggestingthat the former Twitter executive\u2019s doctoral thesis advocated for child sexualization. The move opened up Mr. Roth \u2014 whom Mr. Musk had publicly supported in the first days of his Twitter ownership, before Mr. Roth quit \u2014 to online abuse.\nMusk says that he has focused relentlessly on improving public safety on Twitter, and accused previous management of failing to do so. But Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s co-founder and former C.E.O., disputed that assertion. And three members of Twitter\u2019s Trust & Safety Councilannounced their resignationlast week, citing the company\u2019s increased reliance on automated content moderation.\nIs Musk banking on conservative engagement to help Twitter\u2019s business?Musk haspointed to some metricsshowing that user engagement is up since he took over. The billionaire may well be politically conservative, but evidence of his actual positionsisn\u2019t very clear. In any case, his actions \u2014 which also include leaking internal Twitter correspondence about topics like Hunter Biden to sympathetic journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss \u2014 have certainly succeeded in winning over right-leaning users and conservative politicians.\nBut Mr. Musk\u2019s shock tactics don\u2019t seem to be designed to bring back advertisers who paused spending on Twitter amid the chaos during his takeover. (Apple, which was the target of a brief Musk campaign but which hasn\u2019t halted ads on the platform, declined to comment to DealBook on Musk\u2019s latest tweets.) That puts additional importance on Twitter\u2019s efforts to expand revenue beyond ads, including the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service that is set to debut today.\nNor do they seem likely to endear the company to prospective recruits who may already be wary of workplace culture changes that Mr. Musk has wrought. Insider noted that employees had warned prospective hires via the anonymous employer-rating site Blind tostay away from the companyand its \u201ctoxic\u201d environment.\nMr. Musk certainly didn\u2019t win over the crowd at a Dave Chappelle comedy show on Sunday in San Francisco: He washeavily booedafter making a surprise appearance onstage.\nMicrosoft buys a 4 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange Group.The American software giant acquired the stake from a group led by Thomson Reuters and Blackstone, aspart of a $2.8 billion dealthat will have the exchange rely on Microsoft\u2019s cloud services. It follows similar business partnerships by other exchanges, including Nasdaq (with Amazon) and CME Group (with Alphabet).\nAmgen agrees to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion.Theall-cash deal for Horizon, which produces treatments for autoimmune diseases, is the biggest health care transaction of the year. In beating out rivals like Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, Amgen is paying a nearly 20 percent premium to Horizon\u2019s stock price on Friday.\nEuropean lawmakers grapple with a Qatar bribery scandal.Over the weekend, the Belgian authoritiescharged four peoplewith corruption in connection with an investigation into suspected bribes by the Gulf state to current and former members of the European Parliament. The scandal comes as Qatar hosts the men\u2019s soccer World Cup.\nBritain prepares for national paralysis over strikes.The British government isdrawing up contingency plans, including intervention by the military, to deal with work stoppages across a variety of sectors, including rail and nursing, through the end of the year. Union members have demanded higher wage increases to keep up with inflation.\nDecember has been a downer for investors so far, and this morning is looking no different. Stock markets from Hong Kong to London are in the red on Monday, as are U.S. futures ahead of a big week of data releases and interest rates decisions.\nStocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower on Mondayas concerns grow overthe rate of Covid infectionsin major Chinese cities, after Beijing suddenly eased many of its zero-Covid restrictions. That is feeding into global slowdown fears, which are affecting energy prices. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude was down roughly 0.7 percent.\nThe S&P 500 Index has fallen in nine of the past 11 trading sessions,as recession and inflation fears mount, pushing investors to pare their stock holdings. The benchmark index slumped 3.4 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since September, according to Deutsche Bank equities analysts.\nEnergy, bank and tech stocks have been hit particularly hard, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 4 percent so far this month.\nInvestors are bracing for another volatile week.Markets will be closely watching Tuesday\u2019s latest Consumer Price Index report for signs that consumer inflation has peaked. And on Wednesday, the Fed will announce what is expected to be a 0.5 percentage point interest rate increase. That same afternoon, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, will deliver his latest assessment of the economy, and is expected to signal the central bank\u2019s policy moves for next year.\nIt\u2019s a similar picture in Europe.The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will also deliver rates decisions this week, and similarly sized increases are expected. And investors will be tracking consumer price data releases from France, Germany and the U.K., where soaring energy and food prices have pushed core inflation to multidecade highs.\nAs two congressional committees gear up to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto empire FTX this week, its fallen founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, still seems to believe in the future of the company, and in his role as a business leader.\nMr. Bankman-Fried hopes to start a new venture, he toldthe BBCon Saturday, explaining that the goal would be to repay FTX investors. The comments were made a day after he weighed in on a proposal to revive FTX by issuing a new version of the exchange\u2019s token, FTT, writing on Twitter that it would be \u201ca productive path for parties to explore!\u201d The price ofFTT rose on histweet, but the statements would have come as little consolation to FTX\u2019s million creditors.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be as helpful as I\u2019d like,\u201dBankman-Friedwarned. He is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but the former FTX chief executive said there were limits on what he would be able to say because he does not have access to all of his personal or professional data.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is known as S.B.F., will appear in person. He has also not yet accepted a request to talk to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.\nStaying silent may be difficult.The hearing will pit Mr. Bankman-Fried against John Ray, the restructuring expert and current FTX C.E.O. who is managing the bankruptcy and labeled FTX the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. S.B.F. has pushed back against that characterization, claiming Mr. Ray made \u201cfalse\u201dstatements in court filings about FTX\u2019s failure.\nMr. Ray reportedlymet with Manhattan prosecutorslast week. They are apparently looking into suspicious transfers to the Bahamason the eve of FTX filing for bankruptcy, among other aspects of the collapse.\nOther executives are being more circumspect.At least in public. Caroline Ellison, the former C.E.O. of Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s sister trading firm that allegedly used FTX customer funds to back its very risky bets, has stayed quiet \u2014 even as Bankman-Fried has tried to shift blame on to her.Ms. Ellison has reportedly hired aformer S.E.C. officialsteeped in crypto cases, Stephanie Avakian, as her lawyer. Last week, Ms. Ellison was reportedly spotted in a coffee shop not far from the offices of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, giving rise tospeculation that she may be cooperatingwith their investigation.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening in crypto today:\nSouth Korean prosecutors believe that the crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who is wanted in the $60 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens, ishiding in Serbia.\nInvestors arepulling record amountsfrom crypto coins following the collapse of FTX.

        "title": "Elon Musk Says \u2018Misunderstanding\u2019 With Apple Is Resolved",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a series of tweets on Monday, Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter,accused Apple of sabotaginghis social media company by cutting back advertising and threatening to remove the Twitter app from the App Store.\nBy Wednesday, any potential feud appeared to have been avoided.\nOn Twitter, Mr. Musk posted a video of himself being shown around Apple\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., on Wednesday, walking past a meditation pool. While the video did not show whom Mr. Musk was walking with, Apple employees said they had seen Mr. Musk with Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Musk said in a later post that he and Mr. Cook had discussed their dispute.\n\u201cWe resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store,\u201d Mr. Musk said in atweet. \u201cTim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.\u201d\nApple declined to comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe meeting appeared to sidestep what had threatened to become a big spat between two of tech\u2019s titans. Mr. Musk had taken aim at Apple\u2019s power over the App Store, which is the only distributor of apps on more than one billion iPhones worldwide. His complaints \u2014 about Apple\u2019s policies for approving apps and its practice of taking a cut of the sale of apps \u2014 resurrected an issue that had been raised by other companies, such as Spotify and Epic Games. Lawmakers and regulators around the world have been scrutinizing Apple\u2019s power over software distribution.\nUnder Mr. Musk, who took over in October, Twitter\u2019s content policies have been unclear, potentially putting the app at odds with Apple, which reviews every app distributed through the App Store.\nMr. Musk hasreinstated the account of former President Donald J. Trump, which was banned after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and has said he will offer amnesty to accounts suspended by the company\u2019s previous leadership. But Apple\u2019s rules prohibit hateful speech or content. The company also polices apps to be sure that they use its in-app payment system to collect subscriptions, which allows Apple to collect as much as 30 percent of sales.\nIn the past, Apple has raised concerns with developers that defy those policies and slowed down approval of their apps for distribution. Mr. Musk said on Monday that Apple had threatened to do the same with Twitter without telling the social media company why.\nMr. Cook gave Mr. Musk the tour before a scheduled trip to Washington, where he is set to meet with several Republican lawmakers, including Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A conflict with Mr. Musk had threatened to complicate those meetings because he accused Apple of trying to censor \u201cfree speech\u201d by limiting Twitter\u2019s distribution on iPhones \u2014 an issue in Congress, where Republican leaders are concerned that Silicon Valley companies suppress conservative views.\nMr. Cook has used charm offensives before. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple in 2018 for manufacturing its products overseas, Mr. Cook traveled to Washington to meet with him and joined a White House advisory panel. Mr. Trump later abandoned his criticisms of Apple and praised Mr. Cook as a \u201cgreat executive because he calls me and others don\u2019t.\u201d\nDavid McCabecontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "I have many fears as a mother. My kindergarten-age daughter recently learned a game on the school bus called \u201cTruth or Force.\u201d My youngest refuses to eat almost anything but Kraft Mac and Cheese. Added to the list this year, alongside outside influences and health concerns, is the possibility that my daughters could inadvertently lock me out of my digital life.\nThat\u2019s what happened to a mother in Colorado whose 9-year-old son used her old smartphone tostream himself nakedon YouTube, and a father in San Francisco whoseGoogle account was disabled and deletedbecause he took naked photos of his toddler for the doctor.\nI reported on their experiences for The New York Times, and as I talked to these parents, who were stunned and bereft at the loss of their emails, photos, videos, contacts and important documents spanning decades, I realized I was similarly at risk.\nI am \u201ccloud-complacent,\u201d keeping my most important digital information not on a hard drive at home but in the huge digital basement provided via technology companies\u2019 servers. Google gives all users 15 gigabytes free, a quarter of what comes standard on an Android phone, and I have not managed to max it out in 18 years of using the company\u2019s many services.\nI did fill up Apple\u2019s free 5 GB, so I now pay $9.99 a month for additional iCloud storage space. Meta has no max; like scrolling on Instagram, the allowed space is infinite.\nIf I were suddenly cut off from any of these services, the data loss would be professionally and personally devastating.\nAs a child of the 1980s, I used to have physical constraints on how many photos, journals, VHS tapes and notes passed in seventh grade that I could reasonably keep. But the immense expanse and relatively cheap rent of the so-called cloud has made me a data hoarder. Heading into 2023, I set out to excavate everything I was storing on every service, and find somewhere to save it that I had control over. As I grappled with all the gigabytes, my concern morphed from losing it all to figuring out what was actually worth saving.\nI find nearly 100 photos from one November night 15 years ago, out with my family at a Tampa Bay Lightning game when my sisters and I were home for the holidays. We\u2019re tailgating with a mini-keg of Heineken. My dad is posing by the car, making a funny face at the ridiculousness of a parking garage party. Then, we\u2019re posing in the stadium with the hockey rink in the background, toasting with a stranger we sat next to. Had we bonded with him during an especially close third period? The metadata in the Google Photos jpg file didn\u2019t say.\nThe photos transported me back to a tremendously fun evening that I had all but forgotten. Yet I wondered how there could be so many photos from just one night. How do I decide which to keep and which to get rid of?\nThis kind of data explosion is a result of economics, said Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library based in San Francisco that saves copies of websites and digitizes books and television shows. Taking a photo used to be expensive because it involved film that needed to be developed.\n\u201cIt cost a dollar every time you hit a shutter,\u201d Mr. Kahle said. \u201cThat\u2019s no longer the caseso we hit the shutter all the time and keep way, way too much.\u201d\nI had captured the 2007 evening in Tampa pre-smartphone on a digital Canon camera that had a relatively small memory card that I regularly emptied into Google Photos. I found more than 4,000 other photos there, along with 10 gigabytes of data from Blogger, Gmail, Google Chat and Google Search, when I requested a copy of the data in my account using a Google tool calledTakeout.\nI justpressed a buttonand a couple of days later got my data in a three-file chunk, which was great, though some of it, including all my emails, was not human-readable. Instead, it came in a form that needed to be uploaded to another service or Google account.\nAccording to a company spokesman, 50 million people a year use Takeout to download their data from 80 different Google products, with 400 billion files exported in 2021. These people may have had plans to move to a different service, simply wanted their own copy or were preserving what they had on Google before deleting it from the company\u2019s servers.\nTakeout was created in 2011 by a group of Google engineers who called themselves the Data Liberation Front. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google employee in Chicago who led the team, said he thought it was important that the company\u2019s users have an easy \u201coff ramp\u201d to leave Google and take their data elsewhere. But Mr. Fitzpatrick said he worried that when people store their digital belongings on a company\u2019s server, they \u201cdon\u2019t think about it or care about it.\u201d\nSome of my data landlords were more accommodating than others.Twitter,FacebookandInstagramoffered Takeout-like tools, whileApplehad a more complicated data transfer process that involved voluminous instructions and a USB cable.\nThe amount of data I eventually pulled down was staggering, including more than 30,000 photos, 2,000 videos, 22,000 tweets, 57,000 emails, 15,000 pages of old Google chats and 16,000 pages of Google searches going back to 2011.\nIt was such an overwhelming amount of digital stuff that I wasn\u2019t surprised to see that Google had hiredMarie Kondoas a spokeswoman for the paid version of its storage service \u2014 starting at $1.99 per month for 100 GB. Ms. Kondo suggested better labeling and organization of emails, photos and documents to make it \u201ceasy to find the memories that spark joy.\u201d\nThe trove of data brought forgotten episodes of my life back in vivid color. A blurry photo of my best friend\u2019s husband with a tiny baby strapped to his chest, standing in front of a wall-sized Beetlejuician face, made me recall a long-ago outing to a Tim Burton exhibit at a museum in Los Angeles. I don\u2019t remember what I learned about the gothic filmmaker, but I do remember my friends\u2019 horror when their weeks-old son, now 11, had a blowout and they had to beg a comically oversized diaper from a stranger.\nThe granularity of what was in my digital archive accentuated the parts of my life that were missing entirely: emails from college in a university-provided account that I hadn\u2019t thought to migrate; photos and videos I took on an Android phone that I backed up to an external hard drive that has since disappeared; and stories I\u2019d written in journalism school for publications that no longer exist. They were as lost to me as the confessional journal I once left in the seatback of a plane. The idea that information, once digitized, will stick around forever is flawed.\n\u201cWe often say the internet never forgets, but it does,\u201d said the web historianIan Milligan. Companies shut down, as happened to GeoCities, an early, popular place for hosting personal websites, or a service cuts back on the amount of free storage it\u2019s offering, as when the new owner of Flickrannounced in 2019that free accounts had a limit of 1,000 photos and anything more would be deleted.\nMargot Note, anarchivist, said her profession thinks a lot about the accessibility of the medium on which data is stored, given the challenge of recovering videos from older formats such as DVDs, VHS tapes and reel film. Ms. Note asks the kinds of questions most of us don\u2019t: Will there be the right software or hardware to open all our digital files many years from now? With something called \u201cbit rot\u201d \u2014 the degradation of a digital file over time \u2014 the files may not be in good shape.\nIndividuals and institutions think that when they digitize material it will be safe, she said. \u201cBut digital files can be more fragile than physical ones.\u201d\nOnce I assembled my data Frankenstein, I had to decide where to put it. More than a decade ago, pre-cloud complacency, I would regularly back my stuff up to a hard drive that I probably bought at Best Buy. Digital self-storage has gotten more complex as I discovered when I visited theDataHoarder subreddit. Posts there with technical advice for the best home setup were jargon-filled to the point of incomprehension for a newbie. A samplepost: \u201cStarted with single bay Synology Nas and recently built a 16TB unRAID server on a xeon 1230. Very happy with result.\u201d\nI felt as if I\u2019d landed on an alien planet so I turned instead to professional archivists and tech-savvy friends. They recommended two $299 12-terabyte hard drives, one of which should have ample room for what I have now and what I will create in the future, and another to mirror the first, as well as a $249 NAS, or network-attached storage system, to connect to my home router, so I could access the files remotely and monitor the health of the drives.\nArchivists regularly cited the \u201c3-2-1 rule\u201d: three copies of everything, two copies on different cloud services and one at home. Some also said to keep yet another copy \u201coffsite,\u201d i.e. at a relative\u2019s house or in a bank lockbox, depending on your level of paranoia. History is awash in tales of lost data, including the burning of invaluable master recordings of famous musicians ina Universal Studios fire. John Markoff, a technology journalist who writes for The Times, mined the extensive personal archives of the internet pioneerStewart Brandfor a biography. He found that even Mr. Brand, who meticulously preserved his communications, was missing several years of early emails because of the loss of back-up tapes and had hundreds of thousands of others on an old Macintosh that were a jumble of data that was largely impossible to read.\nGetting all your data and figuring out how to securely store it is cumbersome, complicated and costly. There\u2019s a reason most people ignore all their stuff in the cloud.\nI noticed a philosophical divide among the archivists I spoke with. Digital archivists were committed to keepingeverythingwith the mentality that you never know what you might want one day, while professional archivists who worked with family and institutional collections said it was important to pare down to make an archive manageable for people who look at it in the future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often very surprising what turns out to matter,\u201d said Jeff Ubois, who is in the first camp and has organized conferences dedicated to personal archiving.\nHe brought up a historical example. During World War II, the British war office asked people who had taken coastal vacations to send in their postcards and photographs, an intelligence-gathering exercise to map the coastline that led to the selection of Normandy as the best place to land troops.\nMr. Ubois said it\u2019s hard to predict the future uses of what we save. Am I socking this away just for me, to reflect on my life as I age? Is it for my descendants? Is it for an artificial intelligence that will act as a memory prosthetic when I\u2019m 90? And if so, does that A.I. really need to remember that I Googled \u201cstarbucks ice cream calorie count\u201d one morning in January 2011?\nPre-internet, we pared down our collections to make them manageable. But now, we have metadata and advanced search techniques to sort through our lives: timestamps, geotags, object recognition. When I recently lost a close relative, I used the facial recognition feature in Apple Photos to unearth photos of him I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d taken. I was glad to have them, but should I keep all the photos, even the unflattering ones?\nBob Clark, the director of archives at the Rockefeller Archive Center, said that the general rule of thumb in his profession is that less than 5 percent of the material in a collection is worth saving. He faulted the technology companies for offering too much storage space, eliminating the need for deliberating over what we keep.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made it so easy that they have turned us into unintentional data hoarders,\u201d he said.\nThe companies try, occasionally, to play the role of memory miner, surfacing moments that they think should be meaningful, probably aiming to increase my engagement with their platform or inspire brand loyalty. But their algorithmic archivists inadvertently highlight the value of human curation.\nRecently, my iPhone served me \u201cWaterfalls over the years,\u201d which, as promised, featured a slide show with instrumental music and photos of myself and others in front of a random assortment of waterfalls. Like the British war office during World War II, the technology saw the backdrop as the star of the show.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can simply rely on the algorithms to help you decide what\u2019s important or not,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cThere need to be points of human intervention and judgment involved.\u201d\nRather than just keeping a full digital copy of everything, I decided to take the archivists\u2019 advice and pare it down somewhat, a process the professionals call appraisal. An easy place to start was the screenshots: the QR codes for flights long ago boarded, privacy agreements I had to click to use an app, emails that were best forwarded to my husband via text and a message from Words With Friends that \u201cnutjob\u201d was not an acceptable word.\nThere were some clear keepers, a selfie I took in Beijing with the artist Ai Weiwei in April 2015; a video of my eldest daughter\u2019s first steps in December 2017; and a shot of me on a camel in front of the Giza Pyramids in 2007, a photo I had purposely staged to recreate one we had on my childhood fridge of my great-grandmother in the same place doing the same thing, but with a disgruntled expression on her face.\nThen there\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m ambivalent about, like the many photos with long-ago exes, which for now I\u2019ll continue to hoard given that I\u2019m still on good terms with them and I\u2019m not going to fill up 12 terabytes any time soon.\nThere was also a lot of \u201cdata exhaust,\u201d as the security technologist Matt Mitchell calls it, a polite term for the record of my life rendered in Google searches, from a 2011 query for karaoke bars in Washington, D.C., to a more recent search for the closest Chuck E. Cheese. I will not keep those on my personal hard drive, and I may take the step of deleting them from Google\u2019s servers, which the companymakes possible, because their embarrassment potential is higher than their archival value. Mr. Mitchell said super hoarders should pare down, not to make memories easier to find, but to eliminate data that could come back to bite them.\n\u201cYou need to let go because you can\u2019t get hacked if there\u2019s nothing to hack,\u201d said Mr. Mitchell, the founder ofCryptoHarlem, a cybersecurity education nonprofit. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you\u2019re storing too much that you run into the worst of these problems.\u201d\nRight now, it\u2019s cheap to hoard all this data in the cloud.\n\u201cThe cost of storage long term continues to fall,\u201d said George Blood, who runs a business outside Philadelphia digitizing information from obsolete media, creating 10 terabytes of data per day, on average. \u201cThey may charge you more for the cost of the electricity \u2014 spinning the disk your data is on \u2014 than the storage itself.\u201d\nBig technology companies don\u2019t often prompt people to minimize their data footprints, until, that is, they near the end of their free storage space. That\u2019s when companies force them to decide whether to move to the paid plans. There are signs, though, that the companies don\u2019t want to hold onto our data forever: Most have policies allowing them to delete accounts that are inactive for a year or more.\nAware of the potential value of data left behind by those who euphemistically go \u201cinactive,\u201d Apple recently introduced alegacy contact feature, to designate a person who can access an Apple account after the owner\u2019s death. Google has long had a similar tool, prosaically calledinactive account manager. Facebook createdlegacy contactsin 2015 to look after accounts that have been memorialized.\nAnd that really is the ultimate question around personal archives: Whatbecomes of themafter we die? By keeping so much, more than we want to sort through, which is almost certainly more than anyone else wants to sort through on our behalf, we may leave behind less than previous generations because our accounts will go inactive and be deleted. Our personal clouds may grow so vast that no one will ever go through them, and all the bits and bytes could end up just blowing away.\nAudio produced byKate Winslett."

        "fulltext": "Google\u2019s YouTube is nearing a deal to acquire the rights to the National Football League\u2019s Sunday Ticket package of games, according to three people with knowledge of the talks, a deal that would bring a staple of traditional television into the streaming realm.\nGoogle has discussed paying about $2.5 billion a year to the league, $1 billion more than DirecTV, which had the rights for years, according to two of the people, who would speak only anonymously to discuss confidential negotiations.\nThe league could receive additional payments based on the number of YouTube subscribers that Google is able to add, as well as other performance benchmarks, the people said. The length of the contract is unclear.\nThe deal with YouTube, if it goes through, could result in a sudden influx for YouTube TV, its premium streaming product. DirecTV has 1.5 million to two million Sunday Ticket subscribers, who pay an additional fee for access to every game on Sunday afternoons except those broadcast in their local markets. YouTube said in July that YouTube TV had more than five million subscribers and trial users of the product, which costs $64.99 a month.\nA deal between YouTube and the N.F.L. could be reached as soon as this week, the people said.\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the league declined to comment.\nYouTube\u2019s pursuit of Sunday Ticket is the latest sign that live sports, the glue that holds the traditional cable bundle together, is shifting toward video-streaming companies. Amazon reached an agreement last year to stream the N.F.L.\u2019s Thursday night football games on its Prime video service for $1 billion annually, and Apple has struck deals to stream both Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer. The Apple TV+ streaming service has already struck rich deals to land major stars for its films and TV shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d\nAs the negotiations stretched on, Apple became skeptical that the Sunday Ticket package was worth what the N.F.L. was seeking and ended serious conversations about a potential deal, a person familiar with the matter said. Apple honed its focus oncompleting a deal to sponsor the halftime showfor the 2023 Super Bowl, which it believes will raise the profile of its Apple Music service.\nDirecTV\u2019s rights for Sunday Ticket are set to expire at the end of the 2022 regular season. There has been years of speculation about who might land the coveted rights.\nWithin the last year, it became clear that the league had set its sights on selling the Sunday Ticket rights to a streaming service. In July, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in an interview with CNBC that a streaming buyer would be \u201cbest for consumers.\u201d Apple, YouTube and Amazon soon emerged as leading contenders, tech giants with bankrolls and audiences big enough to entice the N.F.L.\nA number of factors weighed on the deal-making process. The league explored bundling the package of out-of-market Sunday N.F.L. games with some of its other media assets, including the NFL Network, complicating matters. In addition, giants like N.F.L. and Apple are accustomed to getting their way during negotiations, and neither side wanted to budge.\nLast week, Mr. Goodell said talks were at a \u201ccritical\u201d stage.\nThe Sunday Ticket package is the last big piece of the N.F.L. media rights puzzle to be sold. In March 2021, the leagueannounced 10-year dealswith all of its major television partners worth more than $100 billion.\nOnce the N.F.L. deal is struck, industry speculation will turn to negotiations for the rights to show National Basketball Association games, talks that are expected to begin in earnest next year. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, two major N.B.A. rights holders, are expected to explore a bid, as are some of the biggest streaming platforms.\nThe Wall Street Journalearlier reportedYouTube was in advanced talks to acquire the rights.\nNico GrantandTripp Micklecontributed reporting."
