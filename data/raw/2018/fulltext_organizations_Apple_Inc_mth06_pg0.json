        "fulltext": "SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Sorry, Apple\u2019s not sorry.\nThere has been a theme at the tech industry\u2019s big conferences this year:Facebookandother tech giantskeep telling us that they\u2019ve learned from their mistakes and are going to be a lot more thoughtful about the far-out stuff they plan on doing in the future.\nApple has been cool to this narrative, and it was striking how the company\u2019s executives danced around the tech backlash story line from the stage on Monday at itsannual conference for developers.\nThough Apple acknowledged the darker side of society\u2019s obsession with the digital world, it didn\u2019t go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame.\nApple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.\nApple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.\nThese features looked quite handy \u2014 we will know for sure once they\u2019re released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple\u2019s relationship with others in tech.\nBut that is not Apple\u2019s problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone.\nApple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care.\nBut at its event here, Apple\u2019s support for what\u2019s being called \u201cdigital well-being\u201d often awkwardly butted up against Apple\u2019s larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can\u2019t resist it.\nThe next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do \u201ctongue detection\u201d \u2014 an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple\u2019s new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can\u2019t even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn\u2019t that kind of a problem?\nApple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet.\nThe new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from.\nApple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with outfits like Facebook.\nBut that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone\u2019s default search engine.\n\u201cWe aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said several times Monday.\nThat seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world. What you do with it is your own problem."

They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.\nMore in China tech news:The Senate votedon Monday to reimpose U.S. punishments on the Chinese telecom company ZTE.

But Tesla will now investigate whether the purported saboteur had worked with other employees or third-party organizations. The concern is that the situation could be more serious \u2014 perhaps involving corporate espionage.\nThe commerce secretary is one of President Trump\u2019s point men on trade issues involving Russia and China.

        "title": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.\nThe company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.\nNeither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.\nCompanies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\nThe meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.\nBut the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.\nThe tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.\nOne attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.\nAmerican intelligence officialshave offered blunt warningsthat Russia and other foreign governments are already meddling in the closely watched midterm election campaign.\nFacebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.\nIn public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.\nOfficials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nRussia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.\nUnlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.\nAt times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.\nHe said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.\nPart of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\n\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple to Close iPhone Security Hole That Law Enforcement Uses to Crack Devices",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple has long positioned the iPhone as a secure device that only its owner can open. That has led to battles with law enforcement officials who want to get information off them, including awell-publicized showdown with the F.B.I.in 2016 after Apple refused to help open the locked iPhone of a mass killer.\nThe F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple\u2019s help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases.\nNow Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.\nApple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone\u2019s charging and data port \u2014 the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters \u2014 an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone\u2019s password to transfer data to or from the device using the port.\nSuch a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple\u2019s planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles \u2014 and many in investigative agencies are infuriated.\n\u201cIf we go back to the situation where we again don\u2019t have access, now we know directly all the evidence we\u2019ve lost and all the kids we can\u2019t put into a position of safety,\u201d said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift.\nBut privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. \u201cThis is a really big vulnerability in Apple\u2019s phones,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, \u201ccould very easily leak out into the world.\u201d\nIn an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. \u201cWe have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don\u2019t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,\u201d he said.\nApple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant.\nThe friction came into public view after the F.B.I. could not access the iPhone of a gunman who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. A federal judge ordered Apple to figure out how to open the phone, prompting Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to respond with a blistering1,100-word letterthat said the company refused to compromise its users\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe implications of the government\u2019s demands are chilling,\u201d he wrote.\nThe two sides fought in court for a month. Then the F.B.I.abruptly announcedthat it had found an undisclosed group to get into the phone, payingat least $1.3 millionbecause the hacking techniques were not common then. An inspector general\u2019s report this year suggested the F.B.I.should have exhausted more optionsbefore it took Apple to court.\nSince then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan\u2019s Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves.\nApple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said.\nCellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment.\nOpening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said.\nLaw enforcement agencies that have purchased a GrayKey device include the Drug Enforcement Administration, which bought an advanced model this year for $30,000,according to public records. Maryland\u2019s state policehave one, as do police departments inPortland, Ore.,andRochester, Minn., according to records.\nHillar Moore, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, La., said his office had paid Cellebrite thousands of dollars to unlock iPhones in five cases since 2017, including an investigation intothe hazing-related death of a fraternity pledgeat Louisiana State University. He said the phones had yielded crucial information, and he was upset that Apple planned to close such a useful investigative avenue.\n\u201cThey are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,\u201d he said.\nMichael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds \u2014 he declined to specify which \u2014 to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year.\nIn the first 10 months of 2017, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said it had recovered and obtained warrants or consent to search 702 locked smartphones, two-thirds of which were iPhones. Smartphones running Google\u2019s Android software have been generally easier to access, partly becausemany older devices lack encryption.\nThe encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple\u2019s iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.\nThe tussle over encrypted iPhones and opening them to help law enforcement is unlikely to simmer down. Federal officialshave renewed a pushfor legislation that would require tech companies like Apple to provide the police with a backdoor into phones, though they were recentlyfound to be overstatingthe number of devices they could not access.\nApple probably won\u2019t make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers\u2019 data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there.\nApple\u2019s latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy.\n\u201cPeople always expected there would be this back-and-forth \u2014 that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,\u201d she said."

        "fulltext": "It has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion \u2014 and counting. At about $940 billion, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today\u2019s valuation is far from stretched. Apple\u2019s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there.\nThe rather mundane improvements rolling out at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week demonstrate how the smartphone market is largely mature. Shipments worldwide declined slightly for the first time last year, the research firm IDC believes, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years.\nThat said, there\u2019s no obvious replacement for smartphones on the horizon. Apple earned $48 billion last year, mostly from iPhone sales, so this looks like the base camp for the company. Phones are prone to being dropped, dunked in water or lost. Throw in small improvements, and the company can reap more per device. The average iPhone sales price actually rose last year.\nApple can wring more dollars out of users in other ways, as well. Service revenue from selling apps, online storage and streaming music is rising at a 31 percent annual clip and now accounts for 15 percent of sales. Add in revenue from ancillary hardware, and analysts think the company can increase operating profit 13 percent this year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a healthy rate of growth continuing. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is also milking the discomfort of Facebook, Google and others whose businesses rely heavily on sharing data, sometimes controversially, by contrasting them with Apple\u2019s privacy-friendly approach.\nYet Wall Street has remained oddly skeptical over the years. Apple is valued at 15 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, which is slightly less than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over all. And peers trade at a substantial premium, with Facebook at 22 times forward earnings and Microsoft and the Google parent Alphabet on a multiple of 25.\nThat\u2019s too large a gap. Microsoft is projected to grow roughly as fast as Apple this year. Facebook and Google are growing faster, but they are in the line of fire from consumers and regulators over data gathering and privacy worries. Apple\u2019s conference this week may be short on pizazz, but the nearly trillion-dollar company can tweak its business without the distraction of defending it."

        "title": "We Have Reached Peak Screen. Now Revolution Is in the Air.",
        "fulltext": "Smartphones were once the best thing to happen to the tech industry \u2014 and for a while, it seemed, to all of us, too. In the 11 years since the iPhone made its debut, smartphones havesubsumed just about every other gadgetand altered every business, from news to retail to taxis to television, ultimately reordering everything about how we understand media, politics and reality itself.\nBut now that smartphones have achieved dominance, revolution is again in the air.\nGlobal smartphonesales areplateauingfor a very obvious reason: Pretty much anyone who can afford one already has one, and increasingly there are questions about whether we are using our phones too much and too mindlessly. At Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s recent developer conferences, executives took the stage to show how much more irresistible they were making our phones. Then each company unveiled something else: Software to help you use your phone a lot less.\nThere\u2019s a reason tech companies are feeling this tension between making phones better and worrying they are already too addictive. We\u2019ve hit what I call Peak Screen.\nFor much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes. It has given us phones with ever-bigger screens and phones with unbelievable cameras, not to mention virtual reality goggles and several attempts at camera-glasses.\nTech has now captured pretty much all visual capacity. Americans spendthree to four hours a day looking at their phones, andabout 11 hours a daylooking at screens of any kind.\nSo tech giants are building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes.\nThis could be a nightmare; we may simply add these new devices to our screen-addled lives. But depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking, less socially awkward, and perhaps even a salve for our politics and social relations.\nWho will bring us this future? Amazon and Google are clearly big players, but don\u2019t discount the company that got us to Peak Screen in the first place. With advances to the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, Apple is slowly and almost quietly creating an alternative to its phones.\nIf it works, it could change everything again. As I argue below, there are many ways that screens have become too dominant in our lives. The sooner we find something else, the better.\nScreens are insatiable. At a cognitive level, they arevoracious vampires for your attention, and as soon as you look at one, you are basically toast.\nThere are studies that bear this out. One, by a team led by Adrian Ward, a marketing professor at the University of Texas\u2019 business school, found thatthe mere presence of a smartphone within glancing distancecan significantly reduce your cognitive capacity. Your phone is so irresistible that when you can see it, you cannot help but spend a lot of otherwise valuable mental energy trying to not look at it.\nWhen you do give in, you lose your mind.\n\u201cWhat you get sucked into is not the one thing that caught your attention \u2014 your text message or tweet or whatever,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the technology research firm Creative Strategies. Instead, you unlock your phone and instantly, almost unconsciously, descend into the irresistible splendors of the digital world \u2014 emerging 30 minutes later, stupefied and dazed.\n\u201cYou open this irresistible box, and you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she said.\nTech companies understand this power, of course; our inability to resist screens explains why phone screens keep getting bigger.\nApple once argued that increasing the iPhone\u2019s screen size would make for a phone that would be too awkward for your hands. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to buy that,\u201dSteve Jobs predicted of big-screen phonesin 2010.\nHe was wrong. Rivals, led by Samsung, found that big-screen phones sold very well. The eyes won out over the hands. Eventually Apple joined the party, making iPhones with bigger and then still bigger displays. The largest-screen iPhones now account for half of Apple\u2019s sales and the majority of its profits.\nBut screens have now become a crutch for technologists, a lazy, catchall way to add digital experiences to every product.\nWe have seen this in cars for years. By placing interior controls on touch screens rather thantactile knobs and switches, carmakers have made vehicles much more annoying and dangerous to interact with. The Tesla Model 3, the most anticipated car on the planet, takes this to an absurd level. Asseveral reviewershave lamented, just about every one of the car\u2019s controls \u2014 including adjustments for the side mirrors \u2014 requires access through a screen.\nOr look at augmented reality, the technology that allows you to see digital imagery superimposed on the real world. In a few specific uses \u2014 turning your face into a dog\u2019s on Snapchat \u2014 this can be fun. But too often, A.R. feels gimmicky. Rather than commingling the digital and the real, it simply uses a screen to usurp the world around you.\nAt Apple\u2019s developer conference this month, Martin Sanders, a Lego executive, showed off a new A.R. Lego set. When he pointed his iPad at a Lego structure, his screen filled with digital fireworks, superheros, sports cars \u2014 a whole bustling Lego town that he didn\u2019t have to build with his hands or imagine with his head.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do here!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed as he and an assistant stood completely still, staring at animated Legos through a piece of digital glass. It was bizarre. The whole point of Lego is physical interaction, but thanks to A.R., he had turned Lego into just another video game.\nThere are two ways we may break our fevered addiction to screens.\nFirst, we will need to try to use our phones more mindfully, which requires a combination of willpower and technology.\nHelp is on the way. For the last week, I\u2019ve been using Screen Time, one of the new features in Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system. The software gives you valuable information about how much you are using your phone, and it can even block you from using apps that you deem unhealthy. I found Screen Time very well designed, and I suspect it will profoundly change how we use our phones.\nBut in addition to helping us resist phones, the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with digital world. Three technologies may help with this: voice assistants, of which Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant are the best, and Apple\u2019s two innovations, AirPods and the Apple Watch.\nAll of these technologies share a common idea. Without big screens, they are far less immersive than a phone, allowing for quick digital hits: You can buy a movie ticket, add a task to a to-do list, glance at a text message or ask about the weather without going anywhere near your Irresistible Screen of Splendors.\nThese are all works in progress. Voice assistants still cannot do everything for you, though Google and Amazon have thousands of engineers working to improve them. AirPods are fantastic \u2014 they have fewer connection issues than any other wireless headphones \u2014 and after years of refinement, the Apple Watch shows you just enough stuff from your phone to make it useful without becoming overbearing.\nIf Apple could only improve Siri, its own voice assistant, the Watch and AirPods could combine to make something new: a mobile computer that is not tied to a huge screen, that lets you get stuff done on the go without the danger of being sucked in. Imagine if, instead of tapping endlessly on apps, you could just tell your AirPods, \u201cMake me dinner reservations at 7\u201d or \u201cCheck with my wife\u2019s calendar to see when we can have a date night this week.\u201d\nApple declined to comment on its plans. There are enough reports, though, that suggest Apple is not blind to such a future. It has plans for improving AirPods,according to Bloomberg, and I\u2019ve been impressed by how steadily the company keeps adding features to the Watch \u2014 including the ability, in its latest model, to use it away from your phone.\nApple has never been scared of disrupting its own best inventions. By rethinking screens, it may have a chance to do that once more."

        "title": "In China Trade War, Apple Worries It Will Be Collateral Damage",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, may be the leader of the world\u2019s most valuable public company, but lately he has had to act a lot like the tech industry\u2019s top diplomat.\nLast month he visited the Oval Office to warn President Trump that tough talk on China could threaten Apple\u2019s position in the country. In March, at a major summit meeting in Beijing, he called for \u201ccalmer heads\u201d to prevail between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.\nIn atrade and technology showdownbetween the United States and China, Apple and Mr. Cook have a lot to lose. With 41 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, there is arguably no American company in China as successful, as high-profile and with as big a target on its back.\nSince he took over Apple from its co-founder Steve Jobs, in 2011, questions about whether Mr. Cook, 57, could recreate the magic that led to the iPod and iPhone have persisted. For Mr. Cook, the analogous breakthrough \u2014 and potentially his legacy as the heir to Mr. Jobs \u2014 has come not from a gadget, but from a geography: China.\nUnder Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple\u2019s business in China grew from a fledgling success to an empire with annual revenues of around $50 billion \u2014 just a bit under a quarter of what the company takes in worldwide. He did this while China was tightening internet controls and shutting out other American tech giants.\nNow, with the Trump administration saying on Monday that it will identify another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could face tariffson top of the $50 billionalready planned, andChina having threatened retaliation, Apple is stuck in the middle.\nThe Trump administration has told Mr. Cook that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, which are assembled in China, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to speak on the record for fear of upsetting negotiations. But Apple is worried China will retaliate in ways that hamstring its business, according to three people close to Apple who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nApple fears \u201cthe Chinese-bureaucracy machine is going to kick in,\u201d meaning the Chinese government could cause delays in its supply chain and increase scrutiny of its products under the guise of national-security concerns, according to one person close to the company. Apple has faced such retaliation before, another person said, andReuters reportedFord vehicles are already facing delays at Chinese ports.\nThere is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States.\nApple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party.\nAt the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.\nMr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China\u2019s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform.\nLater, Mr. Cook attended China\u2019s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China\u2019s standing committee \u2014 the party\u2019s top leadership group \u2014 and an ideological force behind China\u2019s deepening authoritarianism.\nIn March, just after an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders.\nMr. Cook has long defended Apple\u2019s presence in China as a way to help change the country from the inside. \u201cEach country in the world decides their laws and their regulations. And so your choice is: Do you participate, or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?\u201dhe said at a Fortune eventin China in December. \u201cYou get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.\u201d\nMr. Cook has also put in time in the halls of power in Washington. Last month, he visited the White House to meet with Mr. Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow. Mr. Cook began by applaudingnew corporate-tax rulesand reminded Mr. Trump that Apple said it wouldcontribute $350 billionto the American economy over the next five years, according to two people familiar with what Mr. Cook said.\nThen Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law\u2019s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said.\n\u201cHe was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. \u201cHe says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.\u201d\nMr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him.\nMr. Cook has found cabinet membersmore accessible in the Trump administrationthan the Obama administration, according to a person familiar with the talks, and he has seen eye to eye with Mr. Kudlow, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and, on some issues, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary.\nHe has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration\u2019s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president.\nMr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war \u2014 or Chinese retaliation against Apple \u2014 ultimately will happen, this person said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,\u201d said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.\nThe specter of Chinese retaliation against Apple has increased since the administration targeted the Chinese tech company ZTE for breaking American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But the administration backed away from stiffer penalties this month and said it would fine ZTE $1 billion and install a compliance team picked by the United States.\nOther measurestargeting China\u2019s larger telecom champion, Huawei, could lead to new strains. Indeed, congressional pressure this yearappeared to quash a dealin which AT&T would sell Huawei phones in America.\nApple, meanwhile, has a deal with China\u2019s biggest telecom company, China Mobile, giving it a direct channel to nearly 900 million subscribers in China. The competition to sell smartphones in the country has become increasingly intense, with a number of other Chinese companies also offering high-end \u2014 but usually lower-priced \u2014 phones.\nMr. Cook\u2019s frequent visits to China are part of Apple\u2019s increased efforts to court China\u2019s leadership, started in 2016 after the country suddenly removed Apple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store there.\nApple set up two research-and-development centers in China, madea $1 billion investmentin the Chinese ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing, and created a new position, head of China, that reports directly to Mr. Cook. The companyappointed Isabel Ge Mahe, who was born in China, to the role.\nApple also complied with Chinese orders tostore its data on Chinese-run serversand to pull certain apps from its App Store,including The New York Times appand many that allowed Chinese usersto get around censorshipthat blocks sites like Facebook and Twitter.\nThe company has reason to fear retaliation. In 2014, the Obama administration indicted five Chinese military hackers, stoking tensions already high from leaks about American surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.\nMonths later, Chinese regulatorsdelayed approvals of the iPhone 6for additional security reviews. Apple executives perceived the moves as retaliation, said people familiar with the matter, which has not been previously reported.\nApple\u2019s primary leverage with the Chinese government is Chinese consumers\u2019 love for Apple products, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents Apple and other tech companies.\nHowever, Mr. Garfield added, Chinese consumers would also love Facebook and Google, two products blocked in China. \u201cThere are limits,\u201d he said. \u201cXi and the national party will do what\u2019s in their interest.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.________\nFor Google, a half a billion dollars is a drop in the bucket. But that money could have an outsize impact on the American tech giant\u2019s ability to re-enter China.\nGoogle said Monday thatit would invest $550 million in JD.com, one of China\u2019s biggest e-commerce companies. The investment was a reminder that China, with all its promise, has been largely closed off to American tech giants, thanks to government censorship and fierce competition from homegrown rivals like Alibaba.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Silicon Valley moguls have abandoned hopes of building up their Chinese presences. Here\u2019s where some of the top tech companies stand with their forays into China.\nThe companypulled its search services from mainland Chinain 2010, and its other important businesses have been hobbled. Android, for example, is the most popular mobile operating system in China, but Google services are stripped out for Chinese users.\nAs part of the JD.com investment, the Chinese online retailer will promote products on the Google Shopping platform. The company also has other business lines in that country:\n\u2022 A patent licensing partnership with Tencent, one of China\u2019s biggest internet companies.\n\u2022An A.I. lab in Beijing, a nod to China\u2019s rapidly growing strength in the field.\n\u2022 Investments in start-ups like Chushou, a Chinese equivalent to the Twitch video game streaming site, and XtalPi, a biotechnology company.\n\u2022 A small set of apps, like ones for file management and language translation.\nChina has blocked the social network in the mainland since 2009. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from trying to re-establish beachheads in the country, including with a much-ballyhooed visit by Mark Zuckerberg in 2016, where he demonstrated his Mandarin speaking skills. Late last year, though, the executive who had led much of Facebook\u2019s inroads into Chinaleft the company.\nFor now, here\u2019s what Facebook has going in the country:\n\u2022 Apartnership with Xiaomi, the electronics maker, on creating virtual reality headsets for its Oculus platform. (Facebook knows Xiaomi well: The current head of Oculus,Hugo Barra, came over from the Chinese start-up.)\n\u2022 Facebook releasedColorful Balloons, a photo-sharing app similar to Facebook\u2019s Moments, through a separate local company. (Colorful Balloonsreportedly sanksoon after its unveiling.)\n\u2022 Though Facebook doesn\u2019t operate in China, it remains an important market for ad spending, with advertising from Chinese companies and \u2014 somewhat surprisingly \u2014 local governments and state news media appearing on the social network to reach international audiences.\nUnlike its internet-based rivals, Apple is free to sell its products and services in China, from iPhones to music streaming.\nWith 41 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, there is arguably no American company in China as successful. But it has often found itself trying to strike a delicate balancing act, especially as the United States and Chinaspar over trade. At times, Apple has complied with government demands, likeremoving appsthat help Chinese users skirt censorship laws or opening alocal data centerin partnership with a local company.\nHere\u2019s one explanation why:\n\u2022 China is the second-largest market for Apple, contributing 20 percent of overall sales. In Apple\u2019s most recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the company reported $44 billion in net sales within China. (That figure was down from the previous year, thanks to lower iPhone sales.)\nThe company isn\u2019t blocked in China. (Like Apple, it has sometimesbowed to Chinese government censors.) Its business just isn\u2019t very big, dwarfed by Chinese rivals like Alibaba.\nAmazon has put more money and attention onother emerging markets, especially India. That helps explain why itchallenged Walmartovercontrol of Flipkart, the India e-commerce company. But it hasn\u2019t given up on doing business in China:\n\u2022 Its Prime shopping service wasintroduced in China in 2016.\n\u2022China-specific versions of Kindlesdebuted last year.\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s cloud services offering, known as Amazon Web Services, remains a huge, promising business. But the company has had tosell some physical assetsto its local partner to comply with Beijing rules.\nUltimately, though, it appears Amazon\u2019s ambitions for China are limited, given that the company hasopened an outlet on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platformand run Kindle promotions across its Chinese rival\u2019s services."
