        "title": "Apple\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s Report Cards for the Global Economy",
        "fulltext": "Earnings reports yesterday from Apple and Amazon covered some very different businesses: premium-priced smartphones and tablets versus the world\u2019s \u201ceverything store\u201d and a dominant cloud computing platform.\nBut the tech giants provided a snapshot of the state of the global economy: Consumers and companies are cutting back on some costs, but refusing to stop spending on increasingly essential services.\nA tale of two businesses at Apple.The company\u2019s sales slumpedfor another quarter, even as profit went up slightly compared with a year ago, to $19.88 billion. Much of the revenue decline was caused by a drop in iPhone sales, which comprise half of Apple\u2019s overall revenue. (Sales of iPads fared far worse, with tablet revenue down 20 percent.)\nBut revenue from services \u2014 including Apple Music, Apple TV+ and App Store sales \u2014 grew 8 percent, reaching a record $21 billion. It\u2019s a sign that even as customers stop buying pricey new handsets as regularly as they did in the past, they\u2019re committed to smaller-ticket subscriptions and purchases that add up to big money (and carry an astonishing70 percent gross margin).\nApple also showed growth in key international markets. Sales rose 8 percent in China, the company\u2019s third-biggest market, despite severe economic headwinds there. In India, the company set a record for iPhone sales.\nCost cuts helped power big gains at Amazon.The e-commerce gianthandily beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, as net income of 65 cents per share nearly doubled forecasts. The company enjoyed a surge in its core online retail business, showing that customers are still spending despite headwinds like rising interest rates.\nBut just as important was how Amazon boosted those results through extensive cost-cutting efforts, including tens of thousands of layoffs and shutting unprofitable divisions. (A slowdown in inflation also helped cut transportation costs.)\nThe big question is whether other companies\u2019 efforts to shed their own costs will erode Amazon\u2019s other big business, cloud computing: Its AWS division reported 12 percent growth for the quarter, mirroring what Microsoft reported for its competing offering. \u201cEvery company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can,\u201d Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s C.E.O., told analysts.\nWhat investors think:Shares of Apple are down 1.8 percent in premarket trading, while those in Amazon are up nearly 9 percent.\nIn other earnings news:Warner Bros. Discoverynarrowed its quarterly loss year on year, to $1.24 billion, and lost more streaming customers than analysts had forecast. (The huge success of \u201cBarbie\u201d at the box office will be reflected next quarter.)\nEconomists are watching for signs of a cooling labor market.Jobs numbers for July are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and forecasters expect again of 200,000\u2014 the smallest increase in 31 months. Fed officials will study the report for signs ofcooling wage growthahead of their rate-setting meeting in September. (Company executiveshave said recently they\u2019ve slowed down hiring and been worried about rising labor costs.)\nDonald Trump pleads not guilty to the latest charges against him.The former presidentappeared in a Washington courtroomto face accusations that he sought to subvert the 2020 election results. But Trump remained defiant, calling the charges \u201cpolitical persecution,\u201d and there\u2019s little sign his growing legal troubles are hurting his standing among G.O.P. voters.\nSaudi Arabia extends oil production cuts.The kingdom said it would limit output by one million barrels a dayfor another month, through September, as China\u2019s tepid economic recovery keeps a lid on global crude prices. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose following the Saudi announcement.\nKKR is said to be in advanced talks to buy Simon & Schuster.The investment giant is poised topay $1.65 billionif a deal is reached, according to The Wall Street Journal. Still, the bid for the publishing giant is lower than the $2.2 billion that its rival, Penguin Random House, had offered in a transaction that was blocked by a federal judge last year.\nIt\u2019s no secret that N.B.A. team owners are often big political donors, with most of their money historicallygoing to Republicans. But the revelation this week that the Orlando Magic \u2014 the team, not the conservative DeVos family that owns it \u2014gave $50,000to a super PAC supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida raised eyebrows.\nThe fact that the players\u2019 union issued a sharp rebuke of the move underscored how politics, wealth and pro sports can become uncomfortably intertwined.\nIt appears to be the first time that a team has directly supported a group allied with a presidential candidate. A spokesman for the Magic said that the donation, which was dated May 19, was made before DeSantis officially announced his candidacy, but it was already clear that he would run.\nIn its statement, the N.B.A. Players Association called the move \u201calarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary.\u201d\nDeSantis\u2019s platform clashes with the stated positions of a number of N.B.A. players. The Republican governor has risen to prominence with so-called anti-woke policies, and has pushed for strict bans on abortions and efforts to tighten voting regulations \u2014 both of which run counter to player initiatives and public statements.\nDeSantis also introduced new state standards for the teaching of African American history, which critics sayplay down the brutality of slavery. (That move was announced after the Magic\u2019s donation.) Larry Nance Jr., a player for the New Orleans Pelicans,notedthat the Magic have \u201ca majority Black roster, a Black head coach and a Black G.M.\u201d\nThe league is in a bind.Under Adam Silver, its commissioner, the N.B.A. has mostly welcomed players\u2019 political activism, including on Black Lives Matter and on laws discriminating against L.G.B.T.Q. people. But it is overseen by a board of governors that is largely made up of owners.\nFor now, the N.B.A. is staying neutral: \u201cTeam governors make their own decisions on the political contributions they make and we respect the right of members of the N.B.A. family to express their political views,\u201d a spokesman told The Times.\nBut the players\u2019 union said that while owners were free to express political opinions, \u201cif contributions are made on behalf of an entire team, using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players.\u201d\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company sits at the center of the technological cold war between the U.S. and China: It dominates production of the world\u2019s most advanced chips from its base in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and has threatened to invade.\nTSMC\u2019s top executives acknowledged to The Times that while the company commands a crucial position in the global tech supply chain, it is still subject to a geopolitical battle beyond their control.\nTSMC is a $500 billion juggernautthat makes chips for everything from iPhones to supercomputers to cars to fighter jets. That has given it both market dominance and global political importance. U.S. export controls have made it harder for Chinese companies to gain access to the most advanced semiconductors, and Washington isweighing new restrictionson chips for artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWe control all the choke points,\u201dMorris Chang, the company\u2019s founder, said, referring to Western powers and its chip-making allies, including the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. He played down Beijing\u2019s chances for semiconductor supremacy: \u201cChina can\u2019t really do anything if we want to choke them,\u201d he added.\nTSMC has already cut off supplies to Chinese customers, including in 2020 the telecom giant Huawei, its second-biggest customer at the time.Mark Liu, TSMC\u2019s chief, said that it had no choice: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable, but support or not, we have no say.\u201d\nBut TSMC is still moored to Taiwan. Western countries have courted the company to build plants outside the island, but its experience with its $40 billion project in Arizona \u2014 which has suffered from delays, high costs and managerial challenges \u2014 has hammered home that its power is strongly tied to Taiwan. \u201cWe cannot put it anyplace else,\u201d Liu said.\nThe TSMC chief rejected the idea of a \u201csilicon shield,\u201dwhereby the company\u2019s manufacturing expertise would deter a Chinese invasion or guarantee U.S. support for Taiwan. \u201cChina will not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors. China will notnotinvade Taiwan because of semiconductors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really up to the U.S. and China: How do they maintain the status quo, which both sides want?\u201d\n\u2014 Marc Rowan, the C.E.O. of Apollo, the investment giant. On his firm\u2019s earnings call yesterday, Rowan told analysts that lower growth and high interest rates had ended a boom time for the private equity industry. Separately,Tiger Globalhas built a big stake in Apollo, as the hedge fund looks to diversify beyond its typical tech investments.\nFor over a decade, companies believed that the surest way to bolster their stock price was to buy back their shares, rather than invest in more plants or research and development. Shareholders rejoiced \u2014 but politicians assailed the practice as shortsighted and benefiting only investors and executives.\nThe corporate thinking about buybacksappears to be changing, according to Bloomberg:\nWith tightening credit muting share repurchases, and the siren song of artificial intelligence blaring everywhere, outlays for investment on plants and technology have blossomed. The median company pushed up capital expenditures by 15 percent in [the second quarter], with three-quarters announcing programs that topped analyst estimates in July, data from Bank of America Corp. shows.\nBy contrast, buybacks among corporate clients have been tracking below seasonal trends since May. More broadly, net repurchases plunged 36 percent from a year ago among S.&P. 500 firms that announced financial results. And the reluctance is also on display via planned buybacks, which according to Birinyi Associates have fallen 15 percent year-to-date.\nDeals\nPaco Ybarra, the head of Citigroup\u2019s investment bank and one of its most senior executives, is leaving after 36 years.

        "title": "What Spatial Audio Can and Cannot Do for Classical Music",
        "fulltext": "Recent developments in spatial audio \u2014albums old and new being mixedfor immersive formats \u2014 have made news in the world of pop.\nGiven the right production process (in the studio) and tech setup (at home), headphone sounds no longer need feel so statically pressed to each ear; instead, they can seem to whiz around your head or beckon from the nape of your neck.\nOr simply breathe anew. Whether you\u2019re focusing on a stray slide-guitar accent in the Dolby Atmos mix of Taylor Swift\u2019s\u201cMine (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201dor appreciating the serrated details of brass-arrangement filigree in Frank Zappa\u2019s vintage\u201cBig Swifty,\u201dthe idea is to bring the souped-up, three-dimensional feel of large-speaker arrays into your ears.\nBut classical music was there decades ago. Deutsche Grammophon and the Philips label both experimented with \u201cQuadraphonic\u201d \u2014 or four-channel releases \u2014in the 1970s. More recently,binaural recordings and mixes, designed to simulate that 3-D feel, have been a delight. Now, though, these and other spatial-production practices are enjoying deeper corporate investment, including head-tracking technology as a feature of Apple\u2019s newest Beats headphones. (When you move your head while wearing these \u2014 with the tracking option enabled \u2014 sound-points seem to stay fixed in your 360-degree field, even if you swerve about.)\nHead-tracking seemed largely pointless to me \u2014 even distracting \u2014 until I tried it with the new archival recording \u201cEvenings at the Village Gate,\u201d featuring John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy.\nHearing Dolphy\u2019s bass clarinet in front of my face \u2014 in a way that remained stable, even when I shook my head in wonder at his playing \u2014 allowed me the fleeting sensation that I was sharing space with the legend. A neat trick, though not one more important than Dolphy or Coltrane\u2019s playing on its own terms.\nAround the time that recording was made, classical composers were bringing spatialized concepts into their creative practice. Even before the comparatively meek technology of two-channel stereo sound was standard in every home, Karlheinz Stockhausen and others were using more complex mixes for works involving electronics or taped elements.\nThere\u2019s a reason Stockhausen is one of thecultural worthies on the coverof the Beatles\u2019 \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d: The composer\u2019s works, like \u201cGesang der J\u00fcnglinge,\u201d from 1956, employed a five-speaker mix (including one on the ceiling). That made a lasting impression on Paul McCartney, who once described \u201cGesang\u201d as his favorite\u201cplick-plop\u201d piece by Stockhausen.\nNow, more traditional corners of the classical music world are getting in on spatial audio as well.\nLeading conductors in the orchestral world \u2014 including Riccardo Muti and Esa-Pekka Salonen \u2014 have personally approved spatial audio mixes of their recent recordings, which have been released on Apple Music and its stand-alone classical streaming app. And, as with other genres, Apple has gathered playlists of spatialized remixes.\nThe regular players in classical music\u2019s immersive cohort have meanwhile continued to ply their trade: Members of SWR Experimentalstudio came to the Time Spans Festival in New York this month, bringingsurround-sound works by the Italian modernist Luigi Nono. And the American composer-saxophonist Anthony Braxton brought a new surround-sound concept,\u201cThunder Music,\u201dto the Darmstadt Summer Course in Germany.\nThose live performances were terrific. It\u2019s a different story on recordings: After listening to a variety of Dolby Atmos mixes recently, I sensed that classical music\u2019s more mainstream slate of spatial offerings remains a work in progress.\nSomewhere in between wasthe Sonic Sphere, a realization of a spatial audio concept by Stockhausen, at the Shed in New York this summer. Its 124-speaker setup encircled about 200 listeners at a time. In early July, I heard a new mix of Steve Reich\u2019s \u201cMusic for 18 Musicians\u201d that suffered from muddy bass frequencies. This, unfortunately, also robbed the work of its chiseled, Minimalist grace; instead of following the bass clarinet lines, you just guessed that they were there. A sense of drama had been frittered away.\nSimilarly, some selections you can find in Apple Music\u2019s \u201cClassical in Spatial Audio\u201d playlists seem poorly selected for the format. A recording of a profound solo work like Bach\u2019s \u201cThe Well-Tempered Clavier\u201d isn\u2019t exactly crying out for the spatial treatment. But when it receives one \u2014 as in an otherwise pleasant recording by Fazil Say \u2014 it merely sounds like it\u2019s had its reverb levels jacked to the sky. It\u2019s more distracting than moving. Such extraneous mixes are also a poor advertisement for what Dolby Atmos can provide when applied to the right repertoire.\nFor a contrast, look to the opening work on the Chicago Symphony Orchestra\u2019s recent album \u201cContemporary American Composers,\u201d Jessie Montgomery\u2019s \u201cHymn for Everyone.\u201d That track is plenty inviting in its regular stereo mix; even as its singable opening motif is passed between sections, taking on new timbral colors, it never loses its openhearted sense of invitation. In the Dolby Atmos mix on Apple Music, that enveloping effect deepens. The spaces among bowed strings, brasses and percussion are wider. A centrally mixed pizzicato line takes on an even more dramatic, bridging role.\nThe orchestra\u2019s audio engineer, Charlie Post, said in an interview that \u201ccontemporary music seems to lend itself particularly well for this.\u201d And he related how, since joining the Chicago Symphony in 2014, he\u2019s been \u201cfuture-proofing\u201d sessions by recording with more microphones than are strictly necessary for radio broadcast or archival purposes. Now, when a format like Dolby Atmos comes into play, the ensemble is ready with a robust audio-capture program \u2014 think of it as a highly detailed orchestral data set \u2014 from each performance.\nAfter working with the producer David Frost and the spatial-mixing expert Silas Brown, Post is then required to get the sign-off from Riccardo Muti, the Chicago Symphony\u2019s music director. Post recalled that when the conductor, wearing Sennheiser headphones, heard a binaural rendering of the 2018 album \u201cItalian Masterworks,\u201d he counted himself impressed \u2014 and gave the ensemble\u2019s spatial-audio team his blessing to do more in this realm.\n\u201cHe thought it was more wide and pleasing to him,\u201d Post said. \u201cSo that was a great thumbs-up to get.\u201d\nAt the San Francisco Symphony, Salonen has been equally enthusiastic \u2014 and even more hands on \u2014 with engineers as he plots coming performances and releases.\n\u201cWe have a very, very good team, so they don\u2019t need any kind of mothering,\u201d he said in a video interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m just fascinated by the process myself, because it\u2019s a new kind of mixing. When you position sound objects in 360 space, it becomes like a superfun computer game \u2014 very entertaining. And there are some musical artistic gains which are not gimmicky. It doesn\u2019t have to be technology for the sake of technology; there can be an expressive purpose.\u201d\nThat much is clear in Salonen\u2019s recent San Francisco recordings of music by Gyorgy Ligeti, several of which now exist as Dolby Atmos-enabled singles. (A take on Ligeti\u2019s \u201cLux Aeterna,\u201d which Stanley Kubrick famously used in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d is also available on YouTube in a binaural, headphone-optimized version.)\nIn Ligeti\u2019s \u201cRamifications\u201d \u2014 a piece that requires different orchestral groups to play in microtonally different tunings \u2014 the Dolby Atmos mix brings across the peculiar differences. Eerie, branching strings are easier to locate and appreciate, smeared across a wide soundstage; the chattering climax has fresh force.\nSalonen, who has been interested in blending technology with the traditional orchestra, both as a conductor and as a composer, thought about which Dolby Atmos recordings he would like to see. Thinking about Stockhausen\u2019s \u201cGesang der J\u00fcnglinge,\u201d he said, \u201cI would buy that!\u201d\nIn an email, Kathinka Pasveer, Stockhausen\u2019s longtime companion and collaborator, said that there were no plans to remix the Stockhausen Verlag catalog. The market, she added, is currently too small.\nApple\u2019s market share could change that. But for now, there are other distributors of cutting-edge spatial audio compositions.\nThecomposer Natasha Barrett\u2019srecent album \u201cLeap Seconds\u201d \u2014 perhaps the most vivid spatial-audio work I\u2019ve encountered in the past decade \u2014 comes with a headphones-only binaural mix when boughtfrom the Sargasso label. And the British labelAll That Dusthas been releasing binaural mixes of albums on its Bandcamp page.\nThis year, the best spatial audio purchase I\u2019ve made was anAll That Dust downloadof Stockhausen\u2019s \u201cKontakte\u201d for piano, percussion and electronic sounds. That may not be as newsworthy as the latest buzzy technology, but neither is it as expensive.\nThe week I visited the Shed, tickets for the Reich show started at $46, for a concert that amounted to an hourlong playback session. But my \u201cKontakte\u201d recording was something of a corrective: just 5 pounds ($6.37). With that binaural release and ones like it, you don\u2019t need to be hustled into hyped equipment from Apple. Anyone with solid over-ear headphones \u2014 as with the Sennheiser line that Muti used in Chicago \u2014 can experience this magic."

        "title": "Amid Sextortion\u2019s Rise, Computer Scientists Tap A.I. to Identify Risky Apps",
        "fulltext": "Almost weekly, Brian Levine, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is asked the same question by his 14-year-old daughter: Can I download this app?\nDr. Levine responds by scanning hundreds of customer reviews in the App Store for allegations of harassment or child sexual abuse. The manual and arbitrary process has made him wonder why more resources aren\u2019t available to help parents make quick decisions about apps.\nOver the past two years, Dr. Levine has sought to help parents by designing a computational model that assesses customers\u2019 reviews of social apps. Using artificial intelligence to evaluate the context of reviews with words such as \u201cchild porn\u201d or \u201cpedo,\u201d he and a team of researchers have builta searchable website called the App Danger Project, which provides clear guidance on the safety of social networking apps.\nThe website tallies user reviews about sexual predators and provides safety assessments of apps with negative reviews. It lists reviews that mention sexual abuse. Though the team didn\u2019t follow up with reviewers to verify their claims, it read each one and excluded those that didn\u2019t highlight child-safety concerns.\n\u201cThere are reviews out there that talk about the type of dangerous behavior that occurs, but those reviews are drowned out,\u201d Dr. Levine said. \u201cYou can\u2019t find them.\u201d\nPredators are increasingly weaponizing apps and online services to collect explicit images. Last year,law enforcement received 7,000 reportsof children and teenagers who were coerced into sending nude images and then blackmailed for photographs or money. The F.B.I. declined to say how many of those reports were credible. The incidents, which are called sextortion, more than doubled during the pandemic.\nBecause Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores don\u2019t offer keyword searches, Dr. Levine said, it can be difficult for parents to find warnings of inappropriate sexual conduct. He envisions the App Danger Project, which is free, complementing other services that vet products\u2019 suitability for children, like Common Sense Media, by identifying apps that aren\u2019t doing enough to police users. He doesn\u2019t plan to profit off the site but is encouraging donations to the University of Massachusetts to offset its costs.\nDr. Levine and a dozen computer scientists investigated the number of reviews that warned of child sexual abuse across more than 550 social networking apps distributed by Apple and Google. They found that a fifth of those apps had two or more complaints of child sexual abuse material and that 81 offerings across the App and Play stores had seven or more of those types of reviews.\nTheir investigation builds on previous reports of apps with complaints of unwanted sexual interactions. In 2019,The New York Timesdetailed how predators treat video games and social media platforms as hunting grounds. A separatereport that year by The Washington Postfound thousands of complaints across six apps, leading to Apple\u2019s removal of the apps Monkey, ChatLive and Chat for Strangers.\nApple and Google have a financial interest in distributing apps. The tech giants, which take up to 30 percent of app store sales, helped three apps with multiple user reports of sexual abuse generate $30 million in sales last year: Hoop, MeetMe and Whisper, according to Sensor Tower, a market research firm.\nIn more than a dozen criminal cases, the Justice Department has described those apps as tools that were used to ask children for sexual images or meetings \u2014 Hoop inMinnesota; MeetMe inCalifornia,KentuckyandIowa; and Whisper inIllinois,TexasandOhio.\nDr. Levine said Apple and Google should provide parents with more information about the risks posed by some apps and better police those with a track record of abuse.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that every app with reviews that say child predators are on it should get kicked off, but if they have the technology to check this, why are some of these problematic apps still in the stores?\u201d asked Hany Farid, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked with Dr. Levine on the App Danger Project.\nApple and Google said they regularly scan user reviews of apps with their own computational models and investigate allegations of child sexual abuse. When apps violate their policies, they are removed. Apps have age ratings to help parents and children, and software allows parents to veto downloads. The companies also offer app developers tools to police child sexual material.\nA spokesman for Google said the company had investigated the apps listed by the App Danger Project and hadn\u2019t found evidence of child sexual abuse material.\n\u201cWhile user reviews do play an important role as a signal to trigger further investigation, allegations from reviews are not reliable enough on their own,\u201d he said.\nApple also investigated the apps listed by the App Danger Project and removed 10 that violated its rules for distribution. It declined to provide a list of those apps or the reasons it took action.\n\u201cOur App Review team works 24/7 to carefully review every new app and app update to ensure it meets Apple\u2019s standards,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.\nThe App Danger project said it had found asignificant number of reviews suggesting that Hoop, a social networking app, was unsafe for children; for example, it found that 176 of 32,000 reviews since 2019 included reports of sexual abuse.\n\u201cThere is an abundance of sexual predators on here who spam people with links to join dating sites, as well as people named \u2018Read my picture,\u2019\u201d says a review pulled from the App Store. \u201cIt has a picture of a little child and says to go to their site for child porn.\u201d\nHoop, which is under new management, has a new content moderation system to strengthen user safety, said Liath Ariche, Hoop\u2019s chief executive, adding that the researchers spotlighted how the original founders struggled to deal with bots and malicious users. \u201cThe situation has drastically improved,\u201d the chief executive said.\nThe Meet Group, which owns MeetMe, said it didn\u2019t tolerate abuse or exploitation of minors and used artificial intelligence tools to detect predators and report them to law enforcement. It reports inappropriate or suspicious activity to the authorities, includinga 2019 episodein which a man from Raleigh, N.C., solicited child pornography.\nWhisper didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nSgt. Sean Pierce, who leads the San Jose Police Department\u2019s task force on internet crimes against children, said some app developers avoided investigating complaints about sextortion to reduce their legal liability. The law says they don\u2019t have to report criminal activity unless they find it, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more the fault of the apps than the app store because the apps are the ones doing this,\u201d said Sergeant Pierce, who offers presentations at San Jose schools through a program called the Vigilant Parent Initiative. Part of the challenge, he said, is that many apps connect strangers for anonymous conversations, making it hard for law enforcement to verify.\nApple and Googlemake hundreds of reports annually to the U.S. clearinghouse for child sexual abusebut don\u2019t specify whether any of those reports are related to apps.\nWhisper is among the social media apps that Dr. Levine\u2019s team found had multiple reviews mentioning sexual exploitation. After downloading the app, a high school student received a message in 2018 from a stranger who offered to contribute to a school robotics fund-raiser in exchange for a topless photograph. After she sent a picture, the stranger threatened to send it to her family unless she provided more images.\nThe teenager\u2019s family reported the incident to local law enforcement, according to a report by Mascoutah Police Department in Illinois, which laterarrested a local man, Joshua Breckel. He was sentenced to 35 years in jail for extortion and child pornography. Though Whisper wasn\u2019t found responsible, it was named alongside a half dozen apps as the primary tools he used to collect images from victims ranging in age from 10 to 15.\nChris Hoell, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Illinois who worked on the Breckel case, said the App Danger Project\u2019s comprehensive evaluation of reviews could help parents protect their children from issues on apps such as Whisper.\n\u201cThis is like an aggressively spreading, treatment-resistant tumor,\u201d said Mr. Hoell, who now has a private practice in St. Louis. \u201cWe need more tools.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "A year ago,the tech industry\u2019s prospects looked bleak. Google\u2019s profit dropped. Shares of Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, were in free fall. Business growth at Amazon had slowed to its lowest level in two decades.\nBut what looked like an industrywide bust appears to have been more of a correction. The most recent quarter was surprisingly strong for tech\u2019s biggest companies.Meta\u2019sandGoogle\u2019sad businesses rebounded.Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing businesscontinued to expand. So didAmazon\u2019s e-commerce business.Apple, with a 1 percent decline, was the only big tech company whose revenue dropped.\nStill, the slump exposed a weakness: The world\u2019s largest tech companies hadn\u2019t developed a big new idea in years. Despite pouring money into self-driving cars, the metaverse and quantum computers, the businesses still relied on digital ad sales, iPhones and cloud computing.\nNow the companies are hoping that artificial intelligence will be the answer to the problem and a way to refresh aging product lines that haven\u2019t changed all that much in recent years. They have plans to invest billions in generative A.I. technology, which powers chatbots like ChatGPT.\nWhile making serious money from new A.I. products is still a ways off, a quick return to form has given the companies plenty of room to experiment.\nIn a call with investors on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said work on generative A.I. was still in early stages, but \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be transformative, and I think it\u2019s going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know.\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, made similar comments on Thursday. And during recent calls with analysts, Google, Meta and Microsoft also said they would increase investments to support A.I. work.\nFor tech observers such as Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst who has covered the chip industry for 15 years, the surge in spending to support the development of A.I. is reminiscent of the investments in servers in the late 1990s and data centers in 2010. Generative A.I. is expected to deliver more than $2 trillion in economic benefits,according to McKinsey, the corporate consultancy, by increasing productivity across a host of businesses.\nThe A.I. investments could also lift cloud computing sales across tech. The number of customers using Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI Service, a tool to build on the generative A.I. models developed by its partner OpenAI, has increased this year to more than 11,000, from 250. Microsoft said A.I. would contribute two percentage points of growth to the Azure business in the current quarter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very early, but no one wants to be left behind,\u201d said Gavin Baker, managing partner at Atreides Management, a Boston investment firm with $3.5 billion under management.\nMr. Baker compared it to the early days of the commercial internet in the 1990s. \u201cIt was obvious it would change the world, so people kept investing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same is happening with A.I.\u201d\nGenerative A.I. products are just starting to hit the market. Microsoft plans to charge $360 a year forMicrosoft 365 Copilot, an A.I.-powered assistant for Word, Excel and PowerPoint. But the amount of new sales it generates won\u2019t be clear until sometime next year, according to analysts.\nFor the chip maker Nvidia, the A.I. boom has already arrived. In May, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by forecasting that it would generate $11 billion in sales in its second quarter, which ended July 30, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by more than $4 billion.\nThe big jump reflected surging demand for the graphics processing units, or GPUs, it designs to power A.I. technologies. Nvidia has no serious rivals in that market.\n\u201cIt seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs,\u201d Elon Musk said during a Twitter Spaces in April while discussing his plans for an A.I. company.\nNvidia\u2019s data center business is projected to double sales this year, adding $15 billion. It is predicted to add $20 billion in new sales next year, according to Bernstein Research. And Nvidia\u2019s share price has tripled this year, making the company one of a handful with a total value over $1 trillion.\nNvidia anticipated the A.I. boom. For years, Jensen Huang, the company\u2019s chief executive, hadtalked about how GPUs would power A.I. technologies. He was so convinced of this that he told analysts in 2017 that the company was \u201call in\u201d on a single chip design.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to work out, or it\u2019s going to work out terribly,\u201d Mr. Huang said.\nOther semiconductor companies are trying to claim a piece of the A.I. expansion. Broadcom has had some early success by working on custom A.I. chips for Google, and AMD is introducing a GPU in a bid to loosen Nvidia\u2019s grip on the most important corner of the market.\nIf all the investment in A.I. fails to generate the financial boom that companies and investors hope, the tech companies that have splurged on GPUs and A.I. systems should be able to bear the costs and stomach the disappointment, Mr. Rasgon said. The recent quarter has demonstrated that their existing businesses are far from falling apart.\n\u201cIf they guessed wrong, it\u2019s not an enormous hit,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said. \u201cIt would be a problem, but they can absorb it.\u201d"

        "title": "The Chip Titan Whose Life\u2019s Work Is at the Center of a Tech Cold War",
        "fulltext": "In a wood-paneled office overlooking Taipei and the jungle-covered mountains that surround the Taiwanese capital,Morris Changrecently pulled out an old book stamped with technicolor patterns.\nIt was titled \u201cIntroduction to VLSI Systems,\u201d a graduate-level textbook describing the intricacies of computer chip design. Mr. Chang, 92, held it up with reverence.\n\u201cI want to show you the date of this book, 1980,\u201d he said. The timing was important, he added, as it was \u201cthe earliest piece\u201d in a puzzle that came together for him \u2014 altering not only his career but also the course of the global electronics industry.\nThe insight that Mr. Chang gained from the textbook was deceptively simple: the idea thatmicrochips, which act as the brains of computers, could be designed in one place but manufactured somewhere else. The notion went against the semiconductor industry\u2019s standard practice at the time.\nSo at the age of 54, when many people begin thinking more about retirement, Mr. Chang instead put himself on a path to turn his insight into a reality. The engineer left his adopted country, the United States, and moved to Taiwan where he foundedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. The company does not design chips, but it has become the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge microprocessors for customers including Apple and Nvidia.\nToday, the company that partially exists because of a textbook is a $500 billion juggernaut that has put the most advanced chips in iPhones, cars, supercomputers and fighter jets. So critical are its airplane-hangar-size chip factories, called fabs, that the United States, Japan and Europe havecourted TSMCto build them in their neck of the woods. Over the past decade, China has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to recreate what TSMC has done.\nMr. Chang\u2019s unlikely entrepreneurial journey helped Taiwan become an economic giant, restructured the way the electronics industry worked and ultimately charteda new geopolitical realityin which a linchpin of global economic growth lies in one of the world\u2019s most volatile spots.\nThat has thrust Mr. Chang, and the company he created, into the spotlight. And at the twilight of his career, a man who has preferred to remain in the shadows reflected on what he has built and what it means to no longer be able to stay under the radar.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel particularly good,\u201d said Mr. Chang, who retired in 2018 but still appears at TSMC events. \u201cI would rather stay relatively unknown.\u201d\nOver a recent three-hour discussion in his office, Mr. Chang made it clear that he identifies as American \u2014 he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1962 \u2014 at a time when the company he founded is at the center of atechnological Cold Warbetween the United States and China. Even as the rivalry for tech leadership intensifies, he does not give China much of a chance for semiconductor supremacy.\n\u201cWe control all the choke points,\u201d Mr. Chang said, referring collectively to the United States and its chip-making allies such as the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. \u201cChina can\u2019t really do anything if we want to choke them.\u201d\nMore than a dozen people familiar with Mr. Chang, many of whom knew him as a colleague at TSMC, said he built the company \u2014 and outmaneuvered giants like Samsung and Intel \u2014 by being meticulous, stubborn, trusting his best people and, crucially, having boundless ambition and making daring moves when justified. When TSMC stumbled after the 2008 financial crisis, he returned as chief executive at age 77 to take over again.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the only person left in the chip industry who was present at the creation of the industry itself,\u201d said Chris Miller, the author of the book \u201cChip War\u201d and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. \u201cThat he\u2019s not only still in the industry but at the center and top of it is extraordinary.\u201d\nTo understand the tech industry\u2019s future, it is crucial to understand the world through Mr. Chang\u2019s eyes and how he made that initial bet when others didn\u2019t. And unlike today\u2019s tech moguls \u2014 such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have publicly considereda cage fight\u2014 Mr. Chang has shown more restraint. If competition between the global tech giants is a series of high-stakes poker games, he is the quiet man who runs the casino.\nMr. Chang was born in 1931 in a China on the brink of war. Before the age of 18, he lived in six cities, changed schools 10 times, experienced bombings in Guangzhou and Chongqing, and crossed the front lines as his family fled Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II.\nWhen he made it to Hong Kong in 1948 with his family, who by then were trying to get away from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s advancing army, there was no going back.\n\u201cMy old world crumbled as the mainland changed its color, and a new world was yet to be established,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, which was published in 1998.\nIn 1949, Mr. Chang moved to the United States, attending Harvard before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. In 1955, when he twice failed a qualifying exam for a doctoral degree at M.I.T., he decided to test out the job market.\n\u201cMany years later, I considered failing to be admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Ph.D. program as the greatest stroke of luck in my life!\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.\nTwo of the best offers arrived from Ford Motor Company andSylvania, a lesser-known electronics firm. Ford offered Mr. Chang $479 a month for a job at its research and development center in Detroit. Though charmed by the company\u2019s recruiters, Mr. Chang was surprised to find the offer was $1 less than the $480 a month that Sylvania offered.\nWhen he called Ford to ask for a matching offer, the recruiter, who had previously been kind, turned hostile and told him he would not get a cent more. Mr. Chang took the engineering job with Sylvania. There, he learned about transistors, the microchip\u2019s most basic component.\n\u201cThat was the start of my semiconductor career,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retrospect, it was a damn good thing.\u201d\nThree years at Sylvania opened doors and cemented Mr. Chang\u2019s passion for semiconductors. But Sylvania struggled, teaching him a lesson that would inform how he later ran TSMC.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, the semiconductor industry has been a fast-paced and unforgiving industry,\u201d Mr. Chang wrote of Sylvania\u2019s eventual collapse in his autobiography. \u201cOnce you fall behind, catching up becomes considerably difficult.\u201d\nIn 1958, he jumped to a buzzy new semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. The Dallas company was \u201cyouthful and energetic,\u201d with many employees working over 50 hours a week and sleeping overnight in the office. Four years later, Mr. Chang became an American, an identity he considers primary.\n\u201cEver since I fled Communist China and went to the United States and became naturalized in 1962, my identity has always been American, and nothing else,\u201d he said.\nMr. Chang became a pillar of Texas Instruments\u2019 then world-beating semiconductor business. Breakthroughs were constant. In the 1970s, the firm produced a chip that could synthesize the human voice, which led to the famed Speak & Spell toy, a hand-held device that helped children with spelling and pronunciation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like Camelot, but it was not a long period of time,\u201d he said.\nIn the late 1970s, Texas Instruments turned its focus to the burgeoning market forcalculators, digital watches and home computers. Mr. Chang, then in charge of the semiconductor side, realized his career there was approaching a \u201cdead end.\u201d\nIt was time for something different.\nIf the first puzzle piece that led to TSMC\u2019s creation was the textbook, the second was an experience that Mr. Chang had toward the end of his time at Texas Instruments.\nIn the early 1980s, Texas Instruments opened a chip factory in Japan. Three months after the production line began churning out chips, the plant\u2019s \u201cyield\u201d was double that of the company\u2019s factories in Texas. Yield is a key statistic that refers to how many usable chips emerge from production.\nMr. Chang was dispatched to Japan to solve the yield mystery. The key was the staff, he found, with turnover surprisingly low among well-qualified employees.\nBut try as it might, Texas Instruments could not find the same caliber of technicians in the United States.\u00a0At one U.S. plant, the top candidate for a supervisor job had a degree in French literature and no engineering background. The future of advanced manufacturing appeared to be in Asia.\nIn 1984, Mr. Chang joinedGeneral Instrument, another chip firm, where a third puzzle piece fell into place. He met an entrepreneur who later started a company that would only design chips without also making them, which was then uncommon. He spotted a trend that would prove to have staying power: Today most semiconductor companies design chips and outsource manufacturing.\nThis final piece coincided with Taiwan\u2019s transition from a labor-intensive and heavy industry economy to a high-tech one. When Taiwanese officials set their sights on developing the semiconductor industry, they asked Mr. Chang, whose reputation as a chip expert was established, to lead an institute for supercharging innovation.\nSo in 1985, Mr. Chang, then 54, left the United States for a place he knew only from several visits to a Texas Instruments factory.\n\u201cI certainly had no plan to spend nearly so much time in Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I was going back in maybe just a few years, and I really had no plan to set up TSMC, to set up any company in Taiwan.\u201d\nWithin weeks of Mr. Chang\u2019s arrival,LiKwoh-ting, a government official who became known as the godfather ofTaiwan\u2019s tech development, asked him to make the state-led chip project commercially viable.\nWhen Mr. Chang assessed Taiwan\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, he sensed an opening. \u201cI concluded that Taiwan was a lot more similar to Japan than the U.S.,\u201d he said, referring to his experience with the Texas Instruments\u2019 factory in Japan.\nIn 1987, Mr. Chang founded TSMC. The business model was clear in his head: TSMC would make chips for other companies and not design them. That meant it just had to win over those inside the industry and then focus on what it could do best \u2014 manufacturing.\nFrom the get-go, Mr. Chang had plans for TSMC to tap into a global market. He introduced professional management systems, which were uncommon in Taiwan, at the company. To foster an international environment, internal communications were in English.\nHis vision proved prophetic. As semiconductors became more complex and expensive to produce, only a few firms could even afford to try.Making chipsinvolves hundreds of steps that pull on advanced lasers and chemical manipulations to create tiny pathways for electronic signals that do the most basic calculations for a computer. Costs were astronomical.\nOver the years, Mr. Chang kept going as others dropped out. If TSMC could attract enough customers, leveraging economies of scale, it had a chance to take out the kings:IntelandSamsung.\nIn 1997, Mr. Chang recruited a new head of research of development, Chiang Shang-yi. He told Mr. Chiang to benchmark TSMC against the industry leader, Intel.\n\u201cOur goal is to be No. 1, barring none,\u201d Mr. Chang said.\nMr. Chiang was surprised. \u201cTo be No. 1, you have to spend three times as much as your next competitor,\u201d he replied, implying that being in the lead would be too lofty and costly a goal.\n\u201cIt may be three times, but I do want to spend enough so that we become No. 1,\u201d Mr. Chang said. And he was prepared to be patient, even after stepping down as TSMC\u2019s chief executive in 2005 and staying on as the company\u2019s chairman.\nIn April 2009, angry TSMC employees \u2014 many who had recently been let go by the company \u2014 set up a protest camp at a leafy playground in Taipei\u2019s quiet residential neighborhood of Dazhi. They were down the street from Mr. Chang\u2019s upscale apartment building.\nAs dark fell, the protesters rolled out sleeping bags next to a slide and jungle gym, covering themselves with a large sign that read \u201cTSMC lies lies lies.\u201d Throughout its more than two-decade history, TSMC had never laid off employees. Yet after the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Chang\u2019s successor, Rick Tsai, began letting employees go.\nMr. Chang, then 77, decided he could no longer stay on the sidelines. He took back his job, rehired the talent Mr. Tsai had let go and more than doubled TSMC\u2019s spending.\nComing at a tough time for the industry, the move was not appreciated by investors. Elizabeth Sun, TSMC\u2019s former head of investor relations, recalled her reaction to the news: \u201cWhen I heard it, I felt like banging my head against a wall.\u201d\nBut the bet paid off. In 2010, Mr. Chang got the call that would turbocharge TSMC\u2019s growth and clinch its lead over Samsung and Intel. Jeff Williams, a senior vice president at Apple, reached out through Mr. Chang\u2019s wife, Sophie Chang, who is a relative of Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, Apple\u2019s largest assembler.\nThe call led to a Sunday dinner with all four of them, which turned into negotiations the next day. Apple had worked with Samsung to produce the microchip it designed for the iPhone, but it was looking for a new partner, partly because Samsung had become a major smartphone competitor. TSMC, which does not compete with its customers, was in pole position for the contract.\nThe discussions stretched on for months. \u201cIt was very complicated \u2014 the contract itself,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cIt was the first time we ran into this kind of thing.\u201d\nAt one point, Apple announced a two-month pause in talks. Mr. Chang heard Intel might have intervened.\nWorried, Mr. Chang flew to San Francisco to meet Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who reassured him. In a2013 interview, Paul Otellini, then Intel\u2019s chief executive, said he had turned down the chance to make the chips for the iPhone because Apple would not pay enough.\nMr. Chang would not make the same mistake. Apple demanded better terms and lower prices than others, but he understood the contract\u2019s scale would help TSMC rocket past competitors. That was a lesson he learned from Bill Bain, who founded the consulting firm Bain & Company, back at Texas Instruments.\nMr. Bain, then a consultant for Boston Consulting Group, had worked in an office next to Mr. Chang for almost two years. He had analyzed Texas Instruments\u2019 production and sales numbers and argued that the more the company produced, the better it would perform.\nWhen the deal with Apple was complete, Mr. Chang borrowed $7 billion to build the capacity for making millions of chips for the iPhone.\nIn the ensuing years, Apple briefly turned to Samsung for iPhone chip production again, but TSMC became its primary chip maker. Apple is now TSMC\u2019s largest client, accounting for about 20 percent of revenue.\nMr. Chang remains cautious about what he says about TSMC\u2019s customers even now. After beginning a story about Apple at his office, he wondered whether he had said too much.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have exceeded Apple\u2019s limits of what to tell you,\u201d he said.\nIn a statement, Mr. Williams, now Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said Mr. Chang had \u201cpushed the semiconductor industry to new frontiers.\u201d\nIn 2018, Mr. Chang, at 86 years old, retired again. By then, TSMC had succeeded where others lagged, mass producing chips with electronic pathways the size of a DNA double helix. That gave Mr. Chang confidence that he had achieved a key tenet for TSMC: technological leadership.\nAmong the awards and photos with world leaders that stud the walls of Mr. Chang\u2019s Taipei office, one is a framed comic portraying his close relationship with Jensen Huang, a founder of thechip firm Nvidia.\nIf Apple turbocharged TSMC, it was Mr. Chang who helped make Nvidia the world\u2019s most important designer of artificial intelligence chips. The cartoon tells the story. In the mid-1990s, when Nvidia was a start-up, Mr. Huang sent a letter to Mr. Chang asking if TSMC would make its chips. After a call with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chang agreed.\n\u201cI liked him,\u201d Mr. Chang said of Mr. Huang.\nBy taking that chance, Mr. Chang helped spur the A.I. revolution in the United States. With TSMC\u2019s manufacturing, Nvidia became the world\u2019s most important A.I. chip designer. Breakthroughs like generative A.I. rely on huge numbers of Nvidia chips to find patterns in vast amounts of data.\nIn a 2018speechat Mr. Chang\u2019s retirement gathering, Mr. Huang said Nvidia \u2014 now worth $1 trillion \u2014 would not exist without TSMC. An inscription on the comic, which Mr. Huang gave to Mr. Chang, reads: \u201cYour career is a masterpiece \u2014 a Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony.\u201d\nFor Mr. Chang, the final notes of that masterpiece have not yet been played. He is healthy for a nonagenarian, though he can no longer smoke a pipe \u2014 once his trademark in photos \u2014 after he had stents put into his heart a few years ago.\nAt his office, he still keeps a Bloomberg terminal. He also makes regular public appearances around Taiwan to discuss global politics and the economy. Like many, he worries about a potential conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan, though he believes the chance of such a confrontation is low.\n\u201cThe chance of China invading Taiwan, amphibious warfare and all that stuff, I think that\u2019s a very, very low probability,\u201d he said. \u201cA blockade of some kind, I think I still put it as low probability, but it\u2019s still a chance and I want to avoid that.\u201d\nMr. Chang said he was not worried aboutU.S. policiesthat have cut off Chinese firms from access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s still OK,\u201d he said, though he noted U.S. companies would lose business and China would find ways to fight back.\nAs the conversation wound down, Mr. Chang said he had some regrets that he could not be in the driver\u2019s seat as TSMC faces geopolitical challenges. But he said the timing of his retirement in 2018 made sense, driven by technology and not politics.\n\u201cI was literally sure that we had achieved technology leadership,\u201d he said of that time. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll lose it.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Revenue Drops 1%, but Profit Rises to $19.88 Billion",
        "fulltext": "The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, withunit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $19.88 billion.\nWhile Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.\nApple\u2019s financial results were the latest indication that tech\u2019s biggest companies have found their footing after last year\u2019s downturn. Last week,Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, andGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales.Microsoftposted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, andAmazonon Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.\nThe tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.\nThough Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $6.84 billion, the company said.\nApple\u2019s share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.\nApple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.\nIn the June quarter, the company made $39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent,according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job with affordability programs around the world,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. \u201cThe majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.\u201d\nThe company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company\u2019s services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $8.28 billion.\nApple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. Butthe $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won\u2019t go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.\nIn the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened itsfirst stores in India in Apriland welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to havea billion smartphone users by 2026.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, during the call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for us.\u201d\nApple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company\u2019s supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming \u201cincrementally incremental.\u201d"

The sell-off in global stocks and bonds picked up steam on Thursday. And weary market watchers will be looking for more hints on the Fed\u2019s view at next week\u2019s Jackson Hole summit of central bankers and policymakers.\nTechnology stocks have been hit particularly hard.The high-flying FANG+ Index \u2014 which comprises the largest tech stocks by market capitalization, including Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta \u2014 fell into correction territory on Thursday. The group of Nasdaq heavyweights is down nearly 11 percent since July 18.\nHigh-growth tech stocks tend to be sensitive to rising interest rates and bond yields.They rallied earlier in the year on investors\u2019 belief that the Fed was pivoting to a more dovish rates policy, which could inspire a rebound in tech spending. (Investors\u2019 voracious appetite for stocks that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence also fueled the tech rally.)\nJust a month ago, Wall Street was hailing the so-called \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d for driving the gains this year in the S&P 500. As MarketWatchnotes, four of the seven (Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft) have fallen at least 10 percent from their highs in July. Tesla, the worst of the bunch, has tumbled more than 25 percent in that period, putting it in bear territory.\nRising bond yields have investors on edge.On Thursday, alarm bells sounded on both sides of the Atlantic as investors sold government bonds en masse, sending yields to multiyear highs. The 10-year Treasury note climbed to a height it last hit in the early days of the global financial crisisin 2008.\nThis sentiment trickled down to stocks and crypto.Bitcoin and Ethereum, the largest cryptocurrencies, plunged overnight, with Bitcoin sinking to a two-month low below $26,500. The Wall Street Journal\u2019sreportthat SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s rocket company, wrote down the value of its Bitcoin stake over the past two years and sold some of ithasn\u2019t improved sentimentaround the highly volatile asset class.\nChina\u2019s woes are also weighing on global markets.The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kongfell into a bear marketon Friday as investors pulled back on Chinese stocks with the economy slowing anda property-market crisis brewing. Also on Friday, analysts at Nomura were the latest tolower their forecast for China\u2019s growth. Adding to the jitters, the renminbi hit a 16-year low against the dollar on Friday, promptingemergency movesto prop up the currency. That did little to soothe investors\u2019 nerves.\nThe Chinese property giant Evergrande files for bankruptcy in the United States.Thecompanydefaulted on its bonds in 2021, spurring a crisis across a sector that is a crucial driver of Chinese growth, and is pursuing a restructuring agreement with creditors. Country Garden, another developer, missed international debt payments this month amid a wider economic slowdown in China.\nInstacart is reportedly planning an I.P.O. as early as next month.The country\u2019slargest online grocery delivery companyis pursuing a traditional listing on Nasdaq after considering a direct listing, according to Bloomberg. Separately, Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank,has lined up 28 banksto underwrite an I.P.O. that could be the biggest this year, Bloomberg reported.\nMortgage rates hit a 21-year high.The lending giant Freddie Macsaid on Thursdaythat the average rate on a 30-year mortgage, the most common home loan in America, surpassed 7 percent this week; a year ago it was at 5.19 percent. Ballooning rates for financing and a tight supply of homes are pricing an increasing number of Americans out of the housing market.\nThe Southwest braces for Hurricane Hilary.The Category 4 storm isexpected to make landfallin Baja California on Saturday and then head inland over the Mexican border into California, where it will weaken to a tropical storm. A flood watch has been issued for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\nA cornerstone of President Biden\u2019s effort to counter China is to secure access to the commodities critical to supply-chain security. An emerging bidding war for U.S. Steel could test that ambition in a sector dominated by Chinese rivals.\nBut a brewing geopolitical fight on the other side of the world could have even longer-term consequences for the economy and the Biden administration\u2019s plans to power an energy transition.\nCleveland-Cliffs started the bidding for U.S. Steel with a $10 billion offer.A successful bid would add to consolidation of a U.S. industry that has dwindled to four major companies: Cleveland-Cliffs, U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics.Chinais the world\u2019s biggest producer by far, accounting for about half of global production; the United States ranks fourth.\nU.S. Steel publicly rejected the initial offer.The company called the Cleveland-Cliffs terms\u201cunreasonable\u201dand announced a formal review process. TheUnited Steelworkerssupported Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 bid, but manufacturers worry that more consolidation would give steel makers outsized power to raise prices and squeeze customers.\nAnother major metals fight worth watching is unfolding in Indonesia.The country has theworld\u2019s biggest reserves of nickel, a mineral used in electric vehicle batteries \u2014 and a key material in the green economy. The Biden administration has offered billions of dollars in subsidies to spur EV manufacturing, and the energy transition is a crucial aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act.\nBut Indonesia\u2019s nickel industry relies on Chinese companies for investment and technology.That is complicating Jakarta\u2019s efforts to build ties with global companies that want to get access to the country\u2019s reserves and to American tax credits via the I.R.A. The Indonesian government had been wooing Tesla to build a factory, but the company set up its Southeast Asian headquarters in Malaysia instead.\nThat may give China another opening.Indonesian officials are considering other options, including stepping up efforts to convince BYD, China\u2019s largest EV maker, to set up shop. \u201cWe are aiming basically to the United States,\u201d Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, one of Indonesia\u2019s most powerful ministers, told The Times\u2019s Peter Goodman. \u201cBut if the Americans finally say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to take it,\u2019 fine, we\u2019ll look for some other places to go.\u201d\n\u2014 The amount Spotify could add in profits by steering listeners away from white noise podcasts, according to Bloomberg. The company\u2019s algorithm pushed users looking for \u201ctalk\u201d content to shows that broadcast everything from whale noises to bird song on repeat. But those users typically remain on thefree, ad-supported versionof the platform instead of opting for the subscription shows that are more lucrative for Spotify. The company considered directing listeners to shows that made more money, but didn\u2019t put the plan into action.\nThe death toll from the wildfires that have ripped across Maui stands at 111, and focus is turning to what led the blaze to become one of the country\u2019s worst natural disasters in decades. Maui\u2019s emergency management chiefresigned last nightas questions swirled over the decision not to use outdoor alert sirens. Hawaiian Electric, the state\u2019s largest utility, is also facing major scrutiny.\nIt could take months for officials to assess the company\u2019s role \u2014 if any \u2014 in the blaze.But markets fear the worst. Hawaiian Electric shareshave fallen by more than 65 percent since Aug. 7,the day before the wildfire started. On Friday, Moody\u2019s was the latest credit ratings firm todowngradeHawaiian Electric as potential liabilities mount.\nA big question is whether the company will be forced to follow a similar path to Pacific Gas and Electric, the California-based utility company that filed for bankruptcy in 2019under the burden of wildfire liabilities.\nThe factors to watch includewhether insurance can coverHawaiian Electric\u2019s massive rebuilding costs, and the size of its potential liabilities. At least four lawsuits have already been filed, contending the company was negligent in operating and maintaining equipment.\nEvidence is building.Videos and photos posted from Maui appear to show power lines starting fires. In addition, data from Whisker Labs, a company that monitors electrical grids for fire hazards, seems to identify faults on power lines in the area where the fires started.\nThere\u2019s an important difference between Hawaiian Electric and PG&E.California has inverse indemnification laws, which makes it easier to hold public utility companies like PG&E liable. Hawaii has no such regulations, meaning litigants will have the higher bar of proving management is to blame.\nWould Hawaii allow the company to file for bankruptcy?Regardless of how bad Hawaiian Electric\u2019s financial situation becomes, Hawaii may not want to allow its largest utility to go bankrupt. That could delay rebuilding on the island.\nThe state has been through big bankruptcies before,including those of Hawaiian Airlines in 2008 and Liberty House, its largest retailer, in 1998. Working to keep the company out of bankruptcy could be seen as a more politically fraught option, versus handing over questions about its future to a judge.\nDeals\nSoho House is teaming up with Michael Milken toopen the fourth outlet of The Ned, its high-end social club, in Washington.
