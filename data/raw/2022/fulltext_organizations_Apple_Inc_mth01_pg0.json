        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Top federal antitrust officials on Tuesday announced a review of how they approve mergers and acquisitions, in a broad effort to strengthen enforcement and clamp down on a surge of corporate consolidation, particularly in high tech.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, head of antitrust at the Justice Department, said they wanted to rewrite the merger guidelines created a dozen years ago because they didn\u2019t directly address the unique problems raised by the tech industry.\nThe review will focus on how the merger review process is applied to free services, such as those from Google and Facebook. Often, price increases are a key measure for anticompetitive conduct, but that standard doesn\u2019t apply to advertising-based business models that offer free services to consumers. The regulators will also look at how nascent rivals could be affected by a merger. The F.T.C., for instance, is suing to break up Facebook over its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, when those services weren\u2019t clearly direct competitors to Facebook.\nDemocratic regulators and lawmakers are racing to fulfill promises to curtail the dominance and power of a handful of tech giants, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. A Senate panel is expected to vote this week on legislation aimed at preventing powerful digital platforms such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Amazon\u2019s marketplace from blocking competitors.\nPresident Biden has told the agencies to review the guidelines as part of his effort to strengthen the enforcement of merger rules. He picked vocal critics of technology giants to lead antitrust efforts, but the agencies led by Ms. Khan and Mr. Kanter have struggled to keep up with a surge of corporate acquisitions. Global mergers were valued at a record total of $5.8 trillion in 2021, and the caseload for merger reviews at the F.T.C. and Justice Department has doubled, Ms. Khan said.\nThe regulators said they were also interested in broadening the scope of antitrust enforcement to consider potential ripple effects of corporate concentration on labor markets, innovation and consumer protection.\n\u201cThis inquiry launched by the F.T.C. and D.O.J. is designed to ensure that our merger guidelines accurately reflect modern market realities and equip us to forcefully enforce the law against unlawful deals,\u201d Ms. Khan said.\nLast year, the F.T.C. began a review of guidelines for so-called vertical mergers \u2014 the acquisition of companies\u2019 adjacent markets that are part of a supply chain. Tech companies have acquired scores of companies that don\u2019t directly compete with their main businesses, but that have helped giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google spread their tentacles into new markets and maintain their dominance, leaders including Ms. Khan and Mr. Kanter have argued. The announcement by Microsoft, whose main business is in enterprise and consumer software, on Tuesday that it would buy game maker Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion is an example of this activity. Regulators declined to comment on the deal.\nThe regulators may face challenges to revised rules in the courts. Judges have adhered to decades-old interpretations of antitrust laws that hold consumer prices as the primary test of monopolization. The agencies are expected to take about one year to rewrite its merger rules."

        "title": "No Longer in Service: BlackBerry Phones Come to Their End",
        "fulltext": "For many years, my work for The New York Times was centered on one thing: BlackBerrys. But this week, the onetime wonder of Canada\u2019s tech industry finally faded out as a smartphone maker.\nThere was a time wheninterruptions to BlackBerry servicewere big news at The Timesand at other news organizations around the world. But the company\u2019s decision, which took effect Tuesday, to permanently shut down BlackBerry email, BlackBerry Messenger and other services needed to operate most of its phones passed by with much less notice.\n[Read:BlackBerry Ends Service on Its Once-Ubiquitous Mobile Devices]\nIn all, I\u2019ve written more than 300 articles about BlackBerry devices and Research in Motion, as the phone maker was long named. While I never owned a BlackBerry, out of stinginess more than anything else, I did borrow one occasionally.\nMyfirst BlackBerry article for The Times, published in January 1999, offered little suggestion that the device would turn Research in Motion into Canada\u2019s most valuable corporation and ultimately develop an almost cultish following among users. It was the second-to-last item in a long list appearing in Circuits, The Times\u2019s former weekly technology section, and it described an \u201cE-mail-ready pager\u201d that was roughly the shape of a credit card and ran off a single AA battery. (While its functions were limited, adjusted for inflation, the original version of the BlackBerry cost roughly $650.)\nI took one of those original BlackBerrys cross-country skiing and sent an email from a cabin along the trails just for the sheer novelty of it. Now, of course, I\u2019m happiest skiing where there\u2019s no signal that allows emails, texts and Slack messages to follow me.\nWhat I didn\u2019t foresee was how important the BlackBerry\u2019s physical keyboard would be to its success, as well as to how it would be used: \u201cThe pager\u2019s itty-bitty keyboard, however, will discourage long-winded messaging,\u201d I wrote.\nIn the device\u2019s early years, when BlackBerrys were overwhelmingly bought by corporations and government agencies, RIM\u2019s executives clearly catered to the information technology department heads who approved the purchase of the phones en masse, not the phone users themselves. In a time when there was far more anxiety about email security in general, I.T. bosses had to be persuaded that wireless emails could be kept safe from hackers\u2019 eyes. More than anything, BlackBerry was selling the idea that the unique network its devices operated through provided absolute security.\nAnd that security went beyond email and messaging. Early on, Mike Lazaridis, the co-founder of RIM and the driving force behind the company\u2019s technology, boasted to me that there were no cameras on BlackBerrys because corporate and government security users didn\u2019t want them.\nBlackBerrys, of course, grew in size and gainedfeatures like the ability to make phone callsand, eventually, take photos. And then, almost overnight, they became a hot consumer product and RIM became an industry giant. The company, however, would struggle with the much more fickle consumer market. Its lower priced handsets for consumers, very unlike the ones with which it made its name, were often buggy and unreliable.\nAs RIM struggled to figure out what consumers wanted, it tried a something-for-everybody approach. In 2011,the company was unable to tell me how many different modelsit offered for an article in which I described its lineup this way: \u201cThere are BlackBerrys that flip, BlackBerrys that slide, BlackBerrys with touch screens, BlackBerrys with touch screens and keyboards, BlackBerrys with full keyboards, BlackBerrys with compact keyboards, high-end BlackBerrys and low-priced models.\u201d In RIM\u2019s efforts to cater to everyone, it gradually attracted almost no one.\nBy 2011 of course, the iPhone was well established. RIM\u2019s executives were initially dismissive of Apple\u2019s offering. It lacked, of course, a physical keyboard. Shortly after the iPhone was released, one senior RIM executive brought up at the end of an interview what he saw as the iPhone\u2019s fatal flaw. Unlike BlackBerrys, he noted, iPhones couldn\u2019t lower wireless data costs by compressing web pages. They were, he declared, \u201cbandwidth inefficient.\u201d\nAssuming that they knew anything about bandwidth efficiency, consumers didn\u2019t really care. Smartphones had become all about software, not keyboards \u2014 a fact BlackBerry\u2019s executives were slow to accept. \u201cThey are not idiots, but they\u2019ve behaved like idiots,\u201d Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, a former Apple executive,told me in 2011.\nBlackBerry did finally wake up, but it was too late.The BlackBerry 10 operating system, the company\u2019s response to the iPhone and Google\u2019s Android, was so troubled by delays and development problems that it led to the departure of Mr. Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the company\u2019s co-chief executives. When phones using the new operating system finally arrived, theywere met with waves of indifference.\nBlackBerry the company staggers on, however. It lost $1.1 billion during its most recent fiscal year. Now out of the phone business, it\u2019s selling security software and software systems for carmakers. It has licensed the BlackBerry name to Asian phone makers who have produced some Android-based models. (Those phones continue to work.)\nI asked BlackBerry how many users of its older phones were affected by this week\u2019s shutdown. It didn\u2019t respond.\nThe federal government reached what it called thelargest settlement in Canada\u2019s historythis week after agreeing to provide 40 billion Canadian dollars in a mixture of compensation and funding to repair the nation\u2019s discriminatory child welfare system, Catherine Porter and Vjosa Isai report.\nThe changes to Canadian lawthat make conversion therapy a crime wentinto effect Friday. Christine Hauser goes through the history of the legislation and explains the consequences of the move.\nBrian Hamilton, an assistant equipment manager for the Vancouver Canucks, learned that hehad a cancerous mole on his neckthrough an unlikely channel: a message typed on a phone by a fan and held against the glass during a game in Seattle. Eduardo Medina reports that months later, Mr. Hamilton finally met the sharp-eyed Nadia Popovici.\nMy Montreal-based colleague Dan Bilefsky looks back at hisinternational travel experiences during year two of the pandemic.\nJoe Morena, ofSt-Viateur Bagel in Montreal,discussed his unusual line of business with The Times for an illustrated feature.\nA bitter disenrollment drive by the Nooksack Indian Tribe in northern Washington State has left dozens of peopledescended from a First Nation in Canada facing eviction, Mike Baker reports.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s profit jumps to $34.6 billion in holiday quarter despite supply issues.",
        "fulltext": "Apple weathered the supply chain snarls at the end of 2021 that tripped up the global electronics market and other industries, announcing on Thursday an 11 percent increase in revenue and a 20 percent jump in profit in its most recent quarter while offering optimism that the worst of the problems were behind it.\nApple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations with its record results, easing fears that the tech industry\u2019s long period of fast growth may be coming to an end. It made $34.6 billion in profit off revenue of $123.9 billion in the three months ending in December, though its revenue growth continued to slow.\nAs usual, the iPhone drove sales for Apple, whichbriefly crossed $3 trillion in market valueearlier in January before sliding back to about $2.6 trillion by Thursday. Sales of iPhones totaled $71.6 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier. Demand for the newest iPhone 13 juiced sales, but the company has been warning for months that computer chip shortages and pandemic-related manufacturing problems in Asia were likely to limit supply and hamper revenue.\nA global chip shortagehas hurt a wide range of industries, including consumer electronics and cars. On Monday, Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the U.S. was facing an \u201calarming\u201d shortage of semiconductors.\nChip shortages have forced some factories to slow or suspend production. That hasdented U.S. economic growthand led tosoaring inflationin the United States.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in October that supply constraints had cost his company $6 billion in revenue during its fall quarter. During a call with investors on Thursday, he said Apple \u201cexperienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter\u201d during the holidays, but he declined to give a specific number.\nMr. Cook said he saw light at the end of the tunnel for Apple: He expected supply problems in the current quarter to be less than they were during the holidays.\n\u201cWe pride ourselves in getting products to customers who really want them, and we try to do that on a fast basis, and so it\u2019s frustrating that we can\u2019t always do that at the speed we would like,\u201d he said during the earnings call. \u201cHowever, March is better than December, and so there\u2019s some encouraging signs there.\u201d\nMr. Cook said much of the difficulty stemmed from procuring a particular type of computer chip, but he did not think the struggles necessitated Apple re-evaluating how it operated its supply chain.\n\u201cI think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages, because it\u2019s a fast-moving supply chain,\u201d he said.\nApple saw sales growth around the world, led by a 20 percent year-over-year increase in China and 19 percent in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, though sales in Japan dropped by 14 percent from the same quarter the prior year. iPad sales were particularly constrained by the supply chain problems, Mr. Cook said; the company reported a 14 percent decrease in sales of the tablets from the same time the prior year.\nApple announced a slate of new hardware products in the fall, including new models of its MacBook Pro laptop computer, AirPods, the iPad and the Apple Watch. It is working on an augmented reality headset that could compete with offerings from companies like Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent, astechnology companies increasing jockey for influencein the budding metaverse, a futuristic online universe.\nMr. Cook sidestepped a question about how Apple is thinking about the metaverse on the earnings call, saying, \u201cWe see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.\u201d\nApple also benefited from strong growth in its services business, including its App Store, which Mr. Cook described as an \u201ceconomic miracle for developers around the world\u201d even as itcontinues to face accusationsthat it stifles competition and levies onerous fees on app developers. The services business was up nearly 24 percent in the quarter from a year ago, to $19.5 billion.\nApple also said it planned to use nearly $27 billion of its cash to pay dividends to shareholders. Shares of Apple stock jumped more than 4 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday evening.\nApple\u2019s positive results came near the end of a week of wild trading on the stock market that was due in part to fears about how quickly the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make riskier investment, like technology stocks, less appealing, adding to concerns that the pandemic-fueled boost to technology companies could soon be ending.\nButMicrosoftandTesla, despite dealing with supply chain woes of their own, posted record profits this week and beat industry expectations. Next week, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, and Amazon will report their results for the last three months of 2021, providing insight into the health of online advertising and retail."

        "title": "Apple Becomes First Company to Hit $3 Trillion Market Value",
        "fulltext": "Combine Walmart, Disney, Netflix, Nike, Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, McDonald\u2019s, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, Boeing, IBM and Ford.\nApple is still worth more.\nApple, the computer company that started in a California garage in 1976, is now worth $3 trillion. It became the first publicly traded company to ever reach the figure on Monday, when its stock briefly eclipsed $182.86 a share before closing at $182.01.\nApple\u2019s value iseven more remarkableconsidering how rapid its recent ascent has been. In August 2018, Apple becamethe first American companyever to be worth $1 trillion, an achievement that took 42 years. Itsurged past $2 trilliontwo years later. Its next trillion took just 16 months and 15 days.\nSuch a valuation would have been unfathomable a few years ago. Now it seems like another milepost for a corporate titan that isstill growingand appears to have few tall hurdles in its path. Another tech giant, Microsoft, could follow Apple into the $3 trillion club early this year.\n\u201cWhen we started, we thought it would be a successful company that would go forever. But you don\u2019t really envision this,\u201d said Steve Wozniak, the engineer who founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976. \u201cAt the time, the amount of memory that would hold one song cost $1 million.\u201d\nBy just about any measure, a $3 trillion valuation is striking. It is worth more than the value of all of the world\u2019s cryptocurrencies. It is roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Britain or India. And it is equivalent to about six JPMorgan Chases, the biggest American bank, or 30 General Electrics.\nApple now accounts for nearly 7 percent of the total value of the S&P 500, breaking IBM\u2019s record of 6.4 percent in 1984, according to Howard Silverblatt, an analyst who tracks valuations at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple alone is about 3.3 percent of the value of all global stock markets, he said.\nBehind Apple\u2019s ascent is its tight grip on consumers, an economy that has especially favored its business and its stock, and its shrewd use of an enormous pile of cash.\nWhen Apple unveiled the iPhone in January 2007, the company was worth $73.4 billion. Fifteen years later, the iPhone, already one of history\u2019s best-selling products, continues to post impressive growth. In the year ending in September, iPhone sales were $192 billion, up almost 40 percent from the year prior.\nThe pandemic also sent sales of other Apple devices soaring, as people used them more to work, study and socialize, and sent investors fleeing to the safety of Apple\u2019s stock in an increasingly uncertain global economy.\nApple\u2019s immense sales and wide profit margins have provided it with a stockpile of cash big enough to buy a company like UPS, Starbucks or Morgan Stanley outright. At the end of September, Apple reported $190 billion in cash and investments.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve created the greatest cash machine in history,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor who has studied Apple.\nYet instead of making a major acquisition, or even trying something ambitious and expensive like building multiple factories in the United States, Apple has decided to largely give its cash back to its investors by buying its own stock.\nOver the past decade, Apple has purchased $488 billion of its own shares, by far the most of any company, according to an analysis by Mr. Silverblatt. Much of that spendingcame after Apple used a 2017 tax lawto move most of the$252 billion it had held abroadback to the United States. Apple is now responsible for 14 of the 15 largest stock buybacks in any single financial quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said. \u201cThey are the poster child,\u201d he said.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company has spent more than $82 billion onresearch and developmentover the past five years, steadily increasing its investment each year, and that it employs about 154,000 people, or 38,000 more than five years ago.\nApple is also the largest taxpayer in the United States. In April, the company said it had paid$45 billion in taxesover the prior five years.\nEconomists are split over buybacks. Some economists say companies with excess cash should return the money to its shareholders. That it is far better for the economy than sitting on billions of dollars in cash, they say.\n\u201cThis whole notion that buybacks are somehow going into a black hole is mystifying,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said. \u201cThat is cash going to investors.\u201d\nOther economists say that buybacks are largely designed to increase a company\u2019s valuation and that the money should instead be used to invest in the business, raise wages or even cut prices.\nApple, for instance, has spent billions of dollars buying its own stock while also using low-wage workers to assemble its products,working hardto avoid taxes and tariffs, and continually raising the prices on its devices.\n\u201cApple could have gone and used that money to do all sorts of things. Instead, they\u2019re using it to boost their stock price,\u201d said William Lazonick, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts who has been a leading critic of buybacks since the 1980s.\nMr. Lazonick said that buybacks increase stock prices by encouraging investors to buy, and then causing momentum in the stock market as other investors look to cash in on the increase.\nStock buybacks reduce the number of total shares available for purchase. That makes each remaining share more valuable and improves the underlying fundamentals of the company in equations that large investors and automated trading systems use to pick stocks. As a result, the stock price climbs higher.\nTo Mr. Lazonick, a $3 trillion valuation is the result of a mix of factors. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much of that is speculation, how much is manipulation and how much is innovation,\u201d he said.\nKellen Browningcontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "A judge in Santa Clara County has granted Apple a temporary restraining order against a woman accused of stalking and threatening the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\nIn court documents filed last week andfirst reported by The Mercury News, Apple accused the woman, a 45-year-old Virginia resident, of making increasingly alarming threats and statements toward Mr. Cook over email and Twitter since late 2020. She also claimed that she was in a romantic relationship with him and that he was the father of her twin children, according to the documents.\nThe woman, Apple said, emailed Mr. Cook photos of what she said was a handgun and ammunition she had purchased, along with comments like, \u201cMy new gun will never return it at this time before I shoot!\u201d Apple also wrote that she filed documents to create fraudulent corporations, some with sexually explicit names, while naming Mr. Cook as the executive and listing his home address on the forms.\nThe situation escalated in October, when the woman appeared outside Mr. Cook\u2019s Palo Alto home in a car with a Virginia license plate and said she wanted to speak with him before security sent her away, according to court documents. She returned minutes later and was stopped by local police officers. They searched her car and did not find any weapons, but they towed the vehicle because her license was expired. She told them that she \u201ccould get violent,\u201d according to the filing.\nThe woman continued to send Mr. Cook threatening emails, Apple wrote, including one in early January telling him that he \u201cmust empty the condo\u201d and that she would \u201cmove in next week.\u201d\n\u201cApple believes that respondent may be armed and is still in the South Bay Area and intends to return to Apple C.E.O.\u2019s residence or locate him otherwise in the near future,\u201d the company wrote. Apple declined to comment on Tuesday.\nThe restraining order prohibits the woman from owning guns or going near Mr. Cook\u2019s residence or any Apple offices until March 29, when a hearing on whether to extend the order is scheduled. The order also prohibits her from contacting Mr. Cook or tagging him on social media."

        "title": "Efforts to Rein In Big Tech May Be Running Out of Time",
        "fulltext": "Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are readying a major push on bills aimed at restraining the power of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, as they see the window of opportunity closing quickly ahead of the midterm elections.\nIn a significant step forward, a Senate committee voted on Thursday to advance a bill that would prohibit companies like Amazon, Apple and Google from promoting their own products over those of competitors. Many House lawmakers are pressing asuite of antitrust billsthat would make it easier to break up tech giants. And some are making last-ditch efforts to pass bills meant to strengthen privacy, protect children online, curb misinformation, restrain targeted advertising and regulate artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies.\nMost of the proposals before Congress are long shots.President Biden and top Democratsin Congress have said addressing the industry\u2019s power is a high priority, but numerous other issues rank even higher on their list. These include passing voting rights legislation, correcting labor and supply chain constraints, enacting a social services package and steering the nation out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nStill, the next few months are probably the last best chance for a while. After that, attention will turn to the midterm elections, and Democrats, who support the efforts aimed at tech in far greater numbers than Republicans, could lose control of Congress.\n\u201cThis is a problem that has been brewing for a long time, and it\u2019s become pretty obvious to everyone,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who has led the push for tougher laws on the tech companies. \u201cBut when you get to the fall, it will be very difficult to get things done because everything is about the election.\u201d\nCongress has unified around a growing concern about the technology giants over the last several years. Still,dozens of bills have failed to pass, even as many other countries have beefed up their regulations for the industry.\nWhen Mr. Biden took office last year, he promised to inject more competition into the economy, particularly in the tech sector. He appointed vocal tech critics to lead antitrust agencies, and this month, his press secretary said the president was \u201cencouraged to see bipartisan interest in Congress in passing legislation to address the power of tech platforms through antitrust legislation.\u201d\nBruce Reed, the White House deputy chief of staff, and Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, met on Wednesday with executives from companies including Yelp and Sonos, which have lobbied for antitrust action against the tech giants. They discussed the difficulties that \u201centrepreneurs, brick-and-mortar retailers, and other businesses face competing in sectors dominated by a few large platforms,\u201d White House officials said. The administration said it anticipated working with Congress, but has not endorsed any of the specific legislation aimed at the companies.\nComplicating matters is that even though the two parties widely agree that Congress should do something, they often disagree on what that should be.\nIn the past few years, dozens of privacy, speech, security and antitrust bills have withered amid disagreements over how to balance protecting consumers while encouraging the growth of Silicon Valley. Some bills, like those that address online content moderation, are especially polarizing: Democrats have called for measures that would push the companies to remove from their sites more misinformation and content that contributed to real world harm. Republicans have backed laws to force the companies to leave more content up.\n\u201cEveryone has a bone to pick with Big Tech, but when it comes to doing something that\u2019s when bipartisanship falls apart,\u201d said Rebecca Allensworth, a Vanderbilt Law School professor who specializes in antitrust law.\n\u201cAt the end of day, regulation is regulation,\u201d she said, \u201cso you will have a hard time bringing a lot of Republicans on board for a bill viewed as a heavy-handed aggressive takedown through regulation of Big Tech.\u201d\nThe bill that the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced on Thursday, for instance, could prevent Amazon from steering shoppers to its Amazon-branded toilet paper and socks while making it harder to find comparisons for those products from other brands. It could force Apple to allow alternatives to Apple Pay within iPhone apps. And it could prevent Google from putting its own services like travel prices, restaurant reviews and shopping results at the top of search results.\nIntroduced by Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the legislation aims to address concerns that a handful of tech giants act as gatekeepers to digital goods and services. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have a combined market capitalization of more than $9 trillion. Several Republicans voted in favor of the bill, which passed 16 to 6. Though Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, repeated a consistent party talking point of \u201cunintended consequences\u201d to future businesses that could be swept under the law, others said the threats posed by tech giants outweighed those worries.\nSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, voted in favor of the bill and emphasized that his greatest concern was how giant social media companies moderated content. He and other Republicans on the committee said they believe companies like Apple, Google and Facebook censored conservative voices by banning apps like Parler, a right-wing site, and by taking down accounts of conservative figures.\n\u201cIt would provide protections to content providers that are discriminated against for the content they produce,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI think that that is a meaningful step forward.\u201d\nMs. Klobuchar described the vote as \u201ca historic and important moment,\u201d as the first antitrust bill aimed at tech to advance out of the committee.\n\u201cAs dominant digital platforms \u2014 some of the biggest companies our world has ever seen \u2014 increasingly give preference to their own products and services, we must put policies in place to ensure small businesses and entrepreneurs still have the opportunity to succeed in the digital marketplace,\u201d she said.\nBut she acknowledged there was much work ahead for her and Mr. Grassley to persuade congressional leadership to support final passage.\nConsumer groups and a coalition of dozens of tech start-ups back the bill. Some consumer advocates have compared the legislation to a law that forced monopoly TV providers to offer all networks access to cable customers. That action, they say, did not lead to the demise of the cable television business, but kept monopoly providers from shutting out competition.\n\u201cConsumers will benefit from this bill by making it easier to install, choose and use alternative apps and online services,\u201d said Sumit Sharma, a senior researcher for tech competition at Consumer Reports, \u201cenabling both consumers and small businesses to more easily switch between ecosystems by mixing and matching services from different providers.\u201d\nSilicon Valley lobbyists have fought the bill in published opinion pieces, ad campaigns and one-on-one appeals. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, have called lawmakers to oppose the bill.\nThe companies\u2019 lobbyists have argued that the legislation could make it harder to ward off malware and bugs in devices and could make their services less useful. In ablog poston Tuesday, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, Kent Walker, painted a dire vision of the effects that it and other bills could have: The company may have to stop including a map of vaccination sites in search results if the law passes, he said. It may have to stop blocking spam in Gmail. It may not be able to show someone searching for medical help \u201cclear information\u201d and \u201cinstead be required to direct you to a mix of low quality results.\u201d\nThe companies have also said the proposals \u2014 focused on their bigness \u2014 would hurt small businesses. In recent months, Amazon has urged the merchants who sell products through its marketplace to contact lawmakers with concerns about the bills.\nBrian Huseman, the company\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement that the legislation could imperil Amazon\u2019s ability to offer Prime shipping benefits to those sellers or allow them onto its platform at all.\nMs. Klobuchar\u2019s bill in particular targets a growing business for Amazon: competing directly with those outside merchants by offering its own products, like its Amazon Basics line.\nAmazon argues that many major retailers, like Costco and Walmart, do the same thing. \u201cThe bill\u2019s authors are targeting common retail practices and, troublingly, appear to single out Amazon while giving preferential treatment to other large retailers that engage in the same practices,\u201d Mr. Huseman said. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla, two Democrats from California, repeated the companies\u2019 arguments, saying the Silicon Valley giants were being unfairly targeted by a bill that could help rivals in China like TikTok and Tencent.\nMs. Klobuchar said tech companies had lobbed misleading attacks. \u201cThey don\u2019t like our bill,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see the ads on TV.\u201d\nBefore Thursday\u2019s session, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Grassley proposed changes that they said would address concerns about user privacy and hindering subscription services like Amazon Prime. The new version also appeared likely to cover TikTok.\nEven though Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s bill moved beyond the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, its sponsors face the steeper challenge of getting 60 senators to support it. In the House, advocates of the antitrust bills also need to get enough Republicans on board to account for Democrats who oppose the proposals.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the cascade of legislative possibilities,\u201d said William E. Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cNone of it has happened. And the clock is running.\u201d"

        "title": "The Meaning of Apple at $3 Trillion",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\n$3,000,000,000,000.\nThat was (briefly) the total value of Apple\u2019s stock on Monday. It was worth a piddly $2.93 trillion as of Wednesday morning \u2014 still a bonkers number that no company has reached before.\nThe milestone is a useful moment to dig into the identity of Apple and the rest of America\u2019s technology titans. Big Tech companies are smart at making products and even smarter at making money. That is a big reason Apple is worth so much.\nWhat is Apple\u2019s superpower? With clever tweaks and desirable new products, it has extended the life of its iPhone empire well beyond when it might have declined. What should have been Apple\u2019s weakness \u2014 its dependence on the iPhone, at a time when smartphones are no longer selling like hot cakes \u2014 instead has been a source of strength.\nLike knowing that Google and Facebookare rich from selling advertisements for socks and hotel stays, understanding the nuts and bolts behind Apple\u2019s power helps demystify the technology titans that have grabbed both our awe and derision.\nIn the spirit of Tuesday\u2019s newsletter about technologymisjudgments, I will confess that I was wrong about Apple. Six years ago, I wrote acolumnfor Bloomberg Opinion \u2014 the first of many like it \u2014 that said Apple was hitting a wall.\nSince then, Apple\u2019s sales have increased by more than $132 billion, or about triple the amount that Tesla\u2019s sales have grown since 2015. Apple\u2019s profits are unreal, and we\u2019re probably paying too much fortheir $19 cleaning rags.\nI still think I\u2019m right about Apple, but I\u2019m just not right yet. (You might describe this as being wrong. I won\u2019t argue.) The facts remain: The company\u2019s principal product, smartphones, haveshifted from wow to normal, and people aren\u2019t buying new ones as often as they used to.\nIn 2015, about 1.4 billion new smartphones were sold worldwide. In 2021, the research firm IDC estimated total sales at \u2026about 1.4 billion. The chunk of those that are iPhones \u2014 about one in seven \u2014 hasn\u2019t budged much, either. There are exceptions to this sales flatline trend, including last year when a burst of new iPhones sold.\nBut mostly, this is what smartphones are now: a wonderful and essential product that people don\u2019t buy very often, like fridges, cars and TV sets. In theory, our buying fewer phones should be bad for Apple. Instead, Apple has done great because it\u2019s extremely clever at making money and has persuaded customers that they should buy what it sells.\nApple has figured out ways to sell far more types of iPhones than it did before, including ultraexpensive ones. It has mastered underappreciated details likeself-designed computer chipsandnudges iPhone buyers to pay more for add-ons like extra space to stow photos. And the company keeps coming up with new ways to make money from stuff that makes iPhones more useful, including subscriptions for dating apps, AirPods headphones and computerized watches.\nThis isn\u2019t Apple shifting away from its identity as the iPhone company. It is leaning further into its iPhone dependence. I would say thatit will be tough for Apple to keep doing this, but smartphone sales have been meh for six years and Apple is doing great.\nNone of that completely explains Apple\u2019s march to $3 trillion. Money doesn\u2019t make sense right now, honestly. And the Big Tech companies typically churn out consistent and steadily increasing profits that stock buyers arewilling to pay for.\nThere\u2019s also enthusiasm about Apple launching its first products inface computersanddriverless carsthat could, like the iPhone did, make other companies follow its lead and make Apple even richer.\nApple\u2019s struggles with smart software \u2014 have you yelled at Siri recently for being clueless? \u2014 suggest that it won\u2019t be a cake walk for the company to keep winning in ametaverseand artificial intelligence future. That\u2019s not a prediction, though. I\u2019m done making Apple predictions.\nTaking the oomph out of Chinese innovation:The government\u2019s recent crackdown on tech companiesthreatens the creativity and drive that made China a tech powerhouse, my colleague Li Yuan writes in her latest column. \u201cIn place of the pride and ambition that dominated a few years ago, fear and gloom now rule,\u201d she says.\nThe prevalence of misinformation piped into people\u2019s ears:My colleague Stuart Thompson writes about an analysis of popular political podcasts that found that among the nearly 1,500 episodes released between the November 2020 election and the Capital riot the following January,about half contained false information about the election.\n\u201cIt kind of feels like you\u2019re hacking the communication cycle.\u201dPeople in charge of tech start-ups are gravitating to group sessions toimprove their empathy and emotional skills, Protocol reports. This cannot be a bad thing!\nThe beautiful sounds ofYo-Yo Ma wishing us a happy 2022.\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.

        "title": "Election Falsehoods Surged on Podcasts Before Capitol Riots, Researchers Find",
        "fulltext": "Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck outlined his prediction for how Election Day would unfold: President Donald J. Trump would be winning that night, but his lead would erode as dubious mail-in ballots arrived, giving Joseph R. Biden Jr. an unlikely edge.\n\u201cNo one will believe the outcome because they\u2019ve changed the way we\u2019re electing a president this time,\u201d he said.\nNone of the predictions of widespread voter fraud came true. But podcasters frequently advanced the false belief that the election was illegitimate, first as a trickle before the election and then as a tsunami in the weeks leading up to the violent attack at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to new research.\nResearchers at the Brookings Institution reviewed transcripts of nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular political podcasts. Among episodes released between the election and the Jan. 6 riot, about half contained election misinformation, according tothe analysis.\nIn some weeks, 60 percent of episodes mentioned the election fraud conspiracy theories tracked by Brookings. Those included false claims that software glitches interfered with the count, that fake ballots were used, and that voting machines run by Dominion Voting Systems were rigged to help Democrats. Those kinds of theories gained currency in Republican circles and would later be leveraged to justify additional election auditsacross the country.\nThe share of podcast episodes per week featuring election misinformation increased sharply after the election.\nNote: Among the most popular political talk show podcasts evaluated by Brookings, using a selection of keywords related to electoral fraud between Aug. 20, 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021.\nSource: The Brookings Institution\nThe New York Times\nThe new research underscores the extent to which podcasts have spread misinformation using platforms operated by Apple, Google, Spotify and others, often with little content moderation. While social media companies have beenwidely criticizedfor their role in spreading misinformation about the electionand Covid-19 vaccines, they have cracked down on both in the last year. Podcasts and the companies distributing them have been spared similar scrutiny, researchers say, in large part because podcasts are harder to analyze and review.\n\u201cPeople just have no sense of how bad this problem is on podcasts,\u201d said Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst at Brookings who co-wrote the report with Chris Meserole, a director of research at Brookings.\nDr. Wirtschafter downloaded and transcribed more than 30,000 podcast episodes deemed \u201ctalk shows,\u201d meaning they offered analysis and commentary rather than strictly news updates. Focusing on 1,490 episodes around the election from 20 popular shows, she created a dictionary of terms about election fraud. After transcribing the podcasts, a team of researchers searched for the keywords and manually checked each mention to determine if the speaker was supporting or denouncing the claims.\nIn the months leading up to the election, conservative podcasters focused mostly on the fear that mail-in ballots could lead to fraud, the analysis showed.\nAt the time, political analysts were busy warning of a \u201cred mirage\u201d: an early lead by Mr. Trump that could erode because mail-in ballots, which tend to get counted later, were expected to come from Democratic-leaning districts. As ballots were counted, that isprecisely what happened. But podcasters used the changing fortunes to raise doubts about the election\u2019s integrity.\nElection misinformation shot upward, with about 52 percent of episodes containing misinformation in the weeks after the election, up from about 6 percent of episodes before the election.\nThe biggest offender in Brookings\u2019s analysis was Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former adviser. His podcast, \u201cBannon\u2019s War Room,\u201d was flagged 115 times for episodes using voter fraud terms included in Brookings\u2019 analysis between the election and Jan. 6.\n\u201cYou know why they\u2019re going to steal this election?\u201d Mr. Bannon asked on Nov. 3. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to do anything about it.\u201d\nAs the Jan. 6 protest drew closer, his podcast pushed harder on those claims, including thefalse belief that poll workers handed out markers that would disqualify ballots.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re on, as they say, the point of attack,\u201d Mr. Bannon said the day before the protest. \u201cThe point of attack tomorrow. It\u2019s going to kick off. It\u2019s going to be very dramatic.\u201d\nMr. Bannon\u2019s show wasremoved from Spotifyin November 2020 after he discussedbeheading federal officials, but it remains available on Apple and Google.\nWhen reached for comment on Monday, Mr. Bannon said that President Biden was \u201can illegitimate occupant of the White House\u201d and referenced investigations into the election that show they \u201care decertifying his electors.\u201d Many legal expertshavearguedthere is no way to decertify the election.\nThe podcast by Stephen K. Bannon was flagged for election misinformation more than other podcasts tracked by the Brookings Institution.\nNote: Among the most popular political talk show podcasts evaluated by Brookings, using a selection of keywords related to electoral fraud between Aug. 20, 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021.\nSource: Brookings Institution\nBy The New York Times\nSean Hannity, the Fox News anchor, also ranked highly in the Brookings data. His podcast and radio program, \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show,\u201d is now the most popular radio talk show in America, reaching upward of15 million radio listeners, according to Talk Media.\n\u201cUnderage people voting, people that moved voting, people that never re-registered voting, dead people voting \u2014 we have it all chronicled,\u201d Mr. Hannity said during one episode.\nClaims about voter fraud came not just from Mr. Hannity but also his guests, including the pollster John McLaughlin, who shared a private exchange he had with Mr. Trump.\nIn the exchange, according to Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s on-air account, Mr. Trump said that the election was stolen.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said to the president. \u201cI said it yesterday on Hannity radio.\u201d\n\u201cKeep saying it,\u201d Mr. Trump replied.\nMr. McLaughlin went on to say during the podcast: \u201cThis election, easily, was stolen and these drop boxes and the Dominion Systems \u2014 their voting system \u2014 are definitely the culprits.\u201d\nClaims aboutDominion Voting Systemswere debunked andinternal Republican memosshowed officials in Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign knew the claims were false. Dominion laterfiled a number of lawsuitsagainst people and media companies who pushed the conspiracies.\nRepresentatives for Mr. Hannity, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Beck did not comment when reached about the findings.\nApple\u2019spodcast guidelinessay the company does not allow podcasts that \u201cmay lead to harmful or dangerous outcomes.\u201d Apple declined to comment.\nSpotify did not immediately comment on the research.\nThe lack of moderation on podcast apps is particularly complicated for Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. The video streaming sitecracked down onvideos about election fraud, theconspiracy theory QAnon, andvaccine misinformation, prompting some podcast episodes hosted there to be removed. But the same episodes remained accessible on Google\u2019s Podcasts app. Mr. Bannon\u2019s show was removed from YouTubeshortly after Jan. 6, for instance, but the podcast remains available on Google\u2019s Podcasts app.\nGoogle has argued that its Podcasts app more closely resembles a search engine than a publishing service because no audio is hosted by the company. A Google spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the app simply \u201ccrawls and indexes audio content\u201d hosted elsewhere and that they have \u201cpolicies against recommending podcasts that contain harmful misinformation, including misinformation about the 2020 U.S. elections.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Online Stars Are Mad at Apple",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nPeople who draw a crowd on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and other sites are increasingly asking their followers to pay to support them. We might do this for access to extras like personal chats or a newsletter from our favorite online personality, or for the good vibes from backing online work that we love.\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing that unites many of the people trying to make money from fan payments, it\u2019s irritation at Apple.\nYou might know that some app makers are angryover the fees that Apple collectsfrom some digital purchases in iPhone apps. If you buy extra lives in a video game app or subscribe to a dating service on your iPhone, Apple collects as much as 30 cents of each dollar that you spend.\nBut many people who earn income from their online work also pay these fees to Apple, indirectly.\nHere\u2019s one example: Let\u2019s say that you love thiscycling channel on YouTubeand click in your iPhone\u2019s YouTube app to become a member for $5 a month. Your money is split three ways. Apple gets $1.50. YouTube takes $1.05. The cycling channel receives $2.45, or less than half of what you think you\u2019re paying it.\nMany internet creators say that Apple doesn\u2019t deserve such a big chunk of their earnings for what they see as the company\u2019s marginal involvement in the relationship between creative online work and fans. And they say that Apple\u2019s fees \u2014 on top of those from sites like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 make creative pursuits, which are already difficult, even harder.\n\u201cIt is a ridiculous tax that they are taking for no reason,\u201d the online personality Hank Green said about Apple\u2019s fees.\nAn Apple spokesman told me that the fees on a small minority of what people do in apps are fair compensation for the company\u2019s role in the internet economy and for making it easy to pay for stuff from our phones. People also feel more confident paying with the credit card on file with Apple than with handing over account information to people on YouTube or Instagram.\nHe emphasized that Apple doesn\u2019t take a cut when people pay online personalities from a web browser or when people use virtual tip jars on apps such as Twitch.\nThis week, On Tech is focusing onthe economics for online creators, the people who are so good at entertaining or sharing information online that they make it a job. The tensions between creators and Apple are likely to only grow as fan payments become more prevalent, bothwithinpopularappsand from specialist subscription services likePatreon,OnlyFansandSubstack. (OnlyFans and Substack don\u2019t have apps. Patreon, a service for people to pay musicians, online personalities and podcasters, doesn\u2019t hand over fees from creators to Apple.)\nApple\u2019s fees may not be a huge burden to Green and other creators who earn a good living. But Rosie Nguyen, a co-founder of a service calledFanhousefor people to subscribe to video creators, said that payments to Apple can amount to months of rent or other expenses for the vast majority of people hustling to earn income from their online work.\nFanhousepicked a public fight with Applelast year to pressure the company to change its fees for creators. Nguyen, who goes by the name Jasmine Rice online, told me that her company tried to persuade Apple to waive its commissions ortake its cut from the 10 percent commissionthat Fanhouse collects from creators rather than the full amount that fans pay. Apple said no, Nguyen said, and gave Fanhouse a six-month grace period to pay the full fees.\nOne thing that I\u2019ve repeatedly heard from these online professionals is that Apple is standing in the way not only of creators\u2019 earnings but also of promising ideas.\nLi Jin, an investor in internet creator companies, said that she comes across business ideas that can\u2019t get off the ground because Apple\u2019s fees erode the profit potential.\n\u201cThere are many mouths to feed, and the cut of in-app revenue is really, really high,\u201d Jin said. (Shewrotemore about this topic last year.)\nThe internet economy and income potential for creators would be far smaller if Apple didn\u2019t help make smartphones the most popular computer in history. But we are now seeing the norms and financial systems established in the early days of digital life at times holding back the internet of 2022.\nTomorrow in On Tech: how one online personality makes money from digital work a zillion different ways.\nAnd in case you missed yesterday\u2019s edition: Online creators make the content that entertains and informs us, and they want toshare in the riches.\nMicrosoft made a lot of money,my colleague Karen Weise writes.Sales growth for the three months ending in Decemberwasn\u2019t quite at the bonkers level as most of 2021, but it was a lot.Stock prices of Big Tech companies have fallen substantially this month, but those tech giants are still very rich.\nA showdown over claims of manipulated product reviews:The online retailer Fashion Nova agreed to settle allegations that itheld back negative customer reviewsfrom its website, my colleague Sapna Maheshwari writes. (From On Tech in 2020:how bogus reviews hurt us and Amazon.)\nWatching TikTok videos of people tidying their homesis strangely comforting,says Jessica Grose in her New York Times Opinion parenting newsletter.\nAnorangutan driving a golf cart, set to the theme music of \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d (AndSnopes has more on that orangutan.)\nWe want to hear from you.
