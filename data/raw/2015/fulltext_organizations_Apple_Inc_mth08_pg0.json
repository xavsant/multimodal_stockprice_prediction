        "fulltext": "In June,a father of sixwas shot dead on a Monday afternoon in Evanston, Ill., a suburb 10 miles north of Chicago. The Evanston police believe that the victim, Ray C. Owens, had also been robbed. There were no witnesses to his killing, and no surveillance footage either.\nWith a killer on the loose and few leads at their disposal, investigators in Cook County, which includes Evanston, were encouraged when they found two smartphones alongside the body of the deceased: an iPhone 6 running on Apple\u2019s iOS 8 operating system, and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge running on Google\u2019s Android operating system. Both devices were passcode protected.\nAn Illinois state judge issued a warrant ordering Apple and Google to unlock the phones and share with authorities any data therein that could potentially solve the murder. Apple and Google replied, in essence, that they could not \u2014 because they did not know the user\u2019s passcode.\nThe homicide remains unsolved. The killer remains at large.\nUntil very recently, this situation would not have occurred.\nLast September, Apple and Google, whose operating systems are used in 96 percent of smartphones worldwide, announced that they had re-engineered their software with \u201cfull-disk\u201d encryption, and could no longer unlock their own products as a result.\nAccording to Apple\u2019swebsite: \u201cOn devices running iOS 8.0 \u2026 Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user\u2019s passcode, which Apple does not possess.\u201d\nA Google spokeswomansaid, \u201cKeys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.\u201d\nNow, on behalf of crime victims the world over, we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost.\nBetween October and June, 74 iPhones running the iOS 8 operating system could not be accessed by investigators for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office \u2014 despite judicial warrants to search the devices. The investigations that were disrupted include the attempted murder of three individuals, the repeated sexual abuse of a child, a continuing sex trafficking ring and numerous assaults and robberies.\nCriminal defendants have caught on. Recently, a suspect in a Manhattan felony, speaking on a recorded jailhouse call, noted that \u201cApple and Google came out with these softwares\u201d that the police cannot easily unlock.\nApple, Google and other proponents of full-disk encryption have offered several rationales for this new encryption technology. They haveportrayedthe new policy as a response to the concerns raised by Edward J. Snowden about data collection by the National Security Agency. They say full-disk encryption makes devices generally more secure from cybercrime. And they assert that, if the companies had master encryption keys, then repressive governments could exploit the keys.\nThese reasons should not be accepted at face value. The new Apple encryption would not have prevented the N.S.A.\u2019s mass collection of phone-call data or the interception of telecommunications, as revealed by Mr. Snowden. There is no evidence that it would address institutional data breaches or the use of malware. And we are not talking about violating civil liberties \u2014 we are talking about the ability to unlock phones pursuant to lawful, transparent judicial orders.\nIn the United States, Britain, France, Spain and other democratic societies, the legal system gives local law enforcement agencies access to places where criminals hide evidence, including their homes, car trunks, storage facilities, computers and digital networks.\nCarved into the bedrock of each of these laws is a balance between the privacy rights of individuals and the public safety rights of their communities. For our investigators to conduct searches in any of our jurisdictions, a local judge or commissioner must decide whether good cause exists. None of our agencies engage in bulk data collection or other secretive practices. We engage in targeted requests for information, authorized after an impartial, judicial determination of good cause, in which both proportionality and necessity are tested.\nIt is this workable balance that proscribes the operations of local law enforcement in our cities, and guides our residents in developing their expectations of privacy. But in the absence of laws that keep pace with technology, we have enabled two Silicon Valley technology companies to upset that balance fundamentally.\nThe Evanston case is just one example. In France, smartphone data was vital to the swift investigation of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January, and the deadly attack on a gas facility at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon, in June. And on a daily basis, our agencies rely on evidence lawfully retrieved from smartphones to fight sex crimes, child abuse, cybercrime, robberies or homicides.\nFull-disk encryption significantly limits our capacity to investigate these crimes and severely undermines our efficiency in the fight against terrorism. Why should we permit criminal activity to thrive in a medium unavailable to law enforcement? To investigate these cases without smartphone data is to proceed with one hand tied behind our backs.\nThe new encryption policies of Apple and Google have made it harder to protect people from crime. We support the privacy rights of individuals. But in the absence of cooperation from Apple and Google, regulators and lawmakers in our nations must now find an appropriate balance between the marginal benefits of full-disk encryption and the need for local law enforcement to solve and prosecute crimes. The safety of our communities depends on it.\n"

        "fulltext": "Apple Music, the company\u2019s new streaming service, attracted 11 million people for its trial period in a little more than a month, a top executive said.\nThe executive, Eddy Cue, gave the number inan interview with USA Todaypublished online late Wednesday, saying he was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the results.\nDifferent music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.\nApple Music was introduced on June 30 in more than 100 countries with a trial plan that gave each user three months of access free. After that period ends, the service will cost $10 a month. Of the 11 million sign-ups, two million are for family plans that will cost $15 a month and give access for up to six people, said Mr. Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services.\nIn an earnings call with investors last month, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said only that \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of people had signed up for the new service.\nThe meaning of Apple Music\u2019s numbers is already being debated in music industry circles. Its 11 million users immediately makes Apple Music a major destination for online music; Spotify, its biggest competitor as a subscription outlet, has 75 million users, 20 million of whom pay, and has been in operation for seven years.\nBut it remains to be seen how many of Apple Music\u2019s new users will continue after their trial periods end and pay for streaming music. That will not become clear until at least October, when the free access for Apple Music\u2019s first customers begins to expire."

I have to force the browser to quit to get away from them. Could my Mac be infected?\nA.Recent versions of Mac OS Xinclude built-in malware protectionlike file quarantine and plug-in blocking, and the system has incorporateda number of other safety features. Still, these defenses may not be enough to keep the Mac clear of evolving threats. While Windows users have traditionally been the primary target of malicious software, times have changed. Mac users should not assume their machines are impervious to spyware, viruses and other intrusive code \u2014 hacked web pages and malware programs written to specifically attack OS X are out there.\nIf you are seeing a lot of intrusive ads andfraudulent system alert messageswhen you browse the web, your Mac may have picked up a piece of unwanted software in your travels. Apple\u2019s site hasa guide to dealing with pop-ups and adwarethat hamper its Safari browser.\nThird-party security programscan also help protect your system, and the Mac App Store has a number of antivirus apps for OS X. If your main concern is adware and malware, free tools likeMalwarebytes Anti-Malware for MacandBitdefender Virus Scanner for Maccan catch a number of invasive programs.\nChanging Case in Microsoft Word\nQ.I occasionally hit the Caps Lock key by mistake and type away for minutes without noticing in Word 2010. Is there an easy way convert this all-caps section into standard upper- and lowercase characters without retyping?\nA.Most versions of Microsoft Word for Windows and Mac OS X include a Change Case command that flips the selected text into one of several styles. You can convert a chunk of text typed in all uppercase letters to sentence case, which capitalizes the first word of a sentence and lowercases the rest. (You may have to go back to capitalize proper nouns, though.) The Change Case command can also switch a selected block of lowercase letters to uppercase or capitalize each word in a highlighted section.\nTouse the Change Case commandin Word 2010 for Windows, select the text you want to convert. Then click the Change Case button on the Ribbon\u2019s Home tab; the button\u2019s icon looks like an uppercase and lowercase letter A side by side.\nYou can also get to the Change Case command with a Windows keyboard shortcut. When you have selected the text you want to convert, press the Shift and F3 keys to cycle through all the case options, and stop on the one you want.\nThe Change Case command works the same way in Word 2013 and Word 2016 for Windows, but may vary within earlier versions of Microsoft Word. In some versions of Word for Mac OS X, the Change Case command can be found under the Format menu; to use the keyboard shortcut, press Option-Command-C, which will cycle through the case styles."

And like last week, tech stocks were not immune\n                                        from the market\u2019s plunge.\nPerhaps this is the upside: It could have been worse.\nWhen the markets first opened on Monday, even Apple \u2014 the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization \u2014 was down about 10 percent. Butan email from Tim Cook,\n                                        the company\u2019s chief executive, hailing the company\u2019s sales in China helped push the stock higher, at one point back to positive territory. Eventually, the shine of the email wore off and Apple shares\n                                        ended down 2.5 percent. On a day immediately named \u201cBlack Monday\u201d by local commentators in China, where the markets were hit particularly hard, falling 2.5 percent didn\u2019t seem bad at all.\nCompanies the size of Apple have some tools at their disposal to combat a down market.

The weaker companies, those burning quickly through their\n                                        stockpile of investor money, could find it hard to replenish that money.\nIn other words, if the market doesn\u2019t start to turn around soon, all the giant fund-raising rounds may be in limbo \u2014 as well as the life of some of today\u2019s start-ups."

The service will live inside Facebook Messenger, the company\u2019s popular communication app used by more than 700 million people; users text or dictate questions to M, which can respond accordingly\n                                        and, in some cases, offer items to purchase or recommend places to go.\nFacebook\u2019s service arrives in the increasingly crowded \u2014 though still nascent \u2014 field of digital assistants, each with a different spin on how customers interact with the services they offer. Siri,\n                                        Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant, is integrated into the iPhone and responds to verbal commands and requests.

Facebook\u2019s approach is a\n                                        hybrid of the two, using algorithms as well as paid employees to train M into delivering more intelligent results.\nFor now, M is available only to a small test group of people.

        "fulltext": "Our editorial this morning calling on the Federal Communications Commission tomake it easier for people to buy their own cable boxesattracted hundreds of comments from readers. Not surprisingly, most of the people writing in were unhappy with cable and satellite companies, which generate nearly $20 billion in revenue from renting out boxes to\n                                        their customers.\n\u201cThe cost of cable is preposterous and reaches levels of usury,\u201d a reader from Massachusetts who goes by the username chickenloverwrote on The Timeswebsite. \u201cBut what makes it worse is that the quality of service is abominable. The rent charged by cable companies is akin to the goose that keeps on laying the golden egg. It is time to kill the golden\n                                        goose.\u201d\nBut some tech-savvy readers seemed baffled that so many Americans were still paying to rent their cable boxes since companies like TiVo sell set-top boxes directly to consumers. Consumers who chose to do this still\n                                        have to rent an electronic card from their cable companies and many people complain that it\u2019s hard to use them.\nPete from West Hartfordwrotethat he owns his cable box and found it easy to activate the device\n                                        with his cable company. \u201cAnd I returned the rental with no problem. Am puzzled that others find this difficult.\u201d\nSeveral readers writing on Facebook pointed out that TiVo also charges a monthly fee for the use of its boxes. This makes that company\u2019s devices less appealing to people looking to save money. These readers also\n                                        said that they often couldn\u2019t access the video-on-demand services offered by their cable companies through TiVo boxes.\n\u201cVerizon charges nearly $10/mo for a CableCard, which costs only $10 to purchase from Motorola,\u201d Michael Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n                                        \u201cThey deliberately make it hard to even use TiVO, and ensure TiVO like boxes are not cost competitive. Set-top box tech should be left to tech companies, like the shift from phones being carrier-driven to\n                                        tech company-driven. We wouldn\u2019t have to suffer the horrible UIs that lag 10 years in design. I would buy a better set-top box from Apple or Samsung in a second if Verizon didn\u2019t interfere.\u201d\nOther readers said they have gone much further and stopped subscribing to cable TV altogether. Some of them rely on high-definition antennae to watch local broadcast-TV stations and devices like Roku that let users\n                                        watch TV shows and movies from Netflix and Hulu on their televisions.\n\u201cI got a Roku 5 years ago and never looked back,\u201d Alison Jacobswrote on Facebook.\n                                        \u201cA couple subscriptions to online streaming services like Hulu and Netflix, and a little patience, take care of all the watching needs. Most of my generation doesn\u2019t even get channel surfing, we watch\n                                        what we want when we want, cable who?\u201d\nAnother thread of complaints had to do with how energy inefficient traditional set-top boxes are compared to other home appliances. Christopher from Mayowrote thatthe editorial had completely missed the point: \u201cThis article doesn\u2019t mention the most important part of the larger story: Cable boxes use obscene amounts of energy!\u201d\nReaders can also tell the F.C.C. what they think. The commission isseeking public commentson a report on cable boxes produced\n                                        by a panel of experts advising the agency."

        "fulltext": "Free Windows is proving to be a very attractive price indeed. Seventy-five million users have downloaded Windows 10 to their personal computers and tablets in the first month of its release, Microsoft announced on Wednesday.\nThe Windows 10 adoption rate came as point No. 1 ina top 10 list tweeted by Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft\u2019s senior vice\n                                        president in charge of Windows.\nAmong his other Windows 10 bragging points:\nThe goal of Windows 10 for free, of course, was to try to jump-start the old Microsoft magic of building a flywheel of rising numbers of users and developers around its operating system platform. That was once so easy,\n                                        but has become more difficult as user and developer interest has shifted to other platforms, namely Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS.\nSo the early audience-building of both users and developers is crucial for Microsoft, and the early results look encouraging. It took the previous version of the operating system, Windows 8, released in October 2012,\n                                        six months to reach 100 million licensees. (And license counts don\u2019t necessarily mean users, since its big corporate licenses are bulk subscriptions, whether the software is installed or not.)\nDespite the encouraging early returns, Microsoft still has the challenge of not having a real presence in the critical smartphone market, unlike Google and Apple. But the fast adoption out of the gate does show Microsoft\n                                        is in step with the new economic reality of platform software for consumers.

There are nearly 140 million consumers worldwide, IDC estimates, who had installed Windows 8.\n\u201cWe expected a steep trajectory of adoption for Windows 10, but this is a really good first step,\u201d Mr. Gillen said. \u201cMicrosoft needs this first proof point to attract developers, to show them there\u2019s\n                                        a market out there.\u201d\nWhile the 75 million users is a healthy first-month number, Mr. Mehdi said in a midday interview that the daily user-satisfaction rating is the measurement he follows most closely rather than total download volume.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the user experience that will drive adoption over time,\u201d he said.\nThe daily satisfaction score, Mr. Mehdi said, is a composite of 1-to-5 ratings on online surveys, tracking the use of features like Cortana or the app store, monitoring social network comments for sentiment and aggregating\n                                        customer-service inquiries.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good success so far,\u201d Mr. Mehdi said, \u201cbut we have lot more work to do.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in print on 08/27/2015, on pageB9of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Free Windows 10 Is Downloaded 75 Million Times ."

        "title": "A Stock Market Rout in a Month That Hedge Funds Would Sooner Forget",
        "fulltext": "From his getaway cabin deep in the woods, an experienced adviser to wealthy hedge fund investors was hopping from one conference call to another to manage clients\u2019 mounting anxiety.\nSimilarly, a broker described how he had interrupted his vacation to respond to the needs of his nervous clients. And a multibillion-dollar hedge fund said numerous investors had requested play-by-play commentary and performance figures.\nThe sudden and rapid sell-off across global markets that began late last week and deepened on Monday has caught many on Wall Street off guard, interrupting the vacation plans of richly compensated money managers \u2014 especially those at some of the nation\u2019s biggest hedge funds, where losses over the last few days have been especially steep.\nThe ferocity of Monday\u2019s selling \u2014 in particular a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of nearly 1,000 points in the first minutes of trading \u2014 was attributed to a number of events, from the forced sales of stocks bought on credit \u2014 known as margin calls \u2014 to economic woes in China and looming rate increases in the United States.\nBut by the end of Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closing down 77.68 points, or 3.9 percent, there was still no clear reason for the plunge and not many big money managers were willing to stick their necks out and speak publicly. Even those who spoke privately to investors were few. \u201cI think they don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said one investor, who did not want to be quoted for fear of angering some managers.\nWhat is clear, however, is that the numbers rolling in for August from the hedge fund industry do not look good. Hedge funds went into the sell-off bullish, with $1.5 trillion in long positions \u2014 bets that stocks will rise in price \u2014 compared with $684 billion in short positions, bets that stocks will decline in price, according to an analysis of the industry by Goldman Sachs.\nThe 10 stocks that Goldman said were the most widely held by hedge funds \u2014 stocks like Apple, Citigroup, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 were down from 5 to 10 percent over the last three trading days.\nA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.\nLeon G. Cooperman, founder of the $9 billion hedge fund Omega Advisors and a longtime market bull, is emerging as a big loser in the chaos. As of Friday, his fund was said to have lost 11 percent this month, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cooperman did not return a call seeking comment.\nThe firm was hit hard by big declines in the share prices of Allergan, AerCap, Citigroup and the American International Group \u2014 four of Omega\u2019s top stock holdings, according to regulatory filings.\nOne hedge fund manager who invests mainly in United States stocks, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he would not be surprised if the average fund lost from 3 to 7 percent in August. He said the past week had been brutal and the losses had come far faster than most would have anticipated. Several managers described frenzied selling when the markets opened on Monday morning.\nEven the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Ray Dalio, was not spared. The $162 billion firm told investors on Friday that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.7 percent for the month. Going into August, the Pure Alpha portfolio had been up 11.8 percent for the year.\nBridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.\nBefore the full extent of the sell-off on Wall Street was known, Goldman had already predicted that the hedge fund industry would once again underperform the broader S.&P. 500, which, at Monday\u2019s close, was down 8.1 percent for the year. The Dow lost 588 points, or 3.6 percent. The average hedge fund has underperformed the broader market for six consecutive years, according to the research firm HFR.\nThe warning signs for the latest global market rout appeared as far back as June, when China\u2019s stock market took a plunge and regulators intervened. \u201cThis is really a story about China and emerging markets. Emerging market currencies are off by between 10 and 20 percent over the past two months,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.\n\u201cThose who were short commodities, emerging market currencies or Chinese equities are clearly the winners here,\u201d he said, adding that after the most recent turmoil anyone who made bets against any stocks around the world would be winners, too.\nBut after six years of a bull market run in which American stocks have hit one record after another, few hedge fund managers have been brave enough to short stocks with much conviction. To take a short position, a trader sells borrowed stock in a company that he or she thinks is overvalued in anticipation of buying it back at a cheap price.\nYet, while the headlines on Monday were stark \u2014 analysts in China and the United States were calling it Black Monday \u2014 the sell-off was not as bad for some hedge funds that had short positions. The past week was a good time for money managers betting on stock declines.\nExpress Scripts Holding, for example, which was flagged by Goldman Sachs as one of the most heavily shorted stocks, has shed 6.8 percent in the last three trading days. Exxon Mobil, another favorite short, was down 10 percent over the same period, in lock step with the price of oil dropping below $40 a barrel.\nKerrisdale Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York, sent a \u201cflash estimate\u201d on Monday morning to let investors know that the fund would be down 2 percent for August, according to one investor. The hedge fund, which has a short bet against the satellite company Globalstar, was up around 10 percent for the year heading into August, the investor said.\nHedge funds that scoop up distressed assets at bottomed-out prices also began to eye opportunities. \u201cWhat I have told investors is the economy is fine but now is a great time to be buying some things when they get hit,\u201d said Marc Lasry, a co-founder of the $13.9 billion hedge fund Avenue Capital Group.\n\u201cOther people may be having issues,\u201d Mr. Lasry said. \u201cFor us, that is an opportunity as opposed to a problem.\u201d"
