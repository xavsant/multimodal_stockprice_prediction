        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 Amid the opacity of China\u2019s social systems, the clich\u00e9s can sometimes pile up: Game of smoke and mirrors. Wild-goose chase. Stumbling block.\nA recent high-profilecourt caseinvolving Apple and a Chinese company, Xintong Tiandi, which sells leather goods under the iPhone trademark, involved all of those.\nHere\u2019s a summary: On March 31 the Beijing Higher People\u2019s Court upheld earlier rulings by a lower court and China\u2019s trademark arbitration board that Xintong Tiandi had the right to use \u201ciPhone\u201d for products in Class 18 of the international trademarkclassificationsystem, since Xintong Tiandi acquired the trademark in 2007 when the iPhone name was \u201cnot renowned\u201d in China, the courtruled. Apple has the rights in Class 9, which covers computers and smartphones. Class 18 covers leather goods.\nHere\u2019s the smoke and mirrors: Xintong Tiandi didn\u2019t exist in 2007. A Russian company acquired the rights then and Xintong Tiandi bought the rights from it in 2011, the Chinese company\u2019s lawyer, Xiong Zhi, said in a telephone interview. Public company filings show that Xintong Tiandi was set up in 2011.\nIt may matter, because iPhones went on sale in China in 2009 amid frenzied scenes. By 2011, it was the smartphone of choice for China\u2019s smart set, and arguably \u201crenowned\u201d in China. The purchase date of the trademark raised questions about the good faith of the Chinese company, some lawyers said.\n\u201cIt is a moral argument,\u201d Matthew Dresden, a lawyer with Harris Moure in Seattle who specializes in Chinese intellectual property law, said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cBut the company that filed for it in 2007 must have known what they were doing then, too,\u201d Mr. Dresden added.\nStill, the issue of intent and when Xintong Tiandi acquired the trademark may not affect the ultimate outcome of the case, Mr. Dresden said. Apple has said it will appeal to the Supreme People\u2019s Court.\nWhatever rights the Russian company had or didn\u2019t have are what Xintong Tiandi bought, Mr. Dresden said. \u201cFor better or worse that\u2019s what they purchased,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the logic of how the Chinese trademark system works, it makes sense that it should be viewed as what was the state of the world at the time that it was filed.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see this as the Chinese court being biased; I see it as them enforcing the trademark law as it is currently implemented,\u201d Mr. Dresden wrote later in an email.\nHere\u2019s the wild-goose chase: Calls to the Beijing Higher People\u2019s Court seeking clarification on the ruling went unanswered over the course of a recent afternoon, and no fax number could be located for the court.\nA person answering the telephone at the media office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board that first ruled in favor of Xintong Tiandi in the case in 2013, berated a reporter who said she was from The New York Times: \u201cWhat question do you have? Can you speak?\u201d When the reporter said she had been unable to send a fax to the office, the man said: \u201cI only heard the fax machine beeping; how would I know who that was from and what it was about?\u201d\nWhen the reporter said she may file a complaint for rudeness, he replied: \u201cYou said you want to file a complaint, go file a complaint!\u201d The man hung up without giving his name.\nMr. Xiong, Xintong Tiandi\u2019s lawyer, explained the omission of the Russian ownership detail thus: The court was not obliged to recap the entire history of the case in the ruling.\nHe rejected what he said were unfair remarks by \u201csome foreign media\u201d that the court\u2019s decision showed the Chinese judicial system was not to be trusted. \u201cFairness cannot be judged based on whether one has won or lost, but should be based on whether there are problems in the procedures,\u201d Mr. Xiong said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Xintong Tiandi has clashed with Apple over trademarks. Apple had \u201cprevailed in several other cases against Xintong\u201d for similar issues, Carolyn Wu, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nMr. Dresden\u2019s conclusion is robust: Companies need to do moreto protect themselvesin China, even buying the trademark rights for all 45 classes.\nWhether that\u2019s a stumbling block or a solution, readers can decide."

        "title": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up",
        "fulltext": "With this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.\nThat may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.\nMr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\nSo value investors took notice when Mr. Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway,disclosed it had invested$1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201d\nValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.\nToday there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probablynow considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they haven\u2019t already.\nApple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201d\nMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201d\nAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.\nThat\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.\nAs a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)\nThis week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.\nIf Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.\nShould growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.\nSome prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)\nThat means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\n\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\n\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.\nThat means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.\nTech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.\nFor an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\n\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201d\nMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\n\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\n\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201d\nFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.\nBut Apple still has defenders among growth investors.\nAt the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\n\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201d\nHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.\nMr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.\nAt some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.\nAll of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.\nStill, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.\nThat\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)\nFor those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.\nBerkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\n\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201d"

Apple is attempting to reinvigorate flagging iPhone sales in China, the company\u2019s second-largest market, and just last monthApple shutteredits iBooks and iTunes movie stores in the country.\n\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said in a statement. \u201cWe are extremely impressed by the business they\u2019ve built and their excellent leadership team, and we look forward to supporting them as they grow.\u201d\nApple\u2019s sales have encountered a sharp slowdown in China. The company reported sales of $12.5 billion in Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, in its most recent fiscal quarter. That was down 26 percent from the previous year.\nIt had an operating profit of $4.8 billion from the region in the quarter, down 28 percent from the previous year.\nApple has been working on its own secretcar project,which one independent analyst, Neil Cybart, said on Wednesday had accounted for much of the billions of dollars in research and development spending by the company.\nApple certainly has the money to spare. As of March 26, the company said it had nearly $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nAn Apple spokeswoman referred back to Mr. Cook\u2019s statement and did not add anything further. Uber declined to comment.\n\u201cThe first time we met with Mr. Cook, we shared with him a joke,\u201d said Jean Liu, Didi\u2019s president, in a conference call with reporters on Thursday evening. \u201cOur company\u2019s legal name is called little orange. We figured a company named after a fruit could always achieve something big.\u201d\nFour years old, Didi Chuxing is China\u2019s pre-eminent ride-hailing service and a major competitor to Uber, an American company that is spending millions to make inroads into the Chinese market.\nDidi serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities, according to the company.\n\u201cThe endorsement from Apple is an enormous encouragement and inspiration for our four-year-old company,\u201d Cheng Wei, founder and chief executive of Didi, said in a statement.\n\u201cDidi will work hard with our drivers, riders and global partners, to make available to every citizen flexible and reliable mobility choices, and help cities solve transportation, environmental and employment challenges.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 In China, an iPhone can be found for a small fraction of the official price. It just might not be a phone.\nA Chinese company has won the right to sell its leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal back-and-forth with Apple, according toan articlein Chinese state news media. The case is yet another that centers on names that are well established in much of the world but that have had to fight for control in China, such as the basketball star Michael Jordan and the shoe brand New Balance.\nThe Chinese company, Xintong Tiandi, applied for the iPhone trademark in China just after thefirst Applesmartphones came out, in 2007, according to an article by the state-run Legal Daily last week. Still, Xintong Tiandi\u2019s trademark in China, for leather goods, was approved before Apple\u2019s, which had applied for the rights in 2002, the article said.\nThe website of Xintong Tiandi features a range of leather products, including pen cases, passport holders, handbags and wallets, all stamped with \u201ciPhone.\u201d None of the products are phones. Ina news releaseissued last week, the company also featured photographs of its other products, like a leather iPad case labeled \u201ciphone\u201d next to a bottle of R\u00e9my Martin Cognac.\nIn the news release, the Chinese company said that the \u201chuge victory brings esteem to Xintong Tiandi\u2019s promise to protect the iPhone trademark,\u201d before adding that it was willing to work with the American technology giant.\nThe sentiment may not be shared, however. \u201cApple is disappointed the Beijing Higher People\u2019s Court chose to allow Xintong to use the iPhone mark for leather goods when we have prevailed in several other cases against Xintong,\u201d the Silicon Valley company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe intend to request a retrial with the Supreme People\u2019s Court and will continue to vigorously protect our trademark rights.\u201d\nWhile the Chinese company\u2019s approach might be perplexing, it testifies to the power of Apple\u2019s name recognition in the country. The iPhone brand signals middle- or even upper-class status in China, and many are expected to be willing to pay for a passport cover or other item labeled with the Apple product\u2019s name as a way to show that they have made it.\nThe iPhone ruling, in a high court in the Beijing municipality, is just one of a spate of high-profile trademark and piracy cases in China. The country\u2019s huge number of factories, bolstered by a 100 million-strong class of migrant workers, has made China the workshop of the world, able, among other activities, to quickly pump out products that can make a company a quick profit on the impulse to imitate.\nAiding them is a first-to-file trademark system that lets \u201cunrelated third parties register trademarks which are copies or imitations of well-known brands,\u201d according to apostlast year from law firm DLA Piper.\nAmong other high-profile cases, Michael Jordanlost the rightsto the name he is known by in China, and New Balancepaid$16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the Chinese name for the company, which a person had trademarked.\nApple had previously faced a similar situation with the iPad. In 2012, the company wasforced to pay $60 millionfor the rights to use the iPad trademark in China. Apple had bought the rights to the name in a number of countries, but after iPad tablet sales took off in China, a Chinese company said it had not secured the rights in that country.\nThe case caps a tough couple of weeks for Apple. Last month, the company\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks stores in China wereordered shutby a national regulator. The company also reported last week that sales in China had dropped, as itstruggles to keepthe loyalty and admiration of fickle Chinese consumers."
