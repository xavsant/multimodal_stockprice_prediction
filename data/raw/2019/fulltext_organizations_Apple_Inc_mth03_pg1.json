        "title": "Are You an Amazon or anAppleFamily?",
        "fulltext": "A few months ago, Amazon invited reporters to itsSpheres complexin downtown Seattle. It\u2019s an enormous greenhouse doubling as a work space for employees: a climate-controlled, glass-enclosed, self-contained ecosystem made up of 40,000 species of plants from all over the world. Amazon executives openedthe eventwith a statement worthy of their surroundings: The company had 70 products, services and tools to introduce.Seventy new products?The journalists in the room responded with gasps and laughter.\nThere were new devices like the Echo subwoofer and a tiny gadget to bring Alexa into your car. A smart plug that automatically connects to Wi-Fi and will make any smart appliance respond to your spoken commands. Amazon\u2019s voice-operating system, Alexa, had been upgraded with a ton of new features. At the tail end of the event was something both mundane and marvelous. Situated between the staghorn ferns and tiny begonias was anAlexa-powered microwave oventhat will take the fuss out of having to push buttons to pop a bag of popcorn.\nFrom my vantage point, that Alexa-powered microwave was arguably one of the most important announcements Amazon has made in the past few years. It was clear that Amazon was now using artificial intelligence to slowly transform our homes into data generation machines as we, and our daily activities, are continuously mined, refined and productized.\nAmazon isn\u2019t the only company seeking to become the operating system for everyday life. Apple and Google also offer smart speakers and are partnering with appliance manufacturers.Apple has opened up its HomeKit requirements to make it easier for manufacturers and developers to incorporate its digital assistant, Siri. Google has spent the past year aggressively pushing its connected home assistant.\nApple and Google also make our phones, store our photos and run our app stores. Apple just announced a newcredit card paired with the iPhone. Google is making home alarm systems. Amazon is getting into the health care business. Both Amazon and Google areexpanding into the electricity business, too, as they partner with utilities and deploy home energy management services.\nWhat this means is that sometime in the next decade, all the start-ups and hardware manufacturers and the rest of the A.I. ecosystem will converge around just a few systems. All of us will have to accept a new order and pledge our allegiance to one of the few companies that now act as the operating systems for everyday life.\nOnce your data, gadgets, appliances, cars and services are entangled, you\u2019ll be locked in to Amazon, Google or Apple. As you buy more stuff \u2014 mobile phones, connected refrigerators, smart earbuds \u2014 you\u2019ll find that not only are your devices not compatible with other systems, you and your family aren\u2019t either.\nThis will create a de facto system of segregation, the beginnings of which we\u2019re already seeing. One in 10 Americans received an Apple, Google or Amazon smart speaker during the 2018 holiday season, according toa report by NPR and Edison Research. However, those speakers, and all the peripherals sold with them, can\u2019t be easily used across different operating systems.\nUsers of iPhones have enhanced functionality when using an Apple HomePod, whiletheywon\u2019t work at all with an Android phone. (Android is made by Google.) Amazon\u2019s clever Smart Plugs will connect your desk lamp to Alexa, but they won\u2019t talk to Google Home.\nAll those devices give us access to bundled entertainment packages and shopping platforms, whichrely onour personal and behavioral data. Because our data are managed by one of these companies \u2014 companies that also sold us all the A.I.-powered stuff in our homes \u2014 we are unwittingly choosing our tribes. Without realizing it, you are already a Google family or an Apple family or an Amazon family.\nWhat does that designation imply for the coming years?\nApple\u2019s products tend to be the priciest, but they also come with the fewest glitches, viruses and bugs. As a result, they are attractive to people with little technical knowledge and a lot of disposable income. Apple\u2019s future smart glasses, smart toilets and custom refrigerators might carry on the company\u2019s long tradition of expensive devices anyone can use right out of the box. The families, wherever they call home, will be living a life optimized by a handful of developers in Cupertino.\nGoogle\u2019s current egalitarian approach to tech could shift to a future tiered system of access and permissions. Families who can afford the upgrade fees and have enough tech savvy could manually unlock their systems and connect to a greater variety of devices, such as coffee makers, 3-D printers and outdoor irrigation systems. But a lower-income tier might offer families access in exchange for advertising. Those families would have a small selection of devices and appliances available, and they would come with restrictions and limited data protections.\nSince 2017, Amazon has partnered with Lennar, the largest residential construction company in the United States,to install Alexain its houses, andthere are Amazon homes all over the country: in Sarasota, Fla., in Bucks County, Pa., in Howard County, Md., and in Fresno, Calif. Even in the quiet, blue-collar neighborhood where I grew up in Northwest Indiana, there is now a cluster of Amazon homes that come with smart speakers, door locks and e-keys, video doorbells and thermostats.\nAmazon homes come with built-in neighborhood surveillance: Families type in the name of their community to see security camera footage from their neighbors. So it is conceivable that Amazon might one day build smart homes full of its own appliances \u2014 not just microwaves \u2014 that connect to the Amazon platform.\nBy choosing Google, Apple or Amazon today, you are also aligning your family values with the values of one of the big tech giants. And soon, you mayhaveto choose \u2014 making just one of these companies a custodian of all your family\u2019s data. The unintended consequence of this kind of home automation could be a digital caste system that\u2019s much more daunting than the prospect of making microwave popcorn the old-fashioned way.\nAmy Webb is the author of \u201cThe Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "How to Use Emojis",
        "fulltext": "\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to be angry online,\u201d says Jennifer Daniel, the creative director ofemojisat Google. \u201cEmojis give you permission to be gentler.\u201d In a study involving nearly four million users in 212 countries, the most commonly used emojis were related to faces, hearts and hands. The most popular emoji is \ud83d\ude02, and in 2017 the \u2764\ufe0femoji appeared more than 14 billion times in Instagram comments. When people communicate in short bits of text, they lose the physical signals that suggest warmth and connection. Emojis can help fill that void. Say a friend texts to say he or she is running late: Instead of shooting back an ambiguous \u201cO.K.,\u201d if you\u2019re not angry, add something like a \ud83d\ude18to reinforce your affection despite the tardiness.\nThere aren\u2019t right or wrong ways to use emojis. Most people use the icons as a form of gesticulation, like jazz hands (\u201cHappy birthday \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd42\u2764\ufe0f\u201d). Add nuance. Take note if you\u2019re using just 20 or so well-worn emojis and remember that there are more than 3,000. \u201cExplore the inventory,\u201d Daniel says. If you think the lexicon is missing something, propose a new emoji to the Unicode Consortium, which is responsible for the global standardizing of emoji characters (Daniel serves on the organization\u2019s emoji subcommittee).\nRemember that emojis don\u2019t have set meaning, grammar or syntax; they consist mostly of nouns, including \ud83e\udd94and \ud83e\udd69. Still, collectively, we are giving these little pictures semantics as we go, which can happen on a macro scale \u2014 as when \ud83d\udc10the becomes a stand in for the acronym GOAT (\u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), or when Apple changed its \ud83c\udf51to look less butt-like in 2016, angering many users who deployed it anatomically and not as a stone fruit (the company quickly retreated). Let emojis be the building blocks of secret, intimate languages. Daniel has a friend who will text \ud83e\udd38\ud83d\udd73\ufe0fto mean a nervous breakdown; Daniel\u2019s husband knows that if she sends him a \ud83c\udf35, it means she\u2019s on her period and in a bad mood. Researchers studying street gangs on Twitter found they often used the gas pump, \u26fd, as a stand-in for marijuana. Free yourself psycholinguistically. \u201cI love how children use emojis where it\u2019s just like unicorn, unicorn, unicorn, heart, frog, frog,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cAnd that is how they\u2019re telling their dad that they love him.\u201d"

        "title": "Trump\u2019s Big Tech Bluster",
        "fulltext": "At his Senate confirmation hearing, Attorney General William Barr signaled an interest in confronting the power of big tech corporations like Facebook and Google. AsMr. Barrput it, a lot \u201cof people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.\u201d And since taking office, President Trump has repeatedly attacked America\u2019s biggest technology corporations, especially Amazon, Facebook and Google. Among other accusations, he has charged Amazon withripping offthe Post Office andGooglewithcensoring conservative users. He recently criticizedFacebook, Google and Twitterfor \u201cridiculous\u201d bias in favor of Democrats. By most appearances, Mr. Trump is a foe of big tech.\nMr. Barr, however, will find that those \u201chuge behemoths\u201d will continue to dominate, because, in part, the administration\u2019s chief antitrust enforcer is their champion. On top of granting tech platforms huge windfalls inhis tax reform law, Mr. Trump appointed a friend of big tech, Makan Delrahim, to lead the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim has consistently promoted the interests of the biggest tech companies.\nWhilewe believeMr. Delrahim, a veteran corporate defense lawyer and antitrust official in the George W. Bush administration, was correct on the merits in trying to stop the AT&T/Time Warner merger,that actionwas an outlier. In a Senate hearing in December, heboastedthat he \u201cstrengthened\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s amicus brief program as a means of reshaping antitrust law. In its briefs, which represent the views of the federal government as an expert in antitrust law and are influential in court, the department has supported legal interpretations that would make Amazon, Google, Facebook and other dominant firms more powerful. On top of looking into possible procedural improprieties between the president and Mr. Delrahim, Congress should demand an explanation for \u2014 and put a stop to \u2014 Mr. Delrahim\u2019s under-the-radar effort to revise antitrust law.\nIn the most prominent case, Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide, any day now, whether ordinary Americans can hold tech platforms accountable. The Antitrust Divisionfiledbriefssiding with Apple. (Our organization, the Open Markets Institute, filed anamicus briefin support of Pepper.) In its briefs, the Justice Department argued that iPhone users should not be able to sue Apple for monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps. Although thetextof federal law grants everyone (consumers, workers and businesses) the right to sue antitrust violators for damages, the Justice Department is seeking to restrict private citizens\u2019 ability to hold corporate power to account. In contrast, a bipartisan coalition of31 statesfiled a brief endorsing the right of all consumers to obtain compensation and be made whole.\nThe Justice Department took an even more radically pro-monopolist position in a lower court case. In Viamedia v. Comcast, the Seventh Circuit in Chicago is now deciding whether Comcast, which both operates and competes in the clearinghouse for TV advertisements in Chicago and Detroit, illegally monopolized this clearinghouse when it blocked Viamedia, an ad management company. Through such \u201crefusals to deal,\u201d monopolists can suppress emerging competition or extend their dominance into new markets.\nThe government advised the court to adopt the 2013 ruling byJudge Neil Gorsuch, then on the 10th Circuit,in Novell v. Microsoft, which broadly insulates a monopolist from the charge that it improperly cut off rivals\u2019 access to a good or service they need to compete. Under Novell, if someone sues a monopolist for refusing to deal with competitors, the conduct is illegal only if the monopolist \u201csacrificed profits\u201d in the process and that its sole effect was to hurt competition. This standard would make stopping \u201crefusals to deal\u201d virtually impossible.\nThe Antitrust Division\u2019s position in Viamedia is especially helpful to Google and Facebook, whose core services are free to users. Consider Facebook\u2019s 2013 decision to cut off users\u2019 friend lists fromVine, a video streaming app launched by Twitter. Thanks to Facebook\u2019s move, users of Vine could not invite friends to join the app. Under the standard endorsed by the Justice Department, Facebook would be protected from legal liability for stifling Vine unless an antitrust enforcer could show that Facebook sacrificed profits in this predatory act. Because Facebook does not charge users, this would be a tall order for the government, excluded rivals and injured consumers.\nAlong with these pro-monopoly briefs, the Antitrust Division\u2019s leadership has publicly expressed almost uncritical admiration for technology giants. Disregarding bothcongressional intentin enacting the antitrust laws and the latest evidence on theeconomicandpoliticalharms from corporate concentration, our top antimonopoly enforcers have been fawning over monopoly.\nMr. Delrahim and his deputies routinely praise the biggest tech companies and adopt their legal rationalizations. In a speech in Mexico City in November,heasserted on thebasis of little evidencethat \u201cmarket power is a motivating factor for investment in a free-market economy\u201d and disparaged rules to protect competitive markets as akin to \u201cbreaking a man\u2019s leg to make him run faster.\u201d Mr. Delrahimrecently hypothesizedthat \u201clarge digital platforms have grown because they provide innovative anddisruptiveservices that consumers seem to like and want to use\u201d andexpressed nationalistic pridein the dominant tech platforms being American. Contrary to these claims, however, actions by theEuropean Commissionand documents published byBritain\u2019s Parliamentindicate that the tech platforms have used abusive practices to maintain and extend their power.\nIn December,Andrew Finch, the Antitrust Division\u2019s principal deputy assistant attorney general, contended that \u201cconsumers often benefit from concentration\u201d and dismissed calls to break up or regulate tech platforms as \u201cdrastic.\u201d\nThe division dresses up its actions in the rhetoric of humility. In a June 2018 address,Barry Nigro, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division, said that when enforcing antitrust law, \u201cFirst, we should do no harm,\u201d and warned, \u201cwe should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward.\u201d\nYet, as the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust enforcers proclaim humility and practice restraint when it comes to monopolies, they do not extend this courtesy to elected officials. Cities and states seeking to structure markets through the democratic process can expect hectoring, not humility, from the department.\nThe Justice Department has, to the benefit of Uber and Lyft, interfered with municipal efforts to improve the lives of ride-hailing drivers. These drivers, on average,earnless than the local minimum wage in many places. In November 2017, the Department of Justice (as well as the Federal Trade Commission) filed abriefagainst Seattle\u2019s law granting collective bargaining rights to ride-hailing drivers.\nThe Justice Department has also weighed in on the legality and wisdom of state rules on, for example, thepractice of law. In a statement of interest in a case challenging a Florida bar\u2019s rule, the Antitrust Division paid tribute to \u201cnew competition from mobile platforms that can profoundly change an industry.\u201d This type of free-standing policy lecture voicesa hostility to democratic market structuringand is outside the division\u2019s statutory duty to police corporate cartels, mergers and monopolies.\nWhen trying to understand the Trump administration\u2019s position on tech monopolists, ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and look to what his antitrust enforcers do and say. Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrust chief is hindering the ability of federal, state and local governments and the public to tame the power of tech giants. Instead of this deference to corporate power and condescension to our elected representatives, the department should be confronting monopolies in tech and elsewhere and respecting the policy choices of state and local officials.\nMatthew Buck is a reporter-researcher with the Open Markets Institute. From 2017 to 2018, he worked as a paralegal specialist in the Antitrust Division's Criminal I Section, helping to investigate criminal cartel activity.

        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Apple responded on Friday to antitrust claims made by the music streaming service Spotify, saying its policies are fair and accusing its rival of being motivated by a need to bolster financial results.\nSpotify filed acomplaint with European regulatorsthis week, accusing Apple of using its App Store to undercut companies that compete with its own services, like Apple Music.\nIn a statement published on its website, Apple said that Spotify was not treated any differently from the millions of other developers that use the App Store.\nApple accused Spotify of trying to use the advantages of the App Store, which provides access to millions of Apple users, without having to pay fees that Apple says are necessary to keep the marketplace thriving. Apple charges a fee of up to 30 percent for anything sold through the App Store.\n\u201cSpotify is asking to keep all those benefits while also retaining 100 percent of the revenue,\u201d Apple said. \u201cSpotify wouldn\u2019t be the business they are today without the App Store ecosystem, but now they\u2019re leveraging their scale to avoid contributing to maintaining that ecosystem for the next generation of app entrepreneurs.\u201d\nThe dispute highlights a larger debate about the role of large tech platforms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, and whether their size and power impede competition.Amazon is the subject of a European antitrust investigationrelated to its treatment of independent sellers on its marketplace.Google was fined by the European Commissionlast year for antitrust violations stemming from its Android operating system.\n\u201cWhen the company that runs a platform also competes with businesses that depend on that platform, we face the risk that it could use its power to drive out competition in not one market but dozens,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, said in a speech this week.\nApple said the App Store had created millions of jobs and generated more than $120 billion for developers since its introduction in 2008. It ushered in a new era of mobile computing, allowing companies like Instagram, Uber and others to reach users.\nSpotify\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 300 million times, according to Apple.\n\u201cThe App Store is a safe, secure platform where users can have faith in the apps they discover and the transactions they make,\u201d Apple said. \u201cAnd developers, from first-time engineers to larger companies, can rest assured that everyone is playing by the same set of rules.\u201d"

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Who Should Let Driverless Cars Off the Leash?",
        "fulltext": "Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nA lot of people are getting way more interested in putting fully autonomous cars on the road.\nWith Lyft's initial public offering on Friday, and Uber\u2019s expected in the coming months, investors are effectively placing bets on autonomous vehicles. The development of driverless technology is central to both companies\u2019 becoming profitable and making good on their valuations of tens of billions of dollars.\nUber and Lyft want robocars to navigate city streets alone so they can offer rides 24-7 without having human drivers share their takings. Lyft admitted in its I.P.O. prospectus that without autonomous vehicles, \u201cour business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u201d\nSo the companies need to test the technology in the real world, aggressively. And investors will want that to happen. But the technology still lags behind the hype.\nWaymo, broadly considered to be the market leader, has pushed widespread testing of its vehicles for years. It is testing an autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix that is used by paying members of the public.\nBut according to areport by The Information, things aren\u2019t going smoothly. Almost 40 percent of Waymo\u2019s customers registered complaints in reviews seen by the publication, from wrong turns to near-crashes. \u201cThis buggy and concerning service should not be charging money yet,\u201d one customer reportedly wrote.\nAmbitions to push harder are also softening. \u201cCurrently, the company doesn\u2019t believe it is close to being able to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis without safety drivers,\u201d The Information wrote.\nInvestor pressure on Uber and Lyft will probably influence decisions about holding off on accelerated testing, which raises questions about how strictly cities and states should regulate self-driving vehicles. Some jurisdictions are liberal,even allowing some cars to be tested without safety drivers; others are more strict.\nMark Fagan, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, thinks city and state authorities should allow testing of vehicles only where safety improvements are \u201cunambiguous.\u201d Maybe that means airport shuttles, low-speed taxi pods or some other uses that are safe even if they are \u2026 well, a harder sell to investors.\n\u201cI\u2019m on the side of safety and security and over-testing,\u201d Mr. Fagan says. \u201cRather than letting the market do its thing.\u201d\nIn the face of flagging iPhone sales, Appleunveiled a digital services planlast Monday \u2014 new TV programming, video games and news, as well as a credit card.\nThe announcement was heavy on big names. A cast of Hollywood stars announced the streaming service, its news offering included publishers like The New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, and its credit card is backed by Goldman Sachs.\nBeneath the gloss, questions lurked. There were no details about pricing of the TV service. It\u2019s unclear how much content readers will have access to in the news service. The Journal is offering just a curated selection, for instance. And there were no details about credit limits or interest rates for the credit card.\nStill, Apple has the inertia of its ecosystem to fall back on. It has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. Users have bought 300 million in-app subscriptions to services belonging to Apple and third parties.\n\u201cIf they are any indication of how Apple is leveraging their current iOS users, then they\u2019ve been able to leverage them pretty well,\u201d Annette Zimmermann of the research company Gartner said.\nIf a commodities slump indicates impending economic issues, tech may have a problem.\nSamsung Electronicswarned on Tuesdaythat its financial results for the first three months of this year would be disappointing. It pointed to its memory and display businesses, which account for 43 percent of its revenue.\nMemory and displays appear in almost all electronic devices, but are sensitive to supply and demand \u2014 like a tech world equivalent of oil. There is currently excess inventory and weak demand for the components: See, for instance, a7 percent declinein global smartphone shipments during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSamsung says it \u201cexpects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.\u201d Competitors probably feel the same.\nIt\u2019s 2019, and a dating app is considered a potent security threat.\nThe Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun is reportedly being forced to sell Grindr, the popular gay social network that it bought in two stages in 2016 and 2018,according to Reuters, which cited unidentified sources. That\u2019s the result of an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American operations.\n\u201cThis appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted that foreign control of a social media app could have national security implications,\u201d David E. Sangerwrotein The Times.\nIt\u2019s not too surprising. China is no stranger to cyberespionage, and some data on Grindr is highly personal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is supposed to be playing closer attention to data as a security risk, and has the power to unwind deals.\nBut it\u2019s a clear sign that United States trust in China\u2019s digital operations has worn paper-thin.\nIn other news:\n\u25a0 Google\u2019s robot reboot is all about software. Its new focus is making robots smarter byinjecting them with machine-learning algorithmsso they can learn for themselves.\n\u25a0 Europe adoptedtough online copyright rules. They are meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively.\n\u25a0 Three artificial intelligence pioneers won computer science\u2019s Nobel. They snagged the Turing Award for their work indeveloping artificial neural networks.\n\u25a0 Facebook willban white nationalist contentfrom its platforms. The move comes after longstanding criticism about the tech giant\u2019s failing to confront white extremism.\n\u25a0 And the United States is suing Facebook over housing discrimination. The social network is said to haveallowed advertisers to restrict who can see listingsbased on race, religion and national origin.\n\u25a0 Hunting a robocall king isn\u2019t easy. But a researcher at TripAdvisor helped the Federal Communications Commissionsubpoena a linchpin of the nefarious industry.\n\u25a0 Silicon Valley\u2019s elite are obsessed with stoicism.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Big Spending Plan to Challenge Netflix Takes Shape",
        "fulltext": "Apple is coming to Hollywood.\nDelete that.\nHollywood is going to Apple.\nOn March 25, a delegation of producers, studio executives and big-name actors will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., for one of those Apple showcases, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists.\nThis time around, the focus won\u2019t be on the next must-have device. With iPhone sales showingsigns of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the company\u2019s billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.\nThe premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming before the year is out. At next week\u2019s presentation, Apple is expected to reveal details ofwhat it has been working onwith stars from both sides of the camera like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg.\nThe tag line, \u201cIt\u2019s show time,\u201d appeared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new patrons.\nApple didn\u2019t need stars before, but it needs them now. Although the company was the first publicly traded American firmto be valued above$1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue.\nSo the plan now is not only to sell devices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways.\nApple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Disney Company and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace.\nApple has decided to put more emphasis on its services \u2014 think Apple Music and Apple Pay \u2014 to increase revenues. The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News, which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the star-studded streaming service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens,Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming.\nThe event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino is also meant to drive home \u2014 for iPhone fans and anyone in Hollywood who hasn\u2019t been paying attention \u2014 just how many shows Apple has pulled together. Five series have completed filming. Around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production, according to several people familiar with the shows who were not authorized to speak publicly. And the number of original productions is expected to increase in 2020.\nWith all that new material, Apple will transform itself, seemingly overnight, from a tech giant into a more general enterprise, with a slate of original entertainment offerings sizable enough to put it in a league with Showtime, Hulu or FX.\nInterviews with more than a dozen people who have had dealings with Apple, all of whom said they couldn\u2019t speak publicly about private discussions, suggest that, while the producers and stars appreciate having another deep-pocketed company to pitch, they also have \u2026 well, let\u2019s call them concerns.\nThose concerns have arisen from the culture clash that may inevitably come about when a tech company that is used to guarding its trade secrets gets involved in show business, which runs on a stream of conversation, much of it of the just-between-us variety.\nPlayers expect to be kept in the loop. But many of the people working with Apple said they have received little or no information on how, exactly, their shows will be released. Or even when they will be released, other than a vague assurance of \u201clater this year, probably fall.\u201d They also don\u2019t have a clear idea of Apple\u2019s marketing plans for the shows. Or what their colleagues in the newly built Apple stable are up to.\nApple\u2019s entertainment team is based in Culver City, Calif., historically a center of moviemaking. It is led by two former Sony television executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, under the watch of the senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. Mr. Cue hired the Sony veterans in 2017, after Apple rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d which was a dud. About $1 billion was set aside for them to spend on programming, and they have blown well past that amount by now.\nWhile Apple may be a late arrival to the streaming party, its showcase will take place two and a half weeks before Disney is expected to preview elements of its new streaming platform, and many months before Warner Media provides details of its version.\nApple\u2019s entertainment team has not been totally opaque. It has provided feedback to individuals involved in the shows, but it has been tight-lipped about the marketing and rollout plans. The March 25 event may allay Hollywood\u2019s concerns, but several people involved in the new programs have interpreted the lack of communication as a sign that there may not be a clear game plan.\nPeople involved in the coming series also said that Apple executives had expressed squeamishness when it comes to the portrayal of technology in the shows \u2014 howexactlyare you using that iPhone? Or that Mac laptop?\nApple was sensitive to a reputation it earned, early on, as a home for uplifting programming, with little or no room for the gritty antihero fare that has defined many critically acclaimed series over the last two decades, from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d onward. Executives at the company bristled when they discovered there would be scenes involving crucifixes in Mr. Shyamalan\u2019s new thriller for the service, as The Wall Street Journalreported in September. But Apple ultimately allowed the crucifixes to remain, according to two people familiar with the series.\nApple had no comment on any aspect of its streaming plans.\nHollywood\u2019s concerns have not prevented big names from making deals with the company. In all, Apple has ordered roughly two dozen series from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Damien Chazelle, Chris Evans and others.\nThe producer J.J. Abrams has two Apple series in the works, one with Jennifer Garner, who played the lead in the Abrams-produced ABC series \u201cAlias,\u201d and a musical show starring the singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles that is about to go into production.\nApple has also given the green light to animated \u201cPeanuts\u201d specials and children\u2019s shows madewith Sesame Workshop, and it plans to round out its offerings with films it has acquired recently at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival.\nHere are the projects that have either completed filming or are nearing their wrap dates. They are the likeliest to appear in Apple\u2019s first wave of shows.\nUntitled Series With Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston\nApple\u2019s splashiest project is a behind-the-scenes series about a morning TV show. The company committed itself to two full seasons before seeing a script. Along with Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston, who are also producers, the cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass. The series had some backstage drama last year, when its showrunner, Jay Carson, Hillary Clinton\u2019s former press secretary and a supervising producer of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was replaced by Kerry Ehrin, the co-creator of A&E\u2019s \u201cBates Motel.\u201d Brian Stelter, the CNN host and author of the 2013 book, \u201cTop of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV,\u201d serves as a consultant. Shooting for season one is nearly done.\n\u201cAmazing Stories,\u201d a Steven Spielberg Reboot\nRevival of the NBC series of the same name. After its own showrunner problems \u2014 the original producer\u2019s vision was too dark for almost everyone involved, including Mr. Spielberg \u2014 Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, the duo behind the ABC series \u201cOnce Upon a Time,\u201d took over. Expected to wrap soon.\n\u201cAre You Sleeping?\u201d a Mystery Starring Octavia Spencer\nA drama featuring the prolific Academy Award winner in the lead role, \u201cAre You Sleeping?\u201d is based on a crime novel by Kathleen Barber that featured a cold case and a sleuth with a podcast. According to Ms. Spencer\u2019s Instagram account, shooting finishedlate last year.\n\u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d a Ronald D. Moore Sci-Fi Series\nThis space drama from the producer of the cult-favorites \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d is a alternate-history look at what would have happened if the global space race had continued. This one is in the can.\n\u201cSee,\u201d With the \u201cAquaman\u201d Star Jason Momoa\nA fantasy epic starring the \u201cAquaman\u201d star (please note, the series is not called \u201cSea\u201d) that poses the question, What would happen to humanity if everyone lost their sight? Also with Alfre Woodard, who has been in everything from \u201cScrooged\u201d to \u201cLuke Cage.\u201d Now shooting.\nA New Shyamalan Thriller\nA thriller from the maker of \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d and \u201cGlass\u201d starring Rupert Grint, Lauren Ambrose and Nell Tiger Free.

Now the bad news: The economy may be slowing faster than some people \u2014 like President Trump \u2014 would like to think. The central bank lowered its growth forecast to 2.1 percent, down from its 2.3 percent prediction in December \u2014 and well below the 3.2 percent that the White House envisions. Why the cool-off? The afterglow of the 2017 tax cuts has waned, the China trade war doesn\u2019t seem to be ending anytime soon and other countries\u2019 economies are stagnating.\nBoeing took its first major customer blow since two of its 737 Max 8 jets crashed within five months of each other.

It comes with conditions, though. If Mrs. May can convince Parliament to accept her Brexit plan in the next week, then she\u2019ll have until May 22 to enact it. But they\u2019ve already rejected it twice, so that could be a nonstarter.

This Friday, ride-hailing company Lyft isshooting for the biggest initial public offeringthe tech world has seen since 2014 (when the juggernaut Alibaba went public at $169 billion). Lyft hopes to be valued at an optimistic $23 billion, considerably more than the $15.1 billion valuation from its last private funding round. Silicon Valley will be watching closely. A number of other young tech companies are planning to follow in Lyft\u2019s I.P.O. footsteps shortly, including Lyft\u2019s biggest rival, Uber (whose valuation goal dwarfs Lyft\u2019s, at $120 billion), as well as Pinterest, Slack and Postmates.\nThe costly trade war between the United States and China shows no signs of concluding, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of progress.

        "title": "Spotify Accuses Apple of Anticompetitive Practices in Europe",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Apple\u2019s powerful role as gatekeeper of the App Store has long frustrated the makers of apps who must abide by its rules or risk losing access to hundreds of millions of customers who own Apple devices.\nNow one of Apple\u2019s biggest rivals, the music streaming service Spotify, says Apple is abusing its position and violating European antitrust laws.\nIn an aggressive attempt to undercut Apple\u2019s power, Spotify said on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash companies that compete with its services, including Apple Music.\nSpotify\u2019s complaint comes at perilous moment for the world\u2019s biggest tech companies. Scrutiny over Silicon Valley\u2019s power has been increasing in recent years, and has already become a topic among Democratic presidential hopefuls.\nOne of them, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, last weekproposed breaking up the tech giantsas a remedy to their unfair advantages. One of her ideas was to separate the App Store from Apple.\n\u201cSpotify\u2019s complaint is just the latest example of what can happen when these enormous companies abuse their power to undermine competition,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe need a level playing field, and that starts by breaking up giant tech companies who both own a marketplace and operate in that same marketplace.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, a British government report also called fortougher antitrust lawsfor the industry.\nApple\u2019s role as a make-or-break arbiter has long frustrated app makers by imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on anything sold through its App Store.\nSpotify, which has headquarters in Luxembourg and Sweden, said it had told the European Commission, an aggressive regulator of the tech industry, that the policies were not just a costly nuisance but a \u201ctax\u201d that violated competition laws and merited an investigation.\nThe policies have been particularly vexing for companies, like Spotify, that compete with Apple. Spotify and Apple Music are the world\u2019s largest music streaming services.\n\u201cThey continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn,\u201d Daniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s chief executive,said in a messageposted on the company\u2019s website. He said Apple was acting as both \"player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.\u201d\nApple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said the fees are reasonable given that it must maintain the App Store and is providing access to millions of potential customers who own Apple devices.\nApple\u2019s introduction of the App Store in 2008 revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for consumers to download games, productivity tools and social networking services. There are now more than two million apps available on the App Store.\nCompanies like Spotify have thrived on Apple\u2019s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google\u2019s Play Store.\nSpotify\u2019s overall sales last year rose 29 percent to 5.3 billion euros, or about $6 billion, but the company is not profitable and is under pressure from investors to improve its margins. The company paid about 74 percent of its revenue to cover music rights and related costs.\nSpotify has been a formidable competitor to Apple in attracting customers for music streaming. Spotify said that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, including 96 million who were signed up for a paid subscription that did not include ads. In January, Apple said that its Apple Music service had 50 million paying users.\nApple\u2019s control over the App Store has been an increasing source of tension as the company has focused more on online services that compete with many of the apps sold on its platform. As iPhone sales have leveled off, Apple has relied more on sales of software and services. The largest driver of that sort of revenue is the App Store.\nSpotify said Apple was continually changing its policies to harm competitors.\n\u201cApps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store,\u201d Mr. Ek said. \u201cWe should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions \u2014 including Apple Music.\u201d\nA search for \u201cmusic\u201d on the App Store on Wednesday showed how Apple can give itself an advantage. The top result was an ad for Apple Music, followed by eight more results for Apple apps. Spotify was listed 11th.\nCompanies are finding ways to reduce the fees they pay to Apple. In 2016, Spotify started sending customers to an outside website to make a payment rather than processing charges within its app. Netflix and Amazon have made similar moves.\nAs a result, Spotify generally does not share revenue with Apple for customers who signed up after 2016, but pays 15 percent for customers who signed up before that period. Apple\u2019s fee decreases to 15 percent from 30 percent after the first year of a subscription.\nSensor Tower, an app-data firm, estimated that Apple still took in 23 percent of the roughly $670 million consumers spent on Spotify on the App Store from 2015 through 2018.\nBut Apple punishes companies that do not use its payment system by restricting their ability to communicate with customers and preventing the release of app updates, Spotify claimed. Spotify accused Apple of blocking its app and other Apple competitors from services such as Siri, HomePod and Apple Watch.\nSpotify said Apple also treated companies differently. Uber, for example, is not required to pay a fee to Apple for charges through its app.\nApple demonstrated its power this year when, in response to Facebook\u2019s violating its app rules, ittemporarily shut downFacebook\u2019s internal apps, including those for the company\u2019s cafeteria menu and shuttle schedule.\nThe European Commission has a history of turning a company\u2019s antitrust complaints into larger investigations of tech platforms. Last year,it fined Google a record \u20ac4.34 billion, about $5.1 billion at the time, for antitrust abuses related to its Android operating system, and forced Google to effectively loosen its grip over the platform. Google is appealing. European officials are alsoinvestigating possible anticompetitive practicesby Amazon.\nEuropean regulators have expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s dominance in music. Last year, the European Commission held up Apple\u2019s acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns it would harm competition, though the deal was eventually approved. In 2016, the commission accused Apple of a tax avoidance scheme and ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland, a decision Apple is appealing.\nIt is unclear whether Spotify\u2019s complaint will lead European regulators to start a formal investigation of Apple. The term of Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust official in the European Commission, ends this year, meaning the decision could fall to her successor.\n\u201cThe commission has received a complaint by Spotify, which we are assessing under our standard procedures,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court is considering a suit brought by consumers claiming that Apple\u2019s control over theApp Store represents an unfair monopoly, forcing customers to pay higher prices than they would in a more open market."

        "title": "Hollywood Had Questions. Apple Didn\u2019t Answer Them.",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 A delegation from Los Angeles trekked 300 miles to Apple\u2019s campus armed with questions.\nQuestions like: How much will viewers be charged for the coming slate of Apple programming? When will the shows be released? How will they be marketed?\nThere were plenty of famous people onstage during the nearly two-hour presentation streamed live on Monday from the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., and plenty of skillful corporate stagecraft \u2014 but when it was all over, Hollywood\u2019s main questions had gone unanswered.\nWhile entertainment veterans are rooting for the company to succeed in its new venture, they still need a little more convincing before they will endorse the notion that Apple has created \u201ca new service dedicated to the best stories ever told,\u201d as one of its executives, Jamie Erlicht, put it on Monday.\nIn the first hour of the show, Apple played up its new brand identity as something other than a company that turned out hardware products by unveiling its news and gaming services. It also announced deals it had struck for programming from HBO, CBS, Showtime and Starz, as well as acredit cardit had created with Goldman Sachs.\nThe next act was the charm-and-dazzle portion of the program \u2014 Steven Spielberg! Oprah Winfrey! Big Bird! \u2014 during which Apple tried to get the word out to its customer base that it had become a major content company to rival Netflix or HBO.\nA secondary audience for the star-studded display was the entertainment industry itself, a group that included the producers, actors, executives and agents in the room, as well as their confreres monitoring the event from Los Angeles.\nApple, which will house its original programming and shows from other companies in an app called Apple TV Plus, spent more than $1 billion on entertainment in the last year and a half. That expenditure brought a number of stars to the alien turf of Silicon Valley.\nThe night before the 10 a.m. presentation, there was a cocktail party \u2014 no press invited \u2014 for many of the entertainment people now in business with the no-longer-just-a-tech company. The famous among them gathered for a Vanity Fair-style photo session. Art Streiber, a frequent celebrity portraitist for the magazine, shot group pictures in color and black and white. Ms. Winfrey was seated front and center, flanked by Jennifer Aniston and the Apple chief executive Tim Cook.\nThe majority of the portrait subjects had outfitted themselves in the minimalist style long associated with the brand. The renegades included the \u201cAquaman\u201d star Jason Momoa, who wore a wide-brimmed hat, and Jada Pinkett Smith, whose yellow skirt popped.\nNot long before the Monday showcase, the weekend arrivals were joined by the rest of the Hollywood contingent, who had jetted that morning to Cupertino, a city not known for its five-star accommodations. In flats, heels and black leather sneakers, they tramped up a hill on a cloudy, blustery morning. Youthful, cheerful Apple employees shouted out \u201cHello!\u201d and \u201cGood morning!\u201d\nThe agents, producers and executives stepped into the rounded glass space above the theater. It looked like an Apple Store, only grander, with no products on display, but plenty of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s time to begin the descent,\u201d an Apple employee said, gesturing toward a stairwell as showtime approached.\nThe Los Angeles crowd sat among Apple employees and others in the dark. They took in the information about Apple News Plus and the credit card. Then came the part of the show they had come to see.\nMr. Spielberg, who is rebooting his 1980s-era NBC series \u201cAmazing Stories\u201d for Apple, had not appeared in the group portraits taken the night before, but he was the first member of the Hollywood envoy to take the stage.\n\u201cThis is my first time at Apple,\u201d he said.\nHe was followed by J. J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon, Ms. Aniston, Ms. Winfrey, and let\u2019s not forget Big Bird, who was there to promoteApple\u2019s plan to make children\u2019s showswith Sesame Workshop, the maker of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\nWhile the presentation was something new for Apple, it was familiar to the audience members from Los Angeles. That\u2019s because what they were seeing was essentially an upfront presentation.\nThe so-called upfronts are a decades-old convention in the television business. Networks stage them for advertisers in Manhattan at Carnegie Hall, the Beacon Theater, and Radio City Music Hall. Stars take the spotlight to engage in scripted banter. Executives give rah-rah speeches. Skillfully edited clips raise hopes that the new shows will not be stinkers. Musicians and stand-up comics offer breaks in the action. Fall lineups are introduced with much fanfare.\nDespite the disruptive effect Apple promises to have on the entertainment industry, the company followed an old script on Monday. Mr. Spielberg talked up \u201cAmazing Stories.\u201d Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston promoted their drama, \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d and did some patter with their co-star, Steve Carell. The writer, actor, producer and comedian Kumail Nanjiani played up his anthology show about immigrants, \u201cLittle America.\u201d The singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, introduced by Mr. Abrams, sat at a keyboard and sang the title theme to their musical series, \u201cLittle Voice.\u201d\nWhen Apple\u2019s heads of entertainment, the former Sony studio heads Mr. Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, hit the stage, there was thunderous applause as Hollywood cheered its own. A glimpse of their labors appeared in a one-minute, 43-secondsizzle reelwith clips from the coming programs. Apple hewed to the old timeline favored by traditional broadcast networks in announcing that the shows were \u201ccoming this fall.\u201d\nA partial standing ovation greeted the celebrity saved for last: Ms. Winfrey. \u201cThere has never been a moment quite like this one,\u201d she said, echoing the hyperbole that had been prevalent. She spoke of two documentaries, one on workplace sexual harassment, the other on mental health, and laid out plans for what sounded like an Apple-enhanced revival of the Oprah Book Club.\nMr. Cook was the show\u2019s closer. He paced before a black-and-white group portrait shot by Mr. Streiber the night before. It was projected behind him, the size of a mural. \u201cThey\u2019ve impacted our culture, our society,\u201d Mr. Cook said of its subjects, whom he praised as \u201cthese amazingly passionate and award-winning artists.\u201d\nThe lights went up and the members of the Hollywood group went out. Celebrities and sizzle reels were nothing new to them, so they were buzzing more about the new credit card than anything else. Made of titanium, with rounded edges and no pesky numbers to mar its face, it is likely to be a Beverly Hills status object. They also went on about the card because the event had not laid to rest their concerns about marketing, premiere dates and the cost of the streaming service to consumers.\nIt was also not lost on them that, despite the impressive celebrity cavalcade, many of the stars on display were not exclusive to Apple. Mr. Spielberg has his own production company and makes deals freely. Ms. Witherspoon has shows with HBO and Hulu. Even Big Bird has ties to PBS and HBO.\nWhile skeptical, however, Hollywood is rooting for Apple. In addition to assuming the role of Medici-like patron, it is a viable competitor to Netflix, which can only be good for business. As Ms. Winfrey had put it, speaking of the worldwide reach of Apple\u2019s devices, \u201cThey\u2019re in a billion pockets, y\u2019all. A billion pockets.\u201d"
