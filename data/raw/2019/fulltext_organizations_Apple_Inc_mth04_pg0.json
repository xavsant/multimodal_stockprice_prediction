        "title": "Media Companies Take a Big Gamble on Apple",
        "fulltext": "Like many other media executives, Pamela Wasserstein was wary of tech giants and their attempts to go into business with content creators.\n\u201cThere was great optimism around partnerships, and I think that optimism has largely cooled, and people are now more cautious,\u201d said Ms. Wasserstein, the chief executive of New York Media, the publisher of New York magazine and web titles like The Cut and Vulture.\nBut like others in her position at publishers like Cond\u00e9 Nast, Dow Jones and Meredith, she put caution aside and joined Apple\u2019s media initiative, the recently unveiled Apple News Plus app, which promises to blast out content across more than a billion devices worldwide.\nThe tech giant based the service on an app itacquiredlast year called Texture, which gave readers access to some 200 publications with a single subscription. The revamped and renamed version, introduced with much fanfare last week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., charges subscribers $9.99 a month ($12.99 in Canada) for content from more than 300 titles, including The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Time, The Atlantic and People, as well as The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. (Also included: Airbnb Magazine, Birds & Blooms, Retro Gamer and Salt Water Sportsman, befitting the app\u2019s conceit as an omnibus newsstand.)\nWeighing the pros and cons, Ms. Wasserstein concluded that Apple News Plus would allow her publications to reach \u201ca new audience in an environment that feels right for us.\u201d\nGoing into business with a tech giant was a calculated risk. Like most publishers, New York Media had seen its revenue shrink in an internet environment where Google and Facebook scoop up advertising dollars and have great influence over what people read. (New York Media\u2019s online sales have grown more recently.)\nThere\u2019s a sense among Manhattan\u2019s media ranks that any deal with Silicon Valley amounts to a fool\u2019s bargain.\nNow, by necessity, magazines, newspapers and websites have learned to be promiscuous tradesmen to stop relying on one revenue source. They have embracednew business lineslike branded content, conferences and podcasts just to diversify and stay afloat.\nMs. Wasserstein was among the publishers at the Steve Jobs Theater when Apple unveiled the service. On stage, Tim Cook, the chief executive, contrasted Apple\u2019s editorial approach to the \u201cvery different choice\u201d other companies have made. It was a notable remark, given the criticism of Facebook and Google over their role in spreading misinformation.\nApple\u2019s plan was something altogether different, Mr. Cook promised. \u201cThis is going to take Apple News to a whole new level,\u201d he said. Cheers bounced around the room \u2014 half occupied by Apple employees \u2014 as glossy magazine covers skated across the giant screen at his back.\nThe marketing event seems to have accomplished its goal. More than 200,000 people subscribed to Apple News Plus in its first 48 hours \u2014 more than Texture had amassed at its peak, according to two people with knowledge of the figures who asked not to be named to discuss confidential information. (Texture\u2019s subscribers have not been counted toward Apple\u2019s subscribers.)\nThe New York Times and The Washington Post did not join the effort, despite intense lobbying from Apple. Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said the problem with the app, from his perspective, was how it \u201cjumbled different news sources into these superficially attractive mixtures,\u201d making it difficult for users to know which publication they\u2019re consuming. A spokeswoman for The Post said that the paper\u2019s \u201cfocus is on growing our own subscription base\u201d and that it was not interested in offering its wares through another company.\nSome executives who said yes to the plan seemed less than sanguine, but they declined to comment publicly for fear of upsetting Apple or violating the ironclad nondisclosure agreements the news companies had signed.\nIn addition to allowing their publications to be part of Apple\u2019s big bundle, publishers have risked cannibalizing their own subscription efforts by signing on. At $9.99 a month, Apple News Plus is a bargain, especially for casual readers. The Journal, by contrast, charges a monthly fee of $39 for digital access. Online subscriptions to The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Wired \u2014 all owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast \u2014 together cost more than $10 a month. The New Yorker by itself costs $7.50.\nThe day after the splashy announcement, The New Yorker found itself on the defensive after a Reutersheadlineblared: \u201cIs it time to dump your New Yorker subscription?\u201d In reply, Michael Luo, the editor of The New Yorker\u2019s website, sounded off in a13-part tweetstormadvising readers not to dump the magazine. Only a portion of its archive would be available on the Apple service, he wrote, and readers could miss out on certain articles by Ronan Farrow, Jane Mayer and Doreen St. F\u00e9lix, not to mention the weekly crossword.\n\u201cThe best way to read ALL that we do@newyorkerevery day and every week is to subscribe,\u201d Mr. Luo tweeted.\nPatrick Soon-Shiong, the owner and publisher of The Los Angeles Times, seemed unworried about tying the paper\u2019s fortunes to Apple, saying in an email that the service would \u201cencourage more people to pay for quality content.\u201d\nThe Journalreportedthat, thanks to the deal with Apple, it would add 50 people to its newsroom. But the union that represents the paper\u2019s employees noted the new job listings were open to contract workers.\n\u201cIt would be the first time that we\u2019d see a move toward an unprotected work force,\u201d Tim Martell, the union\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like the uncertainty.\u201d\nTo abide by the union\u2019s contract with The Journal, Mr. Martell added, contract workers in the newsroom would be allowed to work for a maximum of 12 months. That suggests the Journal sees these hires as a temporary assignment \u2014 a compromise approach \u2014 as it gauges the benefits and costs of the Apple partnership.\nThe majority ofJournal storieswill appear on the service, but with only a three-day archive. Content for niche groups, such as CFO Journal, which is aimed at the financial community, and CMO Today, geared toward advertising professionals, will not be included.\nFor Rupert Murdoch, theownerof The Journal since 2007, the partnership is a way for him to realize his long-held dream of turning the paper into something of interest to readers beyond Wall Street and corporate boardrooms.\nThe mogul was the driving force behind the Apple deal, according to two executives close to Mr. Murdoch. He wants The Journal to include more general interest, sports and lifestyle coverage, and the partnership with Apple gives the paper a concrete reason to move beyond its core readership.\nUnswayed by sentiment, Mr. Murdoch, 88, recentlysold offthe bulk of his television and film properties as he refocused on the news business and reshaped his empire into an entity built to survive the final steps of the digital revolution. He was able to extract better terms from Apple than other publishers, the people close to him said, including the ability to exit on a time frame that would be more favorable to The Journal.\nMr. Murdoch has worked with Apple in the past. In 2011, when tablets were supposedly going to save journalism, he poured millions into an iPad publication, The Daily, with the help of Apple\u2019s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. The effortfailed to make its markand was shut down after less than two years.\nPublications that originated at the now defunct Time Inc. \u2014 like Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune \u2014 are also part of Apple News Plus. They were pushed into the arrangement as part of a deal struck by Meredith, the company that purchased them in 2017, according to two news executives familiar with the matter. Although Meredith soldTimeandFortunelast year and is looking to move Sports Illustrated, the three publications appear to be locked in to Apple News Plus, at least for the time being. (Meredith and Apple declined to comment.)\nThe economics of Apple\u2019s venture will vary from title to title. After the company takes half the subscription price, its partners will split the rest. How much each media company receives is based on the amount of time readers devote to its content. That model mimics Spotify and Apple Music, which pay record labels based on how often their tracks are streamed.\nThe visibility of individual articles will depend on Apple\u2019s algorithm, which takes into account a user\u2019s preference \u2014 you can \u201cfollow\u201d a particular magazine or topic \u2014 as well as the judgments of Lauren Kern, theeditor in chief of Apple News, and her team.\nIn contrast with Google and Facebook, Apple has promoted the human touch. The presence of Ms. Kern, a former editor at New York magazine, has to some degree assuaged publishers\u2019 fears of algorithmic tyranny.\n\u201cLauren being there gives me confidence, but it\u2019s not that she knows who we are, but that she knows what great content is,\u201d said Ms. Wasserstein, of New York Media.\nAlthough Ms. Kern provides a link between the news media and Silicon Valley, Apple will also have to get used to the journalists now associated with its team. The New Yorker weighed in on the Cupertino event with a satiricalstoryheadlined \u201cTim Cook\u2019s Big Apple Circus.\u201d\nApple got another taste of what it has signed up for after it hosted a private party last week for its new partners at the company\u2019s Lower Manhattan loft. In its coverage of the event, Vanity Fair, one of those partners, included a quote from an unnamed partygoer who summed up the mood of the room and, perhaps, the industry at large.\nThe quote became the story\u2019s headline: \u201cAre we at a party, or a wake?\u201d"

        "title": "Privacy Is Too Big to Understand",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of a limited-run newsletter. You cansign up here.\nThere\u2019s a passage from arecent bookby the journalist David Wallace-Wells about writing on the sprawling topic of climate change. There is \u201cno single rhetorical approach likely to work on a given audience and none too dangerous to try. Any story that sticks is a good one,\u201d he argues.\nThat\u2019s exactly how I feel about coveringprivacyin the digital age. This newsletter is about finding waysto make this stuff stick in your mind and to arm you with the information you need to take control of your digital life.\nSo, how to start? The definition of privacy itself. I think it\u2019s time to radically expand it.\n\u201cPrivacy\u201d is an impoverished word \u2014 far too small a word to describe what we talk about when we talk about the mining, transmission, storing, buying, selling, use and misuse of our personal information.\nIn this way, the concept of digital privacy shares similarities with weighty crises like climate change. Both are what the theorist Timothy Mortoncalls\u201chyperobjects,\u201d a concept so all-encompassing that it is impossible to adequately describe. Dr. Morton\u2019s chief examples of hyperobjects are climate change and global warming, which invite skepticism because their scale is so vast and sometimes abstract.\nHere\u2019s another way to think of it: You are losing control over your life. When technology governs so many aspects of our lives \u2014 and when that technology is powered by the exploitation of our data \u2014 privacy isn\u2019t just about knowing your secrets, it\u2019s about autonomy. That\u2019s how Matt Cagle, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the A.C.L.U., described it to me recently.\n\u201cPrivacy is really about being able to define for ourselves who we are for the world and on our own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a choice that belongs to an algorithm or data broker and definitely not to Facebook.\u201d\nAt its heart, privacy is about how that data is used to take away our control. Today, our control is chipped away in ways large and small. It may be as innocuous as using your listed preferences, browsing behavior, third-party information about your annual income and a rough understanding of the hours that you\u2019re most susceptible to make a purchase to nudge you toward buying a pair of shoes. Or it may be as potentially life-altering as the inability to get a loan or see a job listing.\nFor survivors of abuse, privacy might mean the freedom to live safely without exposing sensitive location information to stalkers. For undocumented immigrants, digital privacy could mean the difference between a parent being able to drop her child off at school or rush a loved one to the hospital without fear of deportation.\nSuch fears aren\u2019t unfounded \u2014 they\u2019re our new reality. In January, the technology site Motherboardrevealedthat real-time data, once assumed to be protected by phone companies, was available for sale to bounty hunters for a $300 fee. And in March, an A.C.L.U.reportdetailed that ICE officials partnered with a private data firm to track license plate data. According to the report, customs enforcement officials gained access to \u201cover 5 billion data points of location information collected by private businesses, like insurance companies and parking lots, and can gain access to an additional 1.5 billion records collected by law enforcement.\u201d\nThe A.C.L.U. report is proof that our definition of what constitutes an invasion of privacy is expanding every day. Protecting our autonomy doesn\u2019t just mean changing a password or protecting a Social Security number. It means reckoning with private surveillance databases armed with dossiers on regular citizens and outsourced to the highest bidder.\n\u201cYears ago we worried about the N.S.A. building huge server farms, but now it\u2019s much cheaper to go to a private-service vendor and outsource this to a company who can cloak their activity in trade secrets,\u201d Mr. Cagle said.\nBut like any good hyperobject, there\u2019s a distinct lack of urgency when it comes to privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s too big for most individuals to digest fully,\u201d a cyber security entrepreneur, Amir Orad, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s comparable to asking people to stop using air conditioning because of the ozone layer. It\u2019s not likely to happen because the immediate comfort is more valuable than the long-term fear.\u201d\nOur first dive into the archives is this New York Timeseditorial from February 2000.\nLike all writing about the internet from nearly two decades ago, it\u2019s easy to dismiss as quaint. But what\u2019s striking is how relevant it feels. This line, for instance, seems as though it might have been written yesterday:\n\u201cMost consumers have little idea that unseen advertising networks on the internet track their movements across multiple websites. Most do not know that websites can collect and sell data about them.\u201d\nWhile our current privacy debate might feel new, it\u2019s an continuation of a conversation that has been going on for decades.\nThe last line of the editorial is particularly striking:\n\u201cMany users may want to receive ads aimed at their interests. But all users should get a meaningful choice about how personal data are collected and used.\u201d\nThat debate around targeted advertising rages on today. But what really hit home is the editorial\u2019s hopeful ending:\n\u201cMaintaining privacy will be integral to the internet\u2019s future, if only because consumers need to feel safe enough to participate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a nice thought, but if the past 20 years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that we don\u2019t seem deterred by our vulnerability.\nMost of us are aware that our phones tend to track our every move (it\u2019s one reason Google Maps and others are so gloriously helpful). Still, you might not want all that information stored everywhere. Here\u2019s how to see what your iPhone knows about where you\u2019ve been (and how to turn it off and delete the info). And if you\u2019re and Android user,here\u2019s a link.\n1. Head to your iPhone\u2019s \u201cSettings\u201d and click the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab.\n2.

        "title": "Apple Cracks Down on Apps That Fight iPhone Addiction",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They all tell a similar story: They ran apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones. Then Apple created its own screen-time tracker. And then Apple made staying in business very, very difficult.\nOver the past year, Apple has removed or restricted at least 11 of the 17 most downloaded screen-time and parental-control apps, according to an analysis by The New York Times and Sensor Tower, an app-data firm. Apple has also clamped down on a number of lesser-known apps.\nIn some cases, Apple forced companies to remove features that allowed parents to control their children\u2019s devices or that blocked children\u2019s access to certain apps and adult content. In other cases, it simply pulled the apps from its App Store.\nSome app makers with thousands of paying customers have shut down. Most others say their futures are in jeopardy.\n\u201cThey yanked us out of the blue with no warning,\u201d said Amir Moussavian, chief executive of OurPact, the top parental-control iPhone app, with more than three million downloads. In February, Apple pulled the app, which accounted for 80 percent of OurPact\u2019s revenue, from its App Store.\n\u201cThey are systematically killing the industry,\u201d Mr. Moussavian said.\nThe screen-time app makers are the latest companies to suddenly find themselves both competing against Apple and at the mercy of the tech titan. By controlling the iPhone App Store, where companies find some of their most lucrative customers, Apple has unusual power over the fortunes of other corporations.\nTammy Levine, an Apple spokeswoman, said Apple removed or required changes to the apps because they could gain too much information from users\u2019 devices. She said the timing of Apple\u2019s moves was not related to its introduction of similar tools.\nIn response to this article, Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in emails to some customers that Apple \u201cacted extremely responsibly in this matter, helping to protect our children from technologies that could be used to violate their privacy and security.\u201d\nExecutives at the app makers believe they are being targeted because their apps could hurt Apple\u2019s business. Apple\u2019s tools, they add, aren\u2019t as aggressive about limiting screen time and don\u2019t provide as many options.\n\u201cTheir incentives aren\u2019t really aligned for helping people solve their problem,\u201d said Fred Stutzman, chief executive of Freedom, a screen-time app with more than 770,000 downloads before Apple removed it in August. \u201cCan you really trust that Apple wants people to spend less time on their phones?\u201d\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,said at a conferencethis month that Apple had added screen-time tools to help people monitor and manage their phone use. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people using their phones all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has never been an objective for us.\u201d\nOn Thursday, two of the most popular parental-control apps, Kidslox and Qustodio, filed a complaint with the European Union\u2019s competition office. Kidslox said business had plummeted since Apple forced changes to its app that made it less useful than Apple\u2019s tool.\nApple also faces an antitrust complaint in Russia from Kaspersky Lab \u2014 a Russian cybersecurity firm that American security officials claim has ties to the Russian government \u2014 which said Apple had forced it to remove key features from its parental-control app. The company is exploring a similar complaint in Europe, a Kaspersky spokeswoman said.\n\u201cWe treat all apps the same, including those that compete with our own services,\u201d said Ms. Levine, the Apple spokeswoman. \u201cOur incentive is to have a vibrant app ecosystem that provides consumers access to as many quality apps as possible.\u201d\n[Get theBits newsletterfor the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]\nApple is facing other accusations that it is abusing its dominant position to lift itself and bury rivals \u2014 an issue that has become more important as the iPhone maker expands intonew markets like television, news and gaming.\nSpotifycomplained to European regulatorslast month that Apple used the App Store to give its Apple Music service an unfair advantage over Spotify\u2019s competing app. Dutch regulators announced this month that they would investigatewhether Apple abused its controlof the App Store.\nIn the United States, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, recentlysuggested separating the App Storefrom Apple as part of her proposal to rein in the American tech giants.\nIn early 2018, two prominent Wall Street investors urged Apple to address concerns that people were becoming addicted to their smartphones. In June, the company announced plans for tools to help iPhone owners track and limit their and their children\u2019s phone use. It began offering the tools in September, tucked into the phone\u2019s settings menu.\nShortly afterannouncing its new tools, Apple began purging apps that offered similar services.\nApple told the companies that their apps violated App Store rules, like enabling one iPhone to control another, although it had allowed such practices for years and had approved hundreds of versions of their apps.\nApple allows corporations to use such software to control employees\u2019 phones. But last year, the company stopped apps from using the software to enable parents to control their children\u2019s devices. The Apple spokeswoman said Apple had blocked the practice because app makers could gain access to too much information on the children\u2019s devices. Apple cited other rule violations when removing some apps, but the spokeswoman didn\u2019t explain the reasoning behind those moves.\nUnlike apps such as OurPact, Apple\u2019s tools don\u2019t allow parents to schedule different times throughout a day when an app is blocked \u2014 for school or family dinner. And Apple\u2019s tool blocks adult content only on its Safari web browser and some apps, not on other browsers or many popular apps, like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.\nBruce Chantry, a 47-year-old father of two outside Cleveland, said he had used OurPact and Mobicip for years until Apple forced them to gut key features.\nHe has found Apple\u2019s tool more complicated and less restrictive. His children have already found workarounds to Apple\u2019s web-filtering tool and, unlike the apps he had used, it has no kill switch to quickly disable certain apps on their phones, Mr. Chantry said.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make managing these new digital threats any easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually made it more difficult.\u201d\nApple\u2019s tool has another shortcoming: It requires the whole family to own iPhones. Many apps removed by Apple allowed parents with iPhones to control their children\u2019s Android devices.\nApple has also limited the options for adults who want to fight their own phone addiction. In August, it abruptly pulled down the Freedom app, which allowed users to temporarily disable certain apps and websites. Mr. Stutzman, Freedom\u2019s chief executive, said that to return to iPhones, he was forced to stop blocking apps and to block sites only on Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\nApple\u2019s tool now appears to be one of the few ways to disable apps, if not the only one. Yet when a user hits an app\u2019s time limit on Apple\u2019s tool, it provides a single option: \u201cIgnore Limit.\u201d\nThe app makers said they were most frustrated by the process of meeting Apple\u2019s sudden demands. In many cases, Apple alerted them that their apps would be removed \u2014 and their businesses crippled \u2014 via a short note, according to correspondence viewed by The Times.\nWhen app makers asked for more information, responses were often perfunctory and slow in coming.\n\u201cAs a developer who\u2019s been on the App Store for 10 years, I would expect some courtesy from Apple of at least a phone call to explain what we\u2019re doing wrong,\u201d said Suren Ramasubbu, the head of Mobicip, a parental-control app that had about 2.5 million downloads earlier this year, about 70 percent of them on iPhones.\nOn Jan. 19, Mr. Ramasubbu received a message from Apple that said he had 30 days to change the Mobicip app or it would be removed from the App Store. \u201cIf you have any questions about this information, please reply to this message to let us know,\u201d the note said. \u201cBest regards, App Store Review.\u201d\nOver the next 27 days, Mr. Ramasubbu responded four times seeking more information. He eventually resubmitted the app with changes he hoped would satisfy Apple\u2019s demands.\nThen, with Mobicip\u2019s deadline just a few days away, Apple responded three times to his earlier detailed questions \u2014 with virtually the same message: \u201cYour app uses public A.P.I.s in an unapproved manner, which does not comply with guideline 2.5.1 of the App Store Review Guidelines.\u201d\n\u201cWe hear you loud and clear,\u201d Mr. Ramasubbu responded on the morning of Feb. 19, Apple\u2019s deadline. He begged for answers: Could Apple tell him what he needed to do to keep Mobicip on iPhones?\n\u201cAny general direction, clue or specific guidance will be deeply appreciated. We have been one of the pioneers among parental control apps on the App Store over 10 long years and have always been playing by the rules,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease point us in the right direction and we can take it from there.\u201d\nFive hours later, Apple responded with a 14-word message: \u201cYour app has an unresolved issue and has been removed from the App Store.\u201d\n\u201cNo reason, no detail,\u201d Mr. Ramasubbu said. \u201cSuddenly we don\u2019t have a business anymore.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nasty legal battles are nothing new in the tech industry. But Apple\u2019s conflict with the wireless chip maker Qualcomm, headed for a crucial court showdown this coming week, has a special intensity.\nThe two companies, once partners of a sort, now disagree about nearly everything \u2014 including which one deserves the most credit for shaping the evolution of smartphones.\nTheir formidable legal teams are at war on three continents, in a struggle that could affect the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits and, perhaps, even how much consumers pay for their phones.\nNow, the action moves to a federal courtroom in San Diego, where jury selection is set to begin on Monday for a trial on an Apple lawsuit and Qualcomm\u2019s counterclaims. The chief executives of both companies are likely to take the stand.\nThe stakes are reflected in the eye-popping damage claims. Four Asia-based contract manufacturers that assemble iPhones and iPads, whose suits have been merged with Apple\u2019s, argue that they collectively overpaid Qualcomm roughly $9 billion in royalties over the years \u2014 a figure that could be tripled under antitrust laws to $27 billion.\nApple says Qualcomm should also repay $3.1 billion associated with patents whose rights Apple says are exhausted. It has already won a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm should pay nearly $1 billion in withheld rebates.\nQualcomm, in return, estimates that Apple\u2019s partners \u2014 Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics \u2014 owe more than $7.5 billion in unpaid royalties. And it contends that Apple, which reimburses the manufacturers\u2019 royalty payments, should be liable for a doubled penalty that would take the total to $15 billion or more.\nQualcomm\u2019s business practices have also attracted harsh scrutiny from regulators in multiple countries, including China and South Korea. A high-profile Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit is awaiting a judge\u2019s verdict after a trial in San Jose, Calif.\nThe world-spanning legal struggle between Apple and Qualcomm touches on two crucial issues for the tech industry: What is the proper balance between patent rights and competition? And what is the proper role of the government in regulating tech giants?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal more than just a legal case,\u201d said Michael Wolf, who has tracked the issues for his management consulting firm Activate.\nThe fight is an existential one for Qualcomm, at least as it has operated for most of its nearly 34 years in business. The company, based in San Diego, pioneered a type of cellular communications in the 1990s that later became a mainstay of mobile devices. That innovation allowed Qualcomm to charge patent royalties on nearly every smartphone sold, which generates the bulk of its profits.\nQualcomm has historically charged about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a mobile phone. Because of Qualcomm\u2019s various patents, companies building phones that would connect to cellular networks must pay that fee for every phone \u2014 even if the phone does not actually use Qualcomm chips.\nPhone makers have little leverage to negotiate for lower rates, the F.T.C. argued in its suit, which was filed in January 2017, that leans partly on Apple\u2019s contentions.\nBecause Qualcomm holds monopoly positions in two varieties of wireless chips, the F.T.C. argued, handset makers feared that Qualcomm could cut off shipments if they balked at paying royalties. Qualcomm insists it never used that tactic. Rival chip makers, denied patent licenses from Qualcomm, have fled the market while suppliers like Intel are struggling, the F.T.C. said.\nApple, which sued Qualcommshortly after the F.T.C.\u2019s action, particularly objects to basing royalties on a phone\u2019s total price. It says that formula means that Qualcomm earns more money as handset makers add innovations like displays, touch sensors and data storage unrelated to wireless technology.\nQualcomm insists its business model has benefited consumers by helping to fund new innovations like the latest 5G wireless technology. It has responded with counterclaims that Apple and its manufacturing partners violated licensing contracts. Qualcomm has added a string of other court actions, including patent infringement suits against Apple in the United States, China and Germany.\nQualcomm has so far persuaded courts in some countries, including China, to ban sales of some iPhones there, though Apple has dodged shipment disruptions, in part, bytweaking some of its software.\nThe fight has also migrated to Washington. A little over a year ago, Qualcomm was spared a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom after the Trump administration blocked the deal onnational security grounds. Qualcomm has raised the possibility that any court-ordered changes to its practices would threaten investments in wireless technologies that are critical to the American military and intelligence gathering. The chip maker also hired the opposition research firm Definers Public Affairs, which has distributed anti-Apple research to reporters.\nMany Qualcomm customers, partners and rivals are involved in the trial that starts on Monday. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive; Philip Schiller, the company\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing; Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steven Mollenkopf, and its co-founder Irwin Jacobs could all be called to testify.\nOne of the thorniest topics is whether Qualcomm\u2019s royalty rates hurt consumers by raising smartphone prices. The F.T.C. contends they do, though it didn\u2019t quantify the impact. Pricing is also at the heart of a separate private case against Qualcomm brought on behalf of smartphone purchasers, which seeks $5 billion in aggregate damages.\nQualcomm insists its royalties have negligible effect in the mobile market, because competition is sharply reducing prices on many phones and new features have simultaneously pushed flagship models above $1,000. It is appealing a judge\u2019s ruling granting class-action status in the consumer case.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to show harm in a shrinking market,\u201d said David Reichenberg, an antitrust attorney at Cozen O\u2019Connor who specializes in tech cases. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy here.\u201d\nThe 11-day trial in January in the F.T.C. case featured testimony by several Apple executives and numerous internal emails from the companies.\nApple, which shied away from Qualcomm chips for the first iPhones, was facing the prospect in 2006 of paying $12 to $20 in royalties per handset, Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, testified at the trial. It wound up accepting a Qualcomm rebate that reduced the rate to $7.50 per device, as long as Apple agreed not to adopt a rival wireless technology, called WiMax, being promoted by Intel, he said.\nApple began using Qualcomm chips for iPhones starting in 2011, after tense negotiations, Mr. Williams said. Apple managed to keep the $7.50 royalty rate as part of deals reached in 2011 and 2013, but the smartphone maker faced big financial penalties if it started using other chip suppliers.\n\u201cWe were staring at an increase of over a billion dollars a year on licensing,\u201d Mr. Williams testified in connection with the 2013 deal. \u201cWe had a gun to our head.\u201d\nAnother Apple executive, Tony Blevins, testified that it began searching seriously for alternative suppliers in 2013. But Intel didn\u2019t manage to win a share of Apple chip purchases until 2016.\nAfter legal hostilities began with Qualcomm the next year, Apple stopped paying patent royalties and Qualcomm stopped supplying chips for Apple\u2019s newest iPhones \u2014 forcing Apple to ask Intel for a surprise increase in production, Mr. Williams said.\nQualcomm has insisted that its royalty rates, rebates and exclusivity provisions are standard industry practices and had no effect on restricting competition.\nCompanies like Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and Marvell have stopped selling wireless modem chips. But Qualcomm noted that Intel and MediaTek are major suppliers to phone makers, while Samsung and Huawei provide chips for their own phones.\n\u201cThe F.T.C. failed to show harm to competition,\u201d Robert Van Nest, Qualcomm\u2019s lead trial attorney, said in closing arguments at the trial. \u201cThe evidence is simply overwhelming that Qualcomm earned its position and success through superior innovation and better products.\u201d"

        "title": "In the Stock Market, Value Again Lags Growth",
        "fulltext": "In the never-ending tug-of-war between growth and value investing, growth has lately been the strong-armed winner.\nThis year, through the first quarter, for example, the Russell 1000 Growth Index returned over 15 percent, again better than the also excellent return of just over 11 percent for the Russell 1000 Value Index. And growth outperformed value for seven of the 10 years from 2009 through 2018.\nUntil the last decade, however, value stocks often outperformed growth, leading some proponents of the value style of investing to hope for a return to dominance. But there is no assurance that such a shift will happen soon.\nGrowth and value have specific meanings in the stock market: Value investing favors stocks that look cheap using metrics like the price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. Growth investing, on the other hand, favors stocks with higher than average annual increases in revenue and earnings.\nAfter months of rising stock prices, growth shares have become relatively expensive but not outrageously so, Jeremy Zirin, head of Equities Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said. They carried a price-to-earnings premium of 47 percent over value stocks at the end of March. That\u2019s high, he said, but nowhere near the 100 percent premium that prevailed just before the stock market declines of 2000 and 2001. \u201cWe\u2019re not at the stage where growth is grossly overvalued, \u201c he said.\nInvestors can express their own growth or value preference through a wide range of exchange-traded funds. These include theInvesco QQQ E.T.F. and theiShares Russell 1000 Value E.T.F. (Exchange-traded funds are a form of mutual fund that is priced all day on stock exchanges, unlike traditional mutual funds, which are priced only once daily, after the exchanges close.)\nTech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, the so-called Faang stocks, are in the growth category. Despite a brutal stretch in late 2018, these stocks have been big stock market winners in the last several years.\n\u201cThe major tech companies have outstripped expectations,\u201d said John Rekenthaler, vice president for research at Morningstar. \u201cEarnings have maxed or exceeded expectations.\u201d\nEd Yardeni, president ofYardeni Research, has been emphasizing growth stocks but says: \u201cMy contrary instincts suggest we may want to overvalue value relative to growth.\u201d\nOne reason is concern about the strength of the global economy. \u201cGenerally, value has outperformed whenever there is anxiety about whether the economy can continue to grow,\u201d he said.\nValue stocks typically come from industries where investors and analysts see problems; that\u2019s why the stocks are relatively cheap. The question is whether the problems are real or overblown, and whether future price gains are likely. Currently, banks and other financial institutions, and oil and gas companies, make up a large part of the value stock universe.\nJudd Peters, one of the managers of theHotchkis and Wiley Small Cap Diversified Valuefund, sees promise in both sectors. Banks will become more profitable when longer-term interest rates rise, increasing revenue when banks lend money, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at an historically low moment in terms of long-term interest rates,\u201d he said. One of the fund\u2019s holdings isFirst Hawaiian Bank, the largest Hawaiian bank, which closed the first quarter at what Mr. Peters called a \u201cvery attractive\u201d valuation of roughly 12 times current earnings.\nMr. Peters also says the valuations of many energy companies are unreasonably low because oil prices dropped as technological advances increased the supply of oil from shale. \u201cOur view is production increases for U.S. shale producers cannot continue to grow fast enough to keep up with global demand growth,\u201d he said. Mr. Peters said many shale producers have already exploited the best opportunities and are digging at \u201csecondary sites that are more expensive.\u201d\nOn the other hand, fund managers who favor growth investing can point to their recent performance records. Dan Davidowitz, for example, is manager of thePolen Growthfund, which returned an annualized 16.22 percent in the five years through March 29, according to Morningstar.\nMr. Davidowitz says he looks for companies that can increase revenue and earnings and beat the overall stock market. He is not dissuaded by high share prices, he says, because they \u201ccan be overcome with excellent earnings growth, especially where there is a big competitive advantage.\u201d\nStill, the high prices of growth stocks shouldn\u2019t be disregarded, some analysts say.\n\u201cThe gap between high-priced and low-priced stocks has been rising for many years,\u201d said Paul Quinsee, the global head of equities at JP Morgan Asset Management. At this point, he said, the price-to-earnings premium for growth stocks is greater than it has been 94 percent of the time over the last 25 years.\n\u201cThis should give investors pause,\u201d he said, though it\u2019s possible that this extreme level of pricing will persist.\nMr. Rekenthaler expects that value stocks will again outperform growth stocks eventually. \u201cIf I had to bet, I\u2019d bet on value stocks for the next 10 years,\u201d he said. But, he said, because there\u2019s no guarantee that he is right, investing in value stocks requires considerable patience."

        "title": "Apple AirPods Review: Perfect Earbuds, but They Don\u2019t Last",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s new AirPods, those tiny wireless earbuds that look likeQ-Tipsdangling from your ears, are some of the coolest audio accessories you can buy today.\nJust insert the buds into your ears and they work instantly and seamlessly with your iPhone. When you are done using them, pop them into a white case that replenishes their power. They are sleek, innovative and convenient.\nI could go on, but this is where the gushing stops. That\u2019s becauseAirPodshave a finite life. That means you will probably have to buy new ones every few years, as if they were a good pair of shoes.\nHere\u2019s how I know: After I bought Apple\u2019sfirst-generation AirPodsin late 2016, they became my favorite headset for taking phone calls and listening to podcasts. Their lack of wires made moving around easier, avoiding a mess of tangled cords. I haven\u2019t once considered reverting to wired headphones.\nBut about a month ago, my AirPods started dying. Their batteries, which are not replaceable by users, no longer last more than 30 minutes when I am on a phone call; they used to have enough juice for two hours of talk time. Other AirPod owners have recentlyshared similar complaints.\nThe second-generation AirPods, which were released last week, may face a similar fate. That\u2019s because their minimalist design involves embedding the batteries, circuit boards, microphones and antennas directly into the tiny earpieces. Then they are sealed up, making it impossible for us to open them to replace the batteries.\nThere are some improvements. The new AirPods have slightly longer battery life and give you the ability to pick songs from an iPhone hands-free by speaking the command \u201cHey, Siri.\u201d\nYet this is a tough product to recommend for people who are slow to adopt new technology or who are environmentally conscious. While you can spend about $160 (or $200 for a version that includes a special case that can be charged wirelessly) for the new AirPods, you have to be prepared to shell out that amount again when their batteries inevitably wear out. Good wired earphones \u2014 which cancost less than $50\u2014 last indefinitely, so long as you don\u2019t rip the cords.\nSo what\u2019s right for you? Take a look below to decide.\nThe new AirPods look virtually identical to the previous generation. The charging case resembles a white dental floss container. There are three batteries: one inside each earbud and one inside the case. When the charging case eventually runs out of juice, you can plug in Apple\u2019s Lightning cable, the same wire used to charge iPhones.\nThe $200 version of the AirPods includes a new case that can becharged wirelessly. That means you can place the case on a wireless charging pad, which uses an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, creating voltage that powers up the case. This method relieves the Lightning port of eventual wear and tear.\nThe new case worked well with several wireless charging pads I tested. But because you will have to spend about $20 on a charging pad, I recommend buying the AirPods with the special case only if you already own other devices that support wireless charging, likenewer iPhones.\nLike the first-generation AirPods, the new ones last about five hours when you listen to music. But for phone calls, they can now go about three hours, up from two hours previously. When you return the earbuds to the case, it has enough juice to recharge them multiple times; as a result, you will get about 24 hours of listening time before having to replenish the case. Over a week of testing, I recharged the case only once.\nThe audio quality of the new earbuds is about the same as the first generation\u2019s. Music sounds O.K. through them, good enough for playing podcasts and songs on your commute. But if you want wireless earphones that sound louder and richer with deeper bass, consider earbuds from Jabra or some of the otherrecommendations from Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times.\nThe AirPods also include a new chip that lets people use them to interact with Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant. To summon the assistant, you say, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d followed by a command like \u201cPlay some music\u201d or \u201cSchedule meeting for 3 p.m. on Thursday.\u201d\nWhile that\u2019s a neat feature for tasks like adding items to your calendar, I couldn\u2019t get in the habit of talking to Siri via AirPods \u2014 especially in public, where I still occasionally get dirty looks from people just for wearing the earbuds.\nWhen the day the AirPods\u2019 batteries are depleted eventually comes, you can take them to an Apple store and pay for battery servicing. The costfor battery servicingis $49 per earbud and $49 for the case, for a grand total of $147. At that point, you might as well buy a new pair.\nKyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and offers guides for repairing electronics, has tried topry open the new AirPodsto see whether he could replace the batteries. He concluded that removing the batteries was impossible without destroying the gadget, which is a contraption of tiny circuit boards and ribbon cables soldered together.\nHe added that Apple probably wasn\u2019t capable of replacing AirPod batteries, either, when consumers take them in for servicing. That means people are most likely getting new AirPods in exchange for their old ones.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Apple\u2019s replacing batteries in these things,\u201d Mr. Wiens said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be done.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman didn\u2019t comment on whether the company was replacing batteries for AirPods or just giving people new ones. But one thing is certain: Maintaining AirPods isn\u2019t easy compared with maintaining an iPhone, which you can take to Apple or a third-party repair shop toget a fresh batteryor a new screen for relatively little cost.\nApple\u2019s AirPods create a moral conundrum. Should you buy these earphones knowing that you will probably have to buy new ones every few years? In the process, you would essentially be using up energy, metals, plastics and human labor invested in creating the product.\nThe AirPods reminded me ofTile, the company that offers Bluetooth trackers to help find items like house keys, luggage and wallets. In the past, the trackers were tightly sealed, making the batteries impractical to replace. When a Tile device was nearly a year old, the company would send an email warning that it would soon be time to \u201creTile,\u201d or buy a new Tile.\nUsing Tile thus felt more like a subscription service than ownership. After two years of this routine, I stopped buying Tiles.\nBut the company recently made a big change: It started selling trackers with replaceable batteries. Simon Fleming-Wood, Tile\u2019s chief experience officer, said that over time, the company had realized that the reTile process was angering people.\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t realize that these Tiles died until they started hearing from us after 11 months that it was time to start replacing their Tiles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people realized that was part of the deal, some people had very negative reactions to that.\u201d\nHe added that the company was betting that by making the batteries easier to replace, customers would remain loyal to the brand.\nI hope Apple makes a similar change with AirPods. I asked the company whether the AirPods had to have irreplaceable batteries to achieve its design. Apple didn\u2019t have an answer.\nThe upshot: As someone who enjoys maintaining electronics for as long as possible before upgrading, I\u2019m on the fence about springing for the latest AirPods. The fact that my first-generation ones have such shortened battery life after two years gives me pause about buying a new pair.\nBut there are people who enthusiastically buy a new smartphone, tablet or computer as soon as they come out, year after year. The AirPods are perfect for them."

        "title": "Scheme to Swap Fake iPhones Adds Up to $900,000 Loss for Apple, Prosecutors Say",
        "fulltext": "The con was simple: Send a fake iPhone to Apple claiming that the device would not turn on and that it was under warranty, and not long after, a genuine replacement arrived in the mail.\nIt was a scheme that federal prosecutors said two college students in Oregon repeated on such a scale that it amounted to nearly $900,000 in losses for Apple as they sent in hundreds of counterfeit phones.\nThe two students, identified as Quan Jiang and Yangyang Zhou, would then ship the iPhones overseas where they would be sold for hundreds of dollars, and in return, they would get a cut of the profit, according to court documents recently filed in United States District Court in Oregon.\nThe investigation started two years ago, after customs officials seized several shipments coming from Hong Kong containing cellphones from China. The devices appeared to be Apple products, with the logos and design features of an iPhone, but the shipping methods and packaging raised the suspicions of officials who determined that the phones were counterfeit, the authorities said.\nInvestigators discovered that the cellphones were bound for Mr. Zhou\u2019s mailing address and that they were part of an importing operation that also included Mr. Jiang, Mr. Zhou\u2019s neighbor in Corvallis, Ore., about 85 miles south of Portland.\nRecords provided to investigators by Apple allowed them to connect Mr. Jiang to 3,069 iPhone warranty claims through his name and his email, mailing and IP addresses. All of them indicated \u201cNo Power/Wired Charging Issues\u201d as the reason for the claim.\nMore than 1,500 of the claims were rejected, but nearly just as many were approved, with a new phone sent out. An Apple representative told an investigator, according to court records, that a key element of the scheme\u2019s success was that the phones were inoperable, which meant the replacement process would begin before technicians could figure out they were counterfeit.\nMr. Jiang told investigators in an interview he had submitted some 2,000 phones in 2017. He also said that he employed friends and relatives in the United States to help swap out the phones. He said that an associate in China who sold the genuine phones paid Mr. Jiang\u2019s mother, who lives in China; she deposited the money in a bank account that he could access in the United States.\nWith each phone costing $600, the losses for Apple amounted to $895,800, officials said.\nApple, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday, is not the only technology giant that has been targeted by scammers. A Lithuanian manrecently pleaded guilty to an effortin which he sought to bilk Facebook and Google out of millions of dollars by submitting fraudulent invoices to the companies. Prosecutors said that from 2013 to 2015 the companies wired more than $100 million to the man and his associates.\nIn Apple\u2019s case, both of the men named in court records are Chinese citizens who were lawfully in the United States on student visas. Mr. Jiang was finishing studies in electrical engineering at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany, Ore., and Mr. Zhou was an engineering student at Oregon State University in nearby Corvallis.\nMr. Jiang is accused of trafficking in counterfeit goods and wire fraud, and he is under GPS monitoring, officials said. Mr. Zhou is accused of submitting false or misleading information on an export declaration. He made his first court appearance on Friday and was ordered to not have any contact with Apple while the case continues.\nMr. Jiang\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on Saturday. Mr. Zhou\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a message seeking comment, but the lawyer, Jamie S. Kilberg, told The Oregonian, the Portland newspaper thatfirst reported the allegations, that \u201cwe do believe that Mr. Zhou will be vindicated.\u201d\nLast year, federal agents searched Mr. Jiang\u2019s house, where they found more than 300 fake iPhones and shipping and warranty submission records.\nInvestigators found through company records more than a dozen warranty returns under Mr. Zhou\u2019s name and mailing address. More than 200 other total warranty claims were made using his name or derivations of it and other addresses linked to him, prosecutors said.\nIn August, federal agents stopped Mr. Zhou at San Francisco International Airport when he was about to leave for China, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. Among his possessions was an iPhone in like-new condition and still in a factory box.\nAn investigator from the Department of Homeland Security said he could tell from the box that it had come from Apple\u2019s warranty replacement process. But Mr. Zhou told the agent that it was brand-new and given to him by Mr. Jiang as payment for a debt."

        "fulltext": "In the eight years since \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d went on the air, the television industry has been upended. We can thank Netflix for that.\nConsider that in the streaming era, the number of scripted shows airing in the United States has shot up 86 percent, from 266 in 2011 to 495 last year.\nYet amid this glut no series has had more influence or created more industrywide envy than \u201cThrones,\u201dwhich begins its final season on HBO on April 14.\nEveryone wants its awards: \u201cThrones\u201d haswon moreEmmys than any other dramatic series ever (including best dramathree times).\nEveryone wants its reach: It\u2019s the most popular show in HBO\u2019s history and one of the most watched shows of the last decade (when including digital viewership, its most recent season averaged more than30 million viewers an episode).\nEveryone wants its scale and scope: The series was one of the most influential in an era where television budgets for dramas have ballooned from $3 million an episode to, in some cases, $10 million or more.\nEveryone wants its boldness: \u201cThrones\u201d famously killed off the face of the show, Sean Bean, before its first season was over and has repeatedly redefined assumptions about what\u2019s possible on TV, both tonally (sexposition, shocking violence) and technically (dragons, sweeping battle scenes).\n\u201cWe used to have adifferent experiencefor movies and the television business,\u201d said Gary Newman, the recently departed co-chairman of the Fox Television Group. \u201cNow you can feel it melding. I give \u2018Thrones\u2019 a lot of credit for that.\u201d\nAnd everyone, including newer outlets like Hulu and Apple, have been looking for the next \u201cThrones,\u201d a series that can define a network, and help convince people to hand over $10 or $15 a month for subscriptions.\nThree years after \u201cThrones\u201d debuted, Netflix ordered its own high budget epic series \u201cMarco Polo\u201d about the Mongol empire (which was a flop). Amazon bought the TV rights to make a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series and spent northof $200 million to do so(and still needs a script). Apple has abig-budget fantasy dramastarring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard about what happens when to humanity after everyone goes blind (which still needs a premiere date).\nThere have been lots of mixed results so far.\n\u201cIt has made everyone say, \u2018O.K., where is our \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019? Which is the exact wrong way to find your next \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Casey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO. \u201cJust to set out and say \u2018Well we\u2019re going to make our next \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d we\u2019re going to do a real giant show with a huge budget,\u2019 well that doesn\u2019t allow for all the other things that have to go right for a show to really resonate with a viewer.\u201d\nWhich is why HBO has been, as Bloys put it, \u201cdeliberate\u201d in finding its \u201cThrones\u201d successor from the universe of George R.R. Martin\u2019s books. HBO will shoot a pilot for a \u201cThrones\u201d prequel, created by Martin and Jane Goldman, in June.\nStill, \u201cThrones\u201d has helped open up a big fantasy universe for the network. In the coming months, it willairan adaptation of the controversial epic \u201cHis Dark Materials.\u201d Likewise, \u201cLeftovers\u201d co-creator Damon Lindelof is creating an adaptation of the comic books \u201cWatchmen.\u201d And HBO has other science fiction series coming from J.J. Abrams and the \u201cAvengers\u201d director Joss Whedon.\nIf such big-ticket genre series were once unthinkable for the network that made \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cSex and the City,\u201d well, little of television looks the way it did eight years ago.\n\u201cThrones\u201dbeganin April 2011 on HBO, justa few weeksafter Netflix gave a David Fincher-directed drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d astraight-to-series order. Today, Netflix makes more original programs than any studio or network and has spurred the dizzying spike in the number of television series made. It will spend at least $10 billion on content this year.\n\u201cThrones,\u201d which had a budget that started at $5 million an episode but ballooned to as much as $15 million an episode in the final season, helped create the current era of enormous spending, even for shows without CGI dragons, White Walkers and direwolves.\nFor instance, Apple committed to two seasons of a morning TV show dramedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston that the companyhas allocated$240 million to make. At the time, Apple made the pledge even though the show had no script.\n\u201c\u2018Thrones\u2019 certainly accelerated it, raising production value to an incredible place,\u201d Mr. Newman said.\n\u201cThat used to be reserved just for HBO and that\u2019s clearly no longer the case,\u201d he continued. \u201cNetflix and Amazon and now even the broadcast networks and the big cable networks like an FX, TNT are doing it. They\u2019re all realizing they have to raise their game with things that feel more epic and with greater scope to compete with what HBO and other premium services are doing.\u201d\nBloys might think that an emphasis on bigness \u2014 big budgets, big productions \u2014 is the wrong lesson to take from the success of \u201cThrones.\u201d But he does allow that it was a significant part of the formula.\n\u201c\u2018Thrones\u2019 was the first show that demonstrated you could produce a show with real cinematic scope,\u201d Bloys said. \u201cThat you could think bigger \u2014 both in terms of character and drama and in special effects. That it would work, that taking shots and spending real money and putting it on the screen would pay off.\u201d\nNow all someone has to do is find the next \u201cThrones.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple\u2019s spendy new campus in Cupertino, Calif., is a majestic temple to pomp. An etherealglass-and-marble cylinderset high on a serene hill, the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co-founder\u2019s famous \u201creality-distortion field.\u201d It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr. Jobs, smirking joyfully, would bound up to the stage, teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future.\nAnd so it was meant to go once more last week, when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as \u201ca Think Different production.\u201d\nSome different thinking did seem in order. Since becomingthe first trillion-dollar corporation last summer, Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street. TheiPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business, but more than a decade after its debut, pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one, and many customerssee little reason to upgrade.\n[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column onTwitter.]\nSo now, instead of selling better stuff to more people, Apple\u2019s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people. \u201cToday is going to be a very different kind of event,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,taking the stage.\nIt was not. From start to finish, Apple\u2019s affair was a brushed-aluminum homage to sameness \u2014a parade of servicesthat start-ups and big rivals had done earlier, polished with an Apple-y sheen of design and marketing. Among other offerings, Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card, and it offered vague details about a still-in-development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey (who are not exactly edgy or up-and-coming).\nNone of these efforts look terrible. Some, like the news service, might be handy. Yet they are all so trifling and derivative. As the analystBen Thompson noted, Apple\u2019s crush of me-too announcements falls far short of Mr. Jobs\u2019s goal of putting \u201ca ding in the universe.\u201d As I watched Apple\u2019s event, I felt the future shrink a little. In its gilded middle age, Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand, stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing, a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook.\nIn an ordinary time, such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine. But these aren\u2019t ordinary times, and Apple is no ordinary company. Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire, the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine. Under Mr. Cook, Apple hascannily avoidedevery minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years, winning a windfall from President Trump\u2019s tax cut, avoiding getting burned in his trade war \u2014 all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth.\nYet, all around Apple, the digital world is burning up. Indirectly, Apple\u2019s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction, the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy. None of these grand problems is Apple\u2019s fault, but given its centrality to the business, Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them. But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future, Apple is shrinking from it.\nConsider privacy. Mr. Cook is one of the tech industry\u2019s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information, and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations \u2014 which is just about the least Apple could do. But what if it thought a little bigger? For example, it could directly take on Google and Facebook \u2014 the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism \u2014 by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion, or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone. (Google will pay Apple anestimated $12 billionin 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone.)\nMore than restricting the present, Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future. In particular, I wonder why Apple isn\u2019t working feverishly to create new privacy-minded versions of social-media services the world needs.\nTake messaging, for starters.There is a strong moral casefor Apple to turn iMessage, its encrypted messaging app,into an open standard available to anyone, even Android users, who currently lack many privacy-minded messaging apps that aren\u2019t run by an ad company or aren\u2019t friendly with the Chinese government.\nThere might be a business case, too. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, recently reoriented his company toward messaging.As Will Oremus noted in Slate, the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple. This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one; Apple could swiftly undercut Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non-Apple world.\nHere are some other big ideas: Apple could embark on a long-term project to create a privacy-minded search engine to rival Google\u2019s. It could build an ad-free Instagram (its founders just left Facebook in frustration). It could create a YouTube that isn\u2019ta haven for neo-Nazis.\nSome (or many) of these may be dumb ideas \u2014 ideas that would ruin Apple, or at the very least kneecap its short-run profits. But they are at least big ideas; they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do. Let other companies handle streaming entertainment.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Plan to Buy $75 Billion of Its Stock Fuels Spending Debate",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Shortly after Apple used a new tax law last year to bring backmost of the $252 billion it had held abroad, the company said it wouldbuy back $100 billion of its stock.\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced its plans for another major chunk of the money: It will buy back a further $75 billion in stock.\n\u201cOur first priority is always looking after the business and making sure we continue to grow and invest,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. \u201cIf there is excess cash, then obviously we want to return it to investors.\u201d\nApple\u2019s record buybacks should be welcome news to shareholders, as the stock price is likely to climb. But the buybacks could also expose the company to more criticism that the tax cuts it received have mostly benefited investors and executives.\nSeparately on Tuesday, Apple said slumping iPhone salesshrank its profit16.4 percent, to $11.56 billion, in the latest quarter compared with a year ago.\nIn the period, the company\u2019s second fiscal quarter, iPhone sales fell 17.3 percent from the same period a year ago, to $31 billion, in part because of a larger drop in revenue in the China region. The company\u2019s services revenue, which includes app sales, grew 16.2 percent to $11.45 billion.\nOverall results exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations and Apple\u2019s share price rose more than 5 percent in early trading Wednesday. Investors had anticipated a slowdown in iPhone sales but some signs suggested business was rebounding.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on a call with analysts that business in China increased toward the end of the quarter. He attributed the improvement partly to price cuts, the Chinese government\u2019s economic stimulus, and loosening trade tensions with the United States.\nApple said it expected revenue for the current quarter would be $52.5 billion to $54.5 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 forecasts. The company also announced a 5 percent increase to its dividend.\nWhile stock buybacks have plenty of critics, many economists say the money is better off flowing into investors\u2019 pockets and into the economy instead of sitting in Apple\u2019s coffers.\n\u201cThe money isn\u2019t disappearing,\u201d said Alan Auerbach, an economics and law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cApple is basically saying: We have all this money and we prefer not to invest it right now, so we\u2019ll give it to our shareholders.\u201d\nStill, Apple\u2019s decision to return so much cash to investors is likely to provide more grist for liberal politicians who argue that giant stock buybacks are manipulations of the stock market.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, and Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and Democratic presidential candidate,recently proposed restricting such buybacks, saying they increase inequality by putting billions of dollars in the pockets of wealthy shareholders instead of into new plants and higher wages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s total insanity,\u201d said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and former presidential candidate. \u201cThe main incentive, which they will not admit to, is it improves the metrics for executive compensation that consultants develop for them.\u201d\nMr. Nader and other corporate critics say Apple could spend a small fraction of the $75 billion it plans to give to investors on a way to effectively recycle the world\u2019s computer waste, cut the prices of iPhones that have swelled past $1,000, or increase the pay of its contract workers in China. Apple has said the starting pay for workers atthe world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, in Zhengzhou, China, isabout $3.15 an hour.\n[Get theBits newsletterfor the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]\nBut some economists say that thinking is simplistic: Corporations aren\u2019t the government and shouldn\u2019t be expected to invest large sums in ventures that won\u2019t contribute to profits.\n\u201cFirms should reinvest internally when it\u2019s their best use of capital, and they should pay it out to investors when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Laurie Hodrick, a visiting finance professor at Stanford University who studies how corporations use their cash.\nMr. Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said Apple invested an appropriate amount in its business before deciding how much to return to shareholders. Over the past two quarters, Apple\u2019s spending on research and development increased 15.7 percent to $7.85 billion. \u201cCertainly making investments that are not productive are not good for anybody,\u201d he said.\nWhen it repatriated its cash under the new tax law, Apple paid $43 billion less than it would have under previous rates, bigger savings than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington. Apple has also saved billions of dollars under the lower corporate tax rate. Apple says it is spending billions in the United States, hiring new workers, building data centers, expanding offices in Texas and investing in some outside manufacturers.\nFor many big companies like Apple, stock buybacks also support higher compensation for employees, since so many of them are paid in part with company stock, said Ed Yardeni, president of the stock market research firm Yardeni Research.\nCompanies in the S&P 500 bought back a record $806 billion in stock last year, up from $519 billion in 2017, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nApple has returned the largest amounts to shareholders in history, Mr. Silverblatt said. From 2014 through 2018, Apple bought back $229 billion in stock, or more than the value of Home Depot, the 18th most valuable company in the S&P 500.\nOver that period, Microsoft was second in stock buybacks, with $66 billion, according to Mr. Silverblatt. Apple accounted for seven of the eight largest quarterly stock buybacks in history, including the latest quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said."
