        "title": "Readers Ask About Apple\u2019s New iPhone and Watch",
        "fulltext": "After Apple unveilednew iPhones and smartwatcheslast week, we asked readers to send us their questions about the devices. J. D. Biersdorfer and Brian X. Chen answer the queries.\nQ. How much is the new iPhone going to cost? Do the wireless headphones come with the phone or is a separate payment needed? What colors do they come in again? \u2014 Stephanie\nJ. D.:Here is the breakdown for the iPhone 7, without carrier subsidies or trade-up deals factored in:\n\u25a0 The 32-gigabyte model: $650.\n\u25a0 The 128-gigabyte model: $750.\n\u25a0 The 256-gigabyte model (the one with the largest capacity): $850.\nFor the larger iPhone 7 Plus:\n\u25a0 The 32-gigabyte model: $770.\n\u25a0 The 128-gigabyte model: $870.\n\u25a0 The 256-gigabyte model: $970.\nApple and most wireless carriers offer monthly payment plans to carve up the cost into smaller cash chunks. Wired earbuds are included in the box, but thewireless AirPodsare not part of the package and will cost an additional $160 when they arrive in late October.\nAs for colors, you have your choice of silver, gold, pink (\u201crose gold\u201d) or flat black for all models. A new glossy ebony shade called \u201cjet black\u201d is also available for both iPhone 7 models in the 128- and 256-gigabyte capacities, butFootnote No. 1on Apple\u2019s product specifications page warns that the color\u2019s \u201chigh shine may show fine microabrasions with use.\u201d It suggests getting a case to protect it \u2014 which may defeat the purpose of getting the stylish new color unless you like scratches or clear plastic phone cases.\nI have an iPhone 6 I purchased in November 2014 with a warranty, which expires in November 2016. Is it worth it for me to purchase an iPhone 7? \u2014 Jack Bertolino\nBrian:Based on speed alone, it is probably worthwhile to upgrade if you currently own an iPhone 6. The iPhone 7 is significantly faster than the iPhone 6. In speed tests conducted with the app Geekbench 4, the iPhone 7 was 114 percent faster than the iPhone 6.\nOther than that, the iPhone 7 camera is significantly better than the one on the iPhone 6. And when you consider the benefits of the iPhone 7\u2019s being water-and dust-resistant, over all this is a meaningful upgrade if you own an iPhone that is at least two years old.\nWhat is the weight difference for the new phones compared to past models? \u2014 Burt Herman\nJ. D.:For the iPhone models with the 4.7-inch screen size, Apple\u2019s specifications state theiPhone 6from two years ago tipped the scales at 4.55 ounces and last year\u2019siPhone 6scame in at 5.04 ounces \u2014 but theiPhone 7dips back down to 4.87 ounces. In the 5.5-inch screen category, the largeriPhone 6 Plusmodel has a listed weight of 6.07 ounces and the iPhone 6s Plus is 6.77 ounces, but theiPhone 7 Plusedges down to 6.63 ounces. In comparison, the lightest model currently for sale is theiPhone SE, which was released earlier this year. The iPhone SE, with a smaller four-inch screen, is acomparativelysvelte 3.99 ounces.\nCan other brands of wireless headphones be used with the new 7? Or are you limited to the Apple headphones because of a new type of chip in the device? \u2014 Mark Singleton\nBrian:The iPhone 7 supports the open Bluetooth standard, so third-party wireless headphones will be compatible with it. The proprietary chip you are referring to, called W1, is inside the AirPods, Apple\u2019s new wireless earbuds. The AirPods will work fully only with Apple devices. While non-Apple Bluetooth devices can connect with the AirPods for audio, they would not be able to take advantage of the AirPods\u2019 special auto-pairing feature or Siri.\nHow does the iPhone 7 camera differ from the ones on the iPhone 6 and 6s? \u2014 Pat Well\nJ. D.:Far from the measlyfixed-focus, two-megapixel camerain 2007\u2019s original iPhone, the iPhone 6 line of 2014 had aneight-megapixel camerawith a five-element lens, f/2.2 aperture, a True Tone Flash, face detection and other advanced features; the larger 6 Plus also provided optical image stabilization. TheiPhone 6sseries bumped up the camera resolution to 12 megapixels and added the animatedLive Photosfeature and4K video support\u2014 but kept the five-element lens and f/2.2 aperture, while optical image stabilization stayed exclusive to the Plus-size version.\nHowever, theiPhone 7provides optical image stabilization in both the regular and supersize models, and upgrades the hardware to a six-element lens for more colorful photos with greater image detail. The lens also has a larger aperture of f/1.8 and this year\u2019s iPhones have a flash that is 50 percent brighter than the one on last year\u2019s models.\nDevotion to serious smartphone photography is where the iPhone 7 line diverges, as the bigger iPhone 7 Plus adds a second camera on the back \u2014 a 12-megapixel telephoto unit with a f/2.8 aperture, as well as optical and digital zoom. To get professional-quality portraits, the 7 Plus uses the two cameras together to show the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.\nFor those concerned with the selfie quality in their Instagram feeds, the resolution on the front FaceTime camera has taken a huge leap since the 1.2-megapixel version on the iPhone 6, and even the five-megapixel front camera on last year\u2019s iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 now tops the line with a seven-megapixel camera staring you in the face.\nWhen you are in an app and you accidentally touch the iPhone\u2019s new home button, as it is touch-sensitive now, will the app close out? \u2014 Amanda\nBrian:No, the app will not close out. The virtual home button is not just touch-sensitive; it is force-sensitive, meaning it can detect how hard you press. In other words, you have to press down on the button to return to the home screen; when you do, the home button will vibrate in response.\nHow do you charge the new AirPods? \u2014 John Steel\nJ. D.:Thenew wireless earbudswill come with a special portable case that both stores and charges the headphones; numerous people have already described it as looking like a large dental floss dispenser. The AirPods themselves are supposed to get about five hours of use per full charge \u2014 or a minimum of three charging sessions to get through all four operas in Richard Wagner\u2019s epic\u201cRing\" cycle.\nWhen the juice runs out, you put the AirPods in the little white charging case to power up again. Apple estimates 15 minutes in the case should get the AirPods about three hours of listening time or at least an hour of talk time, as the earbuds also include microphones for phone calls or Siri commands. The special charging case needs its own power refill after about 24 hours of listening time. So before long trips, remember to charge the charging case as you charge the AirPods so the music doesn\u2019t die while you are in transit.\nCan the AirPods be used with older phones? \u2014 Curtis Bale\nBrian:Older iPhones capable of running the new operating system, iOS 10, will be compatible with the AirPods. Apple\u2019swebsitesays that iPhones all the way back to the four-year-old iPhone 5 can run iOS 10.\nWhen you say Apple will include an adapter in the box \u2014 is that for old headphones? I have very expensive headphones so I\u2019m not just looking for earbud replacements. \u2014 Margaret Smyth\nJ. D.:Yes, each new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus includes an Apple \u201cLightning to 3.5-millimeter headphone jack adapter\u201d in the box. This slender adapter allows you to connect any set of headphones with the standard 3.5-millimeter plug to the jack in the new iPhone 7. If you lose the adapter, it breaks, or you have multiple sets of headphones in rotation, you can buyadditional audio dongleson Apple\u2019s site for $9 each. Non-Apple versions of the adapter will pop up as well.\nWhen will the iPhone 7 be available unlocked? \u2014 Reid\nBrian:You can already order an iPhone 7 unlocked from Apple\u2019s online store. However, Apple\u2019s webpage makes buying an unlocked phone confusing. On the iPhone 7order page, select the model you want and select a carrier. Then choose a color and storage capacity, and finally, scroll down and select the \u201cPay in full\u201d option to buy an unlocked iPhone.\nIs the iPhone 7 the same size as the iPhone 6? Basically, will my case for the iPhone 6 fit onto the iPhone 7? \u2014 Emma Millen\nJ. D.:It depends on the type of case you have. While 2014\u2019siPhone 6and 2016\u2019siPhone 7are the same width and length, the new model (and last year\u2019siPhone 6s) is 0.01 inches thicker than the iPhone 6 \u2014 0.27 inches versus 0.28 inches deep, to be specific. So loosefitting portfolio/wallet/belt-clip cases or generic bumpers may still work depending on the individual design, but if you have a sleek form-fitting case with precise notches carved out for ports and components, you will probably need to go shopping. That\u2019s because the upgraded camera system on the back of the iPhone 7 is bigger and needs a larger piece cut away than what is provided by many cases specifically designed for the iPhone 6/6s line.\nAdditionally, if you plan to use the iPhone 7\u2019s new second speaker along the bottom edge \u2014 and do not have a case that provides a gap for it \u2014 things may sound a little muffled.\nI just purchased an Apple Watch within the past two weeks. Since they are selling the older version of the watch, called Series 1, with an upgraded processor, is there any chance Apple will replace the processors on recently purchased watches? \u2014 Randy Eichen\nBrian:Probably not. For Apple, upgrading the older Apple Watch with a new chip was not as simple as sticking a faster chip inside it \u2014 it required re-engineering parts of the watch to support the new chip. If you have buyer\u2019s remorse and would like the Apple Watch Series 1 with the faster processor, your best bet is to go to an Apple Store and ask for an exchange.\nApple\u2019s return policy gives you 14 days to return an item for a refund or exchange. Even if you have passed that deadline, there is a good chance that if you beg politely, a store representative will make an exception, given the circumstances.\nWill there be a splitter available to allow recharging and listening through the headphone jack at the same time? \u2014 Meridee\nJ. D.:Yes, optional accessories are coming to the rescue for those who want to simultaneously charge the phone\u2019s battery while using a pair of wired headphones.\nEarly products include Belkin\u2019s $40Lighting Audio and Charge RockStar adapterand Apple\u2019s own $49iPhone Lightning Dock. Expect other products as well. Belkin\u2019s glossy white accessory basically turns one Lightning port into two. Apple\u2019s latest device dock cradles the phone as it sits atop a Lightning connector for charging or syncing to a computer; the dock is available in five colors and compatible with all previous Lightning port-equipped iPhone models. The back of the dock provides a 3.5-millimeter audio jack to plug in a pair of headphones \u2014 including the new Lightning headphones with the free adapter that comes with the new iPhone 7 family."

That was useful.\nA.On Apple\u2019s redesignedlock screen for iOS 10, swipe to the left on the lock screen (instead of swiping up) to open the Camera app quickly. It may be hard to see depending on your lock-screen image, but the screen now shows three tiny icons at the bottom, including one for a camera.\nIf you swipe the lock screen to the right, the iPhone displaysthe Today view, which shows your calendar appointments and information fromwidgets\u2014 those little mini-apps that display bits of data like the current temperature from the Weather app. You can customize the widgets list by tapping the Edit button at the bottom of the Today screen.\nSwiping down from the top of the lock screen still shows the iOSNotificationsscreen with its list of alerts from your news and communications apps. On a late-model iPhone, tap the notification to open its app, or press down with 3D Touch to see a menu for sharing or saving the alert.

        "title": "IPhone 7 Review: Though Not Perfect, New iPhones Keep Apple\u2019s Promises",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s iPhone, just short of 10 years old, has hit puberty.\nLike adolescents coping with awkward changes to their bodies, theiPhone 7, due for release on Friday, introduces some uncomfortable transitions. They include the much ballyhooedremoval of the headphone jackand the replacement of the physical home button with a virtual one.\nFor Apple customers, this creates a difficult choice. While upgrading iPhones in the past was typically a no-brainer, now people must wrestle with whether to deal with the hassle of having no audio jack. Many people could simply upgrade to last year\u2019s model, the iPhone 6S, which is also a fast phone with great cameras and still has the jack.\nYet after testing the new iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the 7 Plus, for five days, I have hopped on the 7 train. While it is irritating not to have an audio jack \u2014 Apple nixed the 3.5 millimeter port to make room for faster chips, better batteries and to make the iPhone water-resistant \u2014 and the older physical home button feels better to press than the new virtual one, the new iPhones deliver on Apple\u2019s promises.\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are tremendously fast \u2014 more than double the speed of the two-year-old iPhone 6 \u2014 and their cameras produce superb, vivid photos. The battery life is improved, and the iPhones survived water torture tests.\nAnd after a while, I didn\u2019t miss the headphone jack as much as I thought. Apple is pushing people toward wireless earphones with the introduction ofAirPods, its first wireless earbuds, which I tried. I found AirPods to be a decent first attempt at wireless audio, though there were glitches.\nThe bottom line: Those who have been waiting years to buy a new phone are in store for a major upgrade with the iPhone 7.\nWhenrumors surfacedabout the iPhone 7, they centered on Apple\u2019s omission of the decades-old headphone jack, one of the longest surviving technology standards. The now-discontinued port let consumers plug many accessories in, including speakers, earphones and credit card readers. Now the new iPhones have only one port for hooking up accessories: Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning connector that was traditionally used for charging the iPhone\u2019s battery.\nApple understood that parting with the audio jack would be painful. So it made two moves:\n1) The new iPhones include a converter, or a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in an audio accessory.\n2) Also included in the box: A pair of wired earbuds with a Lightning connector.\nFor iPhone owners who relied on Apple\u2019s included earbuds, the Lightning earbuds solve that problem. But for consumers hoarding lots of wired audio gear, the converter solution is less convenient since the adapter is tiny and easy to lose. If you have a pair of great wired headphones, your best bet is to leave the converter connected to the headphones so you don\u2019t forget it.\nThe most convenient workaround to not having a headphone jack is to make the leap to wireless earphones. Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods, due for release in October, cost $159 and come in a box that resembles a dental-floss dispenser. They connect to the iPhone\u2019s Bluetooth connection via a proprietary chip in the earphones, called W1.\nThis makes setting AirPods up extremely easy: When you open the box next to the iPhone, the earphones automatically pair with the device. (The box also charges AirPods.) From there, you simply put the earphones on and start listening to music or podcasts; removing the earphones causes the audio to pause.\nHere is where AirPods fell short for me: Sometimes when listening to podcasts, a glitch caused the podcasts to rewind and replay a small segment \u2014 an eerie echo. In addition, when using AirPods outside, there was occasional interference, causing the audio to crackle and cut out.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the company was looking into the podcast issue, adding that the AirPods I tested were early hardware and that bugs should be resolved by the time they are released next month.\nOver all, AirPods sound decent, with loud bass and clear audio quality, comparable to the wired earbuds that Apple has included in iPhones for years. They aren\u2019t, however, sufficient for drowning out the thunderous prattle of a loud co-worker.\nWhile AirPods do a good job staying in your ears, they look odd, like dangling short white stubs. They evoked mockery from one of my editors, who said, \u201cCigarettes belong in your mouth, not your ears, Brian.\u201d\nI recommend waiting for Apple to fix the issues with AirPods before considering them. Meanwhile, there are plenty of great Bluetooth headphones. My favorite isBose\u2019s QuietComfort 35, a pair of fantastic wireless noise-canceling headphones.\nThe most compelling improvement on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the sharp speed increase. Spurred by faster chips, everything \u2014 switching between apps, opening the camera \u2014 feels snappier. The iPhone 7 battery also gets about two hours more juice than the 6S.\nUsing the app Geekbench 4, I tested the speeds of the iPhone 7, 6S and 6. The iPhone 7 was 39 percent faster than the 6S and 114 percent faster than the 6. So people who bought the 6S last year can probably skip upgrading to the 7, but those holding onto a 6 and anything older will benefit from a tremendous performance gain.\nApple also improved the iPhone cameras. Like the 6S devices, the iPhone 7 devices carry 12-megapixel sensors. The difference is that both the new iPhones include optical image stabilization, a feature that helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. The larger model, the 7 Plus, also includes a second camera on the back. The two cameras work together to show the photo\u2019s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background.\nIn my tests comparing photos taken with the iPhone 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as a competitor, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7, photos taken with the 7 Plus had noticeably better detail when reviewed on a large computer monitor. But when reviewing photos taken with each camera side by side on a smaller smartphone screen, the differences were negligible.\nSo while the new iPhones have great cameras, I wouldn\u2019t let that drive your buying decision. If you prefer a larger screen for reading and watching videos, consider the 7 Plus, but if you prefer something easier to carry in a pocket and type on using one hand, go for the 7. (The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.)\nLastly, Apple made changes to the new iPhones to improve durability. The iPhones are designed to be water-resistant. In my tests, they survived a swim in a water pitcher. The physical home button was replaced with a force-sensitive virtual one. It remains to be seen if the new home button will be more durable. In the past, one of the first components to wear out on older iPhones was the home button.\nThere are two types of tech consumers: Those who upgrade on a fairly regular cycle (about every two years with smartphones) to embrace new technology, and those who upgrade only when they feel they need to.\nIf you\u2019re in the former camp and own an iPhone that is at least two years old, the decision is obvious: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades. But if you just bought the iPhone 6S last year, the improvements will be incremental, and you may want to save your money for the next iPhone.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter group, it\u2019s a tougher question. If you have, say, the four-year-old iPhone 5, you will see a great improvement with an iPhone 6S or a 7. Your decision may come down to how much the lack of a headphone jack and physical home button bothers you. Audiophiles with lots of wired accessories, for example, may find using a converter too inconvenient.\nBut taking the leap to the 7 may be a wise bet, even for late technology adopters. Apple is likely to continue making iPhones without headphone jacks, and next year\u2019s iPhone will have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen, according to two people at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because the product details are private. Apple declined to comment on next year\u2019s iPhones.\nTo compete with Apple, rivals may also eliminate the audio jack to make room for faster processors, better batteries and more durable parts. (A little-known fact: Lenovo beat Apple to removing the audio jack in its new smartphone, Moto Z, released this year.)\nSooner or later, consumers will probably look back at the iPhone\u2019s puberty phase and accept that changes had to be made for the smartphone to mature. I, for one, am looking forward to a future with fewer wires."

        "title": "Here Come the iPhone 7 and iOS 10 Apps: What to Try First",
        "fulltext": "APPLE released the iPhone 7 last week along with iOS 10, a major upgrade for its popular mobile operating system. What better time to download some apps to take the new hardware and software for a spin?\nIn one update, Apple\u2019s messaging system, iMessage, got a turbo boost. It now lets people embellish conversations with stickers, interactive drawings and animations. The messaging system even gets its own App Store for downloading third-party stickers and games.\nMy favorite sticker app isStar Wars Stickersfrom Disney. The $2 app provides a number of cute, animated, cartoon images of characters from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise, including BB-8, Obi-Wan Kenobi and C-3PO with his classic \u201cOh, my!\u201d catchphrase.\nYou can send the stickers as stand-alone images or drop them on top of written messages or photos. Add them to selfies you\u2019re sending in iMessage, and suddenly the Death Star is exploding above you. The freePac-Mansticker pack is another great option for some retro fun.\nTheGrammar Snobsticker app, for $1, lets you add editorial red ink over a text message to fix a friend\u2019s bad grammar.\nSticker Pals, which is free, is a more contemporary option, with hundreds of animated cartoon characters and special effects, as well as a neat feature that lets users send stickers to friends for their use. And the freeAardman Face Bombsticker pack includes funny cartoon faces in the style of the Aardman animation studio.\nApple iMessage also lets you play games within the app. With classic games likeWords With Friends, which is free, this feature makes chatting throughout a game easier, so you can express your feelings when someone gets 50 points by dropping a word on a triple-word-score square. In addition,Chess42is a free chess game that you can play directly inside an iMessage chat.\nThere are also plenty of utility apps that can make iMessage more powerful. TheDoodle: Schedule Makerapp lets users set up a simple in-message voting system for particular dates \u2014 perfect for trying to pin down a time to get together with one or more contacts. Doodle is free.\nWhen you need to split the bill, tryCircle Pay, a digital money-transfer system that lets people send dollars, euros or Bitcoin through iMessage. The Circle Pay app requires some setup and registration, but it works simply in the iMessage interface, and it, too, is free.\nThe appiTranslatebrings dynamic automated language translation to iMessage. You can chat with someone who speaks a different language and translate the conversation in real time, without having to leave the chat interface. It\u2019s free, and it works fast and quite well, though the controls can be confusing and sometimes, as with any machine translation, the result may sound like a Spanish or Portuguese version of Yoda.\nAnother test of the new iPhone\u2019s performance is how it handles games.Monument Valley, which is $4, is a highly regarded 3-D puzzle game with clean, abstract graphics and simple gameplay: You have to guide your character through an architectural labyrinth that\u2019s part M. C. Escher, part artwork all its own. Don\u2019t be surprised if you stop just to admire how pretty it is.\nTheObscuraapp, at $5, lets users take full control of the photographic powers of the iPhone\u2019s camera app. You can adjust the ISO and focus to get really creative; it\u2019s almost like using a digital single-lens reflex camera.\nMove beyond Apple\u2019s built-in keyboard with Microsoft\u2019sWord Flow, which is free. Get a deeper understanding of how we measure time on Earth with the lovelyCosmic Watchclock app for $4. Back up your photos and documents to the cloud withGoogle Drive, which is free. And finally, turn your iPhone into a capable document scanner for $4 withScanner Pro 7.\nDataMan Prois a popular app for tracking which apps on your phone are consuming the most mobile data. The app has been updated for iOS 10. It\u2019s $6 and also works with Apple Watch.\nThe third-party keyboard appSwiftKeyhas always been popular because its predictive text features are great, but on Android, its makers have just taken the app to a new level. SwiftKey now has neural artificial intelligence, so instead of a simple suggestion algorithm, it looks at what you\u2019re typing and tries to grasp the context of your message so it can provide better suggestions. SwiftKey is free."

        "title": "Apple Kicks the Tires at McLaren",
        "fulltext": "McLaren\u2019s cars travel fast, but rumors about Apple acquisitions can flash by, too.\nApple approached McLaren, which is based in Britain, about an investment or purchase, according to The Financial Times. The $610 billion Apple, though, has made few acquisitions, even to help it pioneer smartphones. While McLaren is a high-tech supercar and Formula One business, it is still hard to see it taking Apple\u2019s vehicular ambitions far.\nApple executives might enjoy such a bauble. The design guru Jony Ive has a penchant for Aston Martins and Bentleys. Eddy Cue, head of software and services, sits on Ferrari\u2019s board. But Apple\u2019s typical market is far bigger than the rarefied one for $1 million automobiles. And the technology of designing racecars does not trickle down very fast \u2014 BMW retains an aura of tech leadership and refinement despite dropping its Formula One team years ago.\nOver the last year Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has, according to reports, sniffed around the electric-car maker Tesla Motors, the entertainment giant Time Warner, the video-streaming site Netflix, the music service Tidal, the camera maker GoPro and the software producer Adobe. The spread of technology, Apple\u2019s lack of hit new products and its giant cash hoard \u2014 more than $230 billion \u2014 explain why both outsiders and some insiders might fancy and even start exploring all kinds of options.\nEven if any of the above were both real and serious, however, they have not happened because Apple so far has countenanced only small deals. Its largest ever was for the headphone maker Beats Electronics,acquired for $3 billionin 2014. When Apple entered the mobile phone market, some thought it might have to buy a manufacturer like Palm. Instead, it snapped up bits and pieces of the technology it needed, like its Siri voice-activated assistant.\nPerhaps the promise and challenges of autonomous electric cars will force Apple to change its habits. Even the dedicated carmaker Tesla, for example, used a Lotus-produced chassis and body for its first model. But the simpler explanation probably applies. Fancy can run free when a company has so much cash. A McLaren deal is probably already no more than a dot disappearing over the horizon."

        "title": "Daily Report: The iPhone 7 Verdict Is In",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s new phone may be the same size, but it is shrinking down lots of unexpected things. How far you are from your music, for example, or the time between you and your apps. Additionally, the width of your wallet can shrink quite a bit from the removal of money.\nBrian X. ChenreviewsApple\u2019s 10th generation iPhone in Tuesday\u2019s New York Times. The phone made its premiere to much ballyhoo last week, and goes on sale Friday.\nLike its predecessor, the iPhone 7 will cost about $650. The most talked-about accessory is a pair of wireless headphones that will cost $160 more. Not cheap, in other words, to buy the full experience.\nAn editor told Brian the little wireless tubes coming out of the buds looked like he had tiny cigarettes in his ears (to me, they are more like drain pipes.) But the sound, Brian says, is quite good, and the engineering is clever.\nI borrowed them and realized something else: It\u2019s a very different feeling to listen to music from earbuds without wires leading back to the phone. It\u2019s more intimate than using either standard earbuds or wireless headphones, a direct and full relationship to your music.\nImmediacy does seem to be a design goal. The faster processor means getting the camera on or moving among apps is closer to instantaneous. The battery lasts longer, too, so there is less time away from the phone while it is charging.\nThat may not seem like a lot of time saving, but it adds up, maybe even creating enough space to fill by yet more software. And, as Natasha Singerreports, more is certainly on the way: Apple has also released free software that teaches schoolchildren how to write programs.\nFree, that is, to any child or school that buys an Apple iPad."

        "fulltext": "\nApple plans to release a free coding education app on Tuesday that it developed with middle-school students in mind, in the latest salvo among technology companies to gain share in the education market and to nurture early product loyalty among children.\nApple\u2019s app, calledSwift Playgrounds, introduces basic computer programming concepts, like sequencing logic, by asking students to use word commands to move cartoon avatars through a fanciful, animated world. Unlike some children\u2019s apps, which employ drag-and-drop blocks to teach coding, the Apple program uses Swift, a professional programming language that the company introduced in 2014.\n\u201cWhen you learn to code with Swift Playgrounds, you are learning the same language used by professional developers,\u201d Brian Croll, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take the next step and learn to write a real app.\u201d\nThe introduction of Apple\u2019s app coincides with a larger Silicon Valley campaign to press public schools to teach coding. Tech executives have argued that such training could help address socio-economic differences among students, by providing them with marketable job skills. In January, President Obama said he was asking Congress to provide $4 billion in the budget fora computer science initiativein public schools. (Congress has not yet passed a budget.)\n\u201cWe believe every student should have the opportunity to code,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said during a company event last week to introduce theiPhone 7.\nTech companies are in heated competition for the education market. Apple devices and ones based on the Microsoft Windows software have recently lost market share at United States public schools to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on the Google Chrome operating system.\nThe Apple coding app is free, but it requires an iPad, the company\u2019s tablet computer, which has declining sales and which many schools and families may not be able to afford.\n\u201cHow much of the motivation is for selling of product, and what does that do for schools that cannot afford this technology?\u201d askedJane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education & Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied disparities in computer science education for more than two decades. \u201cThe threat is that it is going to replicate current inequities.\u201d\nMr. Croll of Apple said the company was making the app free so that the coding lessons are accessible. While it is available for use in schools, individual students, parents and consumers could also use the app to teach themselves to code at home, he said. He added that Apple had created the app for the iPad to ensure a high-quality user experience.\nApple said that more than 100 schools and districts worldwide had agreed to try the coding app with their students.\n\u201cWe are hoping it will be a good transition between block-coding and language-coding,\u201d said Trang Lai, the director of educational services at the Fullerton School District, a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade public school system in Fullerton, Calif. Her district provides an iPad for every student in grades five through eight.\nMs. Lai said the district had previously bought coding apps that did not work well on iPads, and that it was now eager to try Swift Playgrounds.\n\u201cRight now, that is what is current,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what is available, and that is what is free.\u201d"

        "title": "Elizabeth Warren: What Apple Teaches Us About Taxes",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 APPLE got a big surprise last week when the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect more than $14 billion in back taxes from the company. The global giant had been attributing billions of dollars in profits to a phantom head office, allowing it to pay a tax rate of 1 percent or lower.\nBoth Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision, but the commission\u2019s announcement was the latest sign that multinational corporations are running out of places to hide from paying taxes. The door is now open for Congress to fix our own corporate tax code, which has allowed the biggest multinationals to shirk their obligations for decades.\nThe Apple ruling is big, but it is only the latest international effort to end the deals that American multinationals have used to pay near-zero tax rates. The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe. Also last year, Britain enacted a new tax to target profits siphoned off by international companies \u2014 nicknamed, without much subtlety, the \u201cGoogle tax.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 nations are coordinating on a global effort to end the cross-border games that allow companies to avoid taxation by moving money among various subsidiaries. Multinational corporations are especially worried about losing access to Cayman Island-style tax rates in European countries where they can also get rule of law, political stability and an educated professional class of attorneys and consultants.\nThe Treasury Department has pushed back against the European Commission over the Apple case, concerned about the impact on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority. But Treasury has also finalized new country-by-country reporting requirements that could help expose the jaw-dropping variety of tax-dodging schemes multinational companies employ. At the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, President Obama reiterated his support for a cooperative global effort to end the international tax shell game.\nNow that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home. But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.\nFirst, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.\nSecond, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.\nThird, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.\nI have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.\nFor years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States. When they do, they should pay their fair share, just as working families and small businesses have been all along."

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Aloha, Farhad! I\u2019m excited to say I will soon be on a beach in Hawaii,eating Pok\u00e9and sipping a virgin pi\u00f1a colada. Someday, when I grow up, my parents will allow me to drink adult beverages.\nFarhad:Oh man, you\u2019re leaving! Our long national nightmare is finally over.\nMike:Indeed! So, let\u2019s do a bit of tech news before I go.\nThis week was a technology news vacuum surrounding the Apple event, which sucked out all of the air in Silicon Valley. Usually, a smart company or two will bury big negative news on the day of the Apple event, while everyone else is distracted by horrifying, earth-shattering iPhone product changes like, uh, theloss of a headphone jack.\nLike, for instance, Snapchat deciding to cut some of its\u201clocal stories\u201d curatorsin some markets, roughly 15 employees. It\u2019s not a gigantic story, but if you read between the lines, Snapchat\u2019s future focus is on live events \u2014 like the Super Bowl and the Olympics \u2014 and less on everyday material that the curators previously focused on.\nThat should be worrisome to Twitter, whosegiant push into live eventsis really an enormous bet on the company\u2019s future.\nFarhad:I have to say, Snapchat has lately become my second-favorite social news source, after Twitter. I think its news team does an amazing job of covering huge, dispersed events.\nFor instance, the Snapchat Live stories covering the Louisiana flooding last month were the best reporting on that that I saw. Most other outlets give you several people\u2019s perspectives on a story, usually second hand. On Snapchat, you see dozens of people\u2019s snaps showing different parts of a story \u2014 in this case people showing their homes getting flooded, going to shelters, dealing with the aftermath. It was an incredibly emotionally resonant way to depict the kind of news story that can otherwise seem remote.\nAlso, it\u2019s fun to take pictures of my face as a bee.\nMike:Some important news out of Airbnb, which has committed toenforcing a nondiscrimination policy,after widespread complaints that hosts\u2019 discrimination against guests of color was running rampant across the platform.\nI think this is a good, necessary and long overdue thing. I\u2019ve had many friends tell me of their continuous rejections on Airbnb. Here\u2019s to hoping it actually curbs the discrimination.\nFarhad:It\u2019s good that they\u2019re doing it, but I do wonder how well it will work. The fundamental problem they face is that there are lots of racists in this world. And I\u2019m guessing racists are going to have trouble suppressing their racism when they\u2019re renting out one of their most precious goods. If cracking down starts to curb bookings or people\u2019s willingness to rent out their houses, how strictly will Airbnb enforce these guidelines? We\u2019ll see, I guess.\nMike:Agree. I\u2019m not going to applaud them for doing something they should have thought of addressing a long time ago, anyway.\nNext, I would be remiss not to talk about \u201cjackgate,\u201d or \u201cheadphoneapocalypse,\u201d or whatever term we\u2019re using to describe Apple ditching the headphone jack. John Paczkowski of Buzzfeed covered it in great detailin this piece, which you should read if you haven\u2019t.\nFarhad:I was pretty critical of Apple inmy column this week, but I think they managed the messaging around the headphone jack really well. They earned a lot of good will by putting an adapter to let you use your old headphones in the box with the new iPhone. And it also helps that they\u2019re trying to pave the way for much better wireless audio quality in the future.\nOne big test of success here \u2014 other than sales \u2014 will be what other smartphone manufacturers do now. If we suddenly start seeing the headphone jack disappearing from all high-end phones, Apple will have won the argument.\nMike:Have you seen all the gymnastics it takes to plug the adapter and analog cord in, not to mention if you want to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time? It\u2019s like trying to plug my old Nintendo into a spaghetti pile of cables behind my TV. I don\u2019t like it one bit.\nSpeaking of Nintendo, today I\u2019d like to focus on something that got a little bit less attention during the Big Apple keynote: Super Mario.\nYes, that\u2019s right, the world\u2019s most beloved plumber is coming to the iPhone rather soon \u2014 before the end of the year, Nintendo said \u2014 in the Japanese video game giant\u2019s first ever Mario franchise on iOS. It\u2019s called Super Mario Run, and it\u2019s a neat-looking side-scroller you can play with one hand, even on the subway.\nThis is a watershed moment for Nintendo, long considered a laggard in its approach to mobile gaming. As you may well know, the advent of the iPhone \u2014 and Android \u2014 was kind of a big deal. The mass adoption of smartphones upended entire industries, like GPS navigation companies, mapping sites, and yes, even video game makers. More and more people who once looked to consoles, desktop PCs or even hand-held devices to get their gaming fix are now playing iPhone games, downloading them directly from the app store without the hassle of going to buy a new video game DVD or another console.\nThat\u2019s a massive shift in a mega-market, something that came virtually overnight. And Nintendo, the world\u2019s pre-eminent legacy video game company, has really struggled to recalibrate.\nI take this Mario thing as a big deal. But tell me your thoughts on the matter.\nFarhad:I agree. It\u2019s a big deal for Nintendo, which now has a plausible path to sell all of its old content to a new audience, and it\u2019s a big deal for Apple, which can once again point to an app that is available only on iOS, and will come to Android at some point down the line.\nBut really the deeper story here is that smartphones are unstoppable. Everyone in tech keeps looking for the next big thing, but to me the biggest story in tech continues to be the way smartphones keep swallowing up every other gadget. The best smartphone cameras are now much better than any snapshot camera you can buy, and for most people, a phone is the only camera they need. The Nintendo announcement shows that phones have now completely consumed mobile gaming, too.\nMy own prediction: TV is next. Last night I watched the first episode of Season 2 of \u201cNarcos\u201d on my phone.\nMike:All on your phone? Yeesh, David Lynchwould have an aneurysmhearing that.\nFarhad:Yeah. Then I watched several Snapchat stories about the Kardashians getting stuck in an elevator, also all on my phone. In other words, I love my phone.\nHave a great vacation, Mike!\nMike: Aloha! See you in two weeks!"
