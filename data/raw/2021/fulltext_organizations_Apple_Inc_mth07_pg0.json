        "title": "Delays, More Masks and Mandatory Shots: Virus Surge Disrupts Office-Return Plans",
        "fulltext": "Several hospital systems that previously held off makingvaccines mandatory for health care workersarenow willing to do so. Google employees in California who have voluntarilyreturned to the officeare again wearing masks indoors. Goldman Sachs is considering whether to reinstitute testing for fully vaccinated employees in the company\u2019s New York City offices, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because nothing had been decided. And on Monday,Apple told its work forcethat it would push back itsreturn-to-officedate from September to October.\nWhen companies began announcing tentative return-to-office plans this spring, there was a sense of optimism behind the messages. Covid cases were dwindling in the United States as the vaccine rollout picked up pace. Employers largely hoped their workers would get shots on their own, motivated by raffle tickets, paid time off and other perks, if not by the consensus of the medical community.\nIn recent days, that tone has suddenly shifted. The Delta variant, a more contagious version of the coronavirus, is sweeping through the country. Fewer than half of Americans arefully vaccinated, exacerbating the situation.\nNationally, the daily average of new coronavirus infections surged 180 percent in 14 days to 45,343 by Thursday, and deaths \u2014 a lagging number \u2014 are up 30 percent from two weeks ago, to nearly 252,according to New York Times case counts. Vaccines are still unavailable for children under 12, many of whom are preparing for an in-personreturn to schoolthis fall.\nIt all adds up to a difficult calculation for America\u2019s business leaders, who hoped the country would already be fully on a path to normalcy, with employees getting back to offices. Instead, individual companies are now being forced to make tough decisions that they had hoped could be avoided, such as whether to reverse reopening plans or institutevaccine mandatesfor employees. All the while, they continue to grapple with the unpredictable nature of the pandemic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s emotionally draining on all of us, and it drives the top management teams crazy,\u201d said Bob Sutton, a psychology professor at Stanford University who studies leadership and organizations. He said some executives he had advised were \u201cpulling their hair out\u201d over what to do.\nFor employerswaryof the legal ramifications and political backlash of mandating a vaccine, the tide has begun to turn, if ever so slightly.\n\u201cAt the beginning, there were a lot of employers that were concerned about jumping in too soon and being the one out front \u2014 it is a divisive issue,\u201d said David Barron, a labor and employment lawyer at the law firm Cozen O\u2019Connor. \u201cThe calculus starts to shift a little bit when you see another spike.\u201d\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York on Fridayencouraged private employersto require workers to get vaccinated. He also said the city might broaden the number of city workers required to get vaccinated or to be tested weekly.\nRecent court decisions have upheld employers\u2019 rights to require vaccinations, including arulingthat saidHouston Methodist Hospitalcould require health care workers to get shots. On Monday, a federal judgeruledthat Indiana University could require students to be vaccinated as well.\n\u201cThe legal authority continues to line up on the side of employers being allowed to mandate vaccines if they choose to,\u201d said Douglas Brayley, an employment lawyer at the global law firm Ropes & Gray.\nWhen Twitter reopened its San Francisco office this month at 50 percent capacity for those who wanted to go back, only vaccinated workers were allowed inside. In June, a civilian group that oversees the Los Angeles Police Department was examining the possibility ofrequiring police officers to get shots. And numerous colleges have required students and staff to be fully inoculated before they step foot on campus in the fall.\n\u201cThe recent news of Delta surging in some places is just adding to that determination to be as safe as we possibly can,\u201d said Tim Killeen, the president of the University of Illinois System, which instituted a vaccine requirement Wednesday.\nNovant Health, a North Carolina-based health care company with more than 35,000 employees, said Thursday that it would make vaccinations mandatory for its workers by Sept. 15. Its efforts to overcome vaccine hesitancy through education and making shots easily accessible had stagnated.\n\u201cNow that almost four billion doses of vaccine have been given around the world, and we see that it\u2019s safe and effective, we see that the Delta variant is obviously here, and we have it in our communities, and that almost all the patients being added to our hospitals are unvaccinated, the time was right to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to move forward with requiring vaccines of our team members,\u2019\u201d Dr. David Priest, the company\u2019s chief safety officer, said.\nFor others, high voluntary vaccination rates among employees have made requiring the shot simpler. Morgan Stanley, the investment banking firm, is requiring employees and guests at its New York offices to befully vaccinated, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss company protocols. By the time it imposed the mandate in June,90 percent of its employees were vaccinated.\nVaccine mandates are still not the approach that most companies are taking. And the risk that the coronavirus poses to much of the population is far from what it was at the worst of the pandemic. New cases, hospitalizations and deaths remain at a small fraction of their previous peaks, largely localized to areas with low vaccination rates. Vaccines remain effective against the worst outcomes of Covid-19,including from the Delta variant.\n\u201cThe big question is not so much \u2018Can we keep workers safe in our buildings?\u2019 but \u2018Will workers feel comfortable enough coming back, even if good controls are in place?\u2019\u201d said Joseph Allen, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who advises companies on Covid-19 strategies. \u201cThere\u2019s a renewed anxiety that maybe started to dissipate in the spring \u2014 but it\u2019s back.\u201d\nThat tension may make it more difficult to persuade workers to return to the office. In California\u2019s Silicon Valley, tech companies largely embraced the new era of remote work during the pandemic. But not all have been eager to let their employees stay home for good.\nIn June, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, told employees that they would be required to return to the office at least three days a week, starting in September. About 1,800 employees sent Mr. Cook a letter calling for a more flexible approach.\nHe did not respond, but days later Apple posted an internal video in which company executives doubled down on bringing workers back to the office. In the video, Dr. Sumbul Desai, who helps run Apple\u2019s digital health division, encouraged workers to get vaccinated but stopped short of saying they would be required to, according to a transcript viewed by The Times.\nThe video didn\u2019t sit well with some employees.\n\u201cOK, you want me to put my life on the line to come back to the office, which will also decrease my productivity, and you\u2019re not giving me any logic on why I actually need to do that?\u201d said Ashley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager.\nWhen the company delayed its return-to-office date on Monday, a group of employees drafted a new letter, proposing a one-year pilot program in which people could work from home full time if they chose to. The letter said an informal survey of more than 1,000 Apple employees found that roughly two-thirds would question their future at the company if they were required to return to the office.\nIn Los Angeles, Endeavor, the parent company of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, reopened its Beverly Hills headquarters this month. But it decided to shut down again last week when thecounty reimposed its indoor mask mandatein the face of surging case counts. An Endeavor spokesman said the company had decided that enforcement would be too difficult and would hinder group meetings.\nThe employment website Indeed had been targeting Sept. 7 as the date when it would start bringing workers back on a hybrid basis. Now it has begun to reconsider those plans, the company\u2019s senior vice president of human resources, Paul Wolfe, said, \u201cbecause of the Delta variant.\u201d\nSome companies said the recent spike in cases had not yet affected their return-to-office planning. Facebook still intends to reopen at 50 percent capacity by early September. IBM plans to open its U.S. offices in early September, with fully vaccinated employees free to go without a mask, and Royal Dutch Shell, the gas company, has been gradually lifting restrictions in its Houston offices, prompting more of its workers to return.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise began allowing employees to return to its offices Monday, bolstered by a survey of its California employees that found 94 percent were fully vaccinated.\n\u201cThat gives us an added layer of comfort,\u201d a company spokesman, Adam Bauer, said.\nWells Fargo told its employees on July 16 that it would begin to bring employees currently working remotely back to the office on Sept. 7. But unlike banks that earlier called workers back withdeclarative languageringing in a new stage of the pandemic, the memo, sent by the bank\u2019s chief operating officer, Scott Powell, had a notable degree of caution.\n\u201cThe timing communicated in this message is dependent on our assumption that the pandemic continues to remain stable or further improves,\u201d Mr. Powell wrote. \u201cWe continue to actively monitor the situation and any developments, including new variants.\u201d\nReporting was contributed byJack Nicas,Brooks Barnes,Clifford KraussandSarah Kessler."

        "fulltext": "Tensions are growing betweenChinaand tech companies inside \u2014 and outside \u2014 its borders.\nChina is cracking down on domestic tech giants with U.S. ties.On Sunday, Beijing officialsordered Didi, the ride-hailing app, to be removed from the country\u2019s app stores over concerns about the handling of customer data, days after the company completed a blockbuster U.S. I.P.O. Yesterday, they suspended new user registrations for platforms run by two other Chinese companies that recently listed shares in New York,citing the need for cybersecurity reviews. Didi\u2019s sharesfell nearly 30 percent in premarket trading, below their I.P.O. price.\nMeanwhile, U.S. tech firms are making threats about their businesses in Hong Kong.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and other American tech groups havethreatened to pull out of the territoryif the government doesn\u2019t roll back efforts to control online speech there. The threat was made in a letter sent last month by an American trade group representing Big Tech in Asia.\nA trans-Pacific tech breakup would be messy.Many large U.S. tech companies, notably Apple, have spent billions of dollars building their presences in China, both by moving manufacturing there and by courting local customers. Aninvestigation by The Timesshowed the lengths Apple has gone to keep Chinese regulators happy, even breaking some of the privacy pledges the company has made to customers.\nGoing the other way, Chinese tech firms have enthusiastically tapped U.S. capital markets, raising more than $15 billion in New York I.P.O.s this year,according to Bloomberg. China\u2019s crackdown last year on Ant Group, whichpostponed plans to go publicin Shanghai and Hong Kong, made its shallower domestic markets less appealing to local firms. Some see Beijing\u2019s latest campaign as retaliation for selling stakes to U.S. investors, and the 30-odd companies that have pending U.S. listings \u2014 and the investors they have lined up to buy shares \u2014 may now think twice.\nFurther reading: A look atthe $150 million semiconductor chip-making machineproduced by a Dutch company that has become a key lever in the tech cold war between China and the U.S.\nOil prices rise as OPEC fails to reach a deal on production.Brent crude traded atmultiyear highsafter the alliance of oil producers wasunable to agreeon how much more oil to produce.

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nThe already bonkers dollars ofBig Techhave become even bonkers-er.\nMy colleaguesand Ihave writtena lotabout the unreal sales, profits and oomph of America\u2019s five technology titans \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. This might feel like old news. Tech\u2019s Titanic 5 have been big and rich for a long time, and they\u2019ve gotten even more so as people and organizations have needed their products during the coronavirus pandemic. Yadda, yadda, yadda. We get it.\nBut no, we really don\u2019t get it. American\u2019s technology superstars have launched into a completely different stratosphere than even other wildly successful companies in tech and beyond.\nLet me give you a flavor of the bonkers-ness:\nThe current stock market value of the Big Five ($9.3 trillion) is more than the value ofthe next 27most valuable U.S. companies put together, including corporate giants like Tesla, Walmart and JPMorgan Chase, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nApple\u2019s profitjust from the past three months ($21.7 billion) was nearly double the combined annual profits of the five largest U.S. airlines in prepandemic 2019.\nAmazon\u2019s stock price increases have made Jeff Bezosso richthat he could buy a new model iPhone for 200 million people \u2014 and he would still be a billionaire.\nGoogle\u2019s $50 billion in revenuefrom selling advertisements from April to June was about what Americans \u2014all of the Americans\u2014spent on gasolineand gas station purchases last month.\nThe annual revenue of one of Microsoft\u2019s side businesses, LinkedIn, is nearly four times that of Zoom Video Communications, a star of the pandemic, in the past year.\nFacebook expects to dole out more cash outfitting its computer hubs and offices in 2021 than Exxonspendsaround the world to dig oil and gas out of the ground in a year.\nAmazonfell short of investors\u2019 expectations on Thursday. But in the past year, Amazon\u2019s e-commerce revenue still climbed by $109 billion \u2014 an increase in a single year that Walmart needed the past nine years to reach.\nI know that lots of odd things are happening in the U.S. economy right now. But I cannot adequately explain how not normal these numbers are from the tech superpowers. Maybe that\u2019s why Bezos wantedto touch outer space;the Big 5 tech giants have outgrown Earth.\nWhat\u2019s clear more than ever is that America\u2019s tech titans have formed a separate universe in which they are the sun, and everyone else \u2014 billions of humans, other companies, entire countries and governments \u2014 are mere planets that revolve around them.\nPerhaps even more surprising than the size and scale of these companies is how they have mostly grown more profitable in what could or should have been economic conditions that hurt their profits.\nI have been befuddled that Amazon and Apple have shown higher profit margins than those companies have had for years \u2014 possibly ever. That has happened even though the pandemic has forced those companies to reorganize factories or warehouses, deal with disrupted global shipping, scramble for parts in short supply andspenda fortune to keep their workers safe.\nThat chaos and unplannedspendingshould have made the companies less profitable, not more so. (Apple did spook investors a little by saying this week that it was having trouble getting all the parts it needs for the next few months.)\nWhat does all this mean? Well, for one thing, members of Congress or state attorneys general might look at the numbers and ask: If, as theBig Techcompanies say, they face stiff competition and could die at any moment, how could profit margins keep going up like this?\nLogic would suggest that if the companies are fighting off lots of rivals, they might have to cut prices and profit margins would shrink. Sohow does Facebookturn each dollar of revenue, nearly all from ads it sells, into 43 cents of profit \u2014 a level that most companies can only dream of, and higher than Facebook posted before the pandemic?\nI\u2019ve asked over and over in this newsletter whether America\u2019s Big 5 tech titans are invincible. As the gap keeps widening between the super rich tech superstars and the merely super, I\u2019m starting to believe that the answer is yes.\nEvery country wants to regulate Big Tech:Turkey has forced Google to make major changes to its search engine in the country. My colleagues Adam Satariano and Dai Wakabayashi have details, and say that Turkey could provide a preview of morecountry-by-country government regulationthat could become a fixture of the global internet.\nA big, possibly odd, day for Robinhood:It\u2019s the first day as a public company for the app that made stock trading as fun and easyas playing Candy Crush. My DealBook colleagues ask:Is Robinhood really worth $30 billion or more?\nHere is the most convoluted way to set up home internet equipment.Gizmodo has one man\u2019s tale of aDIY Wi-Fi setup involving plastic bins, bungee cords and a small fan.

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it three times a week.\nAmerica\u2019s technology companies could have done more to keep Americans informed about thecoronavirusand to help people and businesses that have struggled. But they have also been decisive trend setters in keeping their workers and the rest of us safer from the virus.\nLast year, some high-profile tech companies were relatively early to close their corporate offices as coronavirus outbreaks started in the United States, and they continued topay many hourly workerswho couldn\u2019t do their jobs remotely. Those actions from companies includingMicrosoft, Salesforce, Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitterprobably helped save lives in the Bay Areaand perhaps beyond.\nNow many of the same tech companies \u2014 along with schools anduniversities,health care institutionsandsome governmentemployers in the United States \u2014 have started to announcevaccine mandates for staff, the resumption ofrequirements to wear masks,delayed reopenings of officesoron-site workplace vaccinationsto help slow the latest wave of infections.\nAmerica\u2019s tech companies, which deserve criticism for misusing their power, also should get credit for using their power to take decisive action in response to virus risks.\nThose steps helped make it palatable for other organizations to follow. And in some cases, tech companies have acted more quickly in response to health threats and communicated about them more effectively than federal or local government leaders.\nI get that readers will disagree over whether employers should require vaccinations or other health measures. I also get that tech companies have many advantages over other kinds of employers, including workers who can largely do their jobs away from an office. Companies that manufacture cars or airplanes, serve food or run hospitals don\u2019t have that luxury.\nAnd tech companies based in left-leaning parts of the United States including the Bay Area and Seattle are less likely to encounter backlash from staff or local politicians for requiring vaccinations.Having infinite dollarsalso gives tech companies the ability to do what they believe is best.\nBut other affluent corporations mostly haven\u2019t been as visible in leading the way for how large employers should aid in the country\u2019s pandemic response.\nTechnology companies cannot and should not replace effective government. Thecollaboration of private industry and the U.S. governmentwas instrumental in the development and delivery of extremely effective vaccines, and it was the federal government\u2019s actions thatsignificantly reduced poverty in Americain a time of crisis.\nIt\u2019s appropriate to worry that tech superpowers and other private companies have too much influence. But in this case, technology companies have been flexing their might to make us all a little safer.\nA MeToo reckoning in video games:Many employees of the video game company Activision Blizzard areprotestingwhat they say is routine workplace harassment and unfair pay for women. The video game industry has traditionally shrugged off claims of sexism and mistreatment of women, but now a \u201ccritical mass of the industry\u2019s own workers are indicating they will no longer tolerate such behavior,\u201d my colleagues Kellen Browning and Mike Isaac write.\nRelated: Women at Google complained about mistreatment by their bosses.They were offered mental health counseling, and in at least one case the company asked for access to an employee\u2019s patient records, Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Ruchika Tulshyan report.\nAmerica\u2019s drivers are the unwitting guinea pigs:Greg Bensinger, a member of The New York Times\u2019s editorial board, writes thatTesla puts everyone at riskby overstating the capabilities of driver assistance technologies in the company\u2019s cars.\nWe can\u2019t blame only the internet companies:It\u2019sa mistake to overstate the influence of online misinformation on anti-vaccine beliefsin the United States, a Wired writer says. There\u2019s also a risk of the public and news media using \u201cmisinformation\u201d as an overly broad term for posts that aren\u2019t objectively false but contain cherry-picked statistics or misleading interpretations of facts.\nWatch the family of the Olympic gymnast Sunisa Leeerupting in joywhen she won a gold medal.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s profitsnearly doubled in the latest quarter, showing that the world\u2019s richest and most valuable public company is exhibiting little sign of slowing down.\nApplesaid on Tuesday that its profits increased 93 percent to $21.7 billion in its fiscal third quarter compared with a year earlier, while sales rose 36 percent to $81.4 billion, both outpacing analysts\u2019 expectations.\nThe company has posted growth rates in recent quarters that resemble a much smaller upstart rather than a corporate titan worth nearly $2.5 trillion. It has been fueled by people buying even more of its devices than usual during the pandemic, as they becamemore reliant on technologyto work, study and socialize. Apple also makes billions of dollars each quarter by collecting a commission on other companies\u2019 app sales, a rapidly growing part of its business that hasattracted lawsuitsand theattention of regulators.\nApple said itsiPhonesales grew 50 percent to $39.6 billion over the quarter from a year ago, an increase that was high by even its lofty standards. The increase was particularly surprising considering the company is set to release new phones in September, which often causes many people to wait to buy new iPhones.\nSales of iPhones had declined in recent years in a saturated smartphone market, but the pandemic mostly changed that. The April-through-June period was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit increases in iPhone sales, with much of the growth coming from existing customers upgrading their phones.\nApple also sold more of all of its other products, including iPads, Macs and wearable devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods. The company\u2019s sales increased in every geographic area, led by its Greater China region, with 58 percent growth, the third consecutive quarter in which sales increased by more than 50 percent there.\nApple\u2019s reliance on China to sell and manufacture its products hasforced the company to make compromisesthere, including by storing its users\u2019 data on Chinese government servers and censoring certain apps.\nThe company also posted one of its largest gross profit margins ever, at 43.3 percent, showing how efficient its enormous business has become.\nIn an earnings call, Luca Maestri, the company\u2019s finance chief, attributed the widening margin to cost savings and a greater reliance on revenue from its internet-services business, which includes its take of other companies\u2019 app sales and has an unusually high profit margin.\nMr. Maestri said Apple effectively keeps 70 cents for every dollar it earns in its services business, before accounting for certain operating expenses, such as research and development. He said Apple\u2019s gross margins on its devices were 36 percent in the quarter.\nOne of the few challenges for Apple isthe global shortage in computer chips, which its devices rely upon. The shortage is affecting the production of a wide array of products, from cars to washing machines. Mr. Maestri said that while Apple had mostly avoided a major impact so far, the company expected a lack of chips to hurt its iPhone and iPad sales in the current quarter.\nPartly as a result, he said, Apple expected its sales growth to be slower in the current quarter, though it would still be in the double digits. That forecast sent Apple shares down 1.5 percent in after-hours trading."

        "fulltext": "The Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to push harder for the right of consumers to repair devices like smartphones, home appliances, cars and even farm equipment, arguing that large corporations have cost consumers by making such products harder to fix.\nAll five commissioners \u2014 two Republicans and three Democrats \u2014 voted to back a policy statement that promises to explore whether companies that make it harder for consumers to repair products are breaking antitrust or consumer protection laws, and to step up enforcement of the laws against violators.\n\u201cThese types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunity for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs and undermine resiliency,\u201d saidLina Khan, the commission\u2019s chairwoman. \u201cThe F.T.C. has a range of tools it can use to root out unlawful repair restrictions, and today\u2019s policy statement would commit us to move forward on this issue with new vigor.\u201d\nThe commission\u2019s vote on Wednesday falls in line with President Biden\u2019s policies to prioritize initiatives to increase competition between large corporations and to limit their power. In anexecutive orderthis month, Mr. Biden encouraged the commission to crack down on companies that make it harder for consumers to get equipment or electronics repaired by third-party shops. It singled out manufacturers of farming equipment \u2014 the tractor manufacturer John Deere, for example \u2014 that uselicense agreementsthat block farmers from repairing their tractors on their own.\nWednesday\u2019s vote was a victory for the\u201cright to repair\u201d movement, which has long been pushing for repair-friendly policies at the federal, state and local levels. Nathan Proctor, the senior director of the United States Public Interest Research Group\u2019s Right to Repair campaign, celebrated the agency\u2019s decision in a statement.\n\u201cThey have pledged to assist states in making right to repair improvements, and to tackle illegal behavior from manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Proctor said. \u201cThe F.T.C. is no longer on the sidelines.\u201d\nBut TechNet, an advocacy group representing technology companies including Google and Apple, criticized the move by the commission, saying it would only jeopardize the safety of consumers.\n\u201cThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision to upend an effective and secure system for consumers to repair products that they rely on for their health, safety, and well-being, including phones, computers, fire alarms, medical devices, and home security systems, will have far-reaching, permanent impacts on technology and cybersecurity,\u201d Carl Holshouser, the senior vice president of TechNet, said in a statement.\nIt sent a report to Congress in May, titled\u201cNixing the Fix,\u201din which it described how companies designed products to be harder to fix and how they narrowed repair options in order to push consumers to more frequently buy new products. There is \u201cscant evidence to support manufacturers\u2019 justifications for repair restrictions,\u201d the report said.\nIt also noted that the limitations imposed by companies harmed the consumer, especially communities of color and low-income communities. According to the report, the cost of buying a new product or the difficulty of repairing a product can fall disproportionately on small businesses owned by people of color."

        "title": "Can Apple\u2019s AirTags Find Lost Pets?",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nToday we\u2019ll hear from Kaitlyn Wells, a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times.\nThe panic that sets in when a pet goes missing is something no dog or cat owner wants to experience. Should your best friend get loose,GPS (Global Positioning System) pet trackersthat follow your pet in real time can help reunite you, but the devices can be expensive (they average about $200), and some also require a pricey annual subscription. So when Apple announced itsAirTag tracking devicesin April, you may have wondered what I did: Would the $29 coin-sized device work as a pet tracker?\nHow is the AirTag different from a Bluetooth or GPS pet tracker?\nGPS pet trackers use satellite signals and cellular data information to communicate your pet\u2019s location to your phone, while Bluetooth-only trackers communicate its location only if it is within Bluetooth range of your phone \u2014 typically within 30 to 100 feet \u2014 or if someone else running on the same tracker ecosystem happens to wander past.\nThe AirTag uses both Bluetooth and a more precise positioning technology called ultrawideband (UWB) to pinpoint the tracker\u2019s location. Like a souped-up version of Bluetooth, UWB will point you in your AirTag\u2019s direction with compass-like accuracy if you\u2019re using an iPhone close to the missing AirTag. If you\u2019re farther away, Apple\u2019s Find My app network and Bluetooth from other iPhone users can help you find it instead.\nThis difference \u2014 the near ubiquity of Apple devices anywhere you might be, helping to track your AirTag \u2014 is what makes Apple\u2019s tracker far more useful than a Bluetooth tracker such as theTile Mate, which operates within a far smaller pool of users.\nBoth AirTags and Bluetooth trackers are reliant on other devices, though, whereas GPS trackers harness the power of satellites.\nDoes Apple approve of using AirTag for tracking pets?\nTechnically, no. Though it\u2019s small enough to affix to a dog\u2019s collar using Apple\u2019s ownkey ringsorloops(my colleague Brian X. Chenmade the hack work), Apple has stressed that the AirTag is meant forlocating items, not people or pets. Still, the company does have apatenton its UWB technology and cites removable tags attached to a pet\u2019s collar or a kid\u2019s T-shirt as possible use scenarios in the filing.\nDon\u2019t be shocked if Apple launches pet-friendly trackers in the future, but right now, the AirTag as a pet tracker is considered an off-label use.\nIs there any reason you wouldn\u2019t want to use AirTags for pets?\nThe AirTag is more limited than dedicated GPS pet trackers. Currently, the Find My app won\u2019t notify you immediately if you\u2019re separated from an AirTag, though this feature isbeing added in iOS 15. GPS pet trackers do this if your pet leaves a designated area.\nAirTags can\u2019t be attached to a pet\u2019s collar on their own either, so you need to buy an AppleAirTag Loop(which costs as much as the AirTag itself) or a less-expensivethird-party holder.\nOther GPS pet trackers Wirecutter likes\nWe\u2019ve tested over a dozen pet trackers over the years, and one always leads the pack: theWhistle Go Explore. It costs four times as much as the AirTag, but it\u2019ll immediately tell you if your pet escapes home, is more accurate than any other GPS tracker we tested and works with both Apple and Android phones.\nBut like most pet trackers we have tested, its GPS accuracy can be finicky when cellular service is spotty, and you pay a $100 annual subscription to keep using it. The rechargeable battery also lasts only about three days in \u201clost pet mode\u201d compared with AirTag\u2019s estimated monthslong battery life in that mode.\nIf you\u2019re a price-conscious Apple user, the AirTag is more accurate than a traditional Bluetooth tracker, but it won\u2019t be as responsive as a GPS pet tracker.\nThe AirTag is far better than nothing, but if you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more, I\u2019d recommend the Whistle Go Explore because it remains the most reliable, accurate and fastest way to alert you if your pet goes missing.\nNo matter which device you choose, make sure that your pets are microchipped and that their ID tags are accurate. The more ways you have to be reunited with your lost pet, the better.\nFacebook\u2019s pandemic knowledge gap:The White House has been asking Facebook for data on the prevalence of misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines on the social network. But Sheera Frenkel reports thatFacebook doesn\u2019t actually knowmany specifics about how misinformation about the coronavirus has spread.\nHow China became a more serious hacking threat:Nicole Perlrothwritesthat China became more sophisticated at digital espionage after Chinese authorities reorganized networks of cyberattackers and hoarded knowledge of software vulnerabilities that can be used to break into computer systems.\nRelated from my colleague Max Fisher: \u201cGovernment-linked hacking has become a widespread andperhaps long-lasting feature of the global order.\u201d\nThe Chinese mystery seeds might be weirder than we thought:There was a mini-freakout last year when many people got seed packets delivered seemingly at random from China and other countries. The Atlantickept diggingand found that the saga might have resulted from a collective panic over seeds that many people forgot they ordered.\nIt\u2019sa family of falcons hanging out above a churchin Manhattan.

        "title": "Why You Should Care About Your Right to Repair Gadgets",
        "fulltext": "When your car has problems, your instinct is probably to take it to a mechanic. But when something goes wrong with your smartphone \u2014 say a shattered screen or a depleted battery \u2014 you may wonder: \u201cIs it time to buy a new one?\u201d\nThat\u2019s because even as our consumer electronics have become as vital as our cars, the idea of tech repair still hasn\u2019t been sown into our collective consciousness. Studies have shown that when tech products begin to fail, most people are inclined tobuy new things rather than fix their old ones.\n\u201cRepair is inconvenient and difficult, so people don\u2019t seek it,\u201d said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, who is working on legislation to make tech repair more accessible. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t expect to repair things, they replace things when by far the most logical thing to do is to repair it.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. More of us could maintain our tech products, as we do with cars, if it were more practical to do so. If we all had more access to the parts, instructions and tools to revive products, repairs would become simpler and less expensive.\nThis premise is at the heart of the \u201cright to repair\u201d act, a proposed piece of legislation that activists and tech companies have fought over for nearly a decade. Recently, right-to-repair supporters scored two major wins. In May, theFederal Trade Commission published a reportexplaining how tech companies were harming competition by restricting repairs. And last Friday,President Biden issued an executive orderthat included a directive for the F.T.C. to place limits on how tech manufacturers could restrict repairs.\nThe F.T.C. is set to meet next week to discuss new policies about electronics repair. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the fight over your right to fix gadgets.\nThe legislation, which was previously proposed in about two dozen states and is now being discussed on a federal level, would require tech and appliance manufacturers to provide the tools, instructions and parts necessary for anyone to fix their smartphones, tablets, computers and refrigerators, as well as other products.\nThat would be a major shift. Tech companies currently provide service tools and parts only to a network of officially approved partners, including big brands with service centers like Best Buy and some independent repair shops. These official partners typically follow strict rules, which include using genuine parts bought directly from the manufacturer, so costs to the customer may be higher than repairs done by unauthorized repair centers.\nBy making resources broadly available, the unofficial repair centers could more easily compete to drive costs down. And that would make repair a more compelling option than buying a new gadget.\nTech products are among our most expensive household purchases, and their prices keep climbing. Not long ago, the price of a high-end smartphone was $650. Today, new Apple and Samsung phones start at $700 and $800.\nThe average household would save $330 a year if it repaired products rather than replaced them, which adds up to $40 billion nationwide, according to a study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\nBy prolonging the life of your gadgets, you would also put more use into the energy, metals, plastics and human labor invested in creating the product.\nThere are several barriers to repairing consumer electronics that can make it intimidating.\nBasic repairs, like replacing a shattered screen or a depleted battery, are not simple. Modern gadgets are so thin and tightly glued together that special tools are usually needed to pry them open. It\u2019s also not straightforward to buy genuine parts \u2014 you can\u2019t go to the Apple or Samsung website to order a replacement screen or battery, for example.\nFixing basic components is also becoming increasingly impractical for unauthorized repair shops, especially with Apple phones. Many important parts inside neweriPhones, including cameras, batteries and screens, require proprietary software tools to finish the job, independent fixers said.\nGoing to the Apple and Microsoft retail stores and authorized repair shops is a simple option, but the costs there can be so high that you might be persuaded to just buy a new device. When I took my wife\u2019s iPhone to an Apple Store this year, I was quoted $280 to replace a broken touch-screen, about 40 percent of the price of a brand-new iPhone. I turned to another route instead.\nIndependent fixers get access to tools, parts and instructions for repairs when they enroll in partnerships with tech companies to become authorized service centers. But Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, which publishes free instruction manuals for people to restore their gadgets, said many independent fixers were turned off by the contractual terms to become authorized.\nOne requirement to be an authorized Apple repair center involves collecting detailed service records, including customer names, product serial numbers and mailing addresses. This information must be provided to Apple in the event of an audit to verify that repairs are being done properly. Even if a repair provider terminates its agreement with Apple, it must agree to continue to share this information with the company for two years.\nThere is also the issue of price. Shakeel Taiyab, an independent fixer in South San Francisco, said he charged lower prices to customers because he obtained authentic parts from channels such as electronics refurbishers who extract working components from defective gadgets. (He charged me $180 to fix my wife\u2019s iPhone screen, undercutting the Apple store by $100.)\nMr. Taiyab said that if he became an authorized provider, he would follow the rules, which might result in raising prices for his customers \u2014 something he said he didn\u2019t want to do.\nApple declined to comment. A spokesman referred to a news release that said there were1,500 authorized, independent repair centersacross the United States, Canada and Europe.\nApple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google havecontributed to lobbying effortsagainst the right-to-repair act. The most common argument is security \u2014 the idea that people with access to repair and diagnostics tools could perform illegitimate repairs and steal people\u2019s data.\nTechNet, a trade group that represents Apple, Google, Amazon and others, said opening up repair could put consumers in harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cAllowing unvetted third parties with access to sensitive diagnostic information, software, tools and parts would jeopardize the safety of consumers\u2019 devices and put consumers at risk for fraud,\u201d Carl Holshouser, a TechNet executive, said in a statement.\nBut in its report,the F.T.C. concludedthat there was \u201cscant evidence to support manufacturers\u2019 justifications for repair restrictions.\u201d\nWhen your car breaks down, you can take it to a dealership\u2019s service center or potentially get more affordable service at an independent mechanic. Broadly speaking, cars are more customizable with aftermarket parts, and basic maintenance and repair jobs like changing the oil or replacing a cracked windshield don\u2019t require special software.\nIn 2012, Massachusetts enacted a right-to-repair law for automobiles, and automakers agreed to adopt the requirements of the law nationwide. After cars evolved to rely more heavily on computers, the legislation helped make special tools and instructions broadly available to independent mechanics for repairs.\n\u201cWhen your car breaks down, you know exactly what to do,\u201d Mr. Proctor said. \u201cYou find a mechanic, you pay, and it\u2019s back. If you don\u2019t like your mechanic, you find another one. Or you could go to the dealer if you want.\u201d\nIn other words, buying a new car is the last resort. And buying a new phone could become one, too."

        "fulltext": "An industry group representing the largest American internet companies warnedHong Kong\u2019s government that changes to the city\u2019s data-protection laws could impact companies\u2019 ability to provide services in the city.\nThe June 25 letter, which took issue with broad new rules created to curb doxxing \u2014 the targeted disclosure of individuals\u2019 private information \u2014 was the latest sign of the dilemma faced by tech companies in Hong Kong, wherethe government has created harsh new rulesto control what is said online.\nOnce a haven of internet freedom on the doorstep of China\u2019s tightly controlled internet, Hong Kong is home to offices and servers for many major internet companies. Yet under a recent national security law, the city faces a new digital reality in which the authorities have broad surveillance and censorship powers. That has increasingly called into question the viability of continuing operations for major internet companies.\nThe Singapore-based Asia Internet Coalition, which represents Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and other tech companies,warned in the letterthat the new rules would \u201cresult in grave impact on due process and risks for freedom of expression and communication.\u201d\nOf particular concern, according to the letter, was general wording that could give the police the power to impose fines and arrest local employees if the tech companies are not responsive to the new doxxing rules.\n\u201cThe only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering their services in Hong Kong, thereby depriving Hong Kong businesses and consumers, whilst also creating new barriers to trade,\u201d the coalition wrote.\nIn a statement, the Asia Internet Coalition said the letter reflected an industry view, and not the policies or plans of any specific company.The Wall Street Journalfirst reported the existence of the letter.\nSince the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests of 2019, debate over online speech has often focused on doxxing. After police officers stopped wearing identifying markers during the protests, a slew of sites and channels cropped up to identify them. Pro-police sites, in turn, released information on protesters.\nThe authorities have already used the national security law to curb the practice. In January,the first known website to be taken down under the lawhad posted personal information about police officers. Under the new rules anyone posting personal information intended to harass, threaten or intimidate could face up to five years in jail and a fine in excess of $100,000.\nDoxxing is just one part of a continuing proxy fight over internet freedoms in the city. Shortly after the law was enacted, Facebook, Google and Twitter all said they had suspended responding to data requests from the Hong Kong authorities. Last month, police officers in the city invoked the law to briefly pull down a website that called for unity among expatriate Hong Kongers in the pro-democracy movement.\nTiffany Maycontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "Apple pushed back itsreturn-to-office plansby at least a month in response to the recent surge in coronavirus cases, which has been fueled by the spread of theDelta variant.\nThe company told employees on Monday that they are now expected to return to the office as early as Oct. 1 instead of early September. The company said that the date could shift further depending on the spread of the virus, and that it would give employees at least a month\u2019s notice before they are expected to return, according to an email Apple sent to employees, which was viewed by The New York Times.\n\u201cAs the situation continues to evolve, we\u2019re committed to the same measured approach that we have taken all along,\u201d the email said.\nSome employees, such as those who build hardware, have already returned to Apple\u2019s offices. At the beginning of the pandemic, Apple closed many of its retail stores, but those have since reopened. Apple\u2019s return-to-work policies apply to all of its offices, including those in California, Texas and New York.\nApple declined to comment further. The company had 147,000 full-time employees as of September. Bloombergearlier reportedthe changed return-to-office date.\nLike many companies, Apple has delayed its employees\u2019 return date several times, but it is one of the first major corporations to respond to the Delta variant spread.\nThroughout the pandemic, Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of the trend toward remote work, with tech companies like Twitter and Facebook among the first to order their employees to work from home in early 2020. Many tech companies also eventually decided to make remote work permanent.\nBut Apple has been more resistant to lose its in-person office culture, which has caused some friction among employees who want to continue working from home. An internal Slack channel called \u201cRemote Work Advocates\u201d has grown to about 6,500 employees from roughly 1,800 in June, according to Cher Scarlett, an Apple security engineer who has helped write letters to management from the group.\nIn June, about 1,800 workers signed a letter to Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, that said forcing employees back into the office would cause some people to leave the company. On Monday, some employees in the Slack group posted a second letter to send to management that proposed more flexible remote-work arrangements. Tech news sites The Verge and Recode previously reported on the letters.\n\u201cBasically, everybody wanted to feel heard and to have more transparency and flexibility, like we\u2019re seeing in other companies of Apple\u2019s size,\u201d Ms. Scarlett said."
