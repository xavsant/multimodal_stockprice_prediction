        "title": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy",
        "fulltext": "Unemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.\nAnd the stock markets are a mess.\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.\nThe stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.\nIn recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.\nThe S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.\nThe pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.\nThe sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.\nBut the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.\nMr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\n\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201d\nUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.\nSo far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.\nBut those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.\nStrong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.\nIn recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.\nOn Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.\nApple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.\nChina, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.\nOil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.\nLast quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.\nGermany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.\nIn 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.\nFor the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.\nDisappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.\nIn other words, the market may be messy for a while.\n\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.",
        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.\nDespite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.\nThe company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.\nThe decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.\nApple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.\nFor much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.\nBut Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.\nSales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.\nSelling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.\nOther big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.\nFacebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.\nApple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).\nBut the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management."

        "title": "Stocks Dive After Apple Supplier Slashes Outlook",
        "fulltext": "Stocks dropped on Monday, giving back a slice of their recent gains as investors dumped shares in some of the large technology companies that hold outsize sway over major market indexes.\nThe Nasdaq composite was one of the hardest-hit among the major benchmarks. The technology-heavy index was down 2.8 percent. The S&P 500 fell 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.3 percent.\nApple\u2019s shares declined 5 percent after one of its suppliers, Lumentum,slashed its fiscal outlook for the current quarterand said it had received a request from one of its largest customers to reduce shipments. The company, whose shares plummeted over 30 percent, did not identify Apple in its warning but Apple is Lumentum\u2019s largest customer, generating roughly one-third of the company\u2019s revenue, according toa regulatory filing.\nApple\u2019s stumble seemed to weigh on other previously high-flying technology companies. Amazon shares dropped 4.4 percent, and Facebook fell 2.4 percent. The social network was briefly offline for many users Monday afternoon, giving visitors an error message saying \u201csorry, something went wrong.\u201d\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, declined 2.6 percent, and Netflix stock fell more than 3 percent.\nThe slump in technology shares on Monday was a reminder of the ugly drop stocks suffered in October. Worried about rising interest rates, trade tensions and a potential peak in corporate profits, investors briefly pushed the broader market down nearly 10 percent below its late-September peak and into negative territory for the year.\nMore recently, stocks had regained much of that ground. Wall Street jumped after last Tuesday\u2019s contentious midterm elections were resolved, with the S&P 500 finishing the next day up more than 3.5 percent.\nMonday\u2019s pain wasn\u2019t exclusively due to tech stocks.\nShares of Goldman Sachs tumbled 7.5 percent as questions mounted over what role the investment bank may have played inthe lootingof a multibillion-dollar Malaysian government investment fund.\nGeneral Electric\u2019s stock fell 6.9 percent in its fourth straight decline after comments by its new chief executive failed to calm investors\u2019 worries.\nBut Apple remains a key concern. The company has a market value above $900 billion, so moves in the share price have an outsize effect on stock indexes \u2014like the S&P 500 \u2014 that are weighted by market size.\nThat dynamic mostly has been a boon for the stock market in recent years. Apple shares rose more than 45 percent last year.\nAndlarge tech companies have been crucialto the market\u2019s performance this year. From the start of the year through the market\u2019s Sept. 20 peak, roughly half of the gain of the S&P 500 was attributable to five huge tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. Through much of last month\u2019s slump, these companies held up reasonably well.\nBut Apple\u2019s recent stumble suggests that some investors are questioning the ability of major tech companies to continue to carry the broader markets.\nApple\u2019s tumble on Monday followed another slide after its Nov. 1 earnings report, when the company said it would no longer report the number of iPhones it sells each quarter. So far this month, its stock price is down more than 10 percent."

The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.\nThe tumble of more than 1.8 percent in the S&P 500 followed asell-off in high-flying technology stockslike Google, Apple and Amazon in the United States on Monday, as investors weighed the prospects for increased regulation, trade tension and threats to the profit outlook for the large technology companies that exert a large influence on major market indexes.\n[Read how the stock market\u2019s slide is flashingwarning signs about the economy.]\nThe pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.\nThe softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.\nAlso weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.\nMonday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.\nConcerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.\n[ReadRon Lieber\u2019s adviceabout what to do as stocks fall.]\nThe pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.\nIn Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.\nShares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading.

A number of Apple suppliers cut their financial outlooks for this quarter, suggesting there may be weaker demand for the latest models of the phone than expected. Last quarter, sales of iPhones accounted for nearly 60 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue.\nMicrosoft has fared much better during November\u2019s stock market rout.

        "title": "Sending Lewd Nudes to Strangers Could Mean a Year in Jail",
        "fulltext": "[Want to get New York Today by email? Here\u2019sthe sign-up.]\nRebecca Odorisio was traveling home on a crowded A train on Tuesday when a photo suddenly appeared on her phone from someone identifying himself as \u201cThe Enterprise.\u201d\nIt was a picture of an erect penis, sent to her over AirDrop, an iPhone feature that allows users to send photos and documents to anyone within 30 feet who has left that feature open. Disgusted, she quickly rejected it.\n\u201cI felt like I had been punched in the gut,\u201d Ms. Odorisio, 31, a Brooklyn-based actress and singer, said Wednesday. She said it was not the first time something like that had happened to her, adding, \u201cIt was extremely violating.\u201d\nKathe Hannauer, 58, had a similar experience last month, as she traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan on a crowded train during the evening rush.\nWhen an image of male genitalia suddenly appeared on her screen, she said she felt more surprised than flustered. \u201cIt was kind of like, \u2018At my age?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has harassed me in the longest time.\u201d\nBut she worried about what would happen if a young girl was sent such a photograph, so she quickly wrote about the incident on Facebook to warn her friends to turn their AirDrop feature off when they are in public.\nThe two women were victims of what has become known as cyber flashing, a growing trend of technology-enabled sexual harassment. It has become so common that two lawmakers introduced a City Council bill on Wednesday to explicitly make it a crime, punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to a year in jail.\nOne of the first news reports of cyber flashing was in London in 2015, when a female commuter told the British Transport Police that she had received lewd photos on her phone via AirDrop as she traveled to work. Since then, people in New York, Toronto and other cities have written articles, tweeted and posted on Facebook and Instagram about how explicit pictures have showed up on their phones, often while on crowded public transportation.\nBecause AirDrop allows people to send images anonymously, there is no way for a commuter to know who in a busy train car might have sent it. And unlike traditional public lewdness crimes, the sender might not know who exactly within 30 feet is receiving the picture, because the feature identifies nearby phones only by the phone\u2019s nickname.\n\u201cIn the old days, you had to have a long trench coat and good running shoes,\u201d said Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island who is co-sponsoring the anti-flashing bill. \u201cTechnology has made it significantly easier to be a creep.\u201d\nSome people interpret the images as a harmless prank. About a month ago, Michael May, a medical resident in Manhattan, said he was on the A train when a stranger sent him a photo of a completely nude man covering his genitals with a glowing light saber.\n\u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d Mr. May, 26, said. He looked up from his iPhone to try to determine who had sent it, but everyone around him was staring intently at their phones.\nDonovan J. Richards, a Democratic councilman from Queens and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation was intended as a bipartisan effort to raise awareness \u2014 and to remove the sense of impunity that may embolden those sending the images.\n\u201cKeep your pic in your pants,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf you do it, the message we are sending is that the repercussion is a fine or jail time.\u201d\nAirDrop, which first debuted in 2011, is specific to iPhones and other Apple products. It uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate over a short range to other devices, like other iPhones. More recently, some Android-enabled devices have had access to a similar feature called AirDroid.\nWhat makes Apple\u2019s feature particularly vulnerable to cyber flashing is that it automatically shows the recipient a preview of the image, then asks the user to accept or decline it. The only way to block the image is to set the AirDrop feature only for use between phone contacts (which is the default setting from Apple) or to turn it off completely.\nIt is already a misdemeanor in New York State to harass someone by telephone, mail or other forms of written communication. But that law does not explicitly address the issue of visual images.\nThe bill introduced on Wednesday would add language to the city code that would make it \u201cunlawful for a person, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, to send by electronic device an unsolicited intimate image.\u201d\nDanielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland and the author of a book on hate crimes in cyberspace, said that clarification could be helpful. New York may be the first municipality to consider a specific law targeting the practice, she said.\n\u201cThis is unwanted electronic harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like we have telephone harassment laws that have been upheld by federal and state courts, it is absolutely possible to regulate this.\u201d\nMs. Citron said there were no statistics tracking the prevalence of cyber flashing, adding the entire field of electronic harassment is \u201cwoefully understudied.\u201d\nSgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, did not address the issue of cyber flashing directly, but said in a statement, \u201c Any complaints made in regard to aggravated harassment will be recorded and fully investigated.\u201d\nMr. Richards said that Apple and other tech companies should share the responsibility for warning users about the potential misuse, and modify the feature to be safer. \u201cThe onus can\u2019t just be on the Police Department,\u201d he said.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nFor now, protection mostly consists of past victims warning others to look out. Ms. Odorisio was so upset by the explicit image she received that she posted a censored version of it on Instagram, with her own text over it: \u201cTo those who say \u2014 aw, come on, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2026\u201d\nUnder the image it read: \u201cNot asking for it.\u201d\nThere are two ways to restrict the AirDrop feature on an iPhone.\nIn the main settings app, select \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then \u201cAirDrop.\u201d Then select either \u201cReceiving Off\u201d or \u201cContacts Only.\u201d The \u201cEveryone\u201d setting is when sexual harassers can send you photos.\nAlternately, swiping up from any screen will bring up the control center. Pushing down on the Bluetooth icon will open another menu, in which there is an AirDrop icon. Tap that, and the options for \u201cReceiving Off,\u201d \u201cContacts Only\u201d and \u201cEveryone\u201d appear."

        "title": "ADVERTISEMENT by PWC \u2014 Getting Digital Right: Posers, Players and Profits",
        "fulltext": "What does it mean to be digital? Think back to a decade or two ago. It meant being on the web. Then it meant adopting new shiny IT. No more. Digital is a way of doing business. Its being innovative. Quick. Adaptive. Busting hierarchies. Using technology to drive change--and profits.\nBut how well do companies harness and profit from \u201cbeing digital\u201d?  More successful companies bear similar hallmarks: they define digital as a way of doing business, they have a mindset that embraces innovation they work with, less bureaucratic decision-making, and they put experience high on the priority list. They\u2019re transcending a product or service and becoming an experience, a name that rolls off the tongue, according to research from PwC\u2019s decade-plus research on Digital IQ.\nWhile plenty of companies believe they\u2019re digital players, their strategies, priorities, workforce and investments tell a different story. But to those who dive in full-throttle, there\u2019s reward: financial success. Just 8% of the 2,200 respondents toPwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ surveyfall into that group of top financial performers--defined as companies with 3 years or more of profit growth and revenue increases of 5% or more and an expectation of similar revenue growth over the next three years.\nWhat makes the 8% great?\nWhat separates the companies\u2014across  industries and countries\u2014that are financial superstars from the rest?  For starters, top performers have embraced a forward-looking definition of digital. They are twice as likely their lower-performing peers to define digital as a reflection of a mindset that embraces constant innovation, less-bureaucratic decision-making, and the integration of technology, as a tool that helps everyone work smarter. They\u2019ve long since blown through the murky, discovery stage\u2014unlike their peers whose definition of digital is much more likely to center on technology and IT.\nSound like the company you work for? Probably not. But, there\u2019s a path to success and the 8% can show the way.\nTop performers are also gaining a competitive edge by living that definition out, taking an approach to digital that integrates business strategy, customer and employee experience. They are aware of disruption, deliberately work collaboratively and use appropriate technology to execute against overall corporate strategy. They are also more likely to promote innovation and employ workforces that are more digitally savvy and are led by executives with more digital acumen than their peers--in short, they\u2019vetransformed into digital workforces.\nIt\u2019s the combination of these crucial elements that lead to much more than just financial success for companies in the 8%. They\u2019re doing what we all want to: creating and delivering better products and services, fostering happier, more savvy employees, wowing customers, really getting tech right--for the company, for employees, for customers--and living a way of working that makes it happen.\nSilos or synthesis?\nIf you knew you needed to transport your entire workforce across the continent, you wouldn\u2019t build an airplane off in a side building, at one-tenth the scale you need, a side project delegated to a handful of people who \u2018get\u2019  or just want to \u201cexperiment\u201d with planes.\nYet, that\u2019s exactly what many companies do with digital\u2014silo a small project off in the corner in the form of an innovation group or a digital subset, forgotten on another floor or another P&L statement and not a part of overall strategy or success of the company. Who runs that digital thing? Oh, right, that guy. We should invite him to a meeting now and then. Sound familiar?\nTop-performing companies are far more likely to involve the executives responsible for executing on digital strategies in their higher-level corporate strategy efforts at twice the rate of their less-successful peers\u2014although only about half explicitly incorporate digital strategy into overall corporate strategy. Digital capabilities are the single-most driver of top-line growth\u2014and failure to include digital executives in strategy expresses a commitment to failure.\nDigital is everything\nTop performers are putting their money where their mouth\u2014and strategy\u2014sits. A full 59% of top performers are investing 10% or more of their revenue in digital efforts\u2014and one-in-six of them are investing 20%-to-25%.  Compare that to their less successful peers: just 29% are investing at least 10% in their digital efforts, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. And they are more likely to see those investments pay off more than expected off in critical areas. Among them: creating better customer experiences, innovating products and improving talent retention and recruitment\u2014key elements of taking a company from a product-and-service world into a platform that ascends want and turns into need.\nThat, in turn, is translating into better profits, better decision making, enhanced brand and bigger cost savings.\n\nLeaders or laggards at the top?\nHigh organizational digital IQ flows from the top, with senior leaders modeling the skills and behaviors they need from the digital workforce. While there\u2019s no difference between top performers and the rest when it comes to having a CEO that champions digital (72% say they do), there\u2019s a gap in know-how: 54% of top-performers say their leadership is digitally savvy and helps the workforce think in new ways, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. That leaves plenty of room for improvement, but compared with just 41% of less successful peers, it\u2019s a world of difference.\nFor many executives across industries, there\u2019s a strong need to actively improve their digital know-how across functions. To bridge the gap, some companies look outside their industry--in particular, in areas that are core to delivering on the promises of digital. Experience is one key area: 91% of top performers have an executive in charge of employee experience\u2014with about the same number committed to the idea that employee experience is critical to business performance.  Just 70% of their peers say the same. The gap is similar for customer experience. It matters. People say they will pay anaverage of 16% more for superior customer service.And one in three people say they would walk away from a brand they love after just one bad experience.\nEven digitally-savvy Apple struggled to meet customers\u2019 desire for in-store tech-enabled but still-human human experiences. It looked outside to help transform its stores into thriving town squares under the aegis of Angela Ahrendts\u2014the former Burberry CEO who\u2019d restored that brand\u2019s luxury roots with strategic cuts to anything creating noise around the brand.\nDisruptable or indestructible?\nThe next wave of digital disruption is coming, but it might not be seismic. Yet, many companies ignore the threat because they believe they\u2019re less likely to take a death blow. That could be true, but we\u2019ve moved to a rapid-pace, always-changing business environment and these daysdisruption is often much more iterative.\nIt\u2019s that incremental disruption that can be a company-killer. Imagine if Netflix had ignored the burgeoning fascination with streaming and insisted on sticking with mail-and-return movie rentals, or dismissed the idea of owned content as a fad and stuck with movie streaming. A full 64% of top financial performers do view disruption as a serious threat; only 27% of posers say the same, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. That belief guides digital investment and prioritization as well as strategy and workforce upskilling.\nTop performers are more than twice as likely to expect their digital investments to help combat disruption or help them disrupt their own or other industries. And they are finding success in doing so.\n\nBeing digital isn\u2019t something extra. It\u2019s not a nice to have. It\u2019s now. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s having a mindset that embraces constant innovation. It\u2019s flatter, data-guided decision making. It\u2019s developing a workforce and culture that hones the types of skills and behaviors that speed innovation and bolster experience. The companies that have embraced this \u201cit\u2019s all digital\u201d approach offer a roadmap of sorts for those who are playing catch up. It\u2019s not too late to take control and win in the digital world.\nThe hallmarks of a truly digital company help drive results.\n"
