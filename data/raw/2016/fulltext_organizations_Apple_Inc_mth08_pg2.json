        "fulltext": "It\u2019s just a drop in the bucket for Apple, with its cash pile of more than $230 billion. But the company nonetheless described the ruling by Europe that Ireland should recoup 10 years\u2019 worth of back taxes, or about $14.5 billion, as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, defiantly scolded the competition commission of the European Union and contended that Apple was a good corporate tax citizen in Ireland. But do his arguments hold any water? We consultedthe tax expertsand Mr. Cook seems to have been technically truthful.\nBut he missed the point of the European Commission\u2019s case, which was whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax law.\nMr. Cook argues that Apple is the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the United States and the world. It is likely that is because of the company\u2019s size, but it is hard to prove as its corporate tax information in the United States is private. And, as Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, points out, the ruling is not about how much the company has paid, but how much it should pay. \u201cTax systems are not a pay-what-you-want system,\u201d he said.\nShould a board continue to \u201cjust say no,\u201d or should it give in to a hostile acquirer?\nThat\u2019s the question being raised as Tronc continues to play coy with Gannett, which is rumored to have raised its offer for the company, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune.\nGannett must persuade Tronc\u2019s board to accept the offer, but the board seems willing to defy its shareholders by refusing to consider. The \u201cjust say no\u201d defense, which was validated in court and gave boards a wide latitude to reject bids, means shareholders have to abide by a board decision or unseat directors. It has been a successful approach, but it is also a gamble.\nThe risk here is that Gannett might go away, leaving Tronc to wither as Yahoo did after it fought off a bid from Microsoft, writesthe Deal Professor. At least, if Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman, is just trying to push up Gannett\u2019s bid price, he is doing a masterly job.\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is broadening its car-pooling program and setting up apotential challengewith ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. Its program, Waze, is limited to employees of companies near Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. In the fall, it will expand to users in San Francisco.\nThe expansion, earlier reported byThe Wall Street Journal, is another example of intensifying competition between the two companies. Uber has already waded into the arena of self-driving cars, an enduring area of interest for Google. AndDavid Drummond, a longtime executive at Alphabet, recently stepped down from Uber\u2019s board because of the overlap between the two companies.\n\u2022 Canada publishes its second-quarter gross domestic product results, which are expected have been affected by a wildfire in Alberta and sluggish oil prices.\n\u2022 Salesforce reports its latest quarterly results.\n\u2022 Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, will discuss the role of the Fed and its board at St. Paul.\n\u2022 At the Brookings Institution, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew will discuss priorities for the United States at the Group of 20 Summit in Hangzhou."

        "title": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud",
        "fulltext": "The cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.\nAs Diane Cardwell reports, Apple is trying to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.\nA prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.\nOn this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.\nBig cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.\nEven as they take up more of the grid, the big cloud companies don\u2019t want to be seen as big polluters. In 2011 Greenpeace publisheda reporton the energy policies of data centers that in particular slammed Amazon Web Services, the biggest and fastest-growing of the cloud companies.\nAmazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.\nOther data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.\nRemote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.\nThere are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.\nFor many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.\nThe traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.\nFacebook\u2019s data center in Prineville, Ore., by comparison, has a P.U.E. of 1.1 or less, and evenpostshow well it is doing. Google and others now report similar numbers.\nGoogle has also applied its artificial intelligence skills to the problem, and it recentlyannouncedthat by predicting demand it could reduce its P.U.E. overhead by 15 percent.\nGoogle said this kind of technique could be used by other industries, and is likely to besomething it sellsas a service from its cloud business.\nTogether, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better."

Google Photos, Google Docs and others can all be used across Macs, Windows PCs, iPhones and others, while Apple apps typically can only be used on Apple devices.\nGoogle cemented its method on Tuesday with the release of Google Duo, a new video-calling app. Unlike Apple\u2019s FaceTime app, which can only be used to call people with Apple gadgets, Duo can be used to place video calls between Android and Apple phones. That increases the universe of people that consumers can call with Duo.\nBetter yet, Brian tests Duo versus FaceTime to check out the pros and cons of the video-calling apps.Read onfor his conclusions."

Is the .pdf format viable?\nA.One major factor in picking the \u201cbest\u201d format forpublishing your electronic bookis finding the format that works best for your book. Depending on where you put your book up for sale, you may also be able to export it into multiple formats to reach the widest audience.\nThePDF (Portable Document Format) standardworks well for visually oriented books that need a fixed layout to present content effectively \u2014 like children\u2019s storybooks, photography books, graphics-heavy textbooks, travel guides and the like. Unlike some other e-book formats, standard PDF files do not allow the text in the book to be resized or to change fonts or to spill onto different pages than originally intended.\nMost mobile devices can easily open PDF files (or with the aid of free software), but since users cannot alter the font size, they may need to do a lot of zooming in and out on small screens to comfortably read the e-book. Users who need to use the accessibility features \u2014 like screen readers to narrate the text aloud \u2014 may find PDF files harder to work with than other formats.\nApple\u2019s freeiBooks Author softwarefor the Mac also includes features for making visually complex interactive books in the company\u2019s iBooks format for iOS devices. While some interactive elements may not work, books created in iBooks Author can beexported to PDF formatfor use on other mobile platforms.\nIf your book is mostly text with minimal (or no) visual elements, theEPUBformat works on many e-readers, computers and mobile devices. The point size of the text in an .epub book can be made smaller or bigger based on the user\u2019s preference, and the onscreen font may be changed \u2014 all of which can cause the text to reflow across a different span of electronic pages. EPUB files can becreated from Microsoft Word documents, exported from filesin Apple\u2019s Pagesprogram, converted fromApache OpenOfficedocuments with theWriter2ePubextension or created with other utility programs.\nAmazon has its own Kindle Direct Publishing systemfor creating books (including textbooks) supported by the company\u2019s Kindle e-readers, tablets and apps. Once the book has been properly formatted, it can be sold in the company\u2019s Kindle Store."

        "fulltext": "Q.Why do companies stop supporting older phone hardware in their system updates?\nA.While it may seem like encouraging new hardware purchases is the sole reason older phones are thrown off the upgrade bus, every company has its own internal reasons for not including all models in annual operating system updates. In many cases, the newer system software is written to take advantage of more recent processors and other hardware components that older hardware lacks.\nAdditionally, as mobile operating systems mature with each release, the storage space required to install and run them may also exceed the available room on some early-model phones. Having fewer phone models to troubleshoot and support for each operating system update is also appealing to some developers.\nWith Apple\u2019s iPhones andGoogle\u2019s own Nexus lineof smartphones, you should get at least two years of system updates for your device once you buy it. The expiration date for Android-based hardware from other manufacturers varies, though,as it does for Windows Phone.\nGoogle released itsAndroid 7.0 (Nougat)software on Aug. 22, but it dropped official support for two devices released in 2013, the Nexus 5 phone and the second-generation Nexus 7 tablet. Android 7.0 is available for the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P and General Mobile 4G smartphones, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C tablets, and the Nexus Player set-top box, which wasrecently discontinued. (Android enthusiasts may soon find a way to install unofficial updates on the older devices, but tinker at your own risk.)\nApple\u2019s iOS 10 system, expected to arrive within the next few weeks, works on a larger number of devices from the company\u2019s hardware archives. Thenew software will supportthe iPhone 5 (released in 2012) and later, last year\u2019s sixth-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPad (also released in 2012) and later \u2014 including the iPad Mini 2, iPad Air and iPad Pro variations."

First, though, make sure the video files you want to use are in formats that work on the iPod. Thelatest version of the Nano can playH.264 or MPEG-4 video in the .mp4 and .mov formats (as well as the .m4v format that Apple uses for copy-protected video from its iTunes Store).\nOnce you find and download a compatible video file, import the movie into the iTunes program on yourPCorMac.

(If you do not see it immediately, check in the Movies area under Home Videos.) When the transfer is finished, the movie should be in the iPod Nano\u2019s Videos library.\nWhile iTunes is the free software Apple provides for managing content between computer and iPod (especially for iPod models that do not have internet access), several alternative applications can also copy files between devices.CopyTrans,iMazingandiExplorerare just a few of the relatively inexpensive iPod-management tools around.\nFor those who are unfamiliar with it, theInternet Archiveis a free20-year-old online libraryof digital text, audio, video, photos, games and more.

        "title": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer",
        "fulltext": "PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201d\nIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.\nLike other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.\nThe motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.\nIn one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.\nLisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\n\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.\nAlthough much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.\nOne of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.\nApple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.\nGoogle, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\n\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201d\nIn the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to theBusiness Renewables Centerat the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts\u2019 worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before.\nExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\n\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201d\nHelping drive that shift are environmental groups like theWorld Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald\u2019s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart\nElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.\nOne such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.\nAnother is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.\nAlthough the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\n\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.\nRobert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\n\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201d\nTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\n\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201d\nSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.\nWalmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.\nProcter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.\nBut that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.\nAt Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\n\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, issued adefiant letterto his European customers on Tuesday after theregion\u2019s antitrust enforcer ordered Irelandto collect 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, in back taxes from the company.\nBy turns outraged and scolding, Mr. Cook pushed back on thefindings by Europe\u2019s competition commission, which said that Apple had made inappropriate low-tax deals with the Irish government that let the technology company pay almost nothing on its European business in some years.\nInstead, Mr. Cook framed Apple\u2019s operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission\u2019s decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe.\nWe examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to fact-check the chief executive\u2019s statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission\u2019s case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws.\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cAs our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world.\u201d\nFACT CHECKWhile it\u2019s not a bad guess that Apple is the largest taxpayer on the planet because of the company\u2019s immense size, even Mr. Cook saidin testimony before Congressin 2013 that this was just an estimate. United States corporate tax information is private, so there is no way for Apple to say for sure that it is the biggest taxpayer in the country, much less the world.\nThe issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. \u201cThis fight with the European Union is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cTax systems are not a pay-what-you-want system.\u201d\n_________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cIn Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.\u201d\nFACT CHECKApple, along with many multinational companies, takes advantage of differences in national tax laws by moving money around the globe in ways that shrink their overall tax burdens. While a company like Apple may pay all of the taxes that it owes, it also tries to find legal ways to owe as little as possible.\nThe European Union wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a well-known corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the United States.\nWhile Ireland is phasing out some corporation-friendly rules, \u201ccompanies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,\u201d said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University.\n__________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cThe opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals.\u201d\nFACT CHECKThe European Commission makes clear, and tax experts agree, that Ireland let Apple determine how much of the income that it generated in the country would be recognized and taxed there.\nThe rest of Apple\u2019s income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere \u2014 not even in Ireland \u2014 and thus not subject to Ireland\u2019s 12.5 percent tax rate.\nWhile other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a no-no.\n\u201cIn the U.S., states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n__________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cThe Commission\u2019s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been.\u201d\nFACT CHECKMr. Kleinbard said the commission is not replacing Ireland\u2019s tax law with a view of what the commission thinks should happen. It is simply asking Ireland to enforce the tax rate that it has and close loopholes that allow companies like Apple not to recognize large portions of the income they generate in Ireland and pay even less.\n__________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cThis would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of E.U. member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe.\u201d\nFACT CHECKStanford\u2019s Ms. De Simone agrees with Apple that the E.U. ruling hurts the sovereignty of its member countries. If Ireland wants to create rules that allow for stateless entities not to pay taxes anywhere, up until now that has been Ireland\u2019s decision to make.\nWhile the E.U. has been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are \u201can issue for each individual member state in Europe,\u201d said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe.\n__________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cIn Apple\u2019s case, nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the United States.\u201d\nFACT CHECKIt\u2019s true the majority of Apple\u2019s profits are taxed in the United States.\nBut Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens.\n__________\nMR. COOK\u2019S LETTER\u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe.\u201d\nFACT CHECKThere is support among tax experts for this statement. Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center said so many countries are motivated to use low tax rates to generate business that Europe could lose multinational business if companies are discouraged by the commission\u2019s ruling on Irish tax treatment of Apple.\nBut Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to low-cost tax deals, he said.\n\u201cIf we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven \u2014 to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate \u2014 we do add a few jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair.\u201d"
