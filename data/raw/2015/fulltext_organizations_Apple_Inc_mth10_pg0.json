        "title": "In \u2018Steve Jobs,\u2019 Tolerating Tech\u2019s Unpleasant Visionaries",
        "fulltext": "Not long ago, Larry Page watched the Disney film \u201cTomorrowland.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it.\nMr. Page, the co-founder of Google and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet,told shareholdersin June that he wanted to see a positive depiction of technological advances, which is rare in the movies. But while Mr. Page is an optimist\u2019s optimist, likemany criticshe thought \u201cTomorrowland\u201d was a little too utopian. He\u2019d hit on a central problem with attempts to imagine the future in the sunny way that many in Silicon Valley see it: A perfect future makes for a boring story.\n\u201cSteve Jobs,\u201dthe director Danny Boyle\u2019s new biopic about the lateAppleimpresario, aims to get around that problem. The film, which stars Michael Fassbender as Mr. Jobs, is nominally a story about a tech visionary who is unpleasant to just about everyone around him. Yet surprisingly, \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d ends up presenting Mr. Jobs in a positive light, partly because it accepts that his products did change the world for the better, in just the ways he\u2019d promised they would.\n\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d will be seen by many as an attack on Mr. Jobs \u2014 his family and his former colleagues haveharshly criticized it\u2014 but that is just half the story. The film ultimately suggests that the deeply unpleasant behavior of people in the tech industry may be worth putting up with because of what they sometimes manage to create, often in spite of themselves. It is one of the few pop cultural depictions of the tech industry to buy into Silicon Valley\u2019s essential worldview: an aggressive optimism that is willing to roll over just about everything and everyone in its path in the service of what it sees as the more important goal of building tomorrow.\nThe film, which opens in limited release this weekend and more widely on Oct. 23, is the most sophisticated take yet in a growing body of movies, TV shows, novels and other cultural takes on Silicon Valley. Based on a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin that is loosely adapted from Walter Isaacson\u2019s authorized biography of Mr. Jobs, this is the third major film about the Apple co-founder since his death in 2011. There was also \u201cJobs,\u201d the 2013 movie starring Ashton Kutcher, and, this year, \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\u201d thedocumentarian Alex Gibney\u2019s critical take on Mr. Jobs.\ntranscript\nNA\nBeyond Apple, there\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d the HBO comedy about the travails of a start-up, and \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d the AMC drama about the brutal personal computer business of the 1980s. Then there was \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d the 2010 film on the history of Facebook, which Mr. Sorkin also wrote. Even stories not nominally about the industry feature cameos by tech billionaires, who have become easy stand-ins for the powerful forces unleashed by technology \u2014 see \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d the recent acclaimed novel by Joshua Cohen, or the Google-like founder who\u2019s the chief villain in the film \u201cEx Machina.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to explain the bumper crop of pop-cultural takes on the tech industry. Like finance in the 1980s, technology has lately become not just a source of widespread economic angst, but one of social and cultural angst. And a small class of tech founders have become the most powerful figures of our time. Techies are the \u201cNew Establishment,\u201d as Vanity Fair calls them. The magazine even hosts an annual conference devoted to the emerging group of titans who seem certain to one day preside over every aspect of how we buy, watch, read, chat, eat, sleep, dream \u2014 if they don\u2019t already.\nAnd if the recent movies and TV shows about the tech industry are anywhere near accurate, we are all in for a heap of trouble. The tech founders who will rule our future are shown as hapless and comically myopic, inspired either by a desire for world domination or by petty efforts to relieve their social anxieties.\nWhat is unusual about \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is its search for a more authentic motivation for the villainies that we associate with tech billionaires like the Apple co-founder. \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is not very kind to Steve Jobs. He is presented as a man who spent years denying paternity of his daughter and who later only grudgingly paid for her support. At every turn, he treats employees and colleagues as expendable cogs in his corporate game, often without understanding the damage he inflicts on those around him.\nYet unlike many across the business world, the Steve Jobs in this film is not motivated mainly by ego and greed. Instead, what really gets him going is an insatiable desire to \u201cput a dent in the universe,\u201d as Mr. Jobs often put it. Silicon Valley\u2019s insistence on changing the world is usually pilloried in the news media. But here, Mr. Jobs\u2019s mission is accorded respect \u2014 and his behavior, the film implies, can be ultimately tolerated because of what he built.\nPart of the film\u2019s success in this regard rests on Mr. Sorkin\u2019s decision to set the story on the development of the personal computer, a technology whose eventual importance is no longer a matter of dispute. Mr. Jobs\u2019s other great product, the touch-screen smartphone, may one day prove more thoroughly world-changing, but at the moment, it raises almost as many fears as it does hopes, and the film wisely stays away from it.\nThe personal computer, though \u2014 who could argue that it hasn\u2019t proved groundbreaking? To show Mr. Jobs\u2019s ability to see the future, Mr. Sorkin quotes Mr. Jobs\u2019s best argument for the personal computer almost word for word. Humanity\u2019s greatest strength, Mr. Jobsonce noted, is that we\u2019re tool builders. A condor is the most mechanically efficient animal on the planet, but a human being on a bicycle blows the condor away.\n\u201cWhat a computer is to me is, it\u2019s the most remarkable tool that we\u2019ve ever come up with,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\u201d\nThe ultimate importance of the personal computer hangs over every conflict in the film. When Mr. Jobs harangues his staff, when he puts the company ahead of his supposed friends, when he shows little regard for his family in the service of building what\u2019s next, he implicitly holds an ace with the audience who know how things eventually turned out. Sure, he may have been terrible to be around, but in the end, wasn\u2019t he right about the importance of that dent in the universe? And if he hadn\u2019t been as obnoxious about his aims, would the dent have been as large?\nDuring an argument late in the movie, Steve Wozniak, Apple\u2019s co-founder, who, like everyone else, often clashed with Mr. Jobs, tells him: \u201cYour products are better than you are, brother.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Mr. Jobs responds. The tech industry may be peopled by many petty, ruthless, self-important weirdos. But look at the products, not the people. In the future, only the products will matter."

Dupont shares surged on the news.\nMs. Kullman will betemporarily succeededby Edward D. Breen, a former Tyco executive. He joined the board in February after pressure from Nelson Peltz and his investment firm, Trian Fund Management.\nTrian had insisted that DuPont, which makes Kevlar and Teflon, needed to change aftermissing several financial targets. It wanted four seats on the board.\nMs. Kullman fought back and DuPont ultimately prevailed afterseveral months of bitter public argumentsand spurned settlement offers. But Calstrs, the California pension fund, said it was disappointed\n                                                    at the outcome and shares fell on the news.\nThe company\u2019sstock has fallenabout 27 percent for the year to date, giving DuPont a market value of about $44.6 billion.\nTrian has also become one of thebiggest shareholders in General Electric,as Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.It acquired a $2.5 billion stake and said it wanted the company to take on more debt and buy back shares.\nJeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, said hewelcomed the investment. Trian\u2019s proposals do not differ much from Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy, but the stock has returned less than\n                                                    1 percent over the last 12 months.\nG.E. has already been selling off businesses in an effort to focus on its industrial business. Trianmay encourage it to focus more on returning capital to shareholdersthrough buybacks rather than\n                                                    deal-making.\nAsmutual funds find more appealin activists\u2019 efforts and corporate boards have sought to settle with them, these hedge fund managers have become ambitious in their agitations.\nActivists like Mr. Peltz are increasingly generating headlines, especially as thesize of their bets increaseto $1 billion, if not more,Alexandra Stevenson writes in DealBook.\nDaniel S. Loeb staked$1 billion on Yum Brandsin May. Jeffrey W. Ubben amassed abillion-dollar stake in American Expressin August.\nThe hedge fund industry has grown to more than $3 trillion as pension funds and other institutional investors have poured in money.Activist hedge funds now manage more than$129 billion in assets,\n                                                    compared with just $29 billion 10 years ago.\nAlthough this has enabled them to bet on bigger companies, they are alsoplaying down the activist labelin an effort to avoid the image of a corporate raider.\nAfter Mr. Loeb, known for writing sharply critical letters to corporate leaders, took his position in Yum, he emphasized that it wasnot an activist investment.\nMr. Ubben has yet to disclose whether he plans to wage an activist campaign at American Express. This isn\u2019t even the biggest for ValueAct Capital Management, his hedge fund. In 2013, he took a$2 billion stake in Microsoft.\n                                                    Months later, Steven A. Ballmer announced he was stepping down as chief executive and Microsoft reached an agreement to include ValueAct in business discussions with the board and management.\nSomesee a catchin such enormous bets.\n\u201cYou can no longer be looking at companies that are $1 billion in market capitalization if you need to be putting out a billion dollars per investment,\u201d said Gregory P. Taxin, founder of the\n                                                    activist hedge fund Luma Asset Management said, referring to funds like Trian.\u201cIt\u2019s a smaller universe of opportunities.\u201d\n\nBERNANKE\u2019S FRANK LOOK AT LEHMAN BROTHERS|It is astonishing to hear a former Federal Reserve chairman acknowledge that he\n                                                    may havemisled the publicas part of an agreement with another senior government official about one of the most crucial moments in recent financial history,Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.\nIn his new memoir, Ben S. Bernanke writes that he and Henry M. Paulson, then the treasury secretary, purposely obfuscated when asked about Lehman\u2019s collapse early on, allowing the perception that\n                                                    the government had purposely let the firm fail. \u201cBut we had agreed in advance to be vague because we were intenselyconcerned that acknowledging our inability to save Lehman would hurt market confidenceand increase pressure on other vulnerable firms,\u201d Mr. Bernanke writes.\nSpeculation has swirled for years aboutwhether the government could have saved the firmand whether its failure was a political choice.\nMr. Bernanke explains that he was worried that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could have been next in line and that if the public thought the Federal Reserve couldn\u2019t save those firms, it would\n                                                    havehastened the crisis.\nNow he wonders whether he should have been more forthcoming.\u201cOur caginess about the reasons for Lehman\u2019s failure created confusion about the criteria for any future rescues. Would it have\n                                                    been better for market confidence to have admitted that we were unable to save Lehman? Or was it better to maintain ambiguity, as we did, which suggested we still had the capacity to carry out future\n                                                    interventions?I don\u2019t know.\u201c\nMr. Bernanke said it would have beenimpossible to save Lehmanand pointed out that no one has come forward on the record or produced any document saying that the government had found a way to save\n                                                    it and did not do so for political reasons.\n\u201cI do not want the notion that Lehman\u2019s failure could have been avoided, and that its failure was consequently a policy choice, to become the received wisdom, for the simple reason that it\n                                                    is not true,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe dideverything we could think ofto avoid it.\u201d\n\nON THE AGENDA|Trade datafor August will be released at 8:30 a.m.Ben S.

Ackmanwill be a guest on Bloomberg Television at 4 p.m.\n\nSUPREME COURT DENIES INSIDER TRADING HEARING|The Supreme Court refused to review an appeals court decision that made itharder to prosecute insider tradingand threatens to undermine a number of convictions,Matthew Goldstein and Adam Liptak report in DealBook.\nTodd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, two former hedge fund managers, were convicted in 2012, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitoverturned their convictions.\nThe case concerned trading at two hedge funds that was said to be based on inside information about earnings announcements at two tech companies. Mr. Newman and Mr. Chiasson argued that theylearned the information indirectlyand did not know enough to be held criminally responsible for trading on them.\nThe appellate court ruled that the original tips were not unlawful. It said it required proof of \u201ca meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d as well as \u201cpotential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.\u201d\n                                                    It also said there was not enough evidence that the defendants knew they were trading on information of this sort.\nThe Justice Department wanted a review of the ruling on theproof needed to establish personal benefit. It said it represented a change in decades of insider trading case law.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a blow to Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. His office oversaw a crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry and he says the ruling\n                                                    would make itmore difficult to bring criminal caseswhen corporate executives pass on an inside tip to a friend or a relative expecting nothing special in return.\nThe justices\u2019 decision may putmore pressure on Congressto better define what constitutes trading on illegal inside information.\nIt may alsojeopardize other insider trading convictionssecured by Mr. Bharara\u2019s office, including one against Michael Steinberg, a former trader who worked for Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire\n                                                    investor.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nSkyworks to Buy PMC-Sierra for $2 Billion in Merger of Chip Makers|Skyworks\u2019 chief said he expected savings of $75 million\n                                                    from combining the companies, part of a broader consolidation in the industry.NYT \u00bb\n\nSuncor Announces Hostile Takeover Bid for Canadian Oil Sands|If successful, the transaction will give Suncor, Canada\u2019s\n                                                    largest integrated energy company, control of Syncrude, which is Canadian Oil Sands\u2019 only asset.NYT \u00bb\n\nGlobal Jet Capital to Buy G.E.\u2019s Corporate Aircraft Portfolio in $2.5 Billion Deal|Global Jet Capital expects more companies\n                                                    and wealthy individuals to rent rather than buy plush planes worth as much as $75 million.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nNestl\u00e9 in Talks to Form Joint Venture With R&R Ice Cream|The Swiss food giant will contribute ice cream businesses in\n                                                    Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Europe and the Philippines to the deal.NYT \u00bb\n\nApple Acquires Start-Up Developing Advanced A.I. for Phones|The company\u2019s leaders, Nicolas Pinto and Zak Stone, are both\n                                                    established artificial intelligence researchers who specialize in developing image-recognition systems using deep learning.Bloomberg News\n\nCiti to Cut Lending to Coal Miners|Citigroup has pledged to cut lending to coal mining companies, citing the \u201ctremendous\u201d\n                                                    challenge of tackling climate change.THE FINANCIAL TIMES\n\nStandard Chartered to Set Up India Subsidiary|Standard Chartered\u2019s move would make it the only one of the country\u2019s\n                                                    \u201cbig three\u201d foreign lenders \u2014 a group that includes HSBC and Citigroup \u2014 to agree to regulatory requests to set up subsidiary operations.THE FINANCIAL TIMES\n\nGoogle Takes Stake in Symphony Communication Services|Google plans to invest in a new round of funding for the Wall Street-backed\n                                                    messaging company that values it at about $650 million, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nFintech and the Opening Up of Customer Information|There is a view that online marketplace lending depends on profiling, discriminating\n                                                    and limiting customer choices for success \u2014 something currently being passed off as \u201ccustomization\u201d.THE FINANCIAL TIMES\n\nVista Equity Said to Plan $8 Billion Fund as Soon as October|Vista Equity Partners, which focuses on data, technology and software\n                                                    investments, is planning its biggest fund yet, Bloomberg News reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.BLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nAmerican Apparel Filing Shines Light on Hedge Fund Standard General|The fund was instrumental in appointing American Apparel\u2019s\n                                                    current board, which includes David Glazek, a Standard General partner, and two executives who had worked for companies in which the fund had major investments.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nTalking Inequality With The Hedge Fund Industry\u2019s Biggest Cheerleader|\u201cLife is unfair,\u201d says Anthony Scaramucci,\n                                                    who runs SkyBridge Capital, a \u201cfund of funds\u201d that places investors\u2019 money in a variety of different hedge funds.Gawker\n\nHong Kong Exchange Gives Up On Dual-Class Share Plan|The Hong Kong stock exchange has given up a plan to let companies sell shares\n                                                    with different voting rights, dealing a big blow to its efforts to attract high-profile technology companies to list in the territory.THE FINANCIAL TIMES\n\nData Transfer Pact Between U.S. and Europe Is Ruled Invalid|The decision by the European Court of Justice throws into doubt how\n                                                    tech giants like Facebook and Google can use digital data from millions of users.NYT \u00bb\n\nConstitutional Challenges to S.E.C.\u2019s Use of In-House Judges|The agency has been winning the battle over administrative\n                                                    proceedings, but two commissioners have questioned how to resolve constitutional challenges.White Collar Watch \u00bb\n\nWhat Changes Lie Ahead From the Trans-Pacific Partnership Pact|In the long run, lowering barriers among the United States and\n                                                    11 other nations could help decrease prices in stores.

        "title": "As HopStop Nears End of the Line, Transfer to Citymapper",
        "fulltext": "HopStop, until recently the go-to app for New York\u2019s savviest subway navigators, is nearing the end of the line. It has been owned by Apple for two years, and as of this month, it is no longer featured in the App Store. For those who have the app, it continues to operate at the time of this writing, but now the core of HopStop\u2019s transit directions has beenfolded into the Maps applicationof the newest iPhone operating system.\nThe transit feature in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 is passable, and will no doubt improve. It gave me competent directions from my office in Midtown Manhattan to my house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. But many of the features that made HopStop such a useful tool \u2014 a subway map that was available offline, a panoply of suggested route options \u2014 are not as easy to use in this iteration.\nIf HopStop had remained the only reliable transit app in town, this would come as bad news. Luckily, HopStop was overtaken by a competitortwo years ago.That competitor, Citymapper, remains the single best app for finding your way in the city.\nAzmat Yusuf, the founder of Citymapper, said he had started hearing from a lot of formerly dedicated HopStop users who had made their way to his app.\n\u201cNew users go, \u2018Wow, things have changed; apps have evolved,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.\nCitymapper continues to stand out for the abundance of information with which it supplies users. Plug a desired destination into the app, and you learn of multiple routes to get there on multiple modes of transit.\nThere\u2019s no need to search or specify how you\u2019d prefer to travel: The destination is all the app needs, and then the various routes \u2014 by walking, biking, taxi, and several different subway and bus lines and combinations thereof \u2014 are a click away, as well as information about calories burned and the price of a taxi.\nCitymapper is also intuitive. I was in Boston last weekend, and when I opened the app on my return to New York, it recognized that I had changed cities and adjusted its settings accordingly, after asking. (Citymapper works with nearly 30 cities\u2019 transit systems, including those in Hong Kong, Lisbon and Philadelphia.) If you\u2019re riding the bus, it dings when you\u2019re approaching your stop. It adjusts with real-time information about subway delays.\nCitymapper is still entirely venture-backed and sources the data it uses from a variety of different places, including Apple and Google Maps. I asked Mr. Yusuf if, now that Apple is beefing up its transit directions, he was worried that Citymapper might lose access to that information.\nHe expressed confidence that both companies would continue to share. But, he said, even if that were to happen, there would be other places to find the information. \u201cIn such a situation, we can always find Plan B,\u201d he said.\nThat is Citymapper\u2019s greatest strength: It makes the options for Plans B through J abundantly clear.JONAH BROMWICH"

        "fulltext": "The technology industry\u2019s financial data is set to go on full display this week.\nWithIntel having reported earnings last week, a lineup of other tech companies are now on deck to do the\n                                        same. IBM, Yahoo and eBay, along with Amazon, Google and Microsoft, among others, are all preparing to post their quarterly results over the next few days. Next week, it will be the turn of Apple, Twitter and others.\nThe earnings will spotlight the winners and losers of the tech industry, especially as the large companies compete with one another for revenue, users and strategic advantage.\nOne of the fiercest rivalries, of course, is between Apple and Google, which battle each other in multiple arenas. That includes how they view the mobile world, with Apple pushing an app-centric vision while Google\n                                        prefers a mobile web-centric one.Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty foundthat those two differing\n                                        viewpoints have resulted in many websites getting stuck in the middle, with the businesses trying to figure out if they should do an app (as suggested by Apple), a mobile website (as recommended by Google), or both.\nThe earnings results in the next few weeks may indicate which side is winning such tussles. Check back here soon for any verdict."

        "title": "Apps to Organize and Quell the Political Onslaught",
        "fulltext": "As the 2016 presidential race begins to accelerate, debate and political opinion are abounding online. Your smartphone can help you control this flood of political news, as well as inform you about important facts.\nIt\u2019s hard to go online without taking part in some form of social interaction, and even political apps can connect users. Brigade \u2014free on iOS\u2014 is an example of this sort of app. Brigade is a social network for discussing and informally voting on political issues like gun control, the environment and health care. The app is nicely designed, making it fairly easy to use, though I occasionally got lost in its menu system.\nOnce you have signed up for a free profile, you can scan Brigade\u2019s archive to find public votes on issues that interest you. Each issue is phrased in a way that users can agree or disagree with it, or choose unsure. Voting tallies are displayed as numbers and graphs. There is also a page where you and other users can write opinions about the issue. Users on this part of the app can, not surprisingly, become highly charged.\nBrigade users can also submit questions for others to vote on. And because the app is a social network, you can build a network of friends in it, though unfortunately, the app makes it seem a little as if friends are only those other users who agree with your opinions. If nothing else, Brigade is a great way to engage in political debate and gauge what issues people are talking about.\nWhen presidential candidates make references to constitutional matters, you may find yourself wanting to brush up on the Constitution. The iOS appTranscript of the United States Constitution, by Clifton Marien, is clear and simple. It contains a full copy of the text, shown in a clear and minimalist design. The text is easy to read and broken down into sections like the preamble, the articles and so on. You simply tap, scroll and read. And it is free.\nOn Android, thefree United States Constitution appby RBware not only offers a clean and plain text-based interface in which to read the famous document, but also a few extra features, including similar documents, like Magna Carta. And it has the option to jump to the Wikipedia pages for items in the app or to Google search for relevant websites.\nThe Library of Congress has an official constitution app, free foriOSonly, that has a more formal design and includes search features to find relevant sections easily. But several app store reviewers complained that the app was buggy, and I found it took a long time to download the text. Also, the text in the app is dense, making it difficult to read. So I\u2019d recommend skipping this app. While the thousands of pages of analysis and insight can be interesting, it is not easy to use.\nIf you\u2019re seeking an app that consolidates political news, check out Politomix,free on iOS. The app says it scans 40 top political news sources and collects breaking news in one place when you activate it. The main interface lists the most recent news in a scrolling list, complete with thumbnail images, and you tap to read the ones that catch your eye.\nPolitomix uses gestures to make it easy to scan quickly among stories, and if you want to read news from just one particular source, that\u2019s possible, too. The app hasn\u2019t been updated in a while, so sometimes text errors will appear, but overall, it seems to work well.\nA good alternative is the popular news-aggregating app Flipboard, which can be configured to show political news from many sources. Unlike Politomix, Flipboard is well maintained, so it\u2019s more likely to work well on your device, and it has a more polished interface. Flipboard is free oniOSandAndroid,and it\u2019s a fabulous tool for stemming the flood of political news arriving in your digital life.\nAnd don\u2019t forget the official White House app, which is packed with easy-to-navigate news, briefings and videos from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The app is well designed and free, so check it out oniOSandAndroid.\nPolitics is divisive, so remember to be open-minded and stay calm when discussing it online. You never know \u2014 you might change your mind, or your vote.\nThe independent podcast network Relay FM has released an app to give listeners access to its many different podcasts, which mostly have a technology bent. The app is visually great, and though it doesn\u2019t give you full control of podcasts, lacking features like activating subscriptions, it\u2019s a great way to stream recent podcasts from the network. Relay FM isfree."

        "fulltext": "The world may be discovering just how many tweets it needs.\nOn Tuesday,Twitter released results for its third quarterthat revealed what Wall Street analysts already\n                                        knew: The San Francisco company\u2019s revenues are still growing at a healthy though not particularly profitable clip, but persuading more people to use the social media service is proving difficult.\nThe future challenges of revenue growth were also driven home by the company\u2019s disappointing forecast for its fourth quarter. Twitter warned that revenue would be $695 million to $710 million, well below the\n                                        $740 million that Wall Street had been expecting, according to S&P Capital IQ data.\nAt the other end of the tech spectrum,Apple\u2019s most recent quarteralso beat Wall Street expectations.\nStill, the world\u2019s most valuable company \u2014 which tends to undersell what\u2019s ahead \u2014 issued a forecast for the current quarter that could raise eyebrows among investors. Apple said revenue\n                                        would be $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion. That would be up from $74.6 billion a year earlier but below Wall Street estimates of $77 billion at the low end.\nNo doubt, those are gigantic numbers. But that tame (by Apple standards) forecast could be an early indication that Apple is starting to learn just how many iPhones the world needs."

        "title": "The Patent Troll Smokescreen",
        "fulltext": "Is the University of Wisconsin-Madison a patent troll?\nThe question is not as strange as it might seem. \u201cPatent trolls\u201d are entities that own patents that they use not to further innovation or manufacture a product but to conduct a kind of legal extortion racket. Holding patents that are sometimes absurdly vague, they send \u201cdemand letters\u201d to the thousands of companies that use, for instance, bar scanners \u2014 to cite a legendary example \u2014 accusing them of patent infringement.\nMany companies pay a fee to avoid litigation, but others decide to stand and fight. Sometimes they win; sometimes they lose. In either case, patent trolling is sand in the engine of commerce.\nNow consider the University of Wisconsin-Madison, or more precisely, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), which owns the university\u2019s patents. Whenever the university\u2019s scientists come up with innovations \u2014 which they rarely intend to use to manufacture a product \u2014 WARF applies for a patent and then seeks to license it, just as trolls do.\nIn higher education circles, WARF is known as a fierce defender of its patent portfolio. Just like the trolls, it does not back away when it believes companies have infringed on its patents, and it will litigate those claims if need be.\nBut, of course, nobody thinks a university is a patent troll. Universities are supposed to come up with new ideas, not manufacture new products. That\u2019s what companies do. If a university holds a scientist\u2019s patent, the main way it gets the innovation into the hands of a company is through a licensing agreement. Robin Feldman, a University of California Hastings College of the Law professor known for her anti-troll views, notes that the law specifically gives universities the right to seek patents on federally funded research. Why? \u201cTo encourage the commercialization of new products.\u201d\nBut what if, in the name of cracking down on trolls, Congress passes an anti-troll law that winds up having huge negative consequences for legitimate inventors? What if a series of Supreme Court rulings make matters worse, putting onerous burdens on inventors while making it easier for big companies to steal unlicensed innovations?\nAs it happens, thanks to the 2011 America Invents Act and those rulings, big companies can now largely ignore legitimate patent holders.\nOf course, they don\u2019t call it stealing. But according to Robert Taylor, a patent lawyer who has represented the National Venture Capital Association, a new phrase has emerged in Silicon Valley: \u201cefficient infringing.\u201d That\u2019s the relatively new practice of using a technology that infringes on someone\u2019s patent, while ignoring the patent holder entirely. And when the patent holder discovers the infringement and seeks recompense, the infringer responds by challenging the patent\u2019s validity.\nShould a lawsuit ensue, the infringer, often a big tech company, has top-notch patent lawyers at the ready. Because the courts have largely robbed small inventors of their ability to seek an injunction \u2014 that is, an order requiring that the infringing product be removed from the market \u2014 the worst that can happen is that the infringer will have to pay some money. For a rich company like, say, Apple, that\u2019s no big deal.\nWhat got me thinking about this was, in fact, a recent lawsuit between Apple and WARF over a University of Wisconsin innovation that Apple uses to help speed the processing time of several versions of the iPhone and iPad. Apple not only couldn\u2019t be bothered to license the patent; it wouldn\u2019t even let WARF in the door to negotiate. Instead, Apple sent the foundation a link to a page on the Apple website, which says that the company can lay claim to any unsolicited idea. So WARF sued. What choice did it have?\nLast week, a jury ruled in WARF\u2019s favor and then ordered Apple to pay some $234 million. Although I hear that WARF is pleased with the outcome, Apple is actually the big winner. Thanks to efficient infringing, WARF never had the chance to grant an exclusive license to an Apple competitor, which could have hurt Apple while maximizing WARF\u2019s financial gain. WARF had to resort to expensive litigation to get what it should have been able to achieve through less expensive negotiation. And, of course, $234 million is pocket change for Apple. This is \u201cpatent reform\u201d?\nThere are new patent reform bills in both the House and the Senate that are once again allegedly aimed at trolls \u2014 but will, once again, effectively tilt the playing field even further toward big companies with large lobbying budgets.\n\u201cThis is not about trolls,\u201d says Brian Pomper, the executive director of the Innovation Alliance, which supports inventors. \u201cTrolls are a fantastic narrative for companies that want to get their patents cheaper.\u201d The recent changes in patent law also show \u201chow big companies can use Washington to get a business advantage,\u201d he added.\nFor the sake of real innovation, and in the name of the small inventor, who holds a special place in America\u2019s mythology, the pendulum needs to start swinging in the other direction."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Applewants mobile devices to be filled with apps.Googlesupports a world where people browse the web for most things. Now websites are increasingly caught in the middle of those competing visions.\nConsider The Atavist Magazine, an online publication run by Evan Ratliff. To attract the broadest audience possible, Mr. Ratliff said he felt pressure to do everything twice: once for the web and once for the magazine\u2019s app. But maintaining a website and getting readers for it while also building an audience of iPhone users with an app took time \u2014 too much time, Mr. Ratliff said. So last month,The Atavist shut down its appand decided to publish only on the web.\n\u201cGetting someone to download an app is way harder than targeting them and sending them stories through social media,\u201d said Mr. Ratliff, co-founder of the magazine. The decision was difficult because The Atavist\u2019s app had a following, and it is \u201chard to give up any audience once you have it,\u201d he said. But in the end, the app\u2019s limitations were too great, he said.\nThe Internet was supposed to be a place where billions of potential users could be reached in one place, simply and inexpensively. But as Apple focuses on apps and Google pushes the mobile web, businesses are grappling with a fragmenting online world.\nThe two tech giants\u2019 competing visions have a common denominator: money. Apple\u2019s main business is selling devices, so it favors apps that make its iPhone a must for consumers. Google makes its money showing people ads that are tailored to their web searches, so it favors a free and open web.\nBoth are such big companies that there is considerable overlap. Google also makes money selling apps and owns popular programs like Gmail and YouTube, while Apple has growing advertising and search businesses. But even those differences are tied to the vision of their core products, with some Apple search tools being most useful for searching its devices and apps, and Google\u2019s many efforts to help people navigate apps fitting into its mission to build a simple search box for anything and everything online.\nThe competing strategies have made it particularly tough for publishers, which straddle apps and the web more than most mobile categories. That is because publishers tend to use apps to cater to the most loyal users and use the web to be found by new readers. As a result, many have invested lots of time and money on a website and an app, which is a huge burden for small publishers that cannot afford a large technology staff.\nThat situation has been made even harder by some recent moves by Apple and Google. Last month,Apple enabled ads to be blockedon mobile websites on iPhones and iPads, which threatened to hurt publishers that relied on such ads for revenue. And next month, Googlewill start penalizing websitesthat use pop-up screens to promote their apps by placing them lower in search engine results, a move that some have called \u201capp blocking.\u201d\nAt the same time, Google has many projects to make the mobile web faster, including a publisher-focused initiative calledAccelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, which aims to ensure news and other articles will load more quickly on the mobile web.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the war between them has become an issue for publishers\u201d given that Apple and Google have pushed competing ways to make money from content for years, said Maggie Mesa, the head of publisher development atManage.com, a company that sells ads in apps. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s taken this long.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman said: \u201cThe App Store and apps have transformed what people do with mobile devices and have revolutionized the entire industry. Our incredible developer community has created over 1.5 million of the most innovative apps in the world, and they have earned over $33 billion on the App Store. Whether iOS users choose apps or the web for enjoying content, they will have a great experience.\u201d\nGoogle said by email: \u201cPeople want content to be fast, discoverable, and accessible. Both apps and the mobile web are important to publishers and we\u2019re investing in both.\u201d\nThe apps-versus-web debate seems to be a no-brainer for some websites. Apps appear to have largely defeated the mobile web, with Americans spending about 60 percent of online time in a mobile app, about 30 percent on a desktop computer and just 9 percent in the mobile web, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report on digital advertising.\nYet for some publishers, the cost of an app can be onerous. Publishers have to market the app, often by buying things like mobile ads that ask readers to install the app. Such costs drove The Magazine, a long-form digital magazine,out of business last year, even though it had 35,000 app subscribers at its peak in February 2013 and grossed about $750,000 over 28 months.\n\u201cIt was just too hard to stand out in the noise,\u201d said Glenn Fleishman, editor of The Magazine.\nBy comparison, the web can seem to be an attractive option. Sites like The Atavist can use social media to cut marketing costs.\n\u201cEven though there are problems with the mobile web, I see very few publications starting with an app now,\u201d said Mr. Ratliff of The Atavist. After jettisoning the app, he said he could focus more on finding ways to distribute articles through Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. \u201cThese places drive traffic,\u201d he said.\nOther publications, likeBike Hugger, a cycling site, are trying to serve all of the platforms. D.\u00a0L. Byron, the publisher of Bike Hugger, has had an app since June 2013 and a mobile site since October 2011. He said he used the shorter content he runs on the web to encourage people to subscribe to the app. \u201cWe evolved as our audience and tech did,\u201d he said.\nMr. Byron added that he was watching carefully what Apple and Google do because either company could easily take away his ability to make money from an audience.\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more time thinking about what Google and Apple are going to do than when we were just doing desktop publishing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can change on a dime and pull the rug out from under you, like when Google cut off news feeds and Apple decided to allow ad blocking.\u201d\nBeing caught in the middle is \u201cenormously disturbing,\u201d said Ann Kjellberg, the publisher of the poetry and prose journalLittle Star. She could not afford to hire a technology staff to make an app, so in mid-2012, she hired 29th Street Publishing to create one. It now takes a cut of the app\u2019s subscription revenue. She later had 29th Street make a mobile website, for which it takes a percentage of the subscription revenue.\n\u201cFor anybody trying to do something independent on their own, it\u2019s difficult to integrate into this technological environment,\u201d Ms. Kjellberg said. She added that companies like Google and Apple were aiming not \u201cto support the endeavor of creative working people, but to get people addicted to their business models, their devices or interaction with a screen.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014Applehas disabled its news app inChina, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, the most recent sign of how difficult it can be for foreign companies to manage the strict rules governing media and online expression there.\nThe Apple News app, which the companyannounced in June, is available only to users in the United States, though it is being tested in Britain and Australia. Customers who already downloaded the app by registering their phones in the United States can still see content in it when they travel overseas \u2014 but they have found that it does not work in China.\nThose in China who look at the top of the Apple News feed, which would normally display a list of selected articles based on a user\u2019s preferred media, instead see an error message: \u201cCan\u2019t refresh right now. News isn\u2019t supported in your current region.\u201d\nApple, based in Cupertino, Calif., declined to comment.\nGreater China is now Apple\u2019s second-largest source of revenue after the United States, with sales of more than $13 billion in the third quarter. That means the company is most likely taking a careful approach to delivering new content, like that on its news app, within China.\nBeijing generally insists that companies are responsible for censoring content inside China. In Apple\u2019s case, that would mean it would probably have to develop a censorship system \u2014 most Chinese companies use a combination of automated software and employees \u2014 to eliminate sensitive articles from feeds.\nFor now, Apple seems to be avoiding the problem by completely disabling the service for users in China.\nStill, even if the company is moving carefully to appease the government, the move is already troubling some users. Larry Salibra, an entrepreneur who founded Pay4Bugs, a software testing service, pointed out the issuelast weekon Twitter. In a written interview, Mr. Salibra said he found what Apple was doing \u201cvery disconcerting.\u201d\nIn a post on Reddit, Mr. Salibra went further, writing, \u201cThey\u2019re censoring news content that I downloaded and stored on my device purchased in the USA, before I even enter China just because my phone happens to connect to a Chinese signal floating over the border.\u201d\n\u201cOn device censorship is much different than having your server blocked by the Great Firewall or not enabling a feature for customers with certain country iTunes account,\u201d his post continued. \u201cThat Apple has little choice doesn\u2019t make it any less creepy or outrageous.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple and Twitter, which announce quarterly earnings after the market\u2019s close on Tuesday, might be considered companies at very different stations.\nApple is still \u2014 by a wide stretch \u2014 the most valuable company in the world. It generates more cash in a quarter than all but a handful of tech outfits generate in revenue. Its products are everywhere.\n                                        And its financial performance in recent years has been so strong that anything other than exceeding expectations is met with disappointment.\nOther thanless-than-flattering movie portrayalsof its famous co-founder, Apple is the company to which\n                                        all the little tech companies aspire. As they have over the last few quarters, analysts will be watching to see how iPhones are selling in China. They\u2019ll also be looking for indications that Apple Pay and\n                                        Apple Music are catching on \u2014 though both are probably still too small to move the financial needle.\nAnd then there\u2019s Twitter. The social media darling of the media set is stuck in second gear. Growth has slowed. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and first chief executive, has been brought back to right the ship (that\n                                        is, when he\u2019s not busy preparing his other company, Square, for an initial public offering).\nMr. Dorsey appears to have provided Twitter with a much-needed jolt of enthusiasm. But the hard job of getting more people to use his company\u2019s product appears daunting. As a result, when Twitter releases its\n                                        results on Tuesday afternoon, Wall Street analysts are more likely to focus on what will happen rather than what has already passed.\nMany analysts believe Twitter is still a company with enormous potential. Wall Street is eager to hear how Mr. Dorsey plans to unlock it.\nAlibaba, a Chinese Internet company somewhere between the industry giant Apple and the struggling adolescent Twitter in the tech industry\u2019s pecking order, alsoannounced its quarterly resultsearly on Tuesday. It appears that Alibaba has managed to shrug off its home country\u2019s recent economic turmoil. Sales rose 32 percent compared with the same period last year, better than analysts\u2019 expectations.\n                                        After the earnings release, Alibaba\u2019s shares jumped almost 9 percent in premarket trading."
