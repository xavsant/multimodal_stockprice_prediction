        "title": "Tips and Myths About Extending Smartphone Battery Life",
        "fulltext": "Ashlei Teme\u00f1a\u2019s family trip to Disneyland last Thanksgiving break turned into a nightmare when her smartphone battery hit empty.\nMs. Teme\u00f1a, a San Francisco support technician, had gotten separated from her family and realized she had no way to find anyone. Instead of riding roller coasters, she wandered around searching for the group \u2014 eventually locating them four hours later watching fireworks.\n\u201cI wanted to throw my phone on the ground by the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Teme\u00f1a said.\nMany consumers can relate. Despite the leaps forward in mobile phone technology with crisp, clear screens and faster chips, batteries have made only sluggish progress. That has propelled a desire for longer battery life to the top of the list of factors considered by consumers when they purchase smartphones, according to a 2014 survey by the research firm IDC.\nSo why is battery technology still underwhelming? Plenty of companies have been developingsmarter battery technologyfor years, including methods to increase battery capacity tenfold or charge devices by pulling energy from the air. But lithium ion, the technology that most mainstream batteries are based on, is low cost and easily reproducible while being safe \u2014 so we\u2019ll be stuck with it for the foreseeable future, said Charlie Quong, an executive at Mophie, a battery accessory maker, in an interview.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investments on all fronts for improving the technology above and beyond that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that hitting any kind of mass market for several years out,\u201d Mr. Quong said. In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.\nWith that backdrop in mind, we teamed up withthe Wirecutter, a product recommendations website, to run an array of tests to determine best and worst practices for preserving battery life on smartphones. For those who still need extra juice, the Wirecutter also picked some external battery products.\nThe results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life \u2014 like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone\u2019s apps \u2014 produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.\nThe Wirecutter tested a range of recent Apple and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone\u2019s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold. Here are eight tips and seven myths busted by our findings:\nA smartphone\u2019s screen consumes more energy than any other component, so the easiest way to cut down battery drain is to reduce your screen brightness. In an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.\nBut it\u2019s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on ambient light. The Wirecutter found that enabling auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life.\nWhen browsing the web, your smartphone also burns through power when it downloads mobile ads on websites. Installing an ad blocker will greatly extend battery life.\nThe Wirecutter ran a test that cycled through a list of websites for two hours over a Wi-Fi connection. Safari on an iPhone 6s used 18 percent of a full battery; Chrome on a Moto X Pure Android phone used 22 percent. Installing the1Blockerad blocker on the iPhone reduced battery usage for the same test to only 9 percent of a full battery; on an Android phone, using theGhostery Privacy Browser, which blocks ads, used only 8 percent of the battery.\nEmail can have a major impact on battery life if you have multiple email accounts and receive lots of email. Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there\u2019s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.\nThe Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone\u2019s overall battery use.\nTo save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or \u201cfetch\u201d) emails on a schedule \u2014 say, every 30 minutes \u2014 or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.\nThe next tip may come as unwelcome news. Nowadays, online streaming is the most popular way to listen to music, with services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music \u2014 but this method guzzles lots of battery power. In the Wirecutter\u2019s tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10 percent of an iPhone\u2019s battery reserves; streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5 percent.\nFortunately, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music still let you listen to songs the old-school way: by storing the music right on your device.\nYou may have noticed that when you\u2019re in a place without good Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, your phone\u2019s battery seems to drain much more quickly. That\u2019s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.\nTo conserve battery life, disable the phone\u2019s wireless circuitry. Airplane Mode, an option that will turn off all wireless features, is a quick and easy solution in areas with poor reception.\nAlternatively, you can disable (in your phone\u2019s settings) a single wireless feature. For example, if you have terrible wireless carrier coverage in your office, but Wi-Fi is great, disabling cellular connectivity while there will keep the phone from wasting energy trying to get a cellular connection while still letting you connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi.\nConsumers can get even better results with a bit of sleuthing. Both the iPhone and Android systems provide a simple way to see which apps are using a lot of battery power. For iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.\nOn the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap the clock button to reveal information about how much of your battery life each app is consuming when you\u2019re actively using the app (\u201cscreen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackgd\u201d). On Android, the most useful information are the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time the app has been busy in the background.\nBe on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods in the background and are using a lot of battery power. Examples include an email app that spends lots of time checking for new messages even when your phone is asleep, a news reader that updates articles in the background or a fitness app that constantly monitors your location.\nIf you find apps using up lots of energy in the background, disable their background activities. On an iPhone, go to the Settings app, tap General and then Background App Refresh and disable the background activities for any apps. On Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Data Usage, choose an app, then select \u201cRestrict Background Data\u201d for background data usage.\nWatch out for apps that track your location. Your phone\u2019s GPS circuitry, which determines your geographic location for mapping and fitness features,consumes a lot of battery power. A run-tracking program that monitors your precise location for the duration of an hourlong run will lower your battery level.\nIf a location-based app is using a lot of power, especially in the background, there\u2019s a good chance the app is using GPS, Wi-Fi and the phone\u2019s sensors frequently. You can decide whether to disable location features for it (either via your phone\u2019s Location Services settings, or by changing settings in the app itself). On an iPhone, you can disable the app\u2019s ability to track your location by going to Privacy menu and Location Services.\nTo disable location tracking on Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Apps, choose an app and select \u201cPermissions,\u201d then tap to disable Location permission.\nBoth Apple and Google recommend disabling push notifications, which are essentially app alerts, to conserve battery life. Notifications require regular communication with notification servers, and each notification causes your phone to wake up for a few seconds, including turning on the screen, to show you a message and give you a chance to act on it.\nIn the Wirecutter\u2019s testing, receiving a few dozen notifications over the course of an hour didn\u2019t noticeably affect battery usage. But if you get a lot of notifications each day, that energy use can add up. If a particular app or service (say, Twitter or your email client) is constantly producing notifications, consider disabling notifications for that app.\nOn an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, tap the app name and disable Allow Notifications. On Android, disable notification in an app\u2019s settings menu, or long-press the notification itself and select the \u201ci\u201d icon. This will send you to that app\u2019s App Notifications settings, where you can block all notifications.\nThere is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let\u2019s start with one of the worst \u201ctips\u201d: Closing (or force-quitting, as it\u2019s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone\u2019s components, so quitting them will save energy.\nWhile that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground \u2014 meaning you are not actively using it \u2014 most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone\u2019s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.\nFinally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone\u2019s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.\nA common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you\u2019re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.\nAn exception is when you\u2019re at the edges of a Wi-Fi network, where your phone is struggling to get a good connection,andyou have a good cellular data connection. But in most cases, you\u2019re usually better off keeping Wi-Fi enabled.\nMany apps that use your location do so only intermittently. Even using the Maps app for short navigation sessions doesn\u2019t use more than a few percent of your battery\u2019s capacity \u2014 and having the phone\u2019s screen continually on is a big part of why navigation uses a lot of power.\nIn other words, don\u2019t disable all of your phone\u2019s location-based features just to extend your battery life. You won\u2019t see a big jump in use time, but you may end up disabling \u2014 and subsequently missing \u2014 useful features. Instead, check (using the tips above) to see if any of apps consuming the most battery life also track your location. If so, and if you don\u2019t need that location tracking, consider disabling it for those apps.\nMany people, and even smartphone vendors such as Apple, claim that using Wi-Fi for wireless data consumes less power than using a cellular signal, so you should use Wi-Fi whenever you can. However, the Wirecutter\u2019s testing found this isn\u2019t always the case.\nIn testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone. On a Motorola Android phone, LTE used only 2 to 3 percent more power than Wi-Fi.\nIn other words, as long as you have a good signal, you probably won\u2019t see a huge difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and it\u2019s probably not worth the hassle of switching between the two.\nBoth iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to the iPhone or \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.\nYet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won\u2019t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.\nUsing Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone\u2019s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute. But just having the feature enabled isn\u2019t worth worrying about \u2014 and it can be quite convenient.\nA common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone\u2019s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it\u2019s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car \u2014 the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.\nFinally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There\u2019s some truth here: Many chargers \u2014 especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk \u2014 are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you\u2019re replacing your phone\u2019s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.\nFor many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required \u201cconditioning\u201d or \u201ccalibrating,\u201d a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today\u2019s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.\nWhat can happen, however, is that the phone itself loses track of how much capacity its battery has: Every battery gradually loses capacity over time as you use and recharge it, and the phone\u2019s software isn\u2019t always good at accounting for this capacity change. By periodically (once every couple of months)fully charging the phone and then using it until it dies, your phone\u2019s software will determine the battery\u2019s current capacity and thus let the phone better estimate how long it will last on a charge. In other words, the battery won\u2019t last any longer, but the phone\u2019s battery meter will be more accurate. If you find that your phone claims you have 80 percent of a charge left, but it dies a few hours later, you should try this procedure.\nIf you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories \u2014 which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable \u2014 can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone\u2019s battery.\nThe Wirecutter tested more than 100 external batteries for dozens of hours to pick a few favorites. Its favorite battery case for the iPhone 6 and 6s isAnker\u2019s Ultra Slim Extended Battery Case, which has enough power to fully charge a dead iPhone and then some, more than doubling the phone\u2019s battery life. For larger iPhones \u2014 the 6 Plus and 6s Plus \u2014 the Wirecutter prefers Tylt\u2019s Energi Sliding Power Case because the case\u2019s two-piece design makes it appealing.\nFor Android phones, an external battery pack is a good option. The AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank with Micro USB Cable 2,000 mAh is the best pack the Wirecutter tested that will fit in your pocket with your phone, and it\u2019s less than $10. A great battery pack for the iPhone is the $29TravelCard, which is almost thin enough to fit in a wallet \u2014 with a built-in Lightning-connector cable to charge your phone.\nFor days of smartphone power, the Anker PowerCore 15600 is the Wirecutter\u2019s pick if you need to charge a phone repeatedly or keep a full-size tablet and phone topped up through a busy week. It has enough available power to charge a typical smartphone five times or to fill a large tablet such as an iPad Air almost twice \u2014 for under $40.\nAfter her stressful day at Disneyland, Ms. Teme\u00f1a bought an external Amazon battery pack. She said the pack could fully charge her phone six times, but it wasn\u2019t ideal because of its bulk. Ultimately, she wishes her iPhone had a better battery.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a battery wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with all the other advances they\u2019re putting into phones now,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Bill Gates Weighs In on Apple\u2019s Clash With the F.B.I.",
        "fulltext": "Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and a founder of Microsoft, has injected his voice into the fierce debate over how far Silicon Valley should go in assisting the government on criminal investigations.\nThere\u2019s no easy answer, he said during aninterview with Bloomberg News, but the discussion is welcome.\nIn an interview published Tuesday morning withThe Financial Times, the newspaper portrayed Mr. Gates as siding with the government in its attempt to force Apple to help investigators extract data from an iPhone that belonged to an attacker in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\u201cThis is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information,\u201d Mr. Gates told the newspaper. \u201cThey are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case.\u201d\nLater,speaking with Bloomberg News, he said the newspaper had gone too far in characterizing his allegiances.\n\u201cI do believe that with the right safeguards there are cases where the government, on our behalf, like stopping terrorism which could get worse in the future, that that is valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut striking that balance \u2014 clearly the government\u2019s taken information historically and used it in ways that we didn\u2019t expect going all the way back, say, to the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover.\u201d\nSince Apple challenged a court ruling on extracting data from the phone last week, most technology industry leaders have either lined up behind Apple orstayed silent. Several prominent Silicon Valley leaders \u2014 includingMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive;Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter; andSundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive \u2014 have cautiously indicated support for Apple\u2019s position that the order posed an unacceptable threat to user privacy.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, hasforcefully arguedthat the order by a federal magistrate judge to assist the government in getting data from the accused terrorist\u2019s phone would open a so-called back door to consumer phones that could obliterate the privacy protections.\n\u201cAt stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people, and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone\u2019s civil liberties,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an internal email sent to Apple employees this week.\nThe government has portrayed its request as limited in nature, a one-time demand focused on a single device, the work phone issued to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino gunmen who killed 14 people late last year.\nThe order was issued on Feb. 16 byMagistrate Judge Sheri Pymof Federal District Court for the District of Central California. Apple has until Friday to file a formal brief opposing the order to cooperate with the F.B.I.\nThe director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey Jr., made the case ina public statementon Sunday. \u201cWe simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist\u2019s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201d\nIn a video interview on Monday with The Associated Press, Mr. Gates said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good debate to be having. I\u2019m hopeful that government safeguards, and it varies country to country, will be enough that people will feel like this can work.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe courts are going to rule, and it will be good to have that precedent. I do think people want the government to act on their behalf that they feel like the safeguards are there.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\n\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\nApple has argued that granting the government\u2019s request to build software to unlock the phone at issue would compromise the security of all the devices used by its hundreds of millions of customers. But Mr. Comey said the case was \u201cunlikely to be a trailblazer,\u201d because encryption technology ischanging so quickly.\n\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201d\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201d\ntranscript\nna\nHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.\nBut answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.\nOfficials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.\nThe hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.\nIn the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.\nApple on Thursdayfiled a formal briefin oppositionto the order, arguing that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were overreaching with their demands.\nMicrosoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.\nMicrosoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.\nA report by The Financial Times, suggesting that Bill Gates, a Microsoft founder, had sided with the government in the case, caused a stir this week. Mr. Gates, who is no longer an executive at the company,later said the newspaperhad mischaracterized his position in the interview.\nMr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201d\nIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\n\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "ByALEX WILLIAMSFEB. 2, 2016\nThe new generation of smartwatches has arrived. Here are six notable ones.\nNearly a year ago, Apple released its Apple Watch, theextensively hyped smartwatch that many thought would shake up the traditional watch industry, or render it obsolete. Talk of revolution, it turns out, was premature. Just as punk rock gave way to radio-friendlynewwave, the Apple Watch simply paved the way for the next generation of smartwatches. The new blockbuster feature? They look less like sci-fi gizmos and more like, well, watches.\nThese days, it seems, everyone \u2014 LG, Motorola, Samsung \u2014 is doing a smartwatch that looks less like a shrunken smartphone and more like a traditional analog timepiece.Here are some wrist-worthy new smartwatches.\nWatchPebble Time Round\nRetail Price$249\nDesign CuesPebble may be a pioneer of smartwatches, but this is its first offering that looks like a dress watch. It contains all the usual smartwatch features (message alerts, incoming calls, sleep and activity tracking) and throws in interchangeable dial faces and bands in varying colors.\nSelling PointAt 7.5 millimeters thin, it appeals to design-minded wearers who don\u2019t want a laptop on their wrists.\n\nWatchCasio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10\nRetail Price$500 (available in April)\nDesign CuesPowered by Android Wear, this is the do-anything cousin of the go-everywhere G-Shock. Dedicated apps track sunrise and sunset times, tides, compass direction, altitude and activity graphs. At nearly 62 mm, it\u2019s big enough to be seen from the summit of Everest.\nSelling PointThe horological equivalent of a Swiss Army knife.\nWatchMovado Bold Motion\nRetail Price$695\nDesign CuesBauhaus, by way of Star Trek. A partnership with HP, the watch maintains Movado\u2019s signature clean lines and keeps the tech just as elegantly minimalist. Subtle vibrations and light notifications indicate incoming emails, text messages, social media alerts and appointments. Also tracks steps.\nSelling PointA smartwatch appropriate for evening cocktails or interplanetary travel.\nWatchTag Heuer Connected\nRetail Price$1,500\nDesign CuesReleased last November, the Connected was greeted as the first salvo from traditional Swiss watchmakers against the new wearable devices. The good news: It looks like a TAG. Featuring a brushed titanium case that recalls TAG\u2019s classic Carrera racing models, its LED touch screen can access a wide range of Android Wear functions.\nSelling PointSwiss luxury design with a matching price tag.\nWatchFitbit Blaze\nRetail Price$199.95 (available in March)\nDesign CuesIs it a fitness tracker or a timepiece? Fitbit is betting that the question will soon be irrelevant. This star of the recent Consumer Electronics Show packs the standard Fitbit functions (heart-rate tracking, activity tracker, guided workouts) into a boardroom-friendly package featuring a color touch screen.\nSelling PointWorks with either a sweatsuit or pinstripe suit.\nWatchFossil Q54 Pilot\nRetailPrice $175\nDesign CuesUnlike smartwatches that masquerade as analog watches, the Q54 is the opposite: an analog watch retrofitted with Intel technology. When paired with a smartphone, it tracks activity and provides message and app alerts through color-coded LEDs and vibrations.\nSelling PointFor tech geeks who don\u2019t want their wrists to scream \u201ctech geek.\u201d\nAdvertisement"
