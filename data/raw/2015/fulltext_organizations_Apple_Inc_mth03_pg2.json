        "title": "\u2018Becoming Steve Jobs,\u2019 by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli",
        "fulltext": "In early 2009, Tim Cook presented Steve Jobs, his cancer-stricken mentor and friend, with a surprise offer: Cook wanted to donate a portion of his own liver to his ailing boss, who was stuck in dangerous limbo on California\u2019s waiting list for liver transplants.\nCook had researched the surgical procedure known as a living-donor transplant, even traveling to visit hospitals outside the San Francisco Bay Area to avoid media attention. He apparently concluded that his blood type was the same as Jobs\u2019s and that the operation was safe (the \u00addonor\u2019s remaining liver and the portion transplanted to the recipient each grow to a functional size). But Jobs immediately shot down the stunningly generous proposal.\u201cNo,\u201da bedridden Jobs angrily \u00adreplied, according to Cook\u2019s recollections in \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart Into a Visionary Leader,\u201d by the journalists Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli. \u201cI\u2019ll never let you do that.\u201d\nThat moving anecdote is one of several that will quicken the pulse of even obsessive Apple watchers. \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d enters a crowded body of work devoted to Apple and its idiosyncratic co-founder, dominated of course by Walter Isaacson\u2019s 2011 best seller, \u201cSteve Jobs.\u201d Although it drags and feels unnecessary for large stretches, this new addition to the Apple pantheon redeems itself with access to key players and their previously untold accounts, thereby presenting a layered portrait of the mercurial Jobs, whose style and personality, the book argues, were constantly evolving, right up to his early death.\nSchlender was a longtime writer for Fortune and, before that, The Wall Street Journal. He ably co-writes the book with Tetzeli, the executive editor of Fast Company, but this is essentially Schlender\u2019s tale \u2014 a first-person memoir from the technology journalist who arguably got the closest to Jobs over the last 30 years of his life.\nJobs was a skillful manipulator of the media, pitting reporters against one another and doling out favors to those who hewed closest to the party line, and Schlender was an ace at this game. He interacted with Jobs over 150 times by his own count, visited the Jobs house with his young daughters to watch a rough cut of Pixar\u2019s \u201cToy Story\u201d before its release, and even persuaded Jobs and Bill Gates to sit together for a joint interview for Fortune in 1991. He was such a reliable Jobs ally that Gil Amelio, Jobs\u2019s erstwhile adversary and predecessor as Apple chief executive in the \u201990s, called Schlender a \u201cliterary ax murderer\u201d in his own memoir.\nSo it isn\u2019t surprising that the book strives to paint a more sympathetic \u00adpicture of the difficult, brilliant Jobs. The authors assert that \u201cstagnant stereotypes\u201d from Jobs\u2019s early years as an entrepreneurialenfant terriblehave ossified in the public mind and don\u2019t fairly capture how Jobs grew as a manager, or explain why he evoked such selfless \u00adloyalty in top lieutenants like Cook. \u201cSteve developed a reputation as an egomaniac who wasn\u2019t willing to learn from others,\u201d they write. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the man, even during his youngest, brashest and most overbearing years.\u201d The authors tiptoe around challenging Isaacson\u2019s book directly, but Cook himself doesn\u2019t pull any punches. \u201cIt was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written, and focused on small parts of his personality,\u201d Cook, who is now the Apple C.E.O., tells the authors, in an unfair critique.\nThe new book doesn\u2019t really succeed in improving Jobs\u2019s posthumous reputation. Isaacson showed Jobs as an incorrigible perfectionist who often demonstrated \u00adcruel disregard for others. Freshly unearthed anecdotes, like a tantrum Jobs threw in 1979 at a meeting of Silicon Valley bigwigs for a foundation to eliminate blindness in India, don\u2019t do much to soften the picture. In fact, many of the early chapters of \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d cover events that have already been well chronicled. There is Jobs\u2019s listless Reed College period, his early disregard for his oldest daughter, Lisa, and his self-\u00adinflicted ouster at Apple and failed comeback at NeXT. A movie on this period in his life, starring Michael Fassbender and based on \u00adIsaacson\u2019s book, is scheduled to be \u00adreleased in October. Readers may feel compelled to watch these events play out on the big screen rather than on the printed page.\nBut anyone who prematurely dismisses \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d as a retread will miss the best stuff. The later chapters of the book show how Jobs cared for his colleagues and took an interest in their lives. For example, worried by Tim Cook\u2019s lack of a personal life, Jobs once concocted a bogus reason to call Cook\u2019s mother in Alabama so he could learn more about his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And during his final days, Jobs invited Cook over to watch the underdog high school football film \u201cRemember the Titans,\u201d a movie choice Cook found inexplicable at the time, but which now seems appropriate, considering Apple\u2019s own cinematic comeback.\nNew material also emerges from interviews with the Pixar vets Ed Catmull and John Lasseter, and the Disney C.E.O. Bob Iger, whose perspectives weren\u2019t as prominent in Isaacson\u2019s account. Back in 2006, colleagues cautioned Iger against letting Jobs on the Disney board, via an acquisition of Pixar, warning that Jobs would interfere with management of the company. Iger trusted his gut and plowed ahead anyway. Then an hour before Jobs and Iger announced the Pixar purchase, Jobs asked Iger to take a walk. As they sat on a bench on Pixar\u2019s campus in Emeryville, Calif., Jobs put his arm around Iger and told him that his cancer was back. No one else knew at the time. \u201cI\u2019m telling you because I\u2019m giving you a chance to back out of the deal,\u201d Jobs said. Iger didn\u2019t, of course, and the account here of their growing friendship and productive alliance feels moving and fresh.\nBut Jobs could turn on friends and colleagues if they no longer served his needs. \u201cI agree he\u2019s really smart. But he\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t want to work,\u201d Jobs is said to have told Cook about a former Apple vice president. After learning that the man had taken up golf \u2014 not exactly a felony \u2014 Jobs carped, \u201cGolf?! Who has time for golf?\u201d\nThat was the frustrating complexity of Jobs: He was a control freak who seemed to care deeply for the people around him, except when, suddenly, he didn\u2019t. Schlender relays his own experience with Jobs\u2019s erratic affections. The author became seriously ill in 2005, after catching meningitis on vacation in Nicaragua. His employer, Time Inc., airlifted him from Central America to the intensive care unit of Stanford Hospital, where he remained for three weeks. As a result of his ailment, he lost most of his hearing. Jobs visited him in the hospital several times, even while Schlender was hallucinatory, and instructed the hospital staff to give him V.I.P. treatment.\nIt was a sign of their unusual relationship and the endearing humanity that Jobs could express toward the people around him. But after Schlender spent several years recovering from his ordeal and began stepping away from Fortune magazine, Jobs refused to work with him on any more articles. Schlender implies he was mystified and hurt by this; maybe he simply wasn\u2019t useful anymore to Apple\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cNo one I have spoken to has a unified theory for the staying power of Steve\u2019s childish behavior, not even Laurene,\u201d the authors write at one point, referring to Jobs\u2019s widow, basically throwing up their hands in the face of his still unresolved contradictions. Perhaps Steve was just being Steve."

        "title": "Review: \u2018Becoming Steve Jobs\u2019 Focuses on Another Apple Era",
        "fulltext": "The main point of the new business-oriented biography \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli is that Steve Jobs has been misrepresented. Blame Walter Isaacson\u2019s\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d (2011), as the authors do, for the public perception that Mr. Jobs never outgrew the managerial style of the scheming, screaming, cheating, smelly hothead he may \u2014may\u2014 have been in his early years. Instead, Mr. Schlender and Mr. Tetzeli say in their new book, Mr. Jobs developed a wise, mature, deliberate executive style for which he is seldom given credit, one that helped lead Apple to glorious heights.\nOrdinarily, that revelation wouldn\u2019t make waves. But a battle has broken out between these two biographies. Mr. Isaacson\u2019s book was the officially authorized version. But Apple\u2019s top brass has noisily endorsed \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d as a corrective, and Apple history can\u2019t get much more official than that. If the Isaacson book ruffled Apple feathers, its executives had better brace themselves for Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\u201d which just had its premiere at the South by Southwest festival. It\u2019s one thing to read about someone\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s quite another to watch the extensive archival footage of the unguarded Mr. Jobs that shapes Mr. Gibney\u2019s portrait.\nWriting about and interviewing a powerful person always requires making some kind of deal with the Devil. Mr. Isaacson says his subject did not meddle, but his book clearly is only as personal as Mr. Jobs would allow it to be. In any case, his book wisely split its attention between the man and his creations, celebrating the reasons his legacy would matter. Published just three weeks after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death, the book had the emotional heft of an epitaph and the user-friendly feel of an Apple product.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Schlender (who has worked for Fortune and The Wall Street Journal) and Mr. Tetzeli (a former editor of Fortune, now executive editor of Fast Company) also do work that depends on access to business titans. Although he wrote this book with Mr. Tetzeli, Mr. Schlender makes himself a character in the book (and often speaks to or about Mr. Jobs using \u201cI\u201d). Mr. Schlender, who began covering Mr. Jobs in 1986, makes frequent reference to their close friendship, which was surely very close indeed; he attended Mr. Jobs\u2019s funeral service. But reporter-titan relationships, no matter how warm, have an aspect of expediency. \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d would have been better had it been more alert to the power games Mr. Schlender had to play. But it sounds more proud than insightful about them.\n\u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d pays major attention to a time period that the authors feel has been overlooked: the interregnum between Mr. Jobs\u2019s two stints as head of Apple. That was the time, they think, when his impulsive, impractical younger self began giving way to a much more pragmatic visionary, better equipped to lead. Since that is so much less newsworthy than the more tabloidy aspects of his story, they present it with an air of discovery. And they have many anecdotes to flesh out that time. What they don\u2019t have is a deep and consistent insight into what, beyond aging, was at the heart of this growth. This book also has no clear idea of what kind of readership it\u2019s after. So it rehashes some of the most familiar parts of Silicon Valley lore; if you know why the January 1975 cover of Popular Electronics is, in some circles, sexier than the best Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue ever \u2014 because it depicts the world-changing Altair 8800 computer kit \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be told about it again. If you don\u2019t know why it\u2019s important, then there\u2019s a lot you need to be told, and it\u2019s basic computer history you won\u2019t find here.\nAlong the same lines, the book rehashes familiar parts of the Jobs mythology but leaves out some of the most colorful ones, from his fateful wooing of John Sculley to the fact that the author Mona Simpson is his sister. \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d emphasizes competition, sales and computer specs at the expense of anything beyond business. The result is a book too spotty to be a good introduction to Jobs lore.\nThe authors are at their best when analyzing the products Mr. Jobs created, especially during the wilderness years spent away from Apple. They write of how by the time he was forced out, he had lost his sense of practicality as well as some of his best early collaborators, whom he did a fine job of alienating. Instead, he created the company NeXT with a new extravagance and no real grasp of the business machines it was supposed to be building. As \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d makes clear, he had a great feel for devices he himself might use, but a desktop machine that needed to connect to other desktop machines? More money was spent on the design of a good-looking factory than on the computers it would build. And the factory never had cause to manufacture many.\n\u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d which is by no means all puffery, calls this \u201cthe full, unfortunate blooming of Steve Jobs\u2019s worst tendencies at Apple.\u201d And it takes him to task for being \u201ctoo self-centered to see how much of Apple\u2019s success had depended upon a combination of perfect timing and the work of others.\u201d\nThis book\u2019s defenders at Apple say they never would have been able to work with or love or even tolerate the olfactory presence of anyone resembling the Jobs whom Mr. Isaacson initially depicts. (He reaches a fulfilling adulthood in Mr. Isaacson\u2019s book, too.) And that they witnessed a remarkable transformation, especially after Mr. Jobs, learning he had pancreatic cancer, began fighting for his survival and spoke to graduating Stanford students so eloquently about how that battle had changed him."

        "title": "A Conversation With the Authors of \u2018Becoming Steve Jobs\u2019",
        "fulltext": "Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has been the subject of myriad books. But the latest one, \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d released on Tuesday, is the only one with Apple\u2019s stamp of approval.\nIn tweets, Apple haspublicly endorsed the bookas the most\n                                        comprehensive biography of Mr. Jobs to date. Apple executives also haven\u2019t been shy about slamming a previous biography, \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d by Walter Isaacson, which Mr. Jobs directly participated\n                                        in.\nThe new book was written by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, both longtime tech journalists. The biography is viewed through the lens of Mr. Schlender\u2019s personal experience interviewing Mr. Jobs over the last\n                                        two decades. The following is an edited transcript of an interview with both authors.\nWhen did you decide to write about Steve Jobs, and were you hesitant to take on a subject that had already been covered so extensively by Walter Isaacson and others?\nRICK: Brent and I worked on a Fast Company cover story about Jobs in early 2012. Halfway through reporting and editing the piece, I realized that if we worked together we could deliver a pretty nuanced book. I thought\n                                        we could create a picture of Steve that was different from anything that was out there.\nWhy did you feel that there was room for another book about him, and how did you aim to distinguish your account from previous ones?\nRICK: Basically, there was nothing out there that documented how he had changed. I felt that the early stereotype of him as half-genius, half-jerk from birth had stuck around \u2014 it was set during his early years\n                                        at Apple, and it had lasting power mainly because after 1987 he restricted press coverage, because he had sharp elbows.\nBRENT: I felt that Steve was one of the most complex people I had ever known, and that after having known him for more than 20 years, I could see a trajectory of personal change that I didn\u2019t think had been fully\n                                        described or properly appreciated. I think the continuing apparent appetite for books and film projects about his life shows that there remains a deep fascination for Steve and what made him tick.\nYou gained unprecedented access to Apple executives from a company that is typically tight-lipped. How did you do manage to do that, and were you surprised that Apple was willing to cooperate?\nRICK: We sold the book to Crown in 2012 without knowing whether or not Apple would give us interviews with any of its current employees. The company had not worked with us for the original Fast Company piece. After\n                                        the F.C. piece came out, we asked whether they\u2019d work with us on a book and they said absolutely not. We\u2019d ask again, from time to time, as we reported, but it wasn\u2019t until a year and a half\n                                        later that they agreed to participate. I think enough time had passed after Steve\u2019s death for them to consider talking for a new book.\nThe book is largely a recounting of Brent\u2019s memories of Steve over the past two and a half decades. What was the most powerful, memorable moment you shared with Steve, and what did it mean to you?\nBRENT: There was no single most memorable moment in the sense of being an \u201caha\u201d moment. It was a special experience to take my two daughters over to his house to watch an early cut of \u201cToy Story,\u201d\n                                        and it was memorable that he came to visit me twice while I was in the intensive care unit at Stanford Medical Center in 2005. But it was really the cumulative effect of seeing him with some regularity, and not\n                                        always for the purposes of reporting a story, that made it easier for me to look at him as an endlessly fascinating person. You never knew what he might say.\nThe book makes a distinction between \u201cSteve 1.0\u2033 (before Mr. Jobs started a computer company called NeXT) and \u201cSteve 2.0\u2033 (post-NeXT). And your sources say the narrative of Steve 1.0 prevailed\n                                        over 2.0. How did that happen, when Steve became much more high-profile in his later years, especially after the success of the iPhone?\nBRENT: Steve made himself more widely available for interviews during those early years than he did, even during the \u201cwilderness\u201d years. He always told me that the only reason he would talk to reporters\n                                        and writers was to promote a particular product or technology strategy. He\u2019d gotten over the egotistical thrill of seeing his face on the cover of a magazine by then, and wanted to use his celebrity solely\n                                        to help promote his business. So when he had something cool to show off, he would open up a little, but always in a very controlled way.\nThe book goes into great detail about Steve\u2019s negotiations with the record labels for iTunes and the negotiations with AT&T for the iPhone\u2019s terms. These days, the iBookstore is in bad shape, among\n                                        other things. What do you make of this? Is this a sign that Apple\u2019s negotiating power has weakened without Steve?\nBRENT: I\u2019d say it is a situational difference. Time does not stand still, nor does the marketplace. Steve helped actually create a legitimate marketplace for paid-for digital downloads of music, and for what\n                                        we now call smartphones and tablets. Streaming music is an established marketplace already, which Apple was slow to embrace, and so it is much more difficult to break into it. Same for e-books.\nThe book mentions a quote where Steve says Apple will never make a television because he doesn\u2019t like television. Do you really believe that?\nBRENT: I\u2019m sure it was true at the time, but you learned over time that Steve was always willing to change his mind if circumstances changed or if a new technology opened some new doors.\nHave you been surprised in recent days by the outpouring of support for your book from Apple executives like Tim Cook and Eddy Cue? [Cue tweeted his approval of the book last week.]\nRICK: As far as we know, Tim Cook hasn\u2019t publicly endorsed the book. Eddy Cue\u2019s tweet was completely unexpected and we were thrilled about that. Even in its more open Tim Cook iteration, Apple is a company\n                                        that tends to play things pretty close to the chest.\nToward the end of the book, you note that Steve took on the role of the company\u2019s sole spokesperson, perhaps to a fault. Tim, by contrast, has significantly opened up the company\u2019s communications to the\n                                        world. Do you think that\u2019s better for Apple? Does that make Tim a better C.E.O. for Apple now than Steve would have been if he\u2019d survived?\nBRENT: Again, it all depends on the circumstances. Apple doesn\u2019t have another Steve to act as its public pitchman. Nobody does. He was a singular talent in that regard. Our book doesn\u2019t even attempt to\n                                        speculate about Apple beyond Steve\u2019s passing. Our sole purpose was to try to explain why he was so much more effective by the end of his life than he was when he was a young entrepreneur."

        "fulltext": "Applehas held talks with a number of leading television groups to offer an Internet-based TV service for its iPhone, iPad and Apple TV set-top box, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.\nThe service, which could be announced later this year, would offer a bundle of channels that is smaller and cheaper than the bloated catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription, said these people, who discussed the incomplete plans on the condition of anonymity.\nThe plan would potentially offer networks owned by the television groups Disney, Fox, CBS and Discovery, the people said Tuesday. That could include the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and Fox, along with a lineup of other cable networks, such as ESPN and Discovery Channel.\nThe total number of networks to be offered is yet to be determined. Apple is not including all of the networks owned by each of the TV groups, signaling yet another fraying of the traditional cable bundle. No deal has been reached yet, the people said.\nPricing details remain unclear. One person pegged the rate for a monthly subscription at $20 to $25, while another said that it would be in the $30 range. The final price point will probably depend on which networks are offered and negotiations with television groups, the people said.\nNews of Apple\u2019s plans for a web-TV service follows an announcement last week that it had formed an exclusive partnership with HBO to offer the premium cable network\u2019s new digital TV service, called HBO Now.\nA flood of media, telecom and tech companies are introducing digital TV services this year, trying to appeal to a generation of viewers willing to pay for Internet access but not traditional TV cable subscriptions.\nDish Network, the satellite provider, recently started a web-based service called Sling TV that includes ESPN and other popular cable networks for $20 a month. On Tuesday, the company announced a series of updates, including availability of the service on the Xbox One console and the addition of A&E Network channels by the end of March. Sling TV also offers extra packages, priced at $5 a month, for a mini-bundle of lifestyle or news networks, for instance.\nCBS and Sony also are starting Internet-only subscription plans.\nApple will heavily market its new streaming service, which the company has pitched to networks as \u201cbetter than the best-of-class cable products,\u201d one person said. Potential features would include on-demand functionality and the ability to stream live and on-demand television to an array of devices, another person said.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported news of the Apple TV serviceon Monday, after aninitial report in Recodelast month.\nApple declined to comment on the potential new service.\nOne major entertainment company not involved in the latest round of discussions isComcastand its NBCUniversal entertainment group, the people said. If Apple and Comcast do not come to terms on a deal, the new service will not include the broadcaster NBC or the cable networks it owns, such as Bravo and Syfy.\nComcast could be forced to come to a deal with Apple because of the conditions that it agreed to with regulators when it acquired NBCUniversal in 2011. Under those agreements, an online video provider like Apple could demand that NBCUniversal make its programming available if Apple has signed deals with other television groups.\nApple has been rumored to be planning an online TV service for more than five years. But the company\u2019s approach so far has been to work with distributors like Time Warner Cable and Walt Disney Company onoffering appswith access to their content for the Apple TV set-top box.\nOffering a slimmer bundle of television channels over an Internet connection would help Apple distinguish its service from a traditional cable subscription. However, it would not be nearly as disruptive as the deals that Apple cut with record labels for the iTunes Store, when it negotiated to sell songs one track at a time, as opposed to forcing consumers to buy complete albums."

To do so, start in Mac\u2019s Applications folder, which you can easily get to from the Go menu in the desktop Finder. Once in the Applications folder, open the Utilities folder and then open the Disk Utility program.\nIn Disk Utility, go in the File menu to New, and then select \u201cDisk Image from Folder.\u201d Next, select the folder you want to password-protect and click the Image button. In the next box, choose a format for your folder, like Compressed or Read/Write (if you want to edit the contents). Select an encryption level, either the recommended 128-bit AES Encryption or 256-bit AES Encryption (which is more secure but takes longer to encrypt). Click the Save button.\nBecause you have opted to encrypt the folder\u2019s contents, you will next be asked to provide a password. Enter and verify your password, and make sure to uncheck the box next to \u201cRemember password in my keychain.\u201d When you click the O.K. button, OS X creates an encrypted image of the folder. When you see the icon with the .dmg file extension, you can delete the original folder. (Making a backup to a secure external drive and safely tucking it away can bring peace of mind if you are nervous about deleting that original folder.)\nTo open the protected folder, double-click the disk-image icon and supply the password.\nApple has its official instructions for creating encrypted disk images atsupport.apple.com/en-us/HT201599, and information about theFileVault 2utility for encrypting your entire drive is atsupport.apple.com/en-us/HT4790.\nTIP OF THE WEEKWhile it is supposed to provide easy access to the search function and system settings, theCharms barin Windows 8.1 can often pop open unexpectedly when you inadvertently brush the mouse cursor along the upper-right side of the screen.

        "title": "The Hidden Talent of Steve Jobs",
        "fulltext": "The relationship between journalists and Steve Jobs could often be fraught, but there were always a handful of reporters he liked and trusted. They included John Markoff of The New York Times; Steven Levy, formerly of Wired magazine (he\u2019s now at Medium); Walt Mossberg, the longtime technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal (he\u2019s now at Re/code); and Brent Schlender of Fortune. They had all been on the technology beat seemingly forever, and they had known Jobs for decades.\nAs Schlender writes in \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201dthe forthcoming bookhe co-authored with Rick Tetzeli, he first met Jobs in April 1986, eight months after the Apple co-founder had beenousted by John Sculley, then Apple\u2019s chief executive. Jobs, who had started a new company called NeXT, was 31. Schlender, who had just joined The Wall Street Journal\u2019s San Francisco bureau, was 32.\nDuring the next quartercentury, Schlender conducted \u201cmore than 150 interviews and informal conversations\u201d with Jobs. He wrote cover stories for Fortune about Apple, some of which Jobs liked, andsome of which he hated. On occasion, he visited Jobs at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. What began as a subject-journalist relationship evolved into something deeper \u2014 \u201ca long, complicated and mostly rewarding relationship,\u201d as Schlender characterizes it in the book.\nSo it is not a huge surprise that Schlender \u2014 and his friend Tetzeli, a former Fortune deputy managing editor \u2014 would see Jobs in a different light than most. (Disclosure: I worked with Schlender and Tetzeli during my decade at Fortune.) After Jobs died, they write, the coverage reflected \u201cstagnant stereotypes.\u201d On the one hand, \u201cSteve was a genius with a flair for design,\u201d whose powers of persuasion were such that he could convince people that the sun rose in the west and set in the east. On the other hand, he was also \u201ca pompous jerk,\u201d who humiliated employees and \u201cdisregarded everyone else in his single-minded pursuit of perfection.\u201d\nIt is Schlender\u2019s and Tetzeli\u2019s contention that Jobs was a far more complex and interesting man than the half-genius/half-jerk stereotype, and a good part of their book is an attempt to craft a more rounded portrait. What makes their book important is that they also contend \u2014 persuasively, I believe \u2014 that, the stereotype notwithstanding, he was not the same man in his prime that he had been at the beginning of his career. The callow, impetuous, arrogant youth who co-founded Apple was very different from the mature and thoughtful man who returned to his struggling creation and turned it into a company that made breathtaking products while becoming the dominant technology company of our time. Had he not changed, they write, he would not have succeeded.\nFor Schlender and Tetzeli, the crucial period was the most overlooked part of Jobs\u2019s career: The years from 1985 to 1997, when he was in exile from Apple and running NeXT. As a business, NeXT was a failure. Begun as a company that was going to bring affordable yet superior computers to the higher education market, it eventually had to abandon the hardware side of the business and become a pure software company. The point that is normally made about NeXT is that when Jobs returned to Apple, he brought with him the NeXTSTEP operating system,which became the foundationfor a new generation of Macs and was a critical component of the company\u2019s revival.\nEvery bit as important, though, was that Jobs brought his core group of executives with him to Apple, and they stayed with him for years. At the same time he was running NeXT, Jobs also owned Pixar, the animation studio he bought from George Lucas. It took years before Pixar came out with its first full-length movie, \u201cToy Story.\u201d During that time, he saw how Ed Catmull, Pixar\u2019s president,managed the company\u2019s creative talent. Catmull taught Jobs how to manage employees.\nWhen Jobs returned to Apple, he was more patient \u2014 with people and with products. His charisma still drew people to him, but he no longer drove them away with his abrasive behavior and impossible demands. He had also learned that his ideas weren\u2019t always the right ones, and he needed to listen to others.\nPerhaps the most important example of this was the App Store. Jobs had initially opposed allowing outside developers to build apps for the iPhone, but he did a quick about-face once he realized he was wrong. The App Store has been hugely important in making the iPhone perhaps the most profitable consumer electronic device ever.\nJobs has long been hailed as one of the great creative minds of modern business. His genius for creating products and his marketing flair have also been rightly hailed. All of that comes through in \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d but so does something else: He was a great manager. You can\u2019t build a great company if you aren\u2019t one."

        "title": "HBO\u2019s Streaming Service Will Start in April, Initially on Apple Devices Only",
        "fulltext": "HBO has linked with Apple for the start of its much-anticipated Internet streaming service, uniting two premium brands from the media and technology worlds in a quest to reinvent the way people watch television.\nCalled \u201cHBO Now,\u201d the service does not require a traditional TV subscription and will be available exclusively on Apple devices when it makes its debut in early April, the companies announced on Monday during an Apple product event at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco.\nTimed to coincide with the start of the new season of its most-watched series, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the service will cost $14.99 a month and offer all of HBO\u2019s original programming, past and present, as well as its movie offerings. People who subscribe to the service in April through Apple will receive the first month free.\nThe exclusivity with Apple lasts for three months. HBO also is in talks with other distributors, including traditional TV providers and digital partners.\n\u201cThis is a transformative moment for HBO,\u201d Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive, said from the stage of the Apple event.\nAnticipation for HBO\u2019s new digital streaming service has been growing since October, when the company announced plans to start an Internet offering. The new service steps up its rivalry with digital-first streaming outlets like Netflix and Amazon. It also puts more pressure on the established television business, which takes in $170 billion a year in revenue.\n\u201cThis is a wake-up call to the industry,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG Research. \u201cHBO is taking its future into its own hands.\u201d\nThe new service is part of a growing wave of offerings this year from media, telecom and technology companies. Dish Network, the satellite provider, recently unveiled a new web-based service that includes ESPN and several other popular networks for $20 a month. CBS and Sony also are starting Internet-only subscription plans.\nThe companies are fighting to stay relevant to a generation of so-called cord-cutters or cord-nevers, who pay for Internet access but not traditional TV subscriptions. As its target audience for HBO Now, the network has pointed to the 10 million homes in the United States with web service but no traditional cable or satellite television subscriptions \u2014 half of which are estimated to subscribe to a streaming service.\n\u201cThat is a large and growing opportunity that can no longer be ignored,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.\nThe partnership with Apple came together at this time last year after HBO surveyed the market and decided that it was time to get into the streaming business. Mr. Plepler said that he called Eddy Cue, the senior Apple executive in charge of brokering deals with media companies, and pitched the idea. Mr. Cue responded by saying that the timing was impeccable.\n\u201cWe love HBO,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said as he introduced Mr. Plepler at Monday\u2019s event. \u201cOver the years they have created groundbreaking shows that have really become a part of our culture and helped shape our culture.\u201d\nBoth companies are hoping that they will benefit by being in the halo of the other. Apple will market the HBO service as part of its offerings, including its Apple TV product. The company said Monday it had sold 25 million Apple TV devices and that was cutting the price to $69 from $99.\nHBO\u2019s three-month exclusive with Apple applies only to other digital outlets \u2014 not the traditional cable, satellite and telecom companies that currently sell HBO as part of television bundles. HBO said that it was open to offering a stand-alone streaming service with those companies and that while some have been receptive, others have resisted.\n\u201cDeals with our distributors are never easy, but to quote from \u2018Godfather II,\u2019 \u2018This is the business we\u2019ve chosen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cOur position to our partners is: Work with us. We want to help you grow your businesses.\u201d\nSome analysts said that while the $14.99 monthly price represented an attempt by HBO to carefully balance relationships with its current distributors, it also could be a tough sell when compared with the offerings at Netflix, which start at $7.99 a month. \u201cYou had to get to a price point that your distributors couldn\u2019t complain about,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with Moffett Nathanson Research.\nHBO declined to discuss details of the business relationship with Apple. Apple typically takes a 30 percent cut of revenue generated through apps, and it is unclear how that compares with its split with its traditional distributors.\nThe initiative is part of a broader growth strategy at Time Warner, which took on more importance internally after the company rejected an $80 billion takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox last summer. That strategy includes exploiting digital business opportunities, increasing original programming, expanding international business and cutting costs across its television and film properties, which also include Turner cable networks and Warner Bros. film studios.\nWith the new streaming service, Time Warner and HBO will need to tread carefully so as not to cannibalize their core businesses. Both HBO and other television networks in Time Warner\u2019s portfolio depend on their relationships with cable and satellite companies for billions of dollars in revenue.\nHBO and its sibling network Cinemax added 2.8 million subscribers in 2014, the most in more than 30 years. The two networks counted about 138 million worldwide subscribers, with about 46 million paid subscribers in the United States. Growth in subscription revenue and licensing fees for select original programming helped increase revenue 10 percent, to $5.4 billion, at HBO last year.\nIn comparison, Netflix counted 59 million total paid members, 40 million in the United States.\n\u201cThis is not about short-term 2015 revenues,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cIt is about a strategic move for our future and about building flexibility and optionality into our distribution. This is the right move at the right time with the right partner.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple, the highest-valued company in the world, will be added to the Dow Jones industrial average next month in yet another sign of how popular the computer giant has become for investors.\nApple, a top investment holding for risky hedge funds as well as retirees, will replace the telecommunications companyAT&T, a technology standard-bearer in its day, on March 19,S&P Dow Jones Indicessaidin an announcement on Friday.\nThe step, which had been widely expected, is a reminder of the soaring valuations among consumer-driven technology and social media companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter.\nBut no company approaches Apple in terms of raw value. Its market capitalization of $744 billion is about equal to the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia, and analysts have predicted that the company could soon become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s cash pile of $178 billion is larger than the stock market valuations of companies like IBM and Amazon.\n\u201cThe D.J.I.A. is price-weighted, so extremely high stock prices tend to distort the index while very low stock prices have little impact,\u201d David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement. \u201cAmong the current D.J.I.A. constituents, AT&T has one of the lowest prices. Moreover, the D.J.I.A. is overweighted in telecommunications.\u201d\nFurthermore, he added, Apple\u2019s stock split last year \u201cbrought the stock price down closer to the median price\u201d in the Dow.\nTo the extent that investors needed another excuse to snap up more Apple shares, the change will give them one.\nThe stock was up 2 percent in early trading on Friday at $128, not far from their record high.\nMany portfolio managers and investors use the Dow to measure their performance, and with Apple added to the index, they will be compelled to buy the stock or add to existing positions.\nAnd with more and more funds flowing from active managers to index-tracking investments such asexchange-traded funds, the buying pressure on Apple is likely to continue for some time.\nApple is already a major component of the Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the other major stock indexes that investors track closely."
