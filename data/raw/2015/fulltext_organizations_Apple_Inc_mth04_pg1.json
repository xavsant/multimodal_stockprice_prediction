        "fulltext": "With some 13,000 graduate schools of business across the globe, the M.B.A. degree has clearly become a commodity.\nEven among elite schools, courses and case studies are pretty much water from the same well (i.e., finance, operations, marketing, accounting). So how do you choose? By using the rankings? Which ones? The Economist\u2019s? Businessweek\u2019s? The Financial Times\u2019s? And if you do, how do you tell the difference between a school ranked No. 6 and a school ranked No. 7?\nDon\u2019t ask us. Don\u2019t ask the schools, either. Their slick brochures try to be everything to everybody, and in the process they obscure rather than illuminate.\nConventional wisdom will tell you that Harvard is for Fortune 500 jobs, Wharton for Wall Street, Kellogg for marketing and Insead for multinational entities. There\u2019s truth to some of it, but times change, and so do employers\u2019 recruiting preferences. The smartest move might be to choose your business school by focusing on a very specific outcome and, assuming a good fit personally, going to the one with an impressive record of helping students achieve the same. Period.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Ross School of Business (University of Michigan)\nThis might come as a surprise: Amazon regularly hires more M.B.A.s from top-10 business schools than big Wall Street firms. And its demand is surging: In 2014, Amazon hired 40 percent more M.B.A.s than it did in 2013, a large chunk of them from Ross. The e-commerce giant hired 27 M.B.A.s from Michigan last year, displacing Ross\u2019s historical No. 1 recruiter, Deloitte Consulting, and 37 the previous two years.\nThe most senior Ross graduate at Amazon is Peter Faricy, class of 1995 and vice president of Amazon Marketplace. Mr. Faricy says that while Ross graduates have traits common to most M.B.A.s \u2014 analytic ability and problem-solving skills \u2014 some curriculum-related offerings are particularly well suited to Amazon. One course takes students into the field to solve a problem for a sponsoring company. Last year, Amazon was home to three teams. Mr. Faricy worked on one while at Ross, using multilinear regressions to help executives at Target understand employee turnover; the experience, he said, opened his eyes to the importance of deep analytics.\nMr. Faricy also mentioned desirable soft skills \u2014 humility, listening and a hearty work ethic. Readers of \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d Brad Stone\u2019s chronicle of the rise of Jeff Bezos and Amazon, will be aware that Mr. Bezos is one of the hardest-working C.E.O.s in the country, and he surely expects the same of his M.B.A. employees.\nThe scores you need.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern)\nFor an M.B.A., landing a job at McKinsey is a bit like trying to get into a competitive business school all over again. Except the field is much stronger, made up of only those who managed to pass the first hurdle. But graduates of Kellogg perform quite well the second time around. The school\u2019s M.B.A.s are in demand at elite consulting firms, which hired 35 percent of its graduates last year, a higher percentage than at Harvard (23 percent) and Stanford (16 percent).\nThe top four recruiters at Kellogg in 2014 were McKinsey, Deloitte, Bain and the Boston Consulting Group. McKinsey alone has hired 215 Kellogg graduates over the last five years.\nElizabeth Ziegler, associate dean of M.B.A. programs at Kellogg and, more important, a former partner at McKinsey, says that consulting firms look for two specific things in M.B.A. graduates: a natural gift for building trust-based relationships and strong problem-solving skills. The school\u2019s pedagogy is based on a team-based model, which develops the first. And its curriculum stresses the second, with a particular focus on helping students answer a question McKinsey consultants grapple with every day on behalf of clients: Do you know what problem you\u2019re actually solving?\nThe school\u2019s emphasis on persona is historic. In the early 1980s, Don Jacobs, then the dean, had a pioneering idea: Kellogg would interview every single applicant, assessing qualities like presence and articulateness \u2014 interpersonal skills that just so happen to be the most desired by consultants. The commitment continues. Today, Ms. Ziegler says, no one gets admitted without a successful interview.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Fuqua School of Business (Duke)\nSilicon Valley hasn\u2019t always welcomed M.B.A.s. After all, you don\u2019t need a graduate degree to hatch a bold idea in your garage. Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s late chief, didn\u2019t finish college and was known to have disdain for \u201csuits,\u201d whether investment bankers or management consultants. But the company, once the scrappy symbol of the tech counterculture, has undergone an evolution.\nTwo of Apple\u2019s top 10 executives hail from Fuqua: the chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and the senior vice president of operations, Jeff Williams. And they are, apparently, loyal. Apple has hired 32 Fuqua graduates over the past five years, while also providing 42 internships for Duke students.\nSpeaking in 2013 on the occasion of his 25th reunion, Mr. Cook stressed to students that while they should focus first on how to collaborate, they should look to write their own rules after that, words that might describe the ethos at Apple itself.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Kelley School of Business (Indiana University)\nWhile M.B.A.s don\u2019t dream of working at giant consumer products companies the way they did a few decades ago \u2014 today, it\u2019s consulting, start-ups, tech giants or private equity \u2014 one of America\u2019s legendary corporate success stories still draws them in hordes: the 177-year-old Procter & Gamble.\nAnd P.&G. clearly has a thing for Kelley. The school is its biggest source of brand managers. Of the 172 Kelley alumni there, the most senior is Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer, who also sits on Kelley\u2019s dean\u2019s council. The M.B.A. class \u201cMarketing Performance and Productivity Analysis\u201d could just as well be called \u201cGetting You Ready to Work at P.&G.\u201d\nThe closeness stretches back to 1950, when the company formed a joint research project with Dr. Joseph Muhler at Indiana University to develop and test a new toothpaste \u2014 with fluoride. P.&G. says the connection runs deeper than marketing, a specialty of Kelley\u2019s. Monica Boutchard, P.&G.\u2019s Indiana University recruiting team leader, who has an undergraduate degree from Kelley, credits the broad-based curriculum in preparing graduates to be leaders at P.&G., not just experts in finance or, well, marketing.\nThere\u2019s that, as well as the fact that the university\u2019s Bloomington campus is a mere 125 miles from Procter & Gamble headquarters in Cincinnati. Dean Idalene Kesner says that Midwestern companies tend to be good fits for Kelley graduates, as they\u2019re looking for talented hard workers who have something sometimes lacking in their coastal counterparts: the humility to grow.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Harvard Business School\nNo, the world has not been turned upside down. The substantial resources Harvard has devoted to its entrepreneurial offerings in recent years are starting to show real results. By many accounts, Harvard has as strong a claim to being top start-up destination as Stanford does.\nAnchored by its Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, the school offers 33 graduate-level entrepreneurship courses, with the second-largest number of dedicated faculty after finance. But its push reaches well beyond the classroom. An annual New Venture Competition awards $150,000 in cash plus in-kind prizes. The school also assists graduates who are pursuing new ventures with loan reductions of $10,000 to $20,000 \u2014 last year, 21 student entrepreneurs received more than $325,000 through the program. Its biannual entrepreneurial summit gathers alumni with demonstrated early-stage traction, and an entrepreneurs-in-residence program invites accomplished founders (and funders) to hold weekly office hours to advise students.\nRob Biederman, class of 2014, says he entered Harvard Business School pretty much prepared to go back to Bain Capital, where he had been working in private equity. But a required first-year course, \u201cField III,\u201d forces students, in teams of six, to found a company. The professorial advice and an eventual $5,000 in seed money and free office space on campus gave Mr. Biederman start-up fever, and he and his classmates created HourlyNerd \u2014 a rent-an-M.B.A. business model to disrupt the low end of the consulting industry \u2014 and had it up and rolling by the end of their first year. They met Mark Cuban \u2014 the Dallas Mavericks owner, who kicked in $450,000 \u2014 when he visited a class, and connected with other investors through a classmate. (No surprise there: Harvard says that 25 percent of venture capital partners in the world are H.B.S. alumni, providing significant networking possibilities.) Recent graduates have also founded the likes of Birchbox, Rent the Runway and Gilt Groupe.\nJohn A. Byrne, author of eight books on business and founder and editor of Poets & Quants, a website that covers business education, ranked HarvardNo. 1 in his most recent assessment of start-up culture. Stanford\u2019s graduates usually raise more money, he points out, but Harvard grads consistently start more companies.\nH.B.S. is so serious about the push that it recently backtracked on a longstanding policy not to participate in Entrepreneur magazine\u2019s ranking of graduate programs. And the decision had its desired effect: Harvard came in at No. 1 last year, while Stanford, long considered the entrepreneurial hotbed among M.B.A. schools, placed fifth.\nEmployers are recruiting.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Stanford Graduate School of Business\nPrivate equity has the most lucrative jobs for M.B.A.s, but also the fewest. \u201cOnly a handful of business schools on the planet can even pretend to open doors in P.E.,\u201d says Matt Symonds, co-author of \u201cABC of Getting the M.B.A. Admissions Edge\u201d and a director at Fortuna Admissions, a business school admissions consultant.\nWhile East Coast schools would seem an obvious choice given their proximity to Wall Street, private equity isn\u2019t tied to New York in the way investment banking is, and in recent years Stanford has managed to defy conventional wisdom. Its graduates\u2019 success in landing coveted private equity jobs has proved it is more than just a recruiting ground for California\u2019s technology industry.\nIn 2014, Stanford put 12 percent of its graduates into private equity jobs, a larger percentage than Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania (8.5 percent), Booth at the University of Chicago (5.1 percent) and Columbia (2.4 percent), and a shade less than Harvard (13 percent). While more Harvard graduates entered the industry, Stanford\u2019s starting salaries last year for private equity were the highest for any job at any school \u2014 ever. Median base salary was $170,000 (compared with Harvard\u2019s $150,000), and signing bonuses plus other guaranteed compensation took the total take up to $385,000 (compared with Harvard\u2019s $255,000). One lucky 2013 M.B.A. actually received a shocking $522,000 starting package.\nMadhav V. Rajan, the acting dean, points out that Stanford\u2019s long heritage in teaching students how to scale small, fast-growing companies dovetails perfectly with its more analytical finance courses to prepare students for jobs in P.E.\nSeveral of today\u2019s most prominent private equity firms count Stanford graduates as founders or early hires, including TPG Capital (James Coulter), General Atlantic (Steven A. Denning, who is chairman of Stanford\u2019s board of trustees and a member of its advisory council) and S.P.O. Partners (John H. Scully, William J. Patterson and William E. Oberndorf). The legendary finance professor Jack McDonald has been teaching a fundamental, value-based approach to investment at Stanford for the better part of two decades.\nA recurring guest lecturer: Warren Buffett.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to HEC Paris\nHEC Paris isn\u2019t just about luxury \u2014 The Economist named it the top business school in Europe in 2014, and the fourth best globally \u2014 but the school is a no-brainer for an M.B.A. hellbent on working in the luxury goods industry. Its proximity to Paris is clearly crucial. Students have the opportunity to visit stores, workshops and headquarters of a Who\u2019s Who of luxury icons, including the behemoth Kering (Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Brioni, Gucci, Puma), Cartier, Chanel and Herm\u00e8s. Named for Kering itself, the five-year-old luxury program is restricted to just 50 students annually, and those 50 consistently find jobs with some of the biggest brands in Paris and elsewhere.\nHEC graduates include the chief executives of Kering, Balenciaga and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. Vincent Bastien, a graduate and C.E.O. of Louis Vuitton from 1988 to 1995, is a professor in the program as well as co-author of the industry bible, \u201cThe Luxury Strategy: Break the Rules of Marketing to Build Luxury Brands.\u201d\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Yale School of Management\nEdward A. Snyder is reinventing Yale\u2019s business school. Soon after his arrival as dean in 2011, the school created the Global Network for Advanced Management. The network has since assembled an impressive membership of 27 schools from five continents, including well-known names (Insead, London School of Economics) as well as lesser-known ones in China (Fudan University School of Management), the Philippines (Asian Institute of Management), Nigeria (Lagos Business School) and Turkey (Koc University School of Business).\nThe consortium has produced joint faculty research and case studies, and created online courses available only to students at network schools. Students also have the opportunity to pursue study at another network school \u2014 630 did so this March.\nThose seeking a truly global education always have Insead or the London School of Economics to choose from, but as stand-alone business schools they don\u2019t offer the resources and credential of an Ivy League institution. \u201cThe concept of the network was waiting to happen,\u201d Dr. Snyder says, \u201cand Yale is a great convener.\u201d\nSince its establishment in 1976, the Yale School of Management has insisted that business, government and nonprofit leaders need to better understand one another, giving the school a distinct public/private flavor. Dr. Snyder makes clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not abandoning the school\u2019s longstanding mission. Environmental sustainability, for example, is not going to get solved by the government, the market or the nonprofit sector alone. We\u2019re continuing within the frame, but with a more modern \u2014 and more global \u2014 view.\u201d\nA survey of over 12,000 business school alumni on job success and salary.\nIF YOU WANT...\nGo to Presidio Graduate School\nThe youngest school on this list, Presidio, has been around only 12 years, created by a lawyer and a former advertising executive who believed that established schools weren\u2019t producing the kind of socially minded graduates the country needs.\nPresidio is doing well toward that end. It has placed sustainability directors at companies from Salesforce.com to Facebook, and its graduates have founded sustainability-focused companies like Muir Data Systems (data management for the wind turbine industry) and Mission Motors (electric vehicle systems).\nThey\u2019re playing in the big leagues as well. Katie Schmitz Eulitt, who holds an executive education certificate in sustainable management from the school, is director of market research for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a large-scale effort to move the field of accounting toward the use of sustainability metrics.\nThe nonprofit organization Net Impact publishes an annual guide to business school programs, and last year Presidio placed No. 1 in social impact and No. 2 in environmental sustainability, after the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nAt 34, the school\u2019s average student is nearly a decade older than the typical M.B.A. (the average GMAT test-taker is 26). Presidio is also one of just a handful of business schools where women (60 percent) outnumber men. Located in Presidio National Park in San Francisco, it has a campus-lite approach: Most courses are online, with one in-person weekend of classes a month. That helps keep costs down. A two-year degree is $62,400, about half the typical tuition. But those savings come with a price: Sustainability-focused M.B.A.s give up big-time starting salaries. Presidio\u2019s average is in the mid-$80,000s.\nWilliam Shutkin, president of Presidio, says that\u2019s not a concern for its graduates. \u201cThe decision to choose Presidio is a moral one, because our graduates know they\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut someday in the not-too-distant future, chief sustainability officers will be compensated as well or better than their counterparts. The arc of history is bending toward us.\u201d"

        "title": "IBM Creates Watson Health to Analyze Medical Data",
        "fulltext": "IBM is taking its Watson artificial-intelligence technology into health care in a big way with industry partners, a pair of acquisitions and an ambitious agenda.\nThe initial three industry partners are Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. On Monday afternoon, after the close of stock trading, IBM also announced it would buy two start-ups: Explorys, a spin-off from the\n                                        Cleveland Clinic whose data on 50 million patients is used to spot patterns in diseases, treatments and outcomes; and Phytel, a Dallas maker of software to manage patient care and reduce readmission rates to hospitals.\nThe IBM plan, put simply, is that its Watson technology will be a cloud-based service that taps vast stores of health data and delivers tailored insights to hospitals, physicians, insurers, researchers and potentially\n                                        even individual patients.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to enable personalized health care on a huge scale,\u201d said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM\u2019s research labs and new initiatives.\nTo date, IBM has done some individual projects using Watson technology with leading medical centers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in\n                                        Houston and the Cleveland Clinic. But the creation of the Watson Health unit, Mr. Kelly said, is an effort to apply the technology to the mainstream of health care.\nAnd while IBM has been commercializing Watson technology with tools formining Twitter, weather and Internet of Things data,\n                                        Mr. Kelly said Watson Health was the first move into a specific industry.\nThe Watson Health announcement is also the latest in flurry of initiatives IBM has announced this year that include new corporate partnerships as well as moves in cloud computing, data analytics and Watson. They are\n                                        evidence that IBM is intent on investing for future growth, and showing it is doing so, in a year when its financial performance is likely to lag.\nIBM has reported disappointing earnings recently, and Virginia M. Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, has told industry analysts and investors that2015 would be a transition yearin which new growth businesses like Watson did not yet overcome the profit erosion in some of its traditional hardware and software products.\nIBM\u2019s broad vision of combining and analyzing health data from varied sources to improve care has been around for decades. But the company and its partners say that technology, economics and policy changes are\n                                        coming together to improve the odds of making the IBM venture a workable reality. They point to improvements in artificial intelligence, low-cost cloud computing and health policy that will reward keeping patients\n                                        healthy instead of the fee-for-service model in which more treatments and procedures mean more revenue.\n\u201cForces in health care are aligning as never before,\u201d said Sandra E. Peterson, a group worldwide chairman at Johnson & Johnson in charge of information technology and new wellness programs. \u201cIt\n                                        could be a unique moment and something like this could have real legs.\u201d\nA focus of the Johnson & Johnson partnership with IBM will be improving patient care before and after knee and hip replacements. The company will apply Watson technology to data sources ranging from patient records\n                                        to digital fitness devices and smartphone applications, which can monitor movement and vital signs. \u201cIt will allow us to do much more integrated, personalized care,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.\nMedtronic, a large medical equipment maker, wants to use data intelligently to treat diabetes patients beyond providing them with its glucose monitors and insulin pumps. Medtronic devices are already digital and produce\n                                        a lot of data, but the company plans to use the Watson software to spot patients trending toward trouble and automatically adjust insulin doses and send alerts to care providers and the patients themselves.\n\u201cThe goal is dynamic, personalized care plans so you can delay or stop the progression of diabetes,\u201d said Hooman Hakami, executive vice president in charge of Medtronic\u2019s diabetes group.\nApple is increasingly a major supplier of health sensors, from iPhone apps to the Apple Watch. Its recently introduced HealthKit and ResearchKit software make it easier for applications and researchers to harvest health\n                                        information from millions of owners of Apple products, with their permission. That data can now be plugged into Watson. \u201cWe want to be the analytics brains behind HealthKit and ResearchKit,\u201d Mr. Kelly\n                                        said.\nThe IBM initiative raises questions on how data is handled and about privacy. Mr. Kelly said the data scrutinized by Watson will typically be anonymized and often be read by Watson but not removed from hospital or health\n                                        company data centers. \u201cThere will be no big, centralized database in the sky,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\nEven critics of health information technology say the IBM effort holds promise. \u201cIf that future when all this stuff works is going to become real, then having some of the key players come together is the only\n                                        way it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Dr. Robert M. Wachter, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco medical school and author of \u201cThe Digital Doctor: Hope, Hype and Harm at the Dawn of Medicine\u2019s Computer Age.\u201d \u201cThis could be a pretty important step along the way.\u201d"

Keilly, chief executive ofGBK Productions,a marketing firm in Los Angeles that specializes in putting high-end items in the hands of trendsetters, says that Apple is giving its watches to celebrities because the masses adopt fashion in a very different way than they do technology.\nWith gadgets, consumers seek out the advice of experts. With fashion, trendsetters often set the agenda. \u201cIf a celebrity is wearing something, it\u2019s going to make someone want to go out and buy it,\u201d Mr. Keilly said. \u201cCelebrities: They sell.\u201d\nApple isn\u2019t the first consumer electronics company to cozy up to the rich and famous. Technology companies, large and small, all try to get their smartphones, tablets and wearable computers into the hands of influencers.\nSamsung has been particularly aggressive, inviting stars to show up at product introductions, sponsoring Hollywood award shows, hosting parties during fashion week and (of course) handing out devices to the famous.\n(Internal Revenue Service rules require recipients of gifts worth more than $600 to pay tax on those items. Some companies refer to the freebies as \u201clong-term loans.\u201d)\nGiving away productsis something that fashion brands have done for years.\nWhen multiple editors appear in the front row of a ready-to-wear show with the same handbag, which then appears all over street-style blogs, it is a pretty good clue that they received it as a present. Many of the dresses seen on red carpets these days are on loan from fashion houses, if not given outright to the wearer.\nGifting, or swag, suites have popped up wherever boldface names gather, including awards shows and film festivals, where anything from bluejeans to fur vests is theirs for the taking.\n\u201cI think consumers need an extra push with the celebrity endorsement,\u201d said Robert Burke, chief executive ofRobert Burke Associates, a luxury consulting and fashion firm in New York. \u201cThis has been a common practice in the fashion world, but is new to the technology world.\u201d\nHe added that because the Apple Watch blurs the line between fashion and technology, \u201cit makes sense for people to see celebrities with the watch.\u201d\nSo just because I seeKaty Perrywith a gold watch, does that mean I want to come up with $17,000 to buy it, too?\nLikewise, the gift bags that celebrities received at the Oscars this year included a Tuscany vacation, free car rental and overpriced sex toys (allestimated to be valuedat $167,000), and yet that hasn\u2019t enticed me to vacation in Tuscany, use the car rental company or buy the overpriced sex toys.\nLash Fary, founder ofDistinctive Assets, which is based in Los Angeles and manages luxury promotions, said it is not about trying to get people to buy the most expensive version of the Apple Watch, but the version that fits into their budget, much as a fashion house\u2019s couture line creates demand for its off-the-rack label. (Prices for the Apple Watch range from $349 to $17,000.)\n\u201cA lot of the celebrity feeding is about perception in the fashion world,\u201d Mr. Fary said. \u201cIt\u2019s perceived that the brand has stardust now.\u201d\nBut seeing a celebrity flaunt a product doesn\u2019t ensure its success. In 2006, Mr. Keilly of GBK Productions said he gave away \u201cover a million dollars\u201d worth ofgold-plated cellphonesvalued at an $3,500 each from a company called Buzzirk Mobile. While the phone got a lot of media attention, the company ended up going bankrupt.\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first pricey gadget given to A-listers in the hopes of turning it into a must-have fashion accessory.Dozens of actors and performers,including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray, Miley Cyrus and, yes, Beyonc\u00e9, were seen wearing Google Glass.\nAnd we all know how thatworked out."

        "title": "Dear Diary: My Week Wearing an Apple Watch",
        "fulltext": "Ipicked up my Apple Watchlast Wednesday at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. After interviewing some of the designers and engineers who worked on the device, I was given a guided tour of the watch, similar to what customers will receive when they buy one at an Apple Store.\nThe device that Apple lent me was the 42-millimeter stainless steel watch with a Milanese loop band, which sells for $699. The Apple Watch\u2019s bands are interchangeable; I was also given an extra leather band (bright blue, $149) and a sport band made of a kind of rubbery plastic that sells for $49.\nOver a week, I took notes of the highs and lows of using Apple\u2019s new device. Here\u2019s my diary:\nIn Cupertino, an Apple guide walked me through how easy it is to pair the watch with my iPhone (the device gets its Internet connection from a nearby iPhone) and then showed me the watch\u2019s interface. While the demo looked simple, there are unseen depths to the watch. Figuring out what it can do, and how, takes a few days of adjusting.\nThere are two primary input methods for the watch, the touch screen and the digital crown, or the little knob on the side of the device. The screen is similar to any touch screen you\u2019ve used. The main difference is that it does not accept some actions you know from your phone, including pinch-to-zoom. It also accepts a novel gesture not found on phones, called Force Touch. With that gesture, you press the screen harder than you normally do to unearth extra controls on certain screens.\ntranscript\nNA\nThe crown, which turns with the weighty precision you would expect of a fine watch, performs a few functions. You press the crown in to switch between the clock face and your home screen of apps; sometimes, pressing the crown also acts as a back button. If you press and hold down the crown, you invoke the Siri voice assistant. You can also call up Siri by holding your wrist up and saying, \u201cHey Siri!\u201d \u2014 which is awkward in public but addictive in private.\nThe crown\u2019s main functions involve scrolling and zooming. When you\u2019re on a screen with a list of items or a long screed of text, turning the crown will scroll up or down.\nAlthough you can also scroll by flicking the screen, scrolling with the crown can be faster and more precise than using the touch screen, and your finger isn\u2019t covering what you\u2019re trying to look at. When you\u2019re on a screen with images or icons \u2014 like your home screen of apps, or the Photos or Maps app \u2014 turning the crown will zoom in and out of the image.\nIn addition to these primary input methods, you\u2019ve also got to remember four types of screens from which different functions can be performed. These are the clock face, the notifications panel, apps and glances.\nLet\u2019s go over them here:\nThe face is just what it sounds like, one of 10 different timepiece screens you can choose from that show the time, and, on some screens, lots of extra information, including the date, calendar entries, or the position of the sun in the sky. As with most smartwatches, the Apple Watch\u2019s screen is usually off. It turns on to show the clock face when you turn your wrist toward your face.\nIf you swipe down from the clock face, you\u2019ll see the notifications panel. Think of it as you would the list of notifications on your phone \u2014 tiny missives from apps seeking to get your attention. Some notifications will also trigger alerts that will cause the watch to make a sound or to buzz its \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d the mechanism that causes the watch to tap on your wrist.\nApps on the watch are similar to those on a phone: They\u2019re little programs that perform discrete functions. The watch comes with more than a dozen apps made by Apple, and many third-party developers, including The New York Times, have also built watch apps that are companions to their iPhone apps. The watch apps are packaged with iPhone apps; when you install them on your phone, they automatically become available for your watch.\nThe final primary interface element \u2014 and the one that feels the least Apple-y, because it adds a layer of confusion without much attendant utility \u2014 is something called a glance. Glances are quick, summary views of certain apps that you can see by swiping up from the watch face. For instance, the glance for the Weather app shows you the current temperature and your location; the Calendar glance shows you your next appointment.\nIf all this sounds complicated, you\u2019re right. It is slightly difficult to get the hang of the Apple Watch, at least at first. The biggest problem is figuring out which types of actions are available on which screens. For instance, if you get an email notification, you can\u2019t swipe left on the message to archive it, because that quick action is available only from the Mail app, not the notification for the Mail app \u2014 which is confusing, because the two screens are nearly identical visually. Or, if you\u2019re in the glance for the Maps app, you can\u2019t move the map around; to do that, you\u2019ve got to go to the full Maps app, which looks initially just like the glance.\nIt took me at least a day to feel confident at shuttling around the different parts of the watch. Since it\u2019s a brand-new device, it stands to reason there will be a bit of a learning curve involved. Still, the Apple Watch presents an uncharacteristic first impression, one that many may find daunting.\nFor several years, some techies have argued that the best way to separate us from our phones is to add some new device to our lives, preferably something attached to our bodies. This was the main justification forGoogle Glass, and in the last few weeks it has become one of the majorarguments in favorof the Apple Watch. The theory goes like this: Because it is fixed on your wrist, and because its interface is tuned for quick interaction rather than complex tasks, a smartwatch can let you take care of digital demands faster than your phone.\nThis idea is nice, but to get it to work, you\u2019ve got to decide which notifications you want to get on your watch, and which you don\u2019t. When you first set it up, the watch generally mirrors the notifications you\u2019ve set for your phone: If you now get an iPhone alert when a friend changes her Facebook profile photo, you\u2019ll get one on your Apple Watch. (The system is smart enough to alert you in just one place \u2014 it doesn\u2019t buzz your watch if you\u2019re looking at your phone.) But because the phone and the watch are such different devices, mirroring notifications between them often makes little sense.\nFor instance, since there\u2019s isn\u2019t (yet) a Facebook app for the Apple Watch, notifications for Facebook on the watch are essentially useless \u2014 your wrist buzzes with a note that your friend has changed her profile photo, but when you tap the Facebook notification, nothing happens.\nEven for apps that are available for the watch, mirroring the phone\u2019s notifications is not necessarily the best decision. Do you want every email to buzz your wrist, or just those from your VIPs? How about social apps like Twitter \u2014 when should you let them ring your watch?\nI spent many hours pondering such questions, and there was a lot of fine-tuning in the notification screen on my phone. In other words, it didn\u2019t just work.\nOn your wrist, the Apple Watch feels like any other watch. It isn\u2019t too big, it isn\u2019t too heavy, and it is handsomely elegant without being flashy. The shiny Milanese band was my favorite of the three I tried, even though its magnetic clasp periodically loosens up during the course of the day, requiring adjustment. Like anything you wear for the first time, you\u2019ll notice the watch in the early hours after you put it on, but you\u2019ll quickly forget it\u2019s there until you need it.\nI was surprised to discover that the Apple Watch didn\u2019t command much notice from others, either. I used it in public in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Manhattan for a week, and only a handful of people asked what it was.\nEven when I made a show of using it, like holding it up to pay for groceries at Whole Foods or to present my digital boarding pass at San Francisco International Airport, nobody really said anything.\nBy the way, it worked perfectly at Whole Foods and at the security checkpoint at the airport, but there was a hitch before boarding the plane \u2014 my wrist couldn\u2019t fit under Virgin America\u2019s scanner, so, like a time traveler visiting from the olden days, I had to access the boarding pass on my phone. #Firstworldproblems.\nWhen Apple unveiled the watch last year, it did not specify how long the battery would last between charges. For me, the battery consistently lasted at least a full day. On a day of heavy use it got to about 10 percent of power left by bedtime. But on most days I noticed robust battery life, with 20 to 30 percent remaining on the battery bar at the end of a day, which is far better than I fare with my phone. The watch\u2019s charger, a little magnetic disc that sits on your bedside table, is excellent. The watch attaches and detaches from it with ease, so charging it nightly isn\u2019t difficult.\nAnother unexpectedly nice feature was making phone calls from my wrist. It sounds dumb. It looks dumb. But when I got a call in the middle of something else \u2014 cooking, slumping on the couch \u2014 tapping my wrist and chatting was easier than searching for the phone. You don\u2019t have to hold your wrist up to your face like Dick Tracy; the microphone is powerful enough to pick up sound while you use your hands normally. In a strange way, the watch makes phone calling \u2014 which smartphones have been killing in favor of messaging \u2014 more interesting than texting, because the watch has no alphanumeric keyboard.\nYou can send messages from the watch, but it\u2019s limited. One way is to dictate your message, but that isn\u2019t perfect. You can also send emoji or default responses (things like \u201cO.K.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m on the way!\u201d), but those options aren\u2019t often sufficient to get across a range of emotions.\nFor similar reasons, Apple has restricted outbound email. You can triage your messages \u2014 archive them, mark them as read or unread, flag them \u2014 but you can\u2019t respond, not even with emoji or canned responses like my standard response to most emailers, \u201cThanks but no thanks, chump.\u201d I found this less than stellar: I would have loved at least a set of canned responses. In general, I found the Mail app to be something of a pain to use, and I\u2019m hoping that Apple or some third-party creates the perfect mailbox for the watch.\nThere is something magical about having a computer that no one notices right there on your wrist. I first experienced this magic while at lunch with a colleague. I\u2019m usually a wreck at such meetings, because while I try to refrain from looking at my phone, my mind is constantly jonesing for the next digital hit.\nLunch today is different. My iPhone remains hidden deep in my pocket, and to all the world I am the picture of the predigital man. It is the middle of the workday, the busiest time for digital communication. Yet with the Apple Watch on my wrist, my mind remains calm, my compulsion to check the phone suddenly at bay. After spending the last few days customizing my notification settings, my watch is a hornet\u2019s nest of activity. It buzzes every few minutes to indicate incoming email and texts, tweets or Slack messages.\nThe buzzes aren\u2019t annoying. They go completely unnoticed by my colleague, while to an addict like me they\u2019re little hits of methadone \u2014 just enough contact with the digital world to whet my appetite, but not nearly as immersive, and socially disruptive, as reaching for my phone and eyeing its screen. I not only register the watch\u2019s buzzes, but several times while we\u2019re chatting, I surreptitiously check its screen. I scan some incoming messages and tweets, and even flag a couple of emails for later.\nAt the end of the meal, I ask my colleague if she\u2019s noticed me checking my watch. She is surprised; she hasn\u2019t seen it.\nThe Apple Watch has two ways of measuring physical activity. One way is passive: In the background, it constantly measure your steps, how often you stand up and, periodically, your heart rate. It displays these three activities ingeniously; there is a diagram depicting three rings that become fully-closed circles as you get closer to completing your daily activity goals. As you go through the day, the watch prompts you to move around more often if you start to feel slothful. Every hour, it reminds you to stand up.\nI found the prompts helpful. There\u2019s nothing revolutionary about it; I\u2019ve tried lots of activity trackers in the past, and the watch doesn\u2019t do much more than the cheapest ones. But as part of a device that you\u2019ll wear for other reasons, having a general-purpose health app is pretty handy.\nThe Apple Watch can also measure more strenuous exercise. There\u2019s a dedicated app to track your runs, bike rides and other physical activity. After some initial calibration with your phone, the watch can measure your workout distance even when you leave the phone at home. I would love to tell you that the app put me through its paces, but that would be a lie. I spent most of the week as I normally do \u2014 with slight but hardly strenuous daily activity, and never quite approaching the level of an actual workout.\nThe cynic might point out that even if the Apple Watch does liberate you from your phone, your escape is only illusory \u2014 you\u2019re still attached to the digital world, and you\u2019re only escaping for yet another screen. Is that really a positive direction either for you or for society? And to the extent that the watch begins to replace your phone, won\u2019t you just start spending more of your time on its tinier screen, eventually rebuffing the real world again, just like you did on your smartphone?\nSurely smartwatches aren\u2019t going to be a panacea for tech-induced antisocial behavior.\nBut after a few days with the Apple Watch, I get a sense that they do more good than harm. It\u2019s not just that interactions on the watch are speedier and less socially intrusive than those on the phone. The Apple Watch also has another, hidden benefit: It is far less immersive than a phone. There just isn\u2019t that much to do on such a tiny screen, so you rarely feel yourself getting sucked in and lost.\nConsider this: The Apple Watch has no web browser. If you come upon a web link in an email message, a tweet or some other app, tapping it does nothing. This absence eliminates whole avenues of procrastination \u2014 there\u2019s no Google, Wikipedia or BuzzFeed.\nWhile there are some news and entertainment apps for the watch, they consume precious little time.\nAnd that, to me, is the biggest difference between this device and a phone. The watch, for now, is all business, aimed solely at improving your productivity. For some users, that alone might be worth several hundred dollars."

I don\u2019t often have my cellular data turned on and rely primarily on Wi-Fi. Am I missing something?\nA.Apple\u2018s iTunes software can automaticallysync the contenton iPads, iPhones and iPod Touch players with Mac and Windows computers, but even if the feature is enabled in the iTunes settings, a few other conditions apply. For instance, the iOS devices need to be plugged in to a power source and iTunes must be open on the computer, even if the mobile devices are not nearby. Everything must be on the same wireless network, too.\nEven if you do not have the iPad or iPhone plugged in for recharging, you should be able to manually sync it. Open iTunes on the computer, click thedevice icon in the iTunes window, select the iOS device you want to use and click the Sync button at the bottom of the window.\nIf everything appears to be set up correctly and you still cannot sync wirelessly, Apple suggestsadditional troubleshooting steps.\nThese include quitting and reopening iTunes,restartingthe iOS devices, checking your Wi-Fi connections (including checking for interference from other wireless hardware like cordless phones) and rebooting your network router. You should also make sure your computer\u2019s firewall settings are not blocking the connection.\nInternet Explorer\nIn Windows 10\nQ.Is Internet Explorer being removed from the new Windows 10 upgrade that is supposed to come out this year?\nA.According toMicrosoft, the Internet Explorer browser will still be available to use in the comingWindows 10operating system this year, but it will not be the default browser anymore.\nThe company is introducing a new program,code-named Project Spartan,which will be the main browser for Windows 10.\nIf you want or need to use Internet Explorer on Windows 10, you should be able tofind it in the Windows Accessoriesarea on the new system. Microsoft\u2019s development team willstill provide security patchesfor the older browser, but do not expect new features because the company\u2019s focus will be on Project Spartan. This new browser will include faster performance, the ability to mark up web pages andCortana, Microsoft\u2019s voice-activated assistant software.\nTIP OF THE WEEKHave you ever wanted to rename a whole group of files at once? Although earlier versions of Mac OS X did not make it easy (without extra software or scripts), OS X 10.10 Yosemite canrename multiple files at the same time.\nJust select all the files you want to change (like a folder of vacation pictures), and right-click the selected group to see the contextual menu; you can also hold down the Control key while clicking to get the menu. Choose Rename Items from the menu. The box that appears offers multiple ways to rename the selected files, including replacing part of the existing name, adding text to the file name or creating a new name format and numbering system that changes the camera\u2019s numeric photo titles to more descriptive file names like \u201cParis (1).jpg,\u201d \u201cParis (2).jpg\u201d and so on.\nWindows has included the ability to easily rename a batch of files since at leastWindows XP. InWindows 7and later, you can rename multiple files after you select them by right-clicking and choosing Rename from the menu. In the desktop mode ofWindows 8.1, you can also rename selected files by clicking the Home tab at the top of the window. Select the Rename icon there and type in the new group name for the files.\nJ.D. BIERSDORFER"

        "title": "BlackRock\u2019s Chief, Laurence Fink, Urges Other C.E.O.s to Stop Being So Nice to Investors",
        "fulltext": "On Tuesday morning, the chief executives of 500 of the nation\u2019s largest companies will receive a letter in the mail that will most likely surprise them.\nThe sender of the letter is Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. Mr. Fink oversees more than $4 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s trillion with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 of investments, making him perhaps the world\u2019s most important shareholder.\nHe is planning to tell the leaders that too many of them have been trying to return money to investors through so-called shareholder-friendly steps like paying dividends and buying back stock.\nTo Mr. Fink, these maneuvers, often done under pressure from activist investors, are harming the long-term creation of value and may be doing companies and their investors a disservice, despite the increases in stock prices that have often been the result.\n\u201cThe effects of the short-termist phenomenon are troubling both to those seeking to save for long-term goals such as retirement and for our broader economy,\u201d Mr. Fink writes in the letter. He says that such moves were being done at the expense of investing in \u201cinnovation, skilled work forces or essential capital expenditures necessary to sustain long-term growth.\u201d\nAt a time when most investors are clamoring \u2014 and applauding \u2014 high dividends and bigger buybacks, Mr. Fink is bucking the trend.\nUnited States companies spent nearly $1 trillion last year on stock repurchases and dividends, and virtually every big American company is engaged in these practices. General Electric announced last week that it would buy back $50 billion of its stock afterselling most of GE Capital. Apple authorized a $90 billion buyback of its own stock last year. Exxon Mobil spent $13 billion last year on its own stock. IBM, which I\u2019ve questioned for its aggressive use of buybacks and dividends, has spent$108 billion buying backits own shares since 2000.\nRather than consider the return of all this money to shareholders positively, Mr. Fink says the move \u201csends a discouraging message about a company\u2019s ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long term.\u201d Moreover, he argues that \u201cwith interest rates approaching zero, returning excessive amounts of capital to investors\u201d isn\u2019t helpful because they \u201cwill enjoy comparatively meager benefits from it in this environment.\u201d\nMr. Fink and I have been discussing \u2014 and debating \u2014 this topic for more than a year. Last week, before mailing his letter, which he writes annually, he shared it with me.\n\u201cI feel the same pressures as other C.E.O.s,\u201d he told me. But he suggested that it\u2019s not just the fault of managements for being so shortsighted \u2014 the investors themselves may be the problem. \u201cInvestors need to focus on long-term strategies and long-term outcomes,\u201d Mr. Fink said, suggesting we\u2019re currently living in a \u201cgambling society.\u201d\nMr. Fink has a novel suggestion for encouraging shareholders to take a broader perspective, but it may very well upset his peers on Wall Street. He recommends that gains on investments held for less than three years be taxed as ordinary income, not at the usually lower long-term capital gains rate, which now applies after one year.\n\u201cWe believe that U.S. tax policy, as it stands, incentivizes short-term behavior,\u201d he writes in his letter. \u201cSince when was one year considered a long-term investment? A more effective structure would be to grant long-term treatment only after three years, and then to decrease the tax rate for each year of ownership beyond that, potentially dropping to zero after 10 years.\u201d\nMr. Fink contends that such a shift in tax policy \u201cwould create a profound incentive for more long-term holdings and could be designed to be revenue neutral. In short, tax reform that promotes long-term investment will benefit both the companies who rely on capital markets and the hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.\u201d\nAsked whether such a change in tax policy would reduce liquidity in the market, Mr. Fink scoffed: \u201cI don\u2019t think Warren Buffett cares about liquidity that much.\u201d\nIt is refreshing to see a finance executive talk some sense on these issues.\nHowever, Mr. Fink is not simply being altruistic. To some degree, he is talking his own book: BlackRock\u2019s business model, unlike those of so many finance companies that rely on trading fees, does not require it to turn over its portfolio. Given its size and scale, BlackRock often holds its investments for decades.\nSo from a financial perspective, Mr. Fink has little to lose. In fact, the firm may have much to gain if tax rules were adjusted to be more favorable to the way Mr. Fink invests. (And what\u2019s the harm in suggesting tax policy change, as smart as it may be, that has a low probability of ever happening?)\nThat\u2019s not to suggest Mr. Fink doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying; he does. He is a relatively progressive finance executive who has been a longtime Democrat and has taken positions that many of his peers in finance abhor.\nTo Mr. Fink, the shortsightedness that pervades corporate America is just a symptom of a larger issue. \u201cThis is not just a corporate problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a societal problem, whether it\u2019s health care or politics or business.\u201d\nHe also said he recognized that his letter might not be popular in certain quarters but he qualified his approach by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make friends or enemies.\u201d\nDespite his protestations, Mr. Fink said, \u201cThere is nothing inherently wrong with returning capital to shareholders in a measured fashion.\u201d He added, \u201cNor are the demands of activists necessarily at odds with the interests of other shareholders.\u201d But it\u2019s when it is taken to extremes \u2014 such as it seems to be in the current marketplace \u2014 that has Mr. Fink concerned.\nStill, Mr. Fink is taking a direct shot at the rise of activist investors, like Carl C. Icahn, who have made careers out of pressing companies to return cash to shareholders.\nMr. Fink said he met with two activists last week. One of them, he said, told him, \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Mr. Fink said he replied. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some balance.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Watch Review: Bliss, but Only After a Steep Learning Curve",
        "fulltext": "It took three days \u2014 three long, often confusing and frustrating days \u2014 for me to fall for theAppleWatch. But once I fell, I fell hard.\nFirst there was a day to learn the device\u2019s initially complex user interface. Then another to determine how it could best fit it into my life. And still one more to figure out exactly what Apple\u2019s first major new product in five years is trying to do \u2014 and, crucially, what it isn\u2019t.\nIt was only on Day 4 that I began appreciating the ways in whichthe elegant $650 computer on my wrist was more than just another screen. By notifying me of digital events as soon as they happened, and letting me act on them instantly, without having to fumble for my phone, the Watch became something like a natural extension of my body \u2014 a direct link, in a way that I\u2019ve never felt before, from the digital world to my brain. The effect was so powerful that people who\u2019ve previously commented on my addiction to my smartphone started noticing a change in my behavior; my wife told me that I seemed to be getting lost in my phone less than in the past. She found that a blessing.\nThe Apple Watch is far from perfect, and, starting at $350 and going all the way up to $17,000, it isn\u2019t cheap. Though it looks quite smart, with a selection of stylish leather and metallic bands that make for asharp departure from most wearable devices, the Apple Watch works like a first-generation device, with all the limitations and flaws you\u2019d expect of brand-new technology.\nWhat\u2019s more, unlike previous breakthrough Apple products, the Watch\u2019s software requires a learning curve that may deter some people. There\u2019s a good chance it will not work perfectly for most consumers right out of the box, because it is best after you fiddle with various software settings to personalize use. Indeed, to a degree unusual for a new Apple device, the Watch is not suited for tech novices. It is designed for people who are inundated with notifications coming in through their phones, and for those who care to think about, and want to try to manage, the way the digital world intrudes on their lives.\nStill, even if it\u2019s not yet for everyone, Apple is on to something with the device. The Watch is just useful enough to prove that the tech industry\u2019s fixation on computers that people can wear may soon bear fruit. In that way, using the Apple Watch over the last week reminded me of using the firstiPhone. Apple\u2019s first smartphone was revolutionary not just because it did what few other phones could do, but also because it showed off the possibilities of a connected mobile computer. As the iPhone and its copycats became more powerful and ubiquitous, the mobile computer became the basis of a wide range of powerful new tech applications, from messaging to ride-sharing to payments.\nSimilarly, the most exciting thing about the Apple Watch isn\u2019t the device itself, but the new tech vistas that may be opened by the first mainstream wearable computer. On-body devices have obvious uses in health care and payments. As the tech analyst Tim Bajarin has written, Apple also seems to be pushing a vision of the Watch as ageneral-purpose remote control for the real world, a nearly bionic way to open your hotel room, board a plane, call up an Uber or otherwise have the physical world respond to your desires nearly automatically.\nThese situations suggest that the Watch may push us to new heights of collective narcissism. Yet in my week with the device, I became intrigued by the opposite possibility \u2014 that it could address some of the social angst wrought by smartphones. The Apple Watch\u2019s most ingenious feature is its \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d which alerts you to different digital notifications by silently tapping out one of several distinct patterns on your wrist. As you learn the taps over time, you will begin to register some of them almost subconsciously: incoming phone calls and alarms feel throbbing and insistent, a text feels like a gentle massage from a friendly bumblebee, and a coming calendar appointment is like the persistent pluck of a harp. After a few days, I began to get snippets of information from the digital world without having to look at the screen \u2014 or, if I had to look, I glanced for a few seconds rather than minutes.\nIf such on-body messaging systems become more pervasive, wearable devices can become more than a mere flashy accessory to the phone. The Apple Watch could usher in a transformation of social norms just as profound as those we saw with its brother, the smartphone \u2014 except, amazingly, in reverse.\nFor now, the dreams are hampered by the harsh realities of a new device. The Watch is not an iPhone on your wrist. It has a different set of input mechanisms \u2014 there\u2019s the digital crown, a knob used for scrolling and zooming, and a touch screen that can be pressed down harder for extra options. There is no full on-screen keyboard, so outbound messages are confined to a set of default responses, emoji and, when you\u2019re talking to other Watch users, messages that you can draw or tap.\nThe Watch also relies heavily on voice dictation and the voice assistant Siri, which is more useful on your wrist than on your phone, but still just as hit-or-miss. I grew used to calling on Siri to set kitchen timers or reminders while I was cooking, or to look up the weather while I was driving. And I also grew used to her getting these requests wrong almost as often as she got them right.\nThe Watch also has a completely different software design from a smartphone. Though it has a set of apps, interactions are driven more by incoming notifications as well as a summary view of some apps, known as glances. But because there isn\u2019t much room on the watch\u2019s screen for visual cues indicating where you are \u2014 in an app, a notification or a glance \u2014 in the early days, you\u2019ll often find yourself lost, and something that works in one place won\u2019t work in another.\nFinding nirvana with the watch involves adjusting your notification settings on your phone so that your wrist does not constantly buzz with information that doesn\u2019t make sense on the Watch \u2014 like Facebook status updates, messages from Snapchat, or every single email about brownies in the office kitchen. Apple\u2019s notification settings have long been unduly laborious; battling them while your hand is buzzing off the hook is an extra level of discomfort.\nOther problems: Third-party apps are mostly useless right now. The Uber app didn\u2019t load for me, the Twitter app is confusing and the app for Starwood hotels mysteriously deleted itself and then hung up on loading when I reinstalled it. In the end, though, it did let me open a room at the W Hotel in Manhattan just by touching the watch face to the door.\nI also used the Watch to pay for New York cabs and groceries at Whole Foods, and to present my boarding pass to security agents at the airport. When these encounters worked, they were magical, like having a secret key to unlock the world right on my arm. What\u2019s most thrilling about the Apple Watch, unlike other smartwatches I\u2019ve tried, is the way it invests a user with a general sense of empowerment. If Google brought all of the world\u2019s digital information to our computers, and the iPhone brought it to us everywhere, the Watch builds the digital world directly into your skin. It takes some time getting used to, but once it clicks, this is a power you can\u2019t live without.\nTheNew York Times announcedlast week that it had created \u201cone-sentence stories\u201d for the Apple Watch, so let me end this review with a note that could fit on the watch\u2019s screen: The first Apple Watch may not be for you \u2014 but someday soon, it will change your world."

        "fulltext": "Q.I want to be able to set programs to record on my digital video recorder from my iPhone, but the Time Warner Cable app keeps crashing on me when I try. What can I do?\nA. As with any mobile app that is acting erratically, make sure you have both the latest version of theTWC TV appand the most recent iOS update from Apple installed on the iPhone \u2014 and that the app is actually compatible with your phone\u2019s version of iOS. If the app and the phone are up to date,try deleting the app, downloading a new copy and then reinstalling iton your iPhone. You can also tryrestarting the iPhone.\nIf the crashing problem persists, Time Warner Cable does have atechnical support area for the program on its website. The site also has a page toregister for the username and passwordyou need to log into the app so you can manage the DVR or stream live TV on your phone.\nIf all else fails with the iOS app, you may be able tomanage your DVR remotely by using the webinstead. Time Warner Cable includes theDVR Managertool on the My TV tab of youronline account page.\nThe company also maintains aTWCTV.com sitefor viewing your channel content and setting the DVR through a desktop web browser, but the site requires the Adobe Flash Player \u2014 software that is not supported on Apple\u2019s iOS system. As a no-frills alternative for simply setting the DVR to grab a show, Time Warner Cable\u2019s old mobile webpage for DVR management may still do the trick; it can be found athttps://mdvr.timewarnercable.com/login/and it works in the iPhone\u2019s Safari browser.\nSystem Recovery Tools for Windows 7\nQ.Can you use a flash drive for system start-up and recovery on Windows 7like you can on Windows 8? And when will Microsoft stop doing updates for this version of the operating system?\nA.Windows 7 comes with tools tocreate a system repair discwithrecovery optionsin the computer\u2019s CD or DVD drive, but Microsoft also hasa set of instructions onlineto install Windows 7 on a USB flash drive. This drive can then be plugged in tostart up the PCwhen the version of Windows 7 on the computer is unable to function properly. In addition to a spare USB drive, you also need the 25-characterproduct keythat came with your copy of Windows 7.\nAfter you enter the product key, you can download a disc image of Windows 7 to use for creating a bootable USB drive. As Microsoft\u2019s page explains, you also need the freeWindows 7 USB/DVD Download Toolso you can install Windows 7 directly on the USB drive.\nMicrosoft\u2019s method results in a USB drive with a working copy of Windows 7 that can be used to boot up and troubleshoot the ailing computer. Other Windows-focused sites and blogs have their own tips for fixing a PC that won\u2019t start properly. For example, the 7Tutorials site hasan illustrated guidefor installing the Windows 7 System Recovery tools onto a flash drive, and the Raymond.cc siteshows howto install the files from a Windows 7 Recovery Disc onto a USB drive. (As with all do-it-yourself projects, though, you should proceed at your own risk.)\nAs for the life span of Windows 7 itself, do not expect any new features or enhancements to the operating system, as Microsoft ended mainstream support for it in January. Windows 7 will continue to receive extended support for security patches and critical updates for a few years longer, though.According the Microsoft\u2019s Product Lifecycle Page, the extended support phase is scheduled to end on Jan. 14, 2020. If upgrading to Windows 8.1 does not appeal to you, remember thatWindows 10is due later this year and will bea free upgrade for Windows 7 usersduring its first 12 months of release."
