        "title": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits",
        "fulltext": "Tim Cook was angry.\nIt was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before aUnited States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel\u2019s chairman called \u201cghost companies.\u201d\n\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201d\nTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.\nFive months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the smallisland of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.\nApple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.\nThe previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.\nThe records, shared by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalistswith The New York Times and other media partners, were obtained by the German newspaperS\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\nThe documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\n\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.\nIndeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nThe disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.\nBut the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.\nApple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.\nAn Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201d\nIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.\nCongressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.\nAppleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.\nTax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.\nEuropean regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.\nSince the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.\nCriticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.\nIn May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.\nUnder Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.\nAt the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\n\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.\nIreland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.\nBut by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.\nAt that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.\nCompany officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\n\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201d\nIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.\nBaker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201d\nBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\n\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d\n(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)\nApple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.\nBut the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.\nThe double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.\nIrish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.\nThe campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.\nThis gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.\nBut a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.\nApple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.\nApple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.\nBut J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.\nThat would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.\nApple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\n\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201d"

        "title": "Will Qualcomm Agree to a Deal With Broadcom? Ask Apple",
        "fulltext": "Apple may anoint the winner of Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for Qualcomm. A dispute over iPhone royalties left Qualcomm vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. If Apple settles its dispute, it could preserve Qualcomm\u2019s independence \u2014 but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to its devices, or just surlier.\nQualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties that the chip maker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies. The actual payments aren\u2019t disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone. When Apple sued Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees this year, it helped push Qualcomm\u2019s share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcom\u2019s interest was reported.\nSettling the lawsuit might make Broadcom\u2019s bid of $70 per share less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed to a lower royalty payment of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that\u2019s worth about $16 billion \u2014 or roughly $11 per share. And that\u2019s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back.\nShould Apple play along? It depends on which chip maker it considers the more malleable counterpart. Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, is said to be open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should his company prevail. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant.\nWhatever Mr. Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Mr. Tan could negotiate properly anyway. The iPhone maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable."

        "title": "Why Texas Shooting Could Draw Apple Back Into Security Debate",
        "fulltext": "More than a year after Apple battled the F.B.I. over the unlocking of an iPhone, a new skirmish may be brewing between the authorities and the company over privacy and strong encryption on its devices.\nDevin P. Kelley, whoshot 26 people to deathin a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday, owned an iPhone. That phone may contain evidence that could help law enforcement officials, but the authorities have not unlocked the device to peruse its contents.\nIn a news conference on Tuesday, the F.B.I. said that it had not been able to get into the device owned by the gunman, but it did not specify the type of phone or the operating system.\nApple said that it was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the shooting and that it worked with law enforcement every day. \u201cWe offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple,\u201d the company said.\nApple devices are some of the most secure on the market, and people typically lock them with passwords. Fingerprints can also be used to unlock the device on a biometric scanner.\nIf a user has enabled an iPhone\u2019s data-erase function, someone trying to break into the device would have 10 attempts at typing in a password. If all of those attempts failed, the iPhone would automatically wipe itself clean as a safeguard for its owner\u2019s privacy.\nAfter the F.B.I.\u2019s news conference on Tuesday, Apple said, it immediately reached out to law enforcement. \u201cWe offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us,\u201d Apple said.\nThe situation is a reminder of last year\u2019s fight between Apple and the F.B.I. At the time, law enforcement wanted to get into the iPhone used bySyed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 of Mr. Farook\u2019s co-workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015.\nIn that case, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. The judge asked Apple to \u201cbypass or disable\u201d the security feature that wipes a phone clean after 10 incorrect password attempts. Apple argued that creating the technology to bypass its own security would compromise its users\u2019 safety.\nTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, penned a1,100-word letterto customers, warning that the government\u2019s request would lead to a \u201cchilling\u201d breach of privacy.\nIn the aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting, the authorities could have used Mr. Kelley\u2019s fingers for up to 48 hours after he last opened his iPhone to activate the biometric Touch ID function to gain access to the device. It is unclear why officials did not do so. After 48 hours, law enforcement would need a pass code to open the phone.\nIn the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. was ultimately able to open the iPhone without help from Apple. It\u2019s unclear what methods law enforcement has tried in the Texas case.\nWhether or not the government finds evidence on Mr. Kelley\u2019s iPhone, the case could again thrust Apple into the middle of a debate over how we balance the needs of citizens and their right to privacy with the needs of law enforcement working on tough cases."

        "title": "The iPhone X Is Cool. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You Are Ready for It.",
        "fulltext": "The iPhone X is the best iPhone ever made. Many of you probably aren\u2019t ready for it.\nHere\u2019s why: Apple\u2019s newest iPhone takes a big leap from past models. It lacks a home button, which makes it less intuitive to use than previous iPhones. The device is also the first iPhone to feature a face scanner for unlocking it. And for many people who have developed 10 years of muscle memory from using iPhones a certain way, these may seem like abrupt changes.\nYet for all these caveats, be prepared to get caught up in the buzz of the iPhone X (pronounced ten, not ex). Appleunveiledthe device \u2014 its most expensive smartphone ever, starting at $999 \u2014 in September alongside theiPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which are cheaper models with familiar features. The iPhone X arrives in stores on Friday, and Apple has encouraged people to line up early.\nSo is the iPhone X right for you? I tested the device for two days this week after Apple made it available to The New York Times. This was not an ideal length of time to discover all the pros and cons of the smartphone; in years past, we tested new iPhones for a week or more.\nBut the tests revealed that the phone was incredibly fast and took exceptional photos, which helped me arrive at this verdict: Splurge on theiPhone Xif you care about having a phone with the fanciest mobile camera in a compact body. The iPhone X\u2019s camera is superior to the one on the iPhone 8 Plus, and yet the iPhone X is smaller, which makes it easier to carry around.\nOtherwise, there are plenty of cheaper smartphones with excellent features. And the iPhone X isn\u2019t perfect. Losing the home button will make it awkward to use for a while.\nAnd although the face scanner for unlocking the device is impressive and creepily accurate, in many situations, it didn\u2019t work as quickly as a fingerprint scanner. It also failed to unlock the phone when I wore a pair of Persol sunglasses.\nThe iPhone X feels ahead of its time, perfect for a target audience of technology enthusiasts and obsessive photographers. Everyone else may want to wait awhile to buy.\nFirst, the basics: The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that is larger than the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 8 Plus and the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8. Yet the iPhone X\u2019s overall body is smaller than that of the iPhone 8 Plus (though a little bit larger than that of the iPhone 8).\nApple managed to squeeze a larger screen onto a smaller body by eliminating the iPhone\u2019s bezel, which is the border surrounding the display. The screen takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing the infrared face scanner.\nIn the process of removing the bezel, Apple also eliminated the home button. As a result, controlling the iPhone X mostly involves using touch gestures. When inside an app or unlocking the phone, swiping up from the bottom brings you to the home screen. That\u2019s simple, but other functions are trickier. To open the app switcher, a popular feature, you swipe up from the bottom and hold your finger for a second. Many times, I lifted my thumb too soon before opening this shortcut. (On past iPhones, you would just press the home button twice to open the app switcher.)\nApple has included a shortcut on the phone called Reachability, which lowers the top of the screen to make it easier for one-handed users to reach for buttons or apps on the top row with their thumb. To engage it, swipe downward from the bottom of the screen. Yet it often took me multiple attempts to swipe the sweet spot before successfully opening it. It is much easier to use Reachability with other iPhones: you just tap the home button twice.\nI struggled with the new iPhone controls when I ran into a bug. One morning, the Amazon app was loaded on the screen \u2014 then it froze.\nI tried swiping up to leave the app, then holding two physical side buttons down to shut down the phone, but to no avail.\nI fumbled around for at least 10 minutes before I read a guide that revealed that pressing three physical buttons in a sequence would force a restart.\nThese are troubling signs for how less technologically inclined people may respond to the iPhone X. For the last decade, the iPhone has been a computer that anyone can use without reading an instruction manual. With the iPhone X, that is no longer the case.\nApple\u2019sFace ID, the official name for its face scanner technology, works byspraying an object with infrared dotsand stitching the patterns into a detailed 3D image of your face to determine whether you are the owner of the smartphone before unlocking it.\nFace ID continues to update this map of your face with more information every time you unlock your smartphone \u2014 whether you are wearing a scarf or a hat or growing facial hair. In addition, Face ID can authorize mobile payments, log in to apps and create animated emojis that mimic your face movements.\nI put Face ID through dozens of tests and it recognized my face in most situations, including when I wore a beanie, Ray-Ban sunglasses or goggles for my Halloween costume or draped a dog toy over my head. It worked in pitch dark at night and outside on a sunny day.\nBut Face ID worked inconsistently \u2014 or not at all \u2014 when I lay the iPhone X flat on a table or my night stand, wore a gas mask for my Halloween costume, walked around in bright sunlight at a park or wore Persol sunglasses. (According to Apple, these particular sunglasses probably blocked the part of the infrared spectrum used by Face ID.) It also didn\u2019t work when I tried using the face scanner while slurping a bowl of noodles.\nUltimately, it was faster to unlock the iPhone 8 withTouch ID, the fingerprint sensor, than it was to unlock the iPhone X with Face ID in most situations. Unlocking with a fingerprint sensor is one rapid gesture: You hold your fingerprint over the sensor, and the phone unlocks in less than a second. With Face ID, you have to wait for the camera to scan your face, which sometimes takes more than a second; you can swipe up to unlock the phone before or after the scan completes.\nTo be fair, Touch ID sometimes failed to scan my fingerprint on previous iPhones, like when my hands were sweaty, damp or dirty. Over the long term, Face ID is likely to save more time than using Touch ID because Face ID only failed in rare circumstances.\nBefore reviewing the iPhone X, I used an iPhone 8 Plus for two weeks for comparison. Both devices have a similar rear camera system with two lenses. The two cameras work together to show the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. Apple calls this Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect.\nThe dual-lens camera is extremely compelling, with Portrait mode making photos of even the most mundane things \u2014 like a bowl of ramen \u2014 look artistic and stunning. But the drawback was that the iPhone 8 Plus was so bulky that it was miserable to carry around and using the device with one hand felt impossible.\nThat means the iPhone X\u2019s dual-lens camera and phone size may be a major draw for people. The iPhone X\u2019s camera is slightly better than the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus because one lens has a higher aperture to let in more light. As a result, Portrait mode photos looked better (subjects were even clearer in the foreground), and so did photos taken in low light.\nAnother must mention: the screen. It uses OLED technology, a type of display with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. That made the screen on the iPhone X look more vibrant than the ones on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD. I also preferred the colors on the screen to those onthe Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the $950 phablet that earned top ratings for its display. The Samsung device\u2019s display colors looked bluer and less natural than those on the iPhone X.\nIn terms of features, the iPhone X is the most impressive smartphone ever made. It\u2019s worth the $999 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean you should buy it. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the iPhone X to my tech-crazed friends in Silicon Valley, but the iPhone 8 is just as fast while being simpler and more familiar to use.\nThen again, if you are willing to get up early to line up for a $999 phone, you are probably the target demographic for the iPhone X anyway. Make sure you wear something comfortable."

        "title": "The Best Ways to Share Your Smartphone Photos This Holiday",
        "fulltext": "With the holiday season upon us, families will soon gather for the big annual exchange \u2014 not just gifts, but also memories.\nFor taking photos, smartphones have been a blessing because they include excellent, easy-to-use cameras that people carry everywhere. But the downside is that sharing large batches of digital photos among multiple relatives is hardly straightforward.\nNo family enjoys huddling around and squinting at the small screen on Grandma\u2019s smartphone as she swipes and narrates her vacation in Florida. Even worse is when a sibling bombards you with dozens of text messages of photographs of his baby, burning through your data plan. And let\u2019s not forget the uncle who still carries around a thumb drive.\nFortunately, big tech companies like Apple and Google offer tools to quickly and efficiently share pictures. But the problem is many of those features are buried in their increasinglycomplex operating systems.\n\u201cThere are a few really clever photo sharing tools, but as smart as they are, you might still need to teach family members how they work,\u201d said R. C. Rivera, a professional photographer in San Francisco.\nSo here are some tips for the quickest and most efficient ways to share digital photos, based on my tests and interviews with professional photographers.\nIf you have a modestly sized family, chances are some members use iPhones but others use Androids. The quickest method for everyone to share pics is to rely on a photo storage service that supports both devices.\nMr. Rivera said that most of his family in the United States used iPhones, but that his relatives in Asia all used Android devices. So he goaded his family to useGoogle Photos, which is included on Android devices and works on iPhones.\nAfter you sign up for Google Photos, each photo you take is automatically backed up to Google\u2019s cloud. From there, you can create albums for your trip to Spain or your 2-year-old\u2019s birthday party to share with other members of the family with Google accounts. You can also create public albums that anyone can see with a web link.\nTo make sharing more effortless, you can also take advantage of some neat artificial intelligence. Google Photos detects the face of a person and automatically groups all the photos of that person into an album. From there, you can set up Google to automatically share photos of that person with others \u2014 which is great for baby photos.\nTo do that, inside the Google Photos app, you add apartner account that you want to share with, like your spouse or relative, and then select the option to share photos of specific people. Then select the subject you want to share. If you want to keep people up to date with photos of your toddler, this is a quick and efficient method. (An added bonus: This trick also works for dogs.)\nGoogle Photos is cheap. Google offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images for free. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.\nFor families that entirely rely on iPhones, there\u2019s a major benefit: the ability to share photos among devices almost instantly. Apple phones and computers haveAirDrop, a tool that transfers pictures directly between devices via a wireless Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection.\nUnfortunately, this useful feature is difficult to find. In iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hard press in the upper-left corner to open a hidden menu that includes AirDrop. From there, you can set up AirDrop to receive photos from everyone or just people on your contacts list.\nTo share with AirDrop, make sure your relative nearby has AirDrop receiving turned on. On your iPhone, you can select a photo or a group of photos and tap the Share button (a box with an arrow pointing up). Your relative\u2019s device will show up under the AirDrop menu, and you can select the device. The files will move over instantly \u2014 even a batch of 50 photos will take only a few seconds.\nYour older relatives are probably familiar with the tradition of using a slide projector to show vacation photos or talk about family events. You can do something similar to that with a smartphone, a television set and a media streaming device.\nFirst, pick your streaming device. Google\u2019s $35Chromecast, a small dongle that can be plugged into the TV, is perfect for families using Google Photos. For those relying on iPhones, a $149Apple TVis also great.\nAfter you set up your streaming device,beaming your photos to the television setis a breeze. In the Google Photos app, a small broadcasting icon will appear in the upper-right corner. Tap that while you are reviewing photos, and they will beam onto the television screen.\nWith an Apple TV, the process is just as simple with the toolAirPlay. On your iPhone, open the photo album you want to share and hit the Share button, and then tap AirPlay. The photos you are looking at on your phone will show up on the television screen, and you can narrate your trip to Hong Kong while swiping from photo to photo.\nThere\u2019s always the old-school option of printing out your photos for a physical album. There are several different apps you can use to skip buying a printer.\nThe easiest option for Google Photos users is to just print directly through Google. A photo books tool lets you compile photos into a book. In my tests, dragging some favorite photos from my trip to Japan into a photo book was a breeze. A 20-page book costs $10; each extra page costs 35 cents.\nThere are other options if you want to assemble an old-school scrapbook. Online printing services let you upload photos and order prints in different sizes. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products, highlighted Nations Photo Lab as itstop printing servicethat offers high-quality prints for a good price.\nMr. Rivera, the professional photographer, takes the route that requires minimal effort: He regularly prints Google photo books for his relatives. The color accuracy in the photos is not perfect, but the outcome is good enough.\n\u201cAs a photographer I would scrutinize the color,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for 90 percent of the population, it\u2019s perfect. My parents wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d"

        "title": "Skype Vanishes From App Stores in China, Including Apple\u2019s",
        "fulltext": "SHANGHAI \u2014 One of the last foreign-run tools for online communication in China appears to be in trouble with the authorities here.\nFor almost a month, Skype, the internet phone call and messaging service, has been unavailable on a number of sites where apps are downloaded in China, including Apple\u2019s app store in the country.\n\u201cWe have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law. Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement responding to questions about Skype\u2019s disappearance from the app store. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d\nThe removal led to a volley of complaints from Chinese users on internet message boards who were no longer able to pay for Skype\u2019s services through Apple. The users said that the disruption began in late October.\nSkype, which is owned by Microsoft, still functions in China, and its fate in the country is not yet clear. But its removal from the app stores is the most recent example of a decades-long push by China\u2019s government to control and monitor the flow of information online.\nWhile China has long wielded the most sophisticated and comprehensive internet controls in the world, under President Xi Jinping it has upped the ante, squelching most major foreign social networks and messaging apps one at a time.\nEarlier this autumn, the Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp was hit byblockages in China, becoming the latest in a long line of products to be rendered unusable by Chinese government filters. Others include Gmail, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Telegram and Line.\nBeijing appears to have disabled these apps because they generally feature encryption options that make messages harder for the government to monitor. Such products also often run afoul of government rules that require the use of real-name identification for each and every account.\nA Microsoft spokesman said that Skype had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from Apple\u2019s store and that the company was \u201cworking to reinstate the app as soon as possible.\u201d But the spokesman did not address Skype\u2019s absence from a variety of major third-party Android app stores. Because Google\u2019s services are largely blocked in China, Android users revert to alternate stores for downloads, and Skype\u2019s main app was not available on popular ones run by Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi.\nThe move is a reminder of how beholden Apple has become to the Chinese government at a moment when the leadership is pushing to tighten its control over the internet. To stay in China\u2019s good graces, Apple has taken down apps from its Chinese app store in the past. Last year, it said it had complied with a request from the Chinese authoritiesto remove apps created by The New York Timesfrom its China app store.\nIn recent months, aperfect stormof sensitive political meetings and a new cybersecurity law has led to a sharp crackdown on internet freedoms in China. Foreign TV shows were taken down, software that helps evade China\u2019s internet filters was targeted with heavy disruptions, and in some cases, companies restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing video games.\nBut a key Chinese Communist Party meeting had already ended when Skype disappeared from the app stores \u2014 an indication that the cybersecurity law was the reason, and that the law, which began to take effect in June, is likely to have a deep and long-lasting impact on how the internet works in China. While the rules do not specifically ban foreign messaging apps, they do include general language that could be used to justify crackdowns.\n\u201cA broad reading of provisions in the law could be taken to mean that there is no longer support for allowing unfettered access to foreign communications tools such as Skype, WhatsApp, Signal and others that are outside the direct control of Chinese authorities,\u201d said Paul Triolo, the head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\n\u201cHence these also come under pressure, and are increasingly being throttled or blocked,\u201d he said.\nApple faced heavy criticism this year after it said it had decided totake downsoftware from its app store in China that helps circumvent the government\u2019s internet filters, colloquially called the Great Firewall.\nIn that case, as in this one, it said that the apps violated Chinese rules and that it had taken them down to comply. Apple said this year that it planned to open a data center in China, also in response to China\u2019s new internet laws, which require that such centers be within the country\u2019s borders."

        "title": "How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom",
        "fulltext": "BALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. \u2014 They call it the \u201cChurch Lane Hug.\u201d\nThat is how educators at Church Lane Elementary Technology, a public school here, describe the protective two-armed way they teach students to carry their school-issued laptops.\nAdministrators atBaltimore County Public Schools, the 25th-largest public school system in the United States, have embraced the laptops as well, as part of one of the nation\u2019s most ambitious classroom technology makeovers. In 2014, the district committed more than $200 million for HP laptops, and it is spending millions of dollars on math, science and language software. Its vendors visit classrooms. Some schoolchildren have been featured in tech-company promotional videos.\nAnd Silicon Valley has embraced the school district right back.\nHP has promoted the district as a model to follow in places as diverse as New York City and Rwanda. Daly Computers, which supplied the HP laptops,donated $30,000this year to the district\u2019s education foundation. Baltimore County schools\u2019 top officials have traveled widely to industry-funded education events, with travel sometimes paid for by industry-sponsored groups.\nSilicon Valley is going all out to own America\u2019s school computer-and-software market, projected to reach $21 billion in sales by 2020. An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.\nSchool leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.\nThese marketing approaches are legal. But there is little rigorous evidence so far to indicate thatusing computers in classimproves educational results. Even so, schools nationwide are convinced enough to have adopted them in hopes of preparing students for the new economy.\nIn some significant ways, the industry\u2019sefforts to push laptopsand apps in schools resemble influence techniquespioneered by drug makers. The pharmaceutical industry has longcultivated physiciansas experts and financed organizations, likepatient advocacy groups, to promote its products.\nStudies have found that strategies like these work, andeven a free $20 mealfrom a drug maker can influence a doctor\u2019s prescribing practices. That is one reason the government today maintainsa database of drug maker payments, including meals, to many physicians.\nTech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\n\u201cIf benefits are flowing in both directions, with payments from schools to vendors,\u201d saidRob Reich, a political-science professorat Stanford University, \u201cand dinner and travel going to the school leaders, it\u2019s a pay-for-play arrangement.\u201d\nClose ties between school districts and their tech vendors can be seen nationwide. But the scale of Baltimore County schools\u2019 digital conversion makes the district a case study in industry relationships. Last fall, the district hosted theLeague of Innovative Schools, a network of tech-friendly superintendents. Dozens of visiting superintendents toured schools together with vendors like Apple, HP and Lego Education, a division of the toy company.\nThe superintendents\u2019 league is run by Digital Promise, a nonprofit that promotes technology in schools. It charges$25,000 annuallyfor corporate sponsorships that enable the companies to attend the superintendent meetings. Lego, a sponsor of the Baltimore County meeting, gave a 30-minute pitch, handing out little yellow blocks so the superintendents could build palm-size Lego ducks.\nKaren Cator, the chief executive ofDigital Promise, said it was important for schools and industry to work together. \u201cWe want a healthy, void-of-conflict-of-interest relationship between people who create products for education and their customers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason is so that companies can create the best possible products to meet the needs of schools.\u201d\nSeveral parents said they were troubled by school officials\u2019 getting close to the companies seeking their business.Dr. Cynthia M. Boyd, a practicing geriatrician and professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with children in district schools, said it reminded her of drug makers\u2019 promoting their medicines in hospitals.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.\nBaltimore County\u2019s 173 schools span a 600-square-mile horseshoe around the city of Baltimore, which has a separate school system. Like many districts, the school system struggles to keep facilities up-to-date. Some of its 113,000 students attend spacious new schools. Some older schools, though, are overcrowded, requiring trailers as overflow classrooms. In some, tapwater runs brown. And, inbudget documents, the district said it lacked the \u201cdedicated resources\u201d for students with disabilities.\nIn a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\n\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201d\nThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.\nThe district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.\nThe district ultimately awarded a$205 million, multiyear contractto Daly Computers, a Maryland reseller, to furnish the device, called theElitebook Revolve.\nMychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.\nWith the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.\nIn September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\n\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201d\nAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201d\nThe superintendent later appeared inan HP video. \u201cWe are going to continue needing a thought partner like HP to say what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working,\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft, whose Windows software runs the laptops, named the district aMicrosoft Showcaseschool system. Intel, whose chips power the laptops, gave Ryan Imbriale, the executive director of the district\u2019s department of innovative learning, anIntel Education Visionary award.\nRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.\nMr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201d\nAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201d\nAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.\nMr. Dance\u2019s technology makeover is now in the hands of an interim superintendent,Verletta White. In April Mr. Danceannouncedhis resignation, without citing a reason. Ms. White has indicated that she will continue the tech initiative while increasing a focus on literacy.\nA Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.\nMr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.\nIn Baltimore County and beyond, the digital makeover of America\u2019s schools has spawned a circuit ofconferences, funded by Microsoft, Google, Dell and other tech vendors, that lavish attention on tech-friendly educators.\nMr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.\nBetween March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.\nAt least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.\nAnother way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.\nOne prominent provider is the Education Research and Development Institute, orERDI, which regularly gathers superintendents and other school leaders for conferences where they can network with companies that sell to schools.\nERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.\nThe Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\nERDI has offered superintendents $2,000 per conference as participating consultants, according to aLouisiana Board of Ethics filing. And there are other perks.\n\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.\nMr. Dance\u2019s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.\nMr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.\nLast February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.\nAt the time, both companies had contracts with the district. A few months after the event, the school board approved additional money for both companies.Each contractis now worth about$3.2 million.\nA DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. \u201cEven the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,\u201d she said.\nA Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: \u201cThese panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.\u201d\nMs. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201d\nAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.\nShe added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.\nMr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.\nBaltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\nBeneath crystal chandeliers last April, politicians, school leaders, vendors and community members gathered in a banquet hall. The occasion wasState of the Schools, an annual fund-raising luncheon arranged by the Education Foundation of Baltimore County Public Schools.\nThe foundation was created in the early 1990s and raises money for schools. Tech companies have made significant donations, and havedirectorssitting on the foundation\u2019s board. The directors include employees fromDiscovery Education,PearsonandMicrosoft, all vendors with multimillion-dollar district contracts.\nDaly, the laptop provider, was the biggest donor, giving$30,000. McGraw-Hill, Discovery Education, Pearson and Microsoft each donated $1,500 to $15,000. Of the $211,500 in publicly listed donations for the event, tech companies gave about 43 percent.\n\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J. Collins, a former Maryland state senator and former school board member. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that passed the smell test.\u201d\nDiscovery Education said it trained employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.\nDeborah S. Phelps, the foundation\u2019s executive director, said it awarded scholarships and gave schools grants for projects in culture, science, technology and other subjects.\nWhen asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.\nMr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201d\nMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms. Otherwise, parents could lose trust in the system.\n\u201cSchool leaders should be just as concerned about the perception of corruption as actual corruption,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "Qualcomm has rebuffed a $105 billion buyout bid from Broadcom, setting up two of the world\u2019s biggest chip makers for a potentially nasty takeover battle.\nThe proposal \u201csignificantly undervalues\u201d the company, overlooking its reputation in mobile technology and potential for growth, Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s board chairman, saidin a statementon Monday.\nBroadcom\u2019s offer, which would amount to the largest deal in the history of the tech industry and have significant implications for smartphone production, could also run afoul of antitrust regulators, Qualcomm said.\nBroadcom, which said on Monday that it \u201cremains fully committed to pursuing its acquisition of Qualcomm,\u201d now has several options, each involving a degree of hostility.\nThe company could raise its bid price. Or it could take its case to shareholders, starting a proxy fight to swap out members of the current board of directors, all of whom are up for re-election in the spring.\nBroadcom has until Dec. 8 to nominate a new slate.\nThe company could also try to assuage Qualcomm\u2019s fears of government pushback by initiating the regulatory approval process for a potential deal. The company garnered praise from President Trump this month when it said it wouldmove its corporate addressto Delaware from Singapore.\nHock Tan, chief executive of Broadcom, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cThis transaction will create a strong, global company with an impressive portfolio of industry-leading technologies and products, and we have received positive feedback from key customers about this combination.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors and management team.\u201d\nBroadcom is not Qualcomm\u2019s only headache.

        "title": "Apple Report Expects New iPhones to Jump-Start Growth",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Ten years after Apple unveiled the iPhoneand embarked on an era of supercharged growth, the company lifted investor hopes on Thursday thatthe iPhone Xwould be its next blockbuster product.\nAs Apple reported revenue and profit increases that beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, the company said it was also seeing strong demand for the iPhone X, as well as for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which it unveiled in September.\nApple said it expected revenue for the holiday quarter, which is typically its most robust, to come in at between $84 billion and $87 billion. That forecast was well above the $78.4 billion that Apple generated during last year\u2019s holiday quarter, which was anall-time high for quarterly revenue, and reflected confidence that people want new iPhones.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during the earnings call that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had been the most popular iPhones every week since they went on sale. And in an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that iPhone X production was going well and that the company \u201ccould not provide such strong revenue guidance if we didn\u2019t have strong iPhone X demand.\u201d\nThe iPhone X, which arrives in stores on Friday, is Apple\u2019smost expensive iPhone ever, starting at $999. Its new features include a way to unlock the phone using facial recognition technology. The device is the centerpiece of a lineup of new iPhones for the holiday season.\nStrong demand for the devices could give a shot in the arm to Apple, which could become the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market value but has faced more questions about its growth in recent quarters. While the iPhone once fueled Apple\u2019s growth \u2014 its popularity underpinning other offerings like sales of services and software \u2014 more people around the world now own smartphones, and iPhone sales growth has flattened. New products, including the Apple Watch, have not been as widely adopted as the iPhone.\n\u201cThe iPhone X is so important to Apple because \u2014 for now at least \u2014 it seems to be siphoning demand from the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.\nAnd while Wall Street had worried that Apple production issues, especially for the iPhone X, would constrain sales, \u201cthe reality is that over the coming months Apple will be able to meet demand for all of its models,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.\nApple\u2019s revenue for the quarter that ended in late September totaled $52.6 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier and beating Wall Street estimates of $50.7 billion. Net income was $10.7 billion, up 19 percent from $9 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share were $2.07, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.87.\nApple said it had sold 46.7 million iPhones in the quarter, which is typically a lull period before the new devices come out. That was in line with Wall Street predictions of 46 million units and about the same as last year. Sales of iPad tablets rose 11 percent by units, while Macs also sold briskly, up 10 percent from a year earlier.\nAs has been typical for some time, international purchases accounted for the majority of Apple\u2019s sales, with double-digit growth in markets including Europe and China.\nThat growth is set to continue with the new iPhones. There are long lines \u201cin all retail stores across Asia\u201d for the new phones, Mr. Maestri said."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s second play in the TV game shows it\u2019s here to compete.\nThe tech giant has secured one of the most sought-after new projects in television, landing the rights to a new drama centered on a morning TV show and starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, the company announced on Wednesday.\nApple has agreed to two seasons of 10 episodes each, a hefty commitment, and beat out other contenders like Netflix and Showtime that were vying for the show.\nApple, which has a $1 billion war chest to compete for TV projects, had already acquired the rights to revive Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1980s anthology series, \u201cAmazing Stories.\u201d\nBut the Witherspoon-Aniston project is by far the splashier move. Ms. Witherspoon is coming off a major success with the HBO limited series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d for which she was a star and an executive producer. And the project will mark the big return to television of Ms. Aniston, the former \u201cFriends\u201d star.\nFew details are known about the series other than its big stars and its concept, which is built around a morning TV show in the style of \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d The show does not have a title, and no scripts have yet been handed in.\nThe show will be executive produced by Ms. Aniston and her Echo Films production company, along with Ms. Witherspoon and her Hello Sunshine company. Michael Ellenberg, the former head of drama at HBO, will also be an executive producer.\nJay Carson, Hillary Clinton\u2019s former press secretary and a supervising producer of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d will be the series\u2019 showrunner. And CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter, who wrote a book about morning television, \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d will be a consultant."
