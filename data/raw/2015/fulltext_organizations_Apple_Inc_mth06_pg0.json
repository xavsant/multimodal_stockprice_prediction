        "title": "Why I\u2019m Breaking Up With the Apple Watch",
        "fulltext": "I wanted it to work. I wanted to fall in love, like so many of my friends. \u201cIt takes a while,\u201d they said. \u201cDon\u2019t expect a coup de foudre. Let it build over time.\u201d\nSo I did. I knew other people looked at what I had with envy. But a month and a half after we first got together, I have decided it is time to \u2014 well, call time.\nI am breaking up with myApple Watch. The relationship was, despite all expectations, not what I needed. All the focus on San Francisco and Apple\u2019s next big innovation this week (streaming!) made me realize it was not playing my tune.\nStill, I will never regret the weeks we spent together. They taught me some valuable truths about myself.\nLike, for example, that I do not want to be defined by a talking point on my wrist.\nThere is a reason that I carry the same (no logo) handbag everywhere I go, a reason my (pre-Apple) watch had no bells or tourbillon whistles; a reason I gravitate toward clothes that are not identifiable by season or designer and do not appear in any advertisements I have ever seen.\nI spend a lot of time in a world where products are shorthand for people, and I know too well the risks of having such semiology attached to myself (though I fully acknowledge my willingness to attach it to others).\nBut when I started wearing the Apple Watch (the 38-millimeter case with aMilanese Loopband, which is the smaller size with a flexible stainless steel bracelet), it became a subject of conversation no matter where I was: in meetings at work, at the bagel store, at my son\u2019s track meet. It has been so everywhere, marketed to so many people, there was just no mistaking it.\nFirst everyone wanted to know about it. Then they wanted to try it. Then they made certain assumptions about me.\nWhich, frankly, I would have made about any woman like myself walking around with a big black box on her arm.\nBecause no matter how attractive the Apple Watch is in the context of other smartwatches or smartbands, no matter how much of an aesthetic advance its rounded corners and rectangular display, it still looks like a gadget. Especially on someone, like me, with relatively small wrists.\nNot only does its face effectively span the width of my forearm, but the cool little screen saver that so many reviewers have lauded \u2014 the Mickey or the butterfly or the galaxy (which is the one I have) or the pseudo-watch hands (the one that, notably, is always on in every picture of the watch, and actually makes it look like a watch) \u2014 is also functionally sleeping most of the time.\nEvery time I see it, I want to shriek, \u201cBeam me up, Scotty.\u201d\nNot that it would do much good. Typing doesn\u2019t awaken the picture. Even when I rock my arm back and forth energetically, it often takes a few tries before up the earth pops. The default position is blank.\nJust as my default position when trying to read an email or the text of a headline on the small screen involves raising my wrist to near eye level \u2014 or, if a phone call is involved and my actual phone is not reachable, talking into thin air. If your children or acquaintances come upon you, it\u2019s pretty much an invitation to ridicule.\n\u201cWhy is that more embarrassing than endlessly looking at a phone?\u201d my friends said when I complained.\nIt\u2019s a valid question, but after some contemplation I think the answer is simple: A phone is hand-held, and we are used to seeing people read things held in their hands. Like, say, books. But seeing somebody staring at her wrist (or merely sneaking a surreptitious glance at it) telegraphs something else entirely: (1) rudeness or (2) geekiness.\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to have bothered the tech writers, most of whom wrote persuasively positive reviews of the gadget, primarily based on what it could do for you. And it is certainly more subtle thanGoogle Glass, though I am not sure that is saying much.\nGranted, all of this would likely pale in importance if the watch were truly transforming my life, as my iPhone has. But I have never had a problem turning away from my emails when I need to concentrate on something else \u2014 I\u2019ve effectively trained myself to compartmentalize \u2014 so I need specific alerts as to what is important.\nAnd the small screen is simply too small to really read on, so I\u2019ve been more annoyed than happy when it alerted me to texts from my loved ones; and when I saw a headline, all I wanted to do was find the rest of the story.\nBesides, the busywork the watch\u2019s apps can replace \u2014 handing over airline boarding passes, opening hotel room doors \u2014 seems less like an advance than a loss of control. Call me a Luddite, but honestly, I don\u2019t mind unlocking things with my actual hands. The new watch OS announced this week may change the situation, but I am not sure I have the patience to wait.\nLikewise (and I know this will be heresy to anyone really excited about the comingFitbitinitial public offering), the fitness-app aspect \u2014 the tracking of my steps, the measuring of my heart rate, the telling me to stand up when I am in the middle of an article \u2014 seems more like a burden than freedom.\nI have worked hard to wean myself from a reliance on exercise machines telling me how hard I had worked \u2014 how many calories I had burned, how many stairs I had climbed \u2014 in part because I knew I was cheating pretty much all the time anyway and thus could not trust the results, and in part because it became an excuse to modify, or not, my ensuing behavior.\nBut the truth is, I know when I am in shape; I can see the difference in my body and feel it when I ride my bike in the park. The watch threatened to drag me back into a numbers-driven neurosis, and that\u2019s a temptation I would rather not have. (Also, I have too many friends who look at their fitness tracker in the middle of conversation, then immediately spring up and start walking around energetically, to feel it is really additive to my life.)\nI did like the fact that I could turn my phone ringer off, and the watch would vibrate when, say, my children were on the line and I needed to take the call. But in the end that wasn\u2019t enough.\nWhen I told a colleague about the breakup, he observed that perhaps I wasn\u2019t the target for the Apple Watch. That I should be sure to tell the Siri on my wrist, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d He may be right.\nExcept I don\u2019t think so, and not just because often, opposites do attract. But because I actually think I am the intended: a nontech person who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have too many gadgets (a phone, an iPad, a laptop), but who could be seduced into buying another because of its desirability.\nThat\u2019s the way Apple increases market share and owns a category, after all: by sucking in those who are not Apple addicts. It\u2019s why the company worked so hard to get close to the fashion flock.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The watch isn\u2019t actually a fashion accessory for the tech-happy. It\u2019s a tech accessory pretending to be a fashion accessory. I just couldn\u2019t fall for it."

        "title": "Apple Signs Thousands of Independent Labels in Royalty Deal",
        "fulltext": "The turning point inApple\u2019s talks with the music industry came late Sunday night, when \u2014 aftera rebuke from Taylor Swift\u2014 the company reversed course on a proposal to not pay royalties during test drives of a new streaming music service.\nBut for thousands of small record companies for whom Apple is a crucial source of income, a crisis had already been in effect for two weeks, and was resolved only late Tuesday, when the independent groups agreed to licensing terms with the tech giant.\n\u201cOver the last few days, we have had increasingly fruitful discussions with Apple,\u201d Martin Mills, the founder of Beggars Group, whose acts include Adele and Vampire Weekend, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe are now delighted to say that we are happy to endorse the deal with Apple Music as it now stands, and look forward to being a big part of a very exciting future.\u201d\nThe deal, which was also endorsed by Merlin, an organization that represents small labels in digital negotiations, will let thousands of labels join the new streaming service, Apple Music, which will open around the world on Tuesday. The new service is Apple\u2019slong-awaited entryto the world of on-demand streaming music, and will include $10-a-month subscription plans to rival Spotify and others.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about the indie deals, and representatives of Beggars, Merlin and other independents declined to comment further.\nThe standoff with Apple illustrates the unusual position of independents in the digital age. They may have some of the biggest artists in the world \u2014 Ms. Swift and Adele are both signed to indies \u2014 but small companies struggle to secure licensing deals on the same terms as the big labels. Last year, for example, independentsspoke out against YouTubeover terms they believed were unfair.\nAs executives at both major and independent labels describe it, the situation behind the scenes with Apple was typical when it comes to working out the complex licensing contracts for digital music.\nIn the months before Apple announced Apple Music at an event in San Francisco on June 8, the company had extensive talks with Universal, Sony and Warner, the three major labels, and struck the first of its deals with those labels only days before the announcement.\nBut independents were not sent proposals by Apple until the day of the event, and they were told they had five days to approve them with no possibility of negotiation, according to two executives with knowledge of the talks.\nApple had proposed raising its royalty rate slightly for paid streams \u2014 to 71.5 percent of revenue, from 70 percent \u2014 to make up for the loss of royalties during the trial period. Apple would still pay for downloads, but those would be competing with the free trials of the streaming feature, executives said, and many labels were upset by the prospect of three months of reduced income from the industry\u2019s biggest retailer.\nMany independents complained to Apple privately, and trade groups around the world spoke out in frustration. But a stalemate persisted until Sunday morning, when Ms. Swift publishedher blog postand immediately put Apple on the defensive.\nBy Monday \u2014 just hours after the company announced its policy change \u2014 Apple executives began negotiations in New York with a number of independent labels, including Beggars. By Tuesday afternoon, Apple furnished a new proposal that paid royalties on the free streams, and addressed other concerns like the policing of content uploaded by artists to its new media platform, Connect.\nFor each song that is streamed free, Apple will pay 0.2 cent for the use of recordings, a rate that music executives said was roughly comparable to the free tiers from services like Spotify. This rate does not include a smaller payment for songwriting rights that goes to music publishers; Apple is still negotiating with many publishers over those terms, several publishing companies confirmed on Wednesday.\nAccording to the music executives, these rates would apply to all labels.\nFor independents, the negotiations with Apple are seen as a victory, allowing thousands of small labels to be part of Apple Music and earn money when people listen to their songs.\nBut a lingering issue is how much credit goes to Ms. Swift. Without her involvement, some executives said, a deal would most likely not have been reached so quickly.\nOthers, like Adrian Pope, managing director of the British label PIAS, insisted that her involvement only finished what others had already begun.\n\u201cDespite what one might read,\u201d Mr. Pope said, ina statement quotedby the music website The Quietus, \u201cthis was not entirely down to Taylor Swift.\u201d"

        "title": "Seeking Genuine Discovery on Music Streaming Services",
        "fulltext": "One day last week I woke up and decided I wanted to have the best morning ever.\nSo I went toSongza\u2014 the music-streaming service that offers only predetermined playlists, much of them designed around mood, time of day or activity \u2014 and chose the playlist \u201cBest Morning Ever.\u201d\nThe listening experience felt similar to the mainstream-urban-radio format called rhythmic contemporary.\u00a0A few different styles may have been represented, directly or through reference \u2014 hip-hop with Missy Elliott\u2019s \u201cWe Run This,\u201d postdisco with Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cFantasy,\u201d Antillean pop with Becky G\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop Dancin\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014 but this was still a closed loop of pop for an off-the-rack kind of morning.\nLater in the day I checked out Spotify\u2019s \u201cEvening Calm\u201d playlist. It was consistently soft and warm, but focused almost exclusively on the last five years of English-speaking, postfolk Caucasians singing and playing acoustic guitars. If I was being soothed, I was also being sold to. For the streaming services to take over your listening, they need to know who you are. They hope that you can be slotted into predictable contours: a look, a format, a genre.\nEven given unlimited options, many people would prefer to listen like this, and that\u2019s fine. But I have a recurring problem with most streaming-service playlists: Though I keep listening out of animal curiosity for what comes next, I am almost never surprised. I always feel as if I\u2019m shopping somewhere, and the music reflects What Our Customers Like to Listen To. The experience can feel benignly inhuman.\nWith the start of Apple Music this coming Tuesday, I have been thinking about the potential of streaming services. Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora and others oversee an astonishing library \u2014 each offers upward of 30 million songs. Not everything, but enough to suggest the concept of \u201ceverything.\u201d You can\u2019t listen to it all, of course. There is only so much time to waste.\nThis is where all those playlists come in, and the other ways services manage or choose songs for you. For music-data analysts and others, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is very important \u2014 the idea that listeners can be guided, through stated or anticipated preferences, toward music just slightly to the side of what they like, and ideally by pressing a single button.\nThat great library is virtual, not physical. You may never know what you aren\u2019t being exposed to. So will the management of your \u201cdiscovery\u201d involve a narrowing of your library or an expansion of it? And can the streaming services help us \u201cdiscover\u201d without confining us?\nIf there is a basic human desire to have \u201ceverything,\u201d there is also a need to manage it. The creators of the great library of Alexandria, in the third century B.C., sought to bring together the history of intellectual activity. Their goal, it is said, was a half-million volumes, and they contacted rulers of the world, asking them to send scrolls of all kinds. It was overseen by the poet and scholar Callimachus, who understood that users would need to easily find things, and so he cataloged it.\nAccording to Alberto Manguel\u2019s book \u201cA History of Reading,\u201d Callimachus may have been the first to organize a catalog alphabetically. He separated the library\u2019s holdings into drama, oratory, lyric poetry, legislation and so forth; he also attached biographical descriptions and other metadata to them. He was one of the important early stratifiers of genre, which has helped define the reception of creative work \u2014 and to some extent the making of it \u2014 ever since. All the same, as Mr. Manguel writes elsewhere in his book, \u201call classifications are ultimately arbitrary.\u201d\nThe Callimachuses of the music-streaming services know that you need help navigating the great library of music. But they also seem to sense that you associate the concept of musical genres, and their ever more imprecise names \u2014 R&B, country, Latin, punk \u2014 with the old ways.\nSo what are you going to do? Will you dig deeper into the old classifications and consider yourself a lifer with, say, blues or classical music? (I should mention that I have been impressed by the depth of some streaming-service playlists, particularly Songza\u2019s, within a given genre or artist; most are attributed to \u201cSongza\u2019s music experts.\u201d) Will you listen according to a radiolike model, either with a purely algorhythmic logic, or playlists sequenced by humans, or the 24-hour live radio service promised by Apple Music? Will you listen to playlists based on mood or time of day or occasion \u2014 which usually turn out to be presentations of genre, or at least format, by another name? Or will you find some way to better expand your listening?\nI wonder if there is a way of listening that acknowledges the vastness of the library and casts it in a positive light, even for the indifferent.\nThat might involve a greater trust in non-obvious juxtapositions, and in the person programming the juxtapositions. It might be interesting for \u201cEvening Calm\u201d to smuggle elements from other traditions or ethnicities or centuries: say,Sylvia Rexach, or Gilberto Gil, or Ravi Shankar, or Debussy. And it might be even more interesting if the smuggler was someone you felt you knew and respected.\nSome of Tidal\u2019s playlists created by artists have been promising.\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cDrop It for Summer\u201d list, posted in late May, was two hours of hip-hop associated with regional or viral dance moves from the last decade or so \u2014 a subject she knows a lot about \u2014 plus Bob & Earl\u2019s \u201cHarlem Shuffle\u201d from 1963.\u00a0Usher\u2019s \u201cHow U Hear It Part 2: Inspiration,\u201d from a few weeks ago, includes tracks from the rapper Young Thug, the German experimental rock band Can and one particularly non-obvious segue: Frank Zappa\u2019s ridiculous \u201cDon\u2019t Eat the Yellow Snow\u201d followed by Aretha Franklin\u2019s sublime \u201cAin\u2019t No Way.\u201d\u00a0Both used the great library to make fresh or personal associations, and passed that associative energy on to you.\nThe old classification systems in music have done important work. They may have reduced and simplified and excluded; they also helped make culture knowable by delimiting the options. But music is everywhere now, and each of us has many more small relationships with it. I am hoping that we can create some bigger ones, too, worthy of our great and mysterious souls.\nThat Usher playlist could be the first 14 songs generated by his own music library in shuffle mode. But its hard shifts apparently come from his own tastes, and the playlist therefore becomes more interesting than most curation by streaming services. The same probably could be said of the first 14 songs from your library on shuffle, if you own that many songs.\nStreaming services will find more clever ways to anticipate listeners\u2019 tastes, which do often follow patterns. And I can see the point of listening to predictable playlists while you\u2019re doing something else; it keeps you company and isn\u2019t distracting.\nBut for \u201cdiscovery,\u201d I\u2019d rather be guided by a single person of distinction \u2014 whether Beyonc\u00e9, or Usher, or one of the musicians that Apple Music has hired for its radiolike features, or one of the countless other brilliant musical thinkers out there. The streaming services should sign them up furiously, for playlists and shows and podcasts, and pay them well for the privilege.\nLet those people confuse listeners, or challenge precepts of fashion, by being themselves. That\u2019s where discovery will always lie: In the suggestions of actual human beings. Divisions by genre, format, or mood may be arbitrary. Individual people never are."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s new streaming music service will not arrive until June 30, but the company has already upset independent record companies because of its proposed licensing terms.\nThe new service, Apple Music, includes downloads for sale and a $10-a-month subscription streaming feature along the lines of Spotify or Rhapsody. Apple has said thatat least 71.5 percentof the revenue from the service will be paid out in royalties, but labels and music publishers will not be paid during a three-month trial \u2014 a deal that major record companies have apparently agreed to but one that has proved unpalatable to many smaller ones.\nOn Wednesday, Beggars Group, one of the world\u2019s largest indie labels, whose acts include Adele, Vampire Weekend and Thom Yorke of Radiohead,posted a statementsaying that, while it considered Apple \u201ca wonderful partner for the last decade,\u201d it was puzzled by the lack of royalty payments during the trial. \u201cWe struggle to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple\u2019s customer acquisition costs,\u201d the statement said.\nApple declined to comment.\nSince Apple\u2019s new service was unveiled last week, others in the independent sector have openly questioned its proposed licensing terms. While the 71.5 percent rate that Apple has offered narrowly exceeds the 70 percent that is standard on many such services, label executives say they worry that the loss of streaming income from a new release that comes out during Apple\u2019s trial could be devastating.\nThe Association of Independent Music, a trade group in Britain,said this weekthat the Apple deal \u201cdoes not meet a standard of commercial fairness that we can endorse,\u201d while the group\u2019s counterpart in the United States, the American Association of Independent Music, hasadvised its members, \u201cplease do not feel rushed to sign Apple\u2019s current offer.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Pim Koeslag designs and fabricates some of the world\u2019s most complicated mechanical timepieces. Especially ambitious is his Grand Tourbillon Minute Repeater, created for Ateliers deMonaco, a watch company he helped start. When I visited his bright, sunlit factory in Geneva in May, he opened a refrigerator-size safe to show me one of them.\n\u201cIf you want to go for the real complex stuff,\u201d he said, \u201chere it is.\u201d The watch, a gorgeous chunk of white gold, includes more than 400 painstakingly machined, polished and hand-assembled parts. One of them is a circular metal gong, struck by small hammers that mark the time with two-tone melodies. The watch\u2019s mechanisms \u2014 including its \u201cbalance wheel,\u201d whose oscillation is visible through an opening in the watch face \u2014 are so precise that the device loses or gains only two seconds a day. The Grand Tourbillon Minute Repeater sells for just over $200,000, and Koeslag has made just eight of them.\n\u201cA Prince of Qatar has bought three already,\u201d said Koeslag, a mannerly blond man who wore a trim pinstriped suit. \u201cVery special watches, for very special people.\u201d On the factory floor behind us, a dozen white-coated women were piecing together other watches that Koeslag has designed for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, a midrange watch brand. These will sell for as much as $30,000. One woman peered into a microscope as she carefully wielded a long, thin needle to apply a drop of pink oil, before setting a tiny pin in place. This is the tradition that Koeslag is selling to his customers: the patient Swiss art of manufacturing complex, handmade mechanisms.\nLast fall, however, Koeslag set off on a very different, decidedly 21st-century project: a smartwatch. In response to Apple\u2019s plans to introduce a high-tech watch this year, the chief executive of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, Peter Stas, decided the company would produce its own. It would not be a minicomputer with a screen, like Apple\u2019s. Instead, it would combine the functions of a Fitbit, a device that tracks physical activity, with a traditional Swiss timepiece, a $1,200 entry-level Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watch. A Silicon Valley company would produce the tiny sensors that count steps and measure sleep cycles, and this information would be transmitted to a phone through a Bluetooth connection. The phone would also control the watch \u2014 resetting its hands in different time zones, for example. From the outside, the watch wouldn\u2019t look \u201csmart\u201d at all, but it would be packed with electronics. Koeslag\u2019s job was to bring to life this chimera of Swiss engineering and Silicon Valley wizardry.\nKoeslag faced a significant problem, though: He had never worked with chips and sensors before. He didn\u2019t even own a soldering iron. Swiss watchmakers don\u2019t need them; their devices are put together with screws and screwdrivers.\nHe led me to a large microscope and placed one of the chip sets under it. When the image appeared on a large computer screen, he zoomed in on the Bluetooth antenna, which looked like a dark, square block. Getting that into the right spot caused him a great deal of trouble, he said.\n\u201cUnder the microscope, we actually welded it on, by hand,\u201d he said. To install it properly, he sought advice from an associate at a technology company. \u201cI said, \u2018I have to place this big antenna, which way do I put it?\u2019\u2009\u201d The technician told him it couldn\u2019t be done manually; technology companies use robots to fix in place components that require that kind of precision. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll see.\u2019\u2009\u201d He had to shave the tip of his soldering iron down to a fine point to use it successfully.\nBy January, he finally had a prototype working well, just in time to show it off at Baselworld, the annual Swiss jewelers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 fair. Watch designers typically boast about their latest \u201ccomplications,\u201d clever ways of creating gear work to power new features, like calendars or extra dials. This year, though, the chatter at Basel kept coming nervously back to the Apple smartwatch. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant was producing its enhanced watch, and a few Swiss companies were announcing similar plans. But what did this trend mean for the industry? Should they move into smartwatches? Adding chips might help these watchmakers ride the high-tech wave, but it also risked eroding what made them special.\nThe prospect made Koeslag jittery. The night before the show, he wore his smartwatch to bed. It tracked his sleep patterns. \u201cI was so stressed I woke up eight times,\u201d he said. His deep sleep totaled just 25 minutes. Many observers had predicted that Apple would spell trouble for Swiss watchmakers, and now Koeslag had some personal data to prove it.\nSmartwatches have beenaround for years, but none have received as much attention as the Apple Watch. Much of the allure, of course, was Apple\u2019s famously elegant design. It was recognizably a watch, complete with a crown that controlled on-screen apps, but it had Apple\u2019s distinctive aesthetic, with its minimal lines and sleek curves; the watch is a smaller version of an iPhone, essentially.\nVery few companies can turn out such consistently glossy electronics, because few sell enough of their devices to justify the automated processes that keep quality high and prices relatively affordable. For example, to achieve the satiny finish on the bodies of the Apple Watch Sport, the company uses robotized nozzles to blast the aluminum surface with microscopic beads of zirconia. \u201cNo company in the world is finishing and anodizing to Apple\u2019s level,\u201d the product designer Greg Koenig has written. The company\u2019s design prowess rests in part on its mastery of high-volume operations like this.\nSwiss watchmaking emerged from a radically different background, one rooted in meticulous manual labor. The industry got its start in the 16th century after John Calvin persuaded the City Council in Geneva to impose sumptuary laws banning jewelry, and the city\u2019s skilled jewelers joined forces with the makers of pocket watches instead. Later, French Catholics chased Protestant Huguenots out of their country; many of these French exiles happened to be watchmakers, and they settled in Switzerland. In the mountains of the Jura region, they encountered local farmers who spent half the year indoors and idle and who turned out to be extremely patient and detail-oriented. The \u00e9migr\u00e9s hired them to spend their winters hand-polishing tiny metal components for the \u201cmovements,\u201d the watch\u2019s spring-driven inner workings.\nBy the 20th century, Swiss watches had become famous for their reliability and complexity. They are also marvels of energy efficiency, because dozens or even hundreds of components depend on tiny wound springs for power. Each new \u201ccomplication\u201d \u2014 say, a calendar that advances the date with a satisfying snap at midnight \u2014 demanded a new set of gears and more energy, thus requiring ever more clever compensations. A mechanical watch is both a dance with and a fight against physics.\nIn the early 1970s, centuries of tradition were overturned by an upstart technology: quartz watches. In these, a battery\u2019s electricity causes a quartz crystal to vibrate at an extremely regular frequency, running a motor that turns the watch hands. The resulting timepiece is far more accurate and much cheaper than most mechanical watches. Swiss inventors actually helped pioneer this technology, but watchmakers regarded it as beneath them. A quartz watch might have only a few dozen parts, compared with hundreds in a mechanical one. Where was the challenge?\nWhen Swiss companies declined to make quartz devices, inexpensive Japanese watches from companies like Seiko became popular around the world. The \u201cquartz crisis\u201d killed off so many Swiss watchmakers that by the end of the 1970s, the number of workers in the industry had shrunk to 30,000 from 90,000. Brands in existence for centuries vanished in a puff of disruption.\nIn the 1980s, Swiss companies came back. Swatch introduced a line of inexpensive quartz watches, and other Swiss companies followed its lead. In the 1990s, as Ryan Raffaelli, a Harvard business professor who has studied the Swiss industry, has written, Swiss watchmakers hit on an even more profitable strategy: marketing their expensive mechanical watches as luxury items steeped in history. If you wanted to hand something down to your children, the sales pitch went, spend thousands of dollars on a Rolex or, at the very least, several hundred on a quartz watch with elegant Swiss design. Sales of Swiss watches rebounded; exports have more than doubled since 2000, rising even in the years after the economic meltdown.\nThese days, nobody needs a watch to know the time. Time is all around us, displayed on every computer, phone and microwave oven. The Swiss watchmakers realize this. They market their mechanical watches as not only accurate but also deeply symbolic. For those willing to spend $30,000, a traditional Swiss watch marks its owner as a man or woman who appreciates quality, artistry and ingenuity (and, of course, as a wealthy and conspicuous consumer). Wearing a mechanical watch today makes an explicitly antidigital statement, embracing the long pedigree of a device that predates not only computers but electricity itself. It tells the time but is timeless. \u201cA mechanical watch,\u201d Jean-Claude Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, said, \u201cis a piece of eternity in a box.\u201d\nIs the smartwatch the next \u201cquartz crisis\u201d? Few Swiss executives think smartwatches will kill off the high-end market. Nobody, they argue, who spends $50,000 on a piece of handmade eternity will regard an Apple Watch as a substitute. But luxury brands also sell a great many less-expensive quartz watches, and this is where the Apple Watch poses a threat.\n\u201cIf a young man, young woman, is 25 years old, would they rather put 1,200 Swiss francs\u201d \u2014 about $1,300 \u2014 \u201cfor a watch that tells you what time it is and the date, or will they buy, for only $800, a watch that tells you everything?\u201d Biver said. \u201cFor me there is no doubt we will have a very tough competition in the $1,200 price segment.\u201d\nFor Switzerland to compete with Silicon Valley, it needed to answer a question that was no longer just stylistic or technical but existential. Raffaelli said, \u201cWhat does it mean to be a watchmaker in a digital world?\u201d\nPeter Stas beganpondering that question two years ago. A Dutch \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Switzerland, Stas and his wife, Aletta, founded Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant in 1988 to make the sort of midlevel quartz timepieces now threatened by Apple. Their watches retail for $1,000 and more: \u201cClassical, accessible luxury,\u201d he called them as he sat in his office, surrounded by models of his mahogany motorboat.\nAt first, Stas considered making a smartwatch through and through \u2014 LCD screen, apps, Google\u2019s free operating system for wearable devices. He consulted a Portuguese design team but couldn\u2019t find a concept he liked. One crucial issue was power. Watches can accommodate only very small batteries, so users would have to charge their watches every night. (This has been a complaint leveled against the Apple Watch.) The energy-hungry display would be turned off most of the time and activated with a flick of the wrist, but the gesture isn\u2019t always successful. (Another complaint about Apple\u2019s watch: You turn your wrist to check the time, and the screen remains dark.) Like most watchmakers, Stas wanted his quartz watches to run for two years on a single battery.\nA subtler problem was the screen shape. In 2013, the only LCDs available to him were rectangular. \u201cAnd in the watch industry,\u201d Stas told me, \u201cwe know actually that square screens don\u2019t sell to men.\u201d\nSo if a screen-based smartwatch wasn\u2019t viable, he wondered, was there another alternative? Stas knew that \u201cactivity tracker\u201d wristbands were popular. A watch is inherently a wristband, albeit a prettier one. After hunting online for suitable electronics to work with, Stas found Fullpower Technologies, a company in Santa Cruz, Calif., that makes the sensors and firmware in activity-trackers built by companies like Nike. He contacted Philippe Kahn, the chief executive, who told Stas that Fullpower\u2019s technology could run for two years on one watch battery. Better yet, Kahn could make the phone software for Stas. It would analyze activity and deep-sleep patterns, so the watch\u2019s alarm could go off at precisely the least disruptive time to wake its wearer.\nThe prospect of a partnership excited Stas. Kahn too: He detested the environmental waste of many disposable electronics and loved the idea of building sensors into a watch sufficiently expensive that it would be regarded as an heirloom. Watches are easy to open and repair, unlike many of today\u2019s electronics. When Fullpower develops new sensors a few years from now, owners can have their Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watches upgraded with better electronics.\n\u201cThe Swiss watch industry sells tens of millions of watches a year, and they are wearable objects that people tend to keep,\u201d Kahn told me. \u201cI\u2019m a dad, and I\u2019ve got kids, and I don\u2019t want to leave a Kleenex world where nothing\u2019s worth fixing and everything gets thrown away.\u201d\nIn pursuing an analog design, they hit upon an intriguing concept. Using the phone app, the owner can set an activity goal, like 8,000 steps for a day. Then the watch displays how close you are to meeting it, using the hand on a small, secondary dial: At 2,000 steps, for example, the hand would point to 3 o\u2019clock, signifying 25 percent. Eventually, the dial could quantify all sorts of data: How full is your inbox? How close is your friend to arriving at the restaurant? To Ronnie Bernheim, co-owner (with his brother Andr\u00e9) of the watchmaker Mondaine, which is licensing some of Stas\u2019s and Koeslag\u2019s technology, this approach is superior to the blunt accuracy of a screen. A watch hand is \u201cglanceable,\u201d as he puts it, because it\u2019s only semi-accurate; we peek at an analog wall clock to get a general sense of the time of day, not a precise one.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not interested if it\u2019s 23 percent or 27 percent.\u201d Bernheim said. \u201cYou only want to know \u2018Do I have to move or have I already done pretty good?\u2019\u2009\u201d (The French watchmaker Withings began selling a cheaper watch with similar capabilities this spring.)\nWhen Koeslag handed me a Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant smartwatch to try on, it had a pleasantly hefty feel. It didn\u2019t seem like a smartwatch at all; there was nothing visibly electronic about it. I loved it. I\u2019m a fan of gadgets and even wore early, clunky smartwatches with LCD screens able to display texts and tweets. But Koeslag\u2019s stylish analog design felt like a steampunk midpoint, the best of both domains: a device that delivered modern types of information, with the romance of old-fashioned dials.\nBernheim and Stas are diplomatic about the Apple Watch. \u201cWe try to be nice,\u201d Stas said. But he thinks its limitations \u2014 especially the hassle of charging it every night \u2014 will deter some would-be owners. \u201cThere will be plenty of people who are going to buy them. I think the real question will be in three months, five months, if people are still going to wear them.\u201d\nHe is even more dubious that any Silicon Valley company could create something with aesthetics lovely enough to penetrate the European luxury market. \u201cWe have to be very clear here,\u201d he told me, leaning back on his black chaise longue. \u201cLuxury business is coming either from Paris, or it\u2019s coming from Italy, and watches are coming from Switzerland. They\u2019re not coming from the U.S.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSilicon Valley \u2014 my God, what they\u2019re wearing and everything! They really don\u2019t have this culture of refinement. We bring something else to the story.\u201d\nA\u2009traditional watchwith hidden electronics is one solution to the smartwatch challenge. Montblanc, the European luxury-goods brand, has another, more unusual idea.\nWhen I visited Alexander Schmiedt, who runs the company\u2019s watch business, in the village of Villeret, he handed me a smartwatch prototype. The actual timepiece is entirely mechanical, from Montblanc\u2019s \u201cTimeWalker\u201d line of watches. It contains no circuitry.\nInstead, the computerized parts are in the wristband. This \u201ce-Strap\u201d features a small rubber module that sits on the wrist\u2019s underside. The module has an inch-and-a-half touch-screen, where white text and images alert the wearer to incoming calls, SMS messages, emails and social-media messages. The screen can only display 16 characters at a time, so reading a message means swiping back and forth across it. Internal activity sensors track and send data to your phone. (The module I saw was a nonworking mock-up.) Watch and e-Strap together will sell for roughly $5,000.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the technology inside the watch,\u201d Schmiedt said as he strapped on the TimeWalker, a handsome brushed-stainless-steel body whose black-and-red face was encircled by a black ceramic ring. \u201cIt would mean that after a predetermined while, the watch itself would become outdated.\u201d\nAt Montblanc, he said, the engineers tell a story to illustrate the perils of high-tech obsolescence: At graduations in the 1990s, students receive gifts from their parents \u2014 some the latest mobile phone, others a Montblanc fountain pen. Decades later, a phone from the \u201990s is a useless relic. But the Montblanc pen is as good as ever; indeed, the years have imparted character. \u201cIt has a meaning, it has little scratches,\u201d Schmiedt said. \u201cIf I ever scratch up a watch, or \u2014 I don\u2019t know, my child maybe dropped it \u2014 it\u2019s a mark of life.\u201d Our electronics are much less tolerant of faults, he noted, grinning as he held up his own iPhone, whose screen was spider-webbed with cracks.\nDividing the Montblanc smartwatch into two components may make it less intrusive, Schmiedt believes, because the e-Strap\u2019s screen usually faces away from the wearer. \u201cYou don\u2019t always have it in your sight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can choose when you want to see it.\u201d The OLED screen preserves battery life, too. Montblanc promises five days before the device needs charging.\nSchmiedt is enthusiastic about the e-Strap, of course. But looking at this Janus device \u2014 analog and digital faces on opposing sides \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help thinking that it would be harder for Montblanc to strike a balance between smartwatch and mechanical device than for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant or Mondaine. The latter are younger companies, and Mondaine primarily sells affordable quartz watches. Montblanc, however, is trying to safeguard a much older brand name: In 2007, it bought Minerva, a storied Swiss watchmaker founded in 1858. Famous for producing deeply complex movements beloved by collectors, Minerva foundered during the quartz crisis. When Schmiedt walked into the Minerva factory for the first time, it had a mere 20 workers, fashioning watches using century-old tools.\n\u201cYou had really this living heritage, like a sleeping beauty, as if the thing had been stopped in time,\u201d he told me.\nWhen I visited that factory, it was alive with quiet, careful activity. In one room, a line of expert watchmakers polished individual pieces. One man in a white coat was hunched over an elongated figure eight of stainless steel, which he would spend a week shaping; next to him, a woman used a 40x magnification microscope and color-coded emery boards to etch 45-degree beveled edges into a half-inch-long \u201cbridge.\u201d Across the room sat a master watchmaker with tattoos down his left arm and on his elbow. His job was to assemble the watch and ensure it worked, then to disassemble it, recleaning and reoiling the parts before putting it back together one final time. On the wall was pinned one of the oldest types of technology in the building: the dried stalk of a local flower. It\u2019s used, I was told, to polish brass parts to a luminous glow.\nAt Basel this year,Edouard Meylan, chief executive of the high-end watchmaker H. Moser, issued a news release claiming that he, too, would be introducing a smartwatch. But at the Basel fair, he displayed a traditional mechanical timepiece \u2014 a \u201cperpetual calendar\u201d with bold dials and a meter showing how much energy the spring has left in it. In a promotional video, H. Moser called it \u201cthe original smartwatch,\u201d joking that even \u201cour grandmother could use it.\u201d The message was clear: Watches are already smart.\nWhen I spoke to Meylan, he was even more direct. Making smartwatches is a mistake, he argued, particularly for elite brands. To be sure, he said \u2014 as many of his peers did \u2014 the Apple Watch will probably be successful. \u201cWith the right battery, eventually it\u2019ll become something very useful that I will probably wear myself,\u201d he said. But he considers putting smartwatch technology inside a mechanical Swiss timepiece to be brand suicide. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a gimmick,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in our range.\u201d His company, like Montblanc and Ateliers deMonaco, sells watches that cost tens of thousands of dollars. They shouldn\u2019t be creating \u201csome kind of monsters that are a merger of a mobile phone and an actually beautiful mechanical watch.\u201d\nOnce a timepiece becomes a computer, what should itnotdo? Should there be limits? Does watchness become only a trivial part of a smartwatch\u2019s function? \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit the scary thing,\u201d says Pim Koeslag of his work at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant. \u201cOnce you get into it, you see that this is only the beginning of the beginning.\u201d There\u2019s no GPS in his smartwatch now, but he could imagine putting it in. \u201cYou could put in cameras or weather stations or whatever. The only limit is imagination.\u201d\nTAG Heuer is one high-end brand that plans to produce what Silicon Valley might recognize as a smartwatch: a digital version of the TAG Heuer Carrera. TAG Heuer\u2019s engineers will design the physical case, but everything else will come from technology partners. Intel will make the touch screen and the electronics; Google will provide Android Wear software. The goal is to release something by the end of this year that can compete with Apple on the apps front while also being unmistakably Swiss.\n\u201cAt two meters distance, you will not know, \u2018Is this guy wearing a TAG Heuer Carrera connected or is this guy wearing a chronograph Carrera normal?\u2019\u2009\u201d said Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, when I visited his office in Nyon. \u201cThat will give us the watchmaking appeal, which the computer guys at Apple, Samsung don\u2019t have.\u201d\nBiver is a famously voluble, opinionated figure, prone to grand statements and poetic riffs on the beauty of timepieces. He wears, and occasionally caresses, a chunky watch from Hublot (another luxury brand that he oversees). He says the design of the Apple Watch is \u201cnot very sexy.\u201d\n\u201cThere is not enough emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a reduction of the phone for the wrist.\u201d\nYet it\u2019s fair to ask how \u201cSwiss\u201d his prospective watch will really be. As several observers told me, it\u2019s just as much an Intel-and-Google watch. \u201cWhere is your value-add?\u201d asks Amy Glasmeier, an M.I.T. professor who has written about the watch industry. Swiss watchmakers, she adds, will need to create their own high-tech intellectual property in smartwatches. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat they\u2019ve got is just the use of their name. It\u2019s not the use of their human capital.\u201d Raffaelli, the Harvard professor, is a bit more sanguine. He says that the Swiss watchmakers may promote their preindustrial history, but they\u2019ve long been experts at innovating. All those mechanical features \u2014 perpetual calendars, self-winding mechanisms \u2014 were the transformative high tech of their day. The clock itself was a first step toward the \u201cquantified self,\u201d making visible information that was previously hidden, your precise progress through the day.\nEven if the Swiss smartwatch never takes off, many of the watch executives I spoke with said that the Apple Watch might be good for sales of high-end mechanical watches. Why? Because a generation of Americans has grown up without the habit of wearing a watch. Apple is now spending millions to convince younger consumers \u2014 those who coordinate their lives not by looking at a wristwatch, but with \u201cI\u2019m on my way!\u201d text messages and shared Google Calendar events \u2014 that a watch can be useful and fashionable again. \u201cMany young people who would never wear something on their wrist, they will start wearing something on their wrist, which is the connected watch,\u201d Biver said. Having acquired the habit of glancing down, maybe they\u2019ll eventually decide they want to look at an older sort of device instead \u2014 a machine that, in a sense, is outside time."

        "title": "Spotify Wants Listeners to Break Down Music Barriers",
        "fulltext": "In the last few weeks, my two children, ages 4 and 2, have suddenly become obsessed with Simon and Garfunkel.\nAt their insistence, the 1960s folk duo is the only music we listen to during car rides. My son, the older child, can recite several lines of \u201cThe Sound of Silence,\u201d a single that hit the pop charts nearly half a century before he was born. Their interest in 1960s-era folk came on the heels of their deep dive into Maroon 5, the annoyingly catchy pop group; a monthslong mania for Michael Jackson; and an intermittent passion for a staggering range of singles from every era and genre.\nTheir cultural acumen is entirely the product of technology \u2014 in particular, being introduced to new artists through Spotify, the world\u2019s largest subscription music-streaming service. According to executives at Spotify, my children offer a peek at the future of music consumption. Spotify, which has just introduced a new version of its app, says that because online streaming services let us call up and listen to anything we like, and because its curated playlists push us toward new stuff, we are all increasingly escaping rigid genres.\nThat trend looks sure to accelerate as streaming becomes ubiquitous. At itsannual developer conferenceon Monday,Apple is expected to unveil a streaming music servicebased on its acquisition of Beats, the company co-founded by the music impresarios Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, and best known for its headphones.\nThere\u2019s alsoPandora, the radio service that claims nearly 80 million listeners, and Rhapsody, a streaming service that offers only a paid version, which it recently said has about 2.5 million users. Rdio, another streaming service, recently introduced a plan that goes for $4 a month, less than the standard $10 price. And there\u2019s Tidal,a much-mockednew servicefounded by Jay Z and his blue-chip friends.\nGoogle and Amazon both offer music plans, too, and Google\u2019s subsidiary YouTube, which is in many ways the world\u2019s largest jukebox,announced an ad-free music video service last year.\nSpotify itself has about 60 million active users, 15 million of whom pay $10 per month for an ad-free premium version. On average, the company said, the service exposes each of these listeners to one new artist every day. That is making listeners less beholden to music of certain styles and eras. Instead, many of us will try anything, just because we can easily sample it online.\nSpotify is betting that fixed musical genres will fade away. Inits new versionrolling out to iPhone users, the company has expanded its effort to program for moods and activities rather than merely certain kinds of musical tastes.\n\u201cWhat we want to do is make Spotify more of a ritual,\u201d said Shiva Rajaraman, the company\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cYou\u2019ll begin to use it for a set of habits, and we will start to feed content for every slot in your day.\u201d\nThe app uses a variety of computerized filters to personalize its recommendations, but in general, Spotify is betting on a wider palate. To achieve its goal of programming your entire day, Spotify has to show there\u2019s a lot more to music than the narrow band of songs you think you like; instead, there are many tracks and artists that you may have never considered, but that may match a particular moment or activity the app thinks you\u2019re likely to be doing, from waking up to working to exercising. The company said its data supports this premise: playlists based on moods and activities \u2014 like \u201crunning,\u201d \u201cfocus\u201d and \u201cparty,\u201d which contain songs that may cross many genres \u2014 are just as popular as those for specific genres like rock, pop and hip-hop.\nIf Spotify is right about our increasing willingness to try new stuff \u2014 and critics who follow the pop charts said it may be \u2014 the trend could upend how we think about music.\nUntil recently, because of the narrowcasting ethos of terrestrial radio, music was fiercely segregated by genre. In an era less bound by those niches and instead dominated by an online free-for-all, we may discover new artists more quickly than in the past \u2014 though, on the other side of the coin, we may also develop less fierce attachments to certain artists, flitting, as my children do, between anything and everything. For better or worse, streaming services may turn us into cultural nomads.\nSpotify\u2019s effort to program beyond genres is also a canny bit of salesmanship. The company\u2019s biggest hurdle may not be competing services but rather artists, many of whom have been vociferous about their disappointment with the economics of streaming music. Last year, Taylor Swift \u2014 whose nimble crossing from country to pop offers perhaps the clearest proof of Spotify\u2019s argument that we are less bound by genres \u2014pulled her music from Spotify.\n\u201cI think this is a very focused campaign to try to prove to the industry that they are artist-friendly, and that they are helping to discover new artists,\u201d said Jeffrey Rabhan, chair of theClive Davis Institute of Recorded Musicat New York University.\nAfter using Spotify\u2019s new app for a couple weeks, the company\u2019s argument sounded more plausible to me. By suggesting tracks based on my activities and parts of the day, I found the service exposed me to music out of my comfort zone. One early morning, the app suggested \u201cEpic Uplifting Sunrise,\u201d a playlist that consists of soaringpost-rockinstrumentalists, including the Icelandic band Sigur R\u00f3s. I\u2019ve previously found Sigur R\u00f3s to be about as pleasant asairport security, but something about listening in the morning, just before coffee, seemed to register. I got into it; it felt uplifting and, indeed, epic, just as promised. I played the playlist every morning for three days, and by the fourth day I was recommending post-rock to my wife.\nChris Molanphy, a pop critic and pop chart analyst who writes for Slate and National Public Radio, told me Spotify\u2019s power to expose listeners to new songs resonates beyond the service itself. The Billboard charts now count plays on Spotify and YouTube in their calculation of the country\u2019s top hits. Programmers for radio stations also look at these services to decide what to add to their rotations.\nAs a result, Mr. Molanphy said, Internet plays are pushing quirky new acts to the top of the charts faster than ever. He pointed to Gotye\u2019s \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know,\u201d an unusual hit that catapulted to the top in 2012; \u201cRoyals,\u201d by the New Zealand teenager Lorde, which was an early online hit before it topped the charts in 2013; and Hozier\u2019s \u201cTake Me to Church,\u201d which dominated radio last year.\n\u201cThese were all songs that were different from what radio was playing, and radio tends to be a homogeneous medium,\u201d Mr. Molanphy said.\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that many of the new artists tend to be one-hit wonders; in fact, 2014 was one of theworst-recorded years for follow-up hits. \u201cThere\u2019s just far less loyalty, and many artists are having a hard time following up on their hits,\u201d Mr. Molanphy said \u2014 Taylor Swift being the sole notable exception.\nStreaming services have bred a musical culture that more closely resembles a cocktail buffet than a sit-down dinner: We sample widely, and when we find something we like we binge, but we don\u2019t necessarily stick around to savor. I expect that soon my children will forget about Paul Simon. My son is already asking about Dylan."

        "title": "Apple Music Makes Debut With D.J. Carrying the Flag",
        "fulltext": "\u201cInto the unknown we go,\u201d the D. J. Zane Lowe said just after noon on Tuesday, as he began his first show onBeats 1, the Internet radio station that is a big feature of Apple\u2019s new music service.\nMany in the music industry may have been thinking the same thing. The new service, Apple Music, is the most thorough change to the company\u2019s audio offerings since it introduced the iTunes store in 2003, a move that legitimized a nascent digital market and eventually led to a computer manufacturer becoming the world\u2019s largest retailer of music.\nAs Apple Music opened on Tuesday \u2014 most listeners found it as part of an update of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system \u2014 much of the attention turned to Beats 1, a live radio feed that in some ways functions as marketing for the entire service. Led by Mr. Lowe, who was born in New Zealand and became a top announcer on the BBC station Radio 1, Beats 1 is in some ways an old-fashioned radio station, with D. J.s, promotional recordings \u2014 \u201ccarts,\u201d as they are in industry parlance, after the tape cartridges they used to fit on \u2014 and teases about new songs.\nAfter warming up with atmospheric tracks by Brian Eno, Mr. Lowe opened his first show with the song \u201cCity\u201d by Spring King, a little-known alternative band from Manchester, England. Then came Beck, the English producer Jamie XX, the English rapper Skepta and AC/DC, a playlist that in some ways telegraphed Mr. Lowe\u2019s musical approach. He is dedicated to brand-new rock and hip-hop music and isn\u2019t afraid to take chances on the kinds of obscure records that most commercial American radio stations would normally consider too risky to play.\nEven Spring King seemed surprised by Mr. Lowe\u2019s choice. \u201cYo @zanelowe are you kidding?!!?!? you just spun our tune! you\u2019re an absolute legend!!\u201dthe band tweetedshortly after he played its song.\nDifferent music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.\nBut as part of Apple\u2019s new service, the station played plenty of songs that were exclusive to it, or that highlight its catalog. AC/DC,long a holdout to streaming services, joined Apple Music \u2014 along with Spotify, Rhapsody and others \u2014 only on Tuesday. And Mr. Lowe played Pharrell Williams\u2019s new song, \u201cFreedom,\u201d a track that, for now at least, can be heard only through Apple.\nMr. Lowe has a kinetic style that is derived partly from hip-hop producers, and for American listeners it can come across as a slick and hyperactive version of a college-radio announcer who is eager to play all the coolest new tracks. (Although few college D.J.s have Mr. Lowe\u2019s clout in music: On Tuesday, he teased listeners to tune in the next day for his interview with Eminem.\n\u201cIf you have ever had an inkling that you would enjoy Princeton\u2019s very eclectic WPRB, but don\u2019t have the time to tune in, or enough patience once you get there, it\u2019s a more managed version of that experience,\u201d said Sean Ross, a radio analyst with Edison Research who pays close attention to station playlists. \u201cBut I imagine somebody in college radio right now saying, \u2018Sheesh, I played Spring King ages ago.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nApple Music is competing directly with a range of online streaming music outlets. Like Spotify, it is offering $10 monthly subscriptions that let people stream any song they choose out of a catalog of tens of millions. Like SoundCloud, it lets artists upload brand new or unofficial tracks, and like Pandora, it offers Internet radio feeds that cater to a user\u2019s tastes.\nThe new service carries the hopes as well as the worries of the music business. If Apple Music is successful \u2014 some analysts say they believe it can attractas many as 100 million subscribers\u2014 it could deliver billions of dollars in revenue to the music industry and establish streaming music as a stable business. But at that same time, its embrace of streaming may hasten the demise of downloads, which are a vital source of income for the music business but over the last couple of years havebegun to fall.\nApple did not release information on Tuesday about how many people had downloaded the new operating system or were tuning in to Beats 1. But Mr. Lowe\u2019s Twitter feed was full of messages from listeners from around the world \u2014 South Africa, Germany, France, the United States, England, Australia \u2014 which added to the excitement of the show\u2019s debut and also demonstrated Apple\u2019s enormous reach.\n\u201cMy name is Zane Lowe,\u201d he announced near the beginning of his show. \u201cI come from Auckland, New Zealand, and I\u2019m proud to be here to play music for the entire world.\u201d"
