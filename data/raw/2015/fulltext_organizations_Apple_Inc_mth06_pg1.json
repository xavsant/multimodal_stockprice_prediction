        "fulltext": "In the post-Snowden era, tech companies are increasingly being rated not only for the quality of their gadgets and services, but also for how they handle government requests for customer data. In the Electronic Frontier\n                                        Foundation\u2019s annual report on data collection practices, tech companies like Yahoo, Apple and Adobe earned top marks, while WhatsApp and AT&T came in last.\nThereport this week from the E.F.F., a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights, evaluated companies based on factors including their\n                                        transparency to consumers about data requests and data retention, as well as their public positions on so-called back doors that grant government agencies access to customer data.\nApple, Adobe, Yahoo, Dropbox and Sonic.net were among those that scored highly. AT&T and WhatsApp, which earned the lowest marks, with one out of five stars, did not immediately have comments. Verizon Communications,\n                                        which earned two stars in the report (down from four stars last year when the report had slightly different criteria) declined to comment.\nThe wide-ranging nature of government surveillance programs, many of which have been revealed by documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, put pressure on tech companies\n                                        to be more proactive about sharing their data collection and disclosure practices.\nMost tech companies have published so-calledtransparency reportsdetailing the number of requests they receive from\n                                        government agencies, while also describing the types of data they collect and share.

        "title": "Taylor Swift Scuffle Aside, Apple\u2019s New Music Service Is Expected to Thrive",
        "fulltext": "When the pop music star Taylor Swift publicly criticized Apple\u2019s royalty payment plans recently, government regulators that had been investigating the company for various other reasons might have thought: Get in line.\nIn the last few years, Apple has become the most valuable company in the world as well as one of the most scrutinized. Officials in Europe and the United States are looking into Apple\u2019s deals with music labels for possible antitrust violations.\nBut as Apple prepares to start its long-anticipated subscription streaming music service on Tuesday, few marketing experts expect the scuffle with Ms. Swift to leave any scars. Instead, they think it turned out to be remarkably good publicity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the episode has damaged their brand at all,\u201d said Jordan Cohen, the chief marketing officer of Fluent, a consumer marketing firm. \u201cMore than anything, it served to shine a huge spotlight on its newest offering with a week to go until launch.\u201d\nThe new Apple Music service has the potential over the next two years to draw 100 million subscribers, according to Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research. That would more than double the combined 41 million paid subscriptions to all of the current music streaming services last year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group in London, estimates.\nSkating past controversy has become an important skill for Apple in recent years, and the company\u2019s quick response to Ms. Swift\u2019s public letter offers a window into how the Silicon Valley giant responds to criticism.\nAs long as iPhones and Macs are flying off the shelves, analysts and marketing experts say, Apple has little reason to listen to its critics \u2014 except when they are the rare few like Ms. Swift that can have a direct impact on its sales.\n\u201cWhat she says is gold, and at this point she has managed to attain so much brand power that it\u2019s hard for even companies like Apple to not pay attention,\u201d said Erik Ashdown a founder of Indiloop, a music creation service.\nIn her open letter, titled \u201cTo Apple, Love Taylor,\u201d Ms. Swift said she was withholding her latest album from Apple Music because artists like her were unhappy with the company\u2019s decision to skip paying royalties to musicians during the three-month free trial of the new music service.\nWithin a day, Apple\u2019s head of online services, Eddy Cue, said on his Twitter account that musicians would be paid during the three-month trial. \u201cWe hear you @taylorswift13 and indie artists. Love, Apple,\u201d hewrote.\nGovernment regulators might be chagrined to realize that a 25-year-old musician had better luck curbing Apple\u2019s behavior than they have had.\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., continues to fight afederal judge\u2019s 2013 decisionthat it conspired with book publishers to raise e-book prices. Apple continues to appeal the decision, and it has also beenresistant to cooperatingwith a lawyer that the court appointed to monitor its operations to ensure compliance with antitrust laws.\nMore recently, in Europe and the United States, antitrust regulators openedinvestigations into Apple Music. They are trying to find out whether Apple pressured music labels \u2014 or whether labels conspired with Apple and one another \u2014 to withdraw support for popular \u201cfreemium\u201d services offered by companies like Spotify in favor of Apple\u2019s paid music subscriptions.\nSo far, the antitrust investigations into Apple Music have not produced evidence of collusion. This month, the Universal Music Groupsaidin a letter to the state attorneys general of New York and Connecticut that it had no agreements with Apple that would impede the availability of free or ad-supported services.\nBut if consumers are weighing in with their wallets, they have shown complete indifference to the regulatory issues. In the fiscal second quarter, sales of iPhones were up 40 percent year over year, and sales of Mac computers were up 10 percent year over year. The company has accumulated more than $193.5 billion in cash.\n\u201cWhen you think Apple, you think very easy to use and great experience,\u201d said Greg Portell, a partner of A. T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm. \u201cIf you have product quality issues, that\u2019s when things start to stumble.\u201d\nBut Apple has in fact had product missteps in recent years. TheiPhonetook a hit in 2010 when a design flaw on the iPhone 4 \u2014 called Antennagate by the tech press \u2014 caused cellphone reception to be lost for some users when the handset was firmly gripped.\nThe long-term impact? No harm done yet. In fact, iPhone sales kept growing.\nOther Apple product imperfections have recently bubbled up. The releases of its latest software systems for mobile devices, iOS 8, and Mac computers, OS X, had problems. Bugs caused iPhones to lose a cellular signal and rendered their fingerprint sensors unusable, raising concerns that the company\u2019s quality control was slipping.\n\u201cThose issues were probably the first time where I frequently heard from friends and family and people who aren\u2019t in this industry \u2014 that they were recognizing, why is this crashing so much?\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst for Creative Strategies.\nApple is trying to address the issues. A beta, or early version, of its next mobile operating system, iOS 9, will be released in early July for curious consumers to try out before its official release this fall. Outsourcing the system testing to consumers will allow Apple to do a better job of stamping out bugs before the software gets widely used.\nIn tech, self-inflicted wounds have historically been worse than government rulings. In 2001, the Justice Department settled its antitrust suit against Microsoft \u2014 and the company kept right on growing. It wasn\u2019t until Microsoft badly misplayed the transition to mobile computing devices that its growth slowed, Mr. Bajarin said.\nThat is not to say Apple always ignores its critics. The company has publicly acknowledged that it should do better with workplace diversity. Also, in response to accusations of labor rights violations in overseas factories, run by other companies, that produce iPhones and iPads, Apple has deepened its involvement in factory audits, which include the creation of training programs to teach suppliers how to do a better job tracking worker hours.\nThe public reaction to Apple Music will be a test. One challenge in releasing Apple Music, music executives said, will be retaining the simple concept of the original iTunes store \u2014 every song cost 99 cents to download \u2014 which has helped turn it into the world\u2019s largest music retailer and a vital source of revenue for the industry.\nApple Music, on the other hand, combines a range of features that underscore how complex online music has become. It has a subscription streaming service like Spotify; a media platform that has been compared to SoundCloud, which lets people freely upload and stream any kind of audio; and radio features that will compete with Internet and satellite services like Pandora and Sirius XM.\n\u201cRight now they have such high brand equity that one or two stumbles isn\u2019t going to hurt them,\u201d said Mr. Portell of A. T. Kearney. \u201cIf they have more stumbles, that part of the brand starts to degrade.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Takes On a Market Full of Streaming Services",
        "fulltext": "When it comes to streaming music, isApplearriving too late or right on time?\nThe music industry is pondering that question as Apple prepares for an event in San Francisco on Monday at which it isexpected to announcethe most sweeping changes to its music offerings since it introduced the iTunes store 12 years ago and revolutionized the way songs were bought and sold.\nThe new features will include a subscription streaming plan tocompete with Spotify, as well as updates to the iTunes Radio service that will go up against both Pandora and traditional broadcasters, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nWith these changes, Apple is embracing streaming music, which has grown quickly over the last few years even as sales of downloads have dropped.\nYet Apple will be entering a market where others, including Spotify, Deezer and Rhapsody, have already taken root among some of the most active music consumers. Spotify, for example, the largest streaming service, started in 2008 and has signed up 60 million users around the world, 15 million of whom pay for monthly subscriptions.\nAt the same time, analysts say, Apple\u2019s sheer size and reach \u2014 it has sold over 700 million iPhones alone \u2014 gives the company an advantage over every other player, and may allow it to dominate a fast-growing market.\n\u201cApple is not too late, but they are certainly playing catch-up,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt\u2019s a crowded market, and they will have to find ways to set themselves apart.\u201d\nApple is said to still be haggling with record labels and music publishers over licensing terms, according to executives briefed on the talks. If those talks fail, Apple\u2019s announcement could potentially be changed or even postponed, these executives said, though they added that Apple has often completed such deals at the last minute in the past.\nNeither Apple nor the major record labels would comment.\nFor the music companies, the sticking points include how much Apple should pay with new features like far more extensive radio programming and a promotional tier in which artists can upload free content for their fans. The subscription streaming service will cost $10 a month, with free trial periods of perhaps two or three months, according to people briefed on the talks. A social networking component is also expected.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to launch just a Spotify competitor,\u201d said one major-label executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Apple candidly. \u201cThey want to launch an all-singing, all-dancing music experience.\u201d\nApple\u2019s service is expected to make downloads, streaming and radio all available in a redesigned version of Apple\u2019s music app. (A version of it is also expected to be available on Google\u2019s competing mobile platform, Android.)\nIn the app, customers would have access to their existing music libraries and would also be able to sign up for the new subscription service. That combination would give users a choice but has left music executives bracing for financial turbulence: Sales of downloads \u2014 still one of the labels\u2019 biggest sources of income \u2014 will inevitably drop when customers switch to subscriptions. Download sales around the world fell 8 percent in 2014 from the year before, while subscription services were up 39 percent in the same period, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group.\nThe radio features are said to include both a revamped version of iTunes Radio \u2014 the Pandora-like service that Apple introduced in 2013 \u2014 and a new set of \u201clinear\u201d programming that would more closely resemble a traditional radio station. Apple has signed up a range of music celebrities, like Drake and Pharrell Williams, to create playlists and host programs, and the company has also hired radio professionals like Zane Lowe, a former BBC D.J. and interviewer.\nAccording to music executives, Apple is negotiating for separate licenses for iTunes Radio and its new radio service, which is code-named \u201cBeats One.\u201d Separate licenses may point to highly different plans for the two radio services, these executives said. Among those planning the new service are Jimmy Iovine and Trent Reznor, who joined Apple through its $3 billion purchase last year of Beats and report to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s longtime iTunes boss.\nWhile music was a crucial part of Apple\u2019s resurgence under Steven P. Jobs, music sales have become an ever smaller part of the company\u2019s overall business. Analysts said that, even if the streaming service is successful, music is a marginal financial opportunity for the company. Last year music subscriptions around the world generated $1.6 billion in wholesale revenue for the recording industry; by comparison, Apple reported nearly $183 billion in total sales for its most recent fiscal year, which ended in September.\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of Apple\u2019s financials, a streaming service is inevitably going to be a rounding error,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\nBut within the music world, Apple\u2019s arrival is widely seen as the force that could take streaming into the mainstream. While the use of streaming services has grown quickly, music and technology executives alike have frequently complained that services like Spotify have been slow to take off with ordinary consumers.\nIn the United States, only 7.7 million people paid for streaming music subscriptions last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. That lags the performance of single companies like Sirius XM satellite radio, which has 27.7 million customers in the United States, and Netflix, which has 40.3 million paying United States subscribers.\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues for the streaming industry is that consumer understanding is still limited,\u201d said Hans-Holger Albrecht, the chief executive of Deezer, which has some six million paying subscribers around the world. \u201cWhen a company like Apple moves into this sector, it starts to educate consumers. It will lift the market potential.\u201d\nA slam-dunk success is by no means guaranteed for Apple, whose other music projects in recent years have turned in mixed results. ITunes Radio remains a distant competitor to Pandora, and Ping, a social network connected to iTunes, was introduced in 2010 but withdrawn two years later.\nStill, Mr. Dawson, the Jackdaw analyst, said that given Apple\u2019s enormous customer base, its music service could \u201ceasily\u201d sign up 100 million subscribers over the next few years.\n\u201cThey have the demographic that is most likely to pay for music pretty well locked up,\u201d Mr. Dawson said."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Is there an easy way to show my iPhone\u2019s screen on my MacBook and then record a video of the demonstration on the phone?\nA.Software for the Mac that lets you mirror and record the phone\u2019s display on the computer screen is available, but you may not have to download a separate program to do the job. If you are running OS X Yosemite on the MacBook and have iOS 8 on a newer iPhone,you can record videosof the iPhone\u2019s screen actions with theQuickTime Playerprogram that comes with the Mac. The iPhone (or iPad or iPod Touch) needs to be one of the more recent models, one that uses the small Lightning connector and cable that Apple began to include on new iOS hardwarein late 2012.\nIf you have all the hardware and software in place, connect the iPhone to the MacBook with the Lightning cable. If you do not have an icon for the QuickTime Player in the Dock, open the MacBook\u2019s Applications folder on the hard drive and open the program there. (As a shortcut to the Applications folder from the Mac\u2019s Finder, press the Shift, Command and A keys.)\nWhen the QuickTime program opens, go to the File menu and select New Movie Recording. A new window appears, most likely showing you in front of the MacBook\u2019s webcam. Next to the red Record button, click the menu arrow and change the Camera input from FaceTime HD Camera to iPhone. If you want to record the audio from the phone, as from a game or app, select the iPhone for the microphone input as well.\nOnce you have selected the iPhone, click the Record button in the QuickTime window and then perform the tasks on the iPhone you wish to capture as a video. After you finish and click the Stop button to have QuickTime finish recording, you can save the newly recorded clip to your Mac\u2019s hard drive.\nIf you are not using OS X Yosemite or have older iPhone hardware and software, a third-party program may still work. TheAirSquirrels Reflector 2 programis one of the options. It works withMacs running OS X 10.7.5 or laterandphone models as far back as the iPhone 4srunning iOS 7.\nReflector 2uses Apple\u2019s AirPlay streaming technologyto wirelessly link the two so the iPhone\u2019s display appears on the Mac\u2019s screen for viewing and recording. You can try before you buy to see if the software suits your needs \u2014 although it adds a watermark to your files, a free seven-day trial version of the program isavailable to download from the AirSquirrels site.\nThe full, unwatermarkededition for the Macis $15; aWindows version of Reflector 2is also available. Along with iOS devices, the Reflector 2 desktop program can mirror and record the action from the screens of certain Android devicesusing the \u201cCast screen\u201d feature.\nGetting Notifications from Gmail\nQ.I use the office email program at work, but I like to check my personal Gmail account through my web browser. Is there a way to get alerts to new Gmail messages as they come in as my regular mail program does, in case my browser is buried under other windows?\nA.If you are checking your Gmail in the Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari browsers, you canturn on the desktop notifications optionin your Gmail account settings. To see the notifications on your screen, you need to be logged into your account with Gmail open in a tab or window and you should make sure your browser\u2019s preferences are also set to allow desktop notifications.\nTo turn on desktop notifications, go to your Gmail window, click the gear-shaped menu icon on the right side of the window and select Settings. Make sure you are on the General tab of the Settings screen and scroll down to Desktop Notifications. Here, you can turn on alerts for new messages. If you useGoogle\u2019s Inbox category tabs, you will be notified when new mail arrives in your Primary Inbox.\nShould you prefer, you can also limit the notifications so they appear only when you receive new messages from senders you or Google havedesignated as Important; these are the messages tagged with a little yellow icon next to the sender\u2019s name. When you have turned on the notification level you want to use, click the Save Changes button in the Settings window."

        "title": "Square Unveils Mobile Wallet-Friendly Credit Card Reader",
        "fulltext": "It will take years for smartphone-based wallets, like those offered byAppleandGoogle, to have a chance to truly catch\n                                        on with mainstream consumers. But with the help of payments processors, mobile wallets may catch on a bit faster.\nTo that end, Square, the San Francisco-based payments processing start-up, unveiled a new credit card reader on Monday, one capable of accepting mobile payments like those made through Apple Pay and Android Pay, among\n                                        other methods.\nThe new reader, which Square said will be widely available this fall, operates wirelessly for merchants who want to accept contact-less mobile payments. It also accepts so-called EMV enabled credit cards, a technology\n                                        that includes a chip built into credit cards for added security.\nSquare said the new reader will cost $49. The company is giving away about a quarter of a million of the new devices to encourage adoption by small and medium-sized businesses.\n\u201cWe want more and more people to move to authenticated payments,\u201d Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive of Square, said in an interview. \u201cFor us, this feels like a tipping point \u2014 smaller\n                                        and medium-sized businesses really complete the cycle.\u201d\nFor Square, the timing of the release is crucial. Credit card processors and merchants across the greater retail industry are up against a deadline later this year, when merchants must switch over to accepting EMV-based\n                                        credit cards. If they fail to do so, the merchants will become liable for any potential credit card fraud on the transactions they process.\nBut to prepare for EMV \u2014 which stands for EuroPay,MasterCardandVisa, the major credit networks that created\n                                        the new standard \u2014 merchants must update their payments acceptance terminals, a process that for some may prove costly.\nThat is where companies like Square \u2014 along with rivals likeFirst Data\u2018s\n                                        Clover, Poynt and Shopify \u2014 are inserting themselves. To capitalize on the EMV shift, these companies are offering their next-generation payment-acceptance terminals to small and medium-sized businesses that\n                                        are required to switch to updated technology in any case.\nMany larger retailers are already rebuilding their own in-house payments infrastructures to accept EMV transactions and, in many cases, mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay. But options like Square\u2019s\n                                        reader, as well as those like Clover and Poynt, cater to small businesses that need only buy an off-the-shelf hardware terminal to become EMV compliant.\nIn the long run, that\u2019s good for companies like Apple and Google. The more EMV readers small merchants buy, the more places those companies\u2019 mobile wallets will be accepted.\nAll of this will come at a cost to Square with its giveaway of about 250,000 of the new readers to businesses. At $49 for each reader, the handouts will cost Square around $12.25 million, assuming the cost of materials,\n                                        shipping and manufacturing is equal to what the company is charging businesses.\nAnd a cashless future remains far off, as even beyond the EMV deadline it will very likely take years for merchants to accept all the new forms of payment. For now, it\u2019s safe to say you should probably hold on\n                                        to your current wallet."

        "title": "In Return to Twitter, Jack Dorsey Aims to Follow Path of Steve Jobs",
        "fulltext": "Perhaps we should blameSteve Jobsfor Jack Dorsey\u2019s reappointment asTwitter\u2019s interim chief executive.\nJobs set the precedent. Ousted by his board, he left Apple and was regarded as a sort of failure after a brutal struggle with John Sculley. But Jobswas brought backafter Mr. Sculley (who served as chief from 1983 to 1993) and Gil Amelio (who held the top job from 1996 to 1997) failed miserably.\nWhen Jobs returned, it was a dark time for Apple. It was forced to team up with its archrival Microsoft, and even took a $150 million stock investment from the company, which was then run by Bill Gates.\nJobs was brought in to save the company. He did that and more, performing the turnaround of the millennium.\nThe legend of Steve Jobs lingers over Silicon Valley. One of its many forms encourages founders to return triumphantly to \u201csave\u201d their brands.\nIt\u2019s hard not to think of Jobs\u2019s legacy after the events at Twitter this past week. Dick Costolo, the chief executive of Twitter, announced his surprise exit, not too unexpectedly. Twitter has been under scrutiny by investors for not adding users quickly enough.\nMr. Costolo, who owns hundreds of millions of dollars of Twitter stock, had made it known that he planned to resign around the end of the year anyway. But plans changed, and on Thursday,Mr. Costolo announcedhe was stepping down as of July 1.\nHe will be replaced by Mr. Dorsey, 38, a co-founder of Twitter. Mr. Dorsey in recent years has been gaining respect after he helped start the payments company Square, where he currently serves as C.E.O.\nMr. Dorsey was not named as Twitter\u2019s permanent chief; instead he was appointed as interim C.E.O. until the Twitter board can pick a new head. But let\u2019s remember that Jobs rejoined as an interim chief, too, before gaining the full title three years later in 2000.\nThough Mr. Dorsey seems to be a rational choice, eyebrows were quickly raised about the decision. First, Mr. Dorsey is already running a prominent tech company, Square. Running one big company is usually hard enough, but two can be quite daunting, even for the best managers.\nIn response to an analyst question, Mr. Dorsey pointed out that he had good leadership teams in place at both companies. \u201cAnd I will be working directly with and through both of those teams,\u201d he said during an investor call on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been spending significant amounts of time at both companies, and I will continue to split my time between the two companies.\u201d\nWho else has done this? Let\u2019s look again at Jobs, who simultaneously ran Pixar and Apple for nine years.\nBut there is also the matter of whether Mr. Dorsey can replicate the success that Jobs had with Apple. Mr. Dorsey had been previously ousted before by Evan Williams, his fellow co-founder who is still on the Twitter board. Twitter was known for being a terrible scrum during its early years, a place more akin to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d than Silicon Valley-style nose-to-the-grindstone mettle.\nMr. Dorsey was ejected, in part, because he didn\u2019t get along with Mr. Williams. Mr. Dorsey was in charge of the technical side of things, and the servers \u201cwere melting down every day,\u201d as some of the criticism went. A lengthy Vanity Fair article about Twitter said that Mr. Dorsey \u201cadmitted he was a flawed manager\u201dduring this time. So the interim post is a triumph for Mr. Dorsey, who left in such ignominy only to be brought back.\nMr. Dorsey, who still owns about $800 million of Twitter stock, isclearly relishinghis return, although he did not directly addressin an interview with The New York Timeswhether he wants to be Twitter\u2019s permanent leader.\nA founder\u2019s return can also be stabilizing. Rather than spending months performing an executive search to try to identify someone who understands the company and its business, bringing back a founder has its advantages.\nFounders have a long-term relationship with their company, so they need little grounding in what the business is all about. The founder is the \u201csoul\u201d of the company and a \u201cvisionary,\u201d arguments that go over well in the Valley.\nMr. Dorsey is not the only one who may be hearing echoes of Jobs as he walks the path back to his former company. Those who have returned for second stints in the tech world have included Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo; Larry Page, one of the founders of Google; and Marc Pincus, a founder of Zynga. None of them have done spectacularly well the second time around.\nMr. Yang failed to find a new business model for Yahoo andturned down an offerfrom Microsoft in 2008,worth at least $44.6 billionat the time.\nAfter that, Mr. Yang left the company. The saving grace for his reputation was that he had negotiated what turned out to be one of the luckiest bets for Yahoo\u2019s fortunes \u2014 an investment in what was then a virtually unknown company called Alibaba. (Yahoo paid almost nothing for the Alibaba stake, but its holdings in the firm wereworth $39.5 billion at the beginning of this year.)\nOther returns also haven\u2019t been because a company was struggling. Mr. Page returned as chief of Google in part because he wanted to. Eric E. Schmidt, the previous chief executive, is still actively engaged with running Google and remains chairman.\nBut since that time, Google has feasted on expensive acquisitions like the purchase of Nest, a thermostat company, for $3.2 billion. Google\u2019s stock price has also remained relatively stagnant since Mr. Page\u2019s return.\nMr. Pincus left the helm of the gaming company Zynga after he failed to produce new hits. But Mr. Pincus controls the company, even though he owns a small stake (it\u2019s another one of the quirks of Silicon Valley,where voting control often remains concentratedin the hands of founders, even after they leave).\nThus, two years after working on a new venture, Mr. Pincus is back. It remains to be seen, however, if he can find another hit for Zynga that will be as successful as Farmville once was.\nFounders may also lack the skills or vision for a turnaround, which could require an overhaul of the business. Could Marc Andreessen, the successful venture capitalist, have saved Netscape, the company he founded, against the Microsoft behemoth had he not sold it?\nWhen founders start companies, they are entrepreneurs with an idea and often few or no employees. It\u2019s not the same thing to jump into an established enterprise with thousands of employees.\nMr. Dorsey is certainly older and wiser now. He sits on the board of the Walt Disney Company and has helped lead the success of Square, which is estimated to be worth billions.\nAnd to be fair, Twitter is still an enormously successful property. It is a social media hub and it has a lot of potential. But the warning signs are also there that this may not be a smooth ride.\nIf Mr. Dorsey continues to wear the chief executive hats of two companies for too long, there may be an uprising by investors. In an interview with The Financial Times, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns about 5 percent of Twitter, said: \u201cI believe and trust that Jack Dorsey is there on a temporary basis,\u201d citing Mr. Dorsey\u2019s role at Square. He then backtracked ina statement to Reuters, saying that \u201cshould Mr. Dorsey wish to take on the C.E.O. role, I would support him.\u201d\nIt may be that Mr. Dorsey is the right person for the chief executive post at Twitter. But let\u2019s hope that it is based on his real skills, and not the myth that if Jobs did the impossible with Apple, then any founder of any tech company can replicate that success."

        "title": "Affairs of the Wrist: The Apple Watch Comes Between Them",
        "fulltext": "Is the Apple Watch just for gadget geeks? Farhad Manjoo, our technology columnist,\u201cfell hard\u201d for the watchback in April. But our fashion director, Vanessa Friedman, didn\u2019t feel the sparks; she went public this week withher Apple Watch breakup. The two talked \u2014 over email, of course \u2014 about their wearable-tech turn-ons and turnoffs. Farhad composed his letters on his 5K iMac, watch on wrist. Vanessa replied from her MacBook Air, her wrist newly bare.\nI\u2019m very sorry to hear about your breakup. But honestly, I\u2019m not surprised. The relationship had always seemed a little fraught \u2014 as if you were both trying too hard to be something you were not, just for the sake of appearances. Now that it\u2019s all over and you can honestly assess what went wrong, it sounds as if you\u2019ve correctly diagnosed the problem: Despite its grand promises, the Apple Watch was really not meant for you, an admitted \u201cnontech person\u201d who isn\u2019t into gadgets.\nIn fact, I tried to warn you! Though I was mainly positive in my initial review of the device, I did note that the watch was unusual for an Apple product in not offering many benefits to nontechies. After wearing it almost daily for a couple of months now, I haven\u2019t changed my feelings for the watch much. I continue to like it, and I miss it a little when I don\u2019t put it on. But it still feels as if it\u2019s not for most people. The Apple Watch is best suited for the niche category of early adopters like myself: addled techies who will buy anything new just because it holds out the promise of some marginal advantage in navigating life\u2019s least-challenging obstacles, like helping you pay for stuff or giving you a half-second edge in seeing what\u2019s next on your calendar.\nAs you note, the trouble comes in the disconnect between Apple\u2019s marketing and the watch\u2019s reality.Apple has worked hard to go after fashion folks, people in the industry you cover. If a lot of those people are more like you than like me \u2014 if they, too, aren\u2019t addicted to tech and don\u2019t have trouble turning away from email and Twitter (I don\u2019t know how you do it) \u2014 then perhaps the scales will soon fall from their eyes as well.\nStill, I would add one note of optimism for nontechies like yourself: You should think of this as so long, not goodbye. One thing Apple does well is quickly expand the capabilities of its new devices. Atits developer conferencethis week, Apple outlined a series of improvements to the watch that will make apps faster and more useful. I expect continuing advancements in the coming years. I don\u2019t know quite how yet, but the watch you find useless today may soon become truly useful.\nI\u2019d also add that the long-term trends are in Apple\u2019s favor here. When it comes to fashion, Apple is betting that there are enough people in the world like the fashionistas you cover \u2014 people who will pay for design and logos, who don\u2019t mind being identified by products that define them. And with tech intruding upon every facet of our lives, there will be many more folks like me, folks who can\u2019t get away from it for one second.\nIn other words, for the Apple Watch, there are not only other fish in the sea \u2014 but the sea is actually expanding.\nYours in sadness,\nFarhad\nI should always come to you for relationship advice. Maybe you were an Agony Aunt in another life.\nAnd I accept your point that this may be a recidivist relationship. I don\u2019t see our separation as an irrevocable decision. I may approach the Apple Store in great humility in a few iterations, begging it to take me back.\nOf course, I did read your review before the watch and I hooked up. But the Apple folks were flirting so hard (and convincingly), I thought maybe I could change. After all, I don\u2019t dislike technology \u2014 I find it quite liberating. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t identify with it.\nAs you say, the problem was in the gap between what was dangled \u2014 the \u201cmost personal product yet,\u201d sold at elite fashion boutiques everywhere and introduced during fashion week \u2014 and what was in reality a product that seemed more about Apple than about me. There\u2019s no question a lot of fashion people love a brand, but the brand has to be shorthand for their values \u2014 and the object needs to either be indispensable, or to pluck at their heartstrings.\nIf you don\u2019t need it \u2014 and I don\u2019t think, as you point out, anyone needs this watch yet \u2014 you have to want it. Viscerally. And I just never felt that sucker punch of desire when I saw the Apple Watch. More an itchy sort of curiosity.\n(And there are also a host of fashion people who love a hidden brand, among whom I would include a lot of watch connoisseurs.)\nNot to get too racy, but maybe the answer for now is a threesome? Me, Apple and my old watch?\nAnd on another note, do you agree with one of the suggestions I\u2019ve heard that this may get more nonwatch-wearing teenagers back in the habit, and hence be good for the traditional watch industry? Because I have my doubts. In fact, I wonder if the wrist is really the future of wearables at all.\nBut I\u2019m getting off topic. It\u2019s all those fish in the sea!\nBest,\nVanessa\nWow, really didn\u2019t anticipate us broaching threesomes here. But since you asked. \u2026 No, I don\u2019t really think that would work; at least not for me. Like most threesomes (I\u2019ve heard), I suspect it would be super-awkward. At first, you wouldn\u2019t really know which one to pay attention to, and after a bit, you\u2019d realize you vastly preferred the look and feel of one over the other, and then the less-preferred one would feel left out. The whole thing sounds like a recipe for trouble. By the way, I\u2019m still talking about watches.\nAs for teenagers, let me take a stab at that, because at least when it comes to watches, I act just like one. I haven\u2019t ever regularly worn a wristwatch. I never saw much use for them. In school, there were always clocks around me, and when I got to college and adulthood, cellphones and P.D.A.s arrived, all bearing clocks.\nPerhaps my unfamiliarity with watches accounts for my interest in the Apple Watch. Among my favorite things about it is having the time right there! It sure is convenient to not have to go hunting for my phone to figure out the time of day. And because I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to, it doesn\u2019t really bother me that the screen only engages when I tilt my wrist toward my face, Dick Tracy style. I\u2019m not used to looking at the time on my wrist while my hands are idle.\nI know I sound like a rube, but I suspect this is how most teenagers and other nonwatch-wearers will encounter this gadget: genuinely amazed at a device that tells time rather than bummed that it isn\u2019t always on, like a Timex.\nNow, after being introduced to the wonders of wrist-worn clocks, will we be more willing to try out analog watches? I kind of doubt it. I feel as if, after wearing this thing, I wouldn\u2019t want to wear a device that did less. I don\u2019t think the Apple Watch does too much for me, but it does enough \u2014 and if it did any less, it would be useless. In addition to learning the time, I use it a great deal to find my phone (you tap a button, it gets your phone ringing \u2014 so handy!) and to peruse my coming calendar entries. An analog wouldn\u2019t do that for me, so I wouldn\u2019t bother with it.\nBut enough about me. What\u2019s your next step in the breakup: Are you going to return your watch to Apple, or just pass it off to a friend? I have another friend whosold his for a profit on eBay. That would be a sweet way to end a relationship.\nBest,\nFarhad\nO.K., I have reined in my attempt to do \u201c50 Shades of Apple Watch.\u201d But I still think there\u2019s something to the polygamist approach. The high-end watch and the smartwatch fulfill different functions \u2014 arrival and insiderness versus broadly accessible techiness \u2014 and despite what you say about split attention, I actually can imagine them coexisting in a watch wardrobe (yes, that\u2019s what we call it) pretty happily. You wouldn\u2019t want your Apple Watch and your Seiko or your Swatch, but your Apple Watch and a Patek Philippe, for those who can afford one? Why not?\nWhy should we expect one gadget to be all things to all people? Even if that is the dream of Apple.\n(Is that the dream of Apple? You know these things better than I do.)\nHere\u2019s my horological dream, though, and it has to do with solving a real problem I have: One area where a phone is not acceptable, and where you couldn\u2019t check the time on it even if you could find it in your pockets, is a cocktail party or black-tie event. It\u2019s the only time I can think of that having an old-fashioned watch still helps \u2014 and why evening watches are one of the areas of old-fashioned watchmaking that is growing.\nBut I also admit that more useful than said old-fashioned watch would be an elegant accessory on my wrist that would alert me to an important call, text or email. It would give me enormous peace of mind without causing concern that I am offending my companions or colleagues with obvious phone-checking maneuvers. Yet not even the gold version of the current Apple Watch would look right with a party dress, at least not on me.\nMaybe they could tackle that in generation next? Then I\u2019d definitely be back.\nIn the meantime, my watch is going back to Apple. I do have a friend, however, who just emailed me to tell me that he excitedly got his watch on Day 1 of deliveries, only to get so annoyed by the constant need to charge it, wake it up and calibrate the buzzing, that he sold it on Craigslist for a big profit.\nDo you think it\u2019s already a collectible?\nBest,\nV\nI suspect your horological dream is in line with Apple\u2019s. The people there don\u2019t like to talk about the future of their products, so I haven\u2019t asked them to describe what they\u2019re trying to build. But if other Apple gadgets are any indication, you can bet this one will get lighter, thinner and sleeker over the next few years. At some point, it won\u2019t look odd at a cocktail party.\nAnd if it takes off, I suspect norms will also change. Not long ago, it wasn\u2019t really socially acceptable to look at your phone all the time. Now, black-tie events aside, it\u2019s sort of required.\nAs for whether it becomes a collectible: nope, I doubt it, unless it fails spectacularly. If the watch succeeds, I bet the first-gen versions will one day be seen as interesting curiosities. Maybe in 10 years, when smartwatches will be capable of actually changing time, some tech billionaire will pay $50,000 for a vintage 2015 model as part of a charity auction. But most of the rest of them will be forgotten in drawers. Yours, sadly, will probably get buffed up and sold as a refurb \u2014 and maybe, finally, it will find love.\nAnd now, my watch beckons.\nBest,\nFarhad"

        "title": "Taylor Swift Criticism Spurs Apple to Change Royalties Policy",
        "fulltext": "When Taylor Swift speaks, even the most powerful company in the world listens.\nLess than 24 hours after Ms. Swift complained publicly that Apple was not planning to pay royalties during a three-month trial period of its new streaming music service, the company changed course, and confirmed that it will pay its full royalty rates for music during the free trial.\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning and read Taylor\u2019s note, it really solidified that we need to make a change,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview late Sunday.\nIn a letter posted Sunday morning to her Tumblr page,called \u201cTo Apple, Love Taylor,\u201dMs. Swift addressed a situation that had begun to send shock waves through the music industry: Apple, which has announced a subscription streaming service to compete with Spotify, Rhapsody and Deezer, was not going to pay royalties during the trial period.\nMs. Swift, who last year pulled her music from Spotify in another dispute over royalties, called Apple\u2019s policy \u201cshocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive company.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones,\u201d she added. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\u201d\nMs. Swift had framed her letter as an explanation for why she was withholding her latest album, \u201c1989,\u201d from Apple\u2019s new service. But she said that she was also speaking for other musicians who were afraid to speak up about the issue, and her comments found wide support in the music world. On Twitter, Elvis Costello called Ms. Swift\u2019s note \u201ca note from our future President.\u201d\nApple\u2019s new service, called Apple Music, is set to become available worldwide on June 30. Besides its longstanding iTunes download store, it will include a $10 streaming subscription plan, a free Internet radio station and a media platform that will let artists upload songs, videos and other content for fans. Unlike Spotify, which lets customers listen free or pay monthly fees to eliminate ads, Apple\u2019s subscription feature will have no permanent free level.\nApple\u2019s arrival in streaming music has been much anticipated by the music industry, but its plan not to pay royalties during its trial period drew complaints from independent music groups around the world, saying that the company\u2019s terms were unfair.\nBut the criticism from Ms. Swift \u2014 perhaps the biggest star in pop today \u2014 was a damaging public-relations misstep for Apple on the eve of its big new product release.\nMr. Cue, the Apple executive in charge of iTunes and Apple\u2019s new music service, said that he had spoken to Ms. Swift on Sunday. \u201cI did let her know that we heard her concerns and made the change,\u201d he said.\nEarly Monday, after Apple\u2019s change was announced,Ms. Swift tweeted:\nMr. Cue said the company\u2019s original plan was to pay a slightly higher royalty rate \u2014 at least 71.5 percent of the money it collects from sales, as opposed to the industry standard of about 70 percent \u2014 in exchange for the free trial.\nBut many record executives, particularly at small labels where margins are thin, had described a frightening scenario in which income from important new albums that came out during the free period would not only lose out on crucial download income, but also get nothing from Apple\u2019s new streaming feature.\nMr. Cue said that Apple will now pay royalties to both record companies and music publishers for the use of music during the trial period. He declined to specify how much money that might cost the company, which is the biggest retailer of music.\nMs. Swift has long been outspoken on economic issues for musicians. In a piece in The Wall Street Journal last year, she wrote: \u201cValuable things should be paid for. It\u2019s my opinion that music should not be free.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.I am trying to leave iPhoto behind and get used to the Photos app for OS X on my Mac, but all the familiar controls for adjusting the color, contrast and other aspects of the image seem to have moved or have disappeared. For example, where are the Sharpness and De-Noise sliders that were under the Adjust tab in iPhoto?\nA.The Adjust tab in the older iPhoto program included handy sliders for changing the exposure, contrast, saturation, sharpness, noise and other elements of the image. Despite the interface overhaul, Apple\u2019sPhotos for OS Xsoftware still offers many editing tools to help you improve the look of your pictures. The streamlined look of the new program happens to tuck things away under small icons and menus, so you have to poke around a bit to find them.\nIn Photos for OS X, you can find these tools after you select a photo to work on and click the Edit button in the top-right corner of the window. Once the program\u2019s background changes from white to black and you are in Edit mode, click the Adjust icon in the list on the right of the screen.\nThe Adjustments panel opens with a few default groups of sliders, like those for Light, Color and Black & White. If you do not see individual sliders under these groupings \u2014 like the exposure and contrast controls under Light, move the cursor to the right side of the label and click the large downward-pointing menu arrow to reveal all the individual sliders for that category.\nTo add sliders for other editing tools, likesharpeningandnoise reduction, click the Add button in the top-right corner of the Adjustments panel. From the menu that opens, you can add those sliders to your panel, along with controls for a picture\u2019swhite balance,levels,vignetteand overall definition. If you do not see it already, you can also choose to show thehistogramfor the photo you are editing. Use the Save As Default option on the Add menu if you would like to keep this arrangement of tools.\nFor basic instruction in using Photos for OS X, go to the program\u2019s Help menu and select Photos Help. If you do not have the Photos program open and still want to do some background reading on the subject, you can find the samePhotos for OS X guideon Apple\u2019s website.\nHushing a Noisy Narrator\nQ.I sometimes hit certain keys and Windows 8.1 starts describing the screen out loud. I have to restart to make it shut up. What is this and how can I stop it?\nA.If you accidentally press the Windows and Enter keys at the same time in Windows 8.1, you turn on theNarrator feature. You can turn off Narrator by pressing the same Windows-and-Enter key combination again.\nNarrator is one of theaccessibility featuresbuilt into theWindows 8.1 operating system, and the program has beenincluded in Windows 7andearlier versionsof Windows, too. The utility helps make using the computer easier for people with visual impairments because it describes things like alert boxes and recites text on the screen aloud. (For Mac users, Apple has a similar set ofaccessibility tools built into OS X, including its own screen reader program calledVoiceOver.)"

        "title": "Updating the Mac\u2019s Software",
        "fulltext": "Q.Should I always install updates of Mac OS X and individual applications? I\u2019ve heard that over time, they can really slow down one\u2019s computer. How do you know which are important?\nA.Any update with \u201csecurity\u201d in the name is usually important, and some versions of OS X caneven install those automaticallyfor you. Security patches are designed to close off vulnerabilities in the software and generally keep your Mac safer.\nApple has been annually updating OS X for the last several years and the new versions can bring some nice features. As with any operating system update, though, you could experience quirks, bugs and a learning curve as you get used to it. Depending on your hardware, a new system may run more slowly on older Macs than on the newer models, although system updates are usually intended to improve speed. Applehas a list of suggestionsif your Mac feels sluggish, including clearing space on an overstuffed hard drive.Mac-themed sitesusually have their own advice as well.\nIf you are nervous about updating to a new version of OS X or installing a major upgrade to a favorite app, wait a few days after its release and then check Apple\u2019sMac Support pagesor Mac-blog forums; the support pages for your other Mac apps may also detail any known issues. If there are major problems plaguing the software, odds are someone will be complaining about it online and you can better decide if the update is worthwhile for you. The crowd-sourcedRoaring Apps application compatibility tablehas tested more than 600 apps to see if they run on various versions of OS X, and is another good site to consult.\nApple is not shyaboutadvertising each new edition of OS X in the Mac App Store, even if you have decided to skip it. To avoid seeing OS X update notices all the time, open the App Store by clicking its icon in the Mac\u2019s Dock. When the Store window opens, click the Updates tab. When you see the large banner urging you to upgrade, right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) on the banner and choose \u201cHide Update.\u201d\nApple\u2019sWorldwide Developers Conferencebegins on June 8, and the company traditionally uses the event to announce its next iteration of OS X. If you have not upgraded to the current OS X Yosemite yet, another new version of the Mac\u2019s operating system will most likely be available before the end of the year.\nChecking a Laptop Charger That Gets Too Hot\nQ.The electrical adapter to my laptop gets very warm when I have it plugged in to charge my computer. Is this normal, or should I be worried?\nA.Most power adapters do feel quite warm to the touch, especially if you have the laptop turned on and are working as you recharge. This is normal. Just make sure you have plenty of ventilation around the charger and laptop while they are plugged in so heat does not get trapped under mounds of magazines, papers and other desk debris.\nBut if the charger is so hot that it hurts to hold it \u2014 or it smells like burning plastic when it is plugged in \u2014 you should disconnect it immediately and investigate further. Check the length of the cord for damage to the outer casing, particularly if you have house pets that like to chew, as some animals have a taste for electronic accessories.\nYou should also examine the tip of the cord and the power jack on the laptop. Look for broken or bent pins inside \u2014 or anything else obstructing the plug and port. An incomplete or faulty connection could be preventing the charger from working properly.\nIf you have the power adapter plugged in and the laptop on, check the computer\u2019s battery icon to see if it is actually charging. If the charging icon in not steadily visible, the adapter may be malfunctioning.\nBroken power adapters for electronic devices are potential fire hazards. To be on the safe side, consider getting a replacement approved by your laptop\u2019s manufacturer, or just ordering another one directly from the company. Third-party adapters are often less expensive but can vary in quality, so research any product before buying it. TheConsumer Product Safety Commissionhas occasionally issued recalls forfaulty power cords and chargersfrom manufacturers, and the agency\u2019s database is worth a search if you want to be really diligent."
