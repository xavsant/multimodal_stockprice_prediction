        "fulltext": "U.S. and European officials talk incessantly about making more of the world\u2019s advanced computer chips anywhere other than Taiwan, which they consider vulnerable to Chinese invasion or influence. They\u2019re on a mission tomake more chips in the U.S.andEuropeand want tospend taxpayer dollarsto do so.\nApple doesn\u2019t seem so worried. For years to come, Apple has planned for devices rolling off assembly lines to continue relying on chips made largely in Taiwan.\nApple has a track record of bending global technology manufacturing to its will, and the company has lobbied for more computer chips to be made in America. But Apple and other big buyers of chips do not seem to have made it a priority and are not seriously using their influence over suppliers to speed up the building of chip factories in the U.S., Japan or Europe.\n\u201cThe industry is not raising this as something that they need to see some action on immediately,\u201d said Brett Simpson, a computer chip specialist and partner at the investment firm Arete Research.\nThe apparent disconnect between Western governments and the biggest buyers of chips, like Apple, raises a question for both companies and policymakers: Who is right about the urgency of the economic and geopolitical risks of concentrating chip-making in Taiwan \u2014 the people who need votes or the companies that vote with their wallets?\nGovernment officials might be overstating the risks of concentrating chip-making in Taiwan, or chip buyers like Apple might be underestimating them. Or maybe these companies find it too daunting to shift more quickly away from the expertise of Taiwan\u2019s chip factories. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s as if elected leaders and the companies that need chips the most are working from a different sense of what is possible and necessary for the future of this essential industry.\nLet me recap why big businesses and big governments want to keep computer chips flowing but aren\u2019t moving in lock step on how and how quickly to achieve that.\nMany important products \u2014 including smartphones, medical devices and fighter jets \u2014 need computer chips to function as their brains or memory. Some of us have become keenly aware of theseteeny componentsbecause the manufacturing of computer chips hasn\u2019t kept up with the demand of people who have wanted to buy cars, computers and other goods during the pandemic.\nThe shortages of some products, and the increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, haveturned the spotlightonto the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. It makes most of the world\u2019s cutting-edge computer chips, including for Apple\u2019s products, almost entirelyin factories in Taiwan.\nTSMC is expanding into other places, includingArizona, but it takes years to get new factories up and running. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to keep factories churning out computer chips without interruption, because the global economy sputters otherwise. The Biden administration and many tech experts also say that it\u2019s strategically important to preserve America\u2019s know-how in chip-making and counter China\u2019s ambitions in chip-making and other essential tech areas.\nChanging the world\u2019s reliance on chips made in Taiwan won\u2019t be easy, and industry officials told me that Apple has been working behind the scenes to support legislation to manufacture more chips in America.\nSome big chip buyers also have said that they\u2019re helping TSMC pay for its chip factories outside Taiwan and will buy chips manufactured there. The question is whether all this could move faster if influential customers put more of their muscle into it.\nSimpson told me that if Apple and other big customers such as Qualcomm and Nvidia wanted to more quickly spread manufacturing away from Taiwan, they could press TSMC to get new factories ready to go all at once rather than in phases, as TSMC has been doing. They could also commit to buying more chips from other manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel with factories outside Taiwan. Instead, Apple and others have mostly been doubling down on contracts with TSMC.\nWhen Washington and Silicon Valley don\u2019t seem to share the same sense of urgency, it\u2019s tough for all of us to know if it\u2019s worth the collective effort to create a new world order in computer chips.\nEveryone learned to shut up and enjoy the tech bubble.My colleagues Erin Griffith and Taylor Johnston published adelightful historyof the many warnings in the past decade that the boom times for the technology industry were ending. Nope, everything has just gotten bubblier (so far), and hardly anyone even uses the word \u201cbubble\u201d anymore.\nNew TV is looking more like old TV:To sign up more subscribers, large entertainment companies including Disney and HBO are offering a deal:exposure to commercials in their streaming video services in exchange for lower prices, my colleagues John Koblin and Tiffany Hsu explained.\nRelated from On Tech:Old-school media companies are challenging Netflix, which needs new ways to stay on top.\nA burrito chain exists in the metaverse for some reason.You canvisit Chipotle in the Lego-like Roblox virtual game. A writer for Business Insider wasn\u2019t impressed.\nBears are fatter and healthier than ever, and that has confused researchers in Minnesota who study bear breeding patterns. I can\u2019t explain why I loved this bear science article, but I did.\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.
