        "title": "Apple Flounders, but Tidal Will Not Steady the Boat",
        "fulltext": "Apple is flailing around to the beat.\nThe company may buy Tidal, the music-streaming service started by the superstar rapper Jay Z,according to The Wall Street Journal. The presumed logic is that it will help Apple strengthen its own service.\nSpotify, a rival, says that Apple is harming it by rejecting an app upgrade. Apple has the clout to fend off rivals, but adding Tidal will not help get its rhythm back.\nIt was just two years ago that Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, spent $3 billion for Beats, the streaming music and headphones business owned by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. The co-founders have deep ties to the music industry with roots at Interscope and Death Row Records.\nAnd yet Apple\u2019s streaming ambitions have been middling at best. It is redesigning the service after frustrating its approximately 15 million paying subscribers. That is just half as big as Spotify\u2019s 30 million subscriber base.\nTidal is struggling, too. It had a star-studded debut last March \u2014 with Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna and Chris Martin of Coldplay \u2014 and promised that an online service owned by artists would be better for artists. But it is on its third chief executive and has not drawn the masses, picking up fewer than five million paying customers, many of them reaped by dropping occasional exclusives from the likes of Kanye West, Prince and others.\nAs sales of iPhones, computers and iPads slow, it is understandable why Apple is setting its sights on other businesses. Revenue from apps, Apple Music subscriptions, along with a few other services, rose 20 percent year-over-year and accounted for 12 percent of its $50 billion in last quarter\u2019s top line.\nThat partly explains why Apple is giving Spotify headaches. Recode reported that Apple will not approve the digital music service\u2019s latest app. Spotify, based in Sweden, is encouraging customers to sign up through its own website, thus bypassing in-app subscriptions. Apple takes a 30 percent cut, though the fee falls to 15 percent after one year. It\u2019s a retributive move \u2013 like a lyric from one of Dre\u2019s old NWA raps."

        "title": "Apple, in Seeming Jab at Spotify, Proposes Simpler Songwriting Royalties",
        "fulltext": "In the music industry\u2019s streaming battles, the fight extends to even the minutiae of copyright.\nApple, in a government filing on Friday, proposed simplifying the highly complex way that songwriting royalties are paid when it comes to on-demand streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal.\nAccording to Apple\u2019s proposal, made with the Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of federal judges who oversee rates in the United States, streaming services should pay 9.1 cents in songwriting royalties for every 100 times a song is played. This formula would replace thelong passagesof federal rules for streaming rates, which often leave musicians bewildered about just how the money flows in streaming music.\nBut even in this seemingly innocuous proposal, which was not made public but was obtained by The New York Times, Apple\u2019s target is clear: Spotify, its archenemy in streaming music. The proposal would significantly raise the rates that Spotify pays, and the filing includes lines that are clearly directed at Spotify and its so-called freemium model.\n\u201cAn interactive stream has an inherent value,\u201d Apple wrote, \u201cregardless of the business model a service provider chooses.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Apple confirmed the filing but declined to comment further.\nApple\u2019s streaming service, Apple Music, was introduced a year ago, and it has earned the support of many power players in the music industry \u2014 includingTaylor Swift\u2014 because it does not offer a free version, but instead charges about $10 a month. Spotify, begun in Europe in 2008, has both free and paid versions. This has led to a tense relationship with record companies and music publishers, who say the service\u2019s free tier does not pay enough in royalties and devalues their music across the board.\nThe battle over free music has extended toYouTube, which the music industry has been campaigning against for months, arguing that the service does not pay enough in royalties and that the availability of so much free music on the site has hampered the growth of paid services. Both Spotify and YouTube counter that they have paid billions of dollars to the music industry.\nLast month, Apple said that Apple Music had 15 million subscribers, and Spotify reported that it had 30 million paid users and another 70 million who listen free, with ads.\nAlthough Apple Music has a three-month free trial period, the company has stood staunchly by its model of paid music. \u201cWe agree 100 percent with artists that they should have the right to decide where their content is available \u2014 whether it\u2019s free or when it\u2019s free, when it should be paid or how much it should cost,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of internet software and services, said in an interview this week withThe Hollywood Reporter.\nApple\u2019s filing was made as part of a proceeding by the Copyright Royalty Board to set statutory rates for downloads and interactive streaming services from 2018 to 2022. Spotify, Google, Pandora, Amazon and the Recording Industry Association of America were all expected to file their proposals by Friday, but the panel has not yet made the filings public.\nAlthough the bulk of Apple\u2019s proposal with the Copyright Royalty Board is confined to three brief paragraphs, it would have wide implications if it were adopted. Songwriting rates paid by interactive streaming services like Spotify are now governed by a byzantine system that includes a division between what are known as mechanical and performance royalties for the same songs. Apple\u2019s proposal would cover all songwriting royalties with the same rate. (Royalties for recordings are accounted separately.)\nWhat Apple does not say in its filing, however, is that the statutory rates it proposes would not apply to its own services. When the company introduced Apple Music last year, it struck direct deals with music publishers at rates that areslightly higher than usual."

        "fulltext": "Apple on Thursday released an early version of its next mobile operating system, which will deliversome of the most substantial changesto iPhones and iPads in years.\nSo for those who are eager to try all the new features and are willing to be guinea pigs, there are a few important things to know about upgrading to the software.\nThe system, iOS 10, became available as a public beta, which means intrepid iPhone and iPad owners get to sample it and give feedback while Apple and developers continue to test it and to stomp out bugs before the software is more widely released in the fall.\nFor most consumers, there is little reason to upgrade this soon; the free, official iOS upgrade is only a few months away, and operating systems generally get better with time. Yet there can be some benefits to upgrading now.\nEarly adopters who want a head start on using some of theiOS 10 features, like a new messaging app and improved photo software, should jump in, for example.\nThere is a communal benefit to upgrading now, too. If more early testers report bugs and give other feedback to Apple, it is less likely that major problems will remain on release. Microsoft used a similar public testing process for its operating system Windows 10, to gather information and fix problems. Though many consumers have run intohiccups with Windows 10, it has generally received positive reviews.\nIf you are hopping on the early-upgrade train for iOS, here are some tips for making the experience smoother and for avoiding disaster.\nThe first step in obtaining the iOS beta is to sign up for Apple\u2019s testing program, which involves signing in with your Apple ID on anApple webpage.\nAfter enrolling, you will receive an email with steps on installing the upgrade.\nBefore installing the upgrade, it is crucial to back up your device data in case something goes wrong. Apple recommends backing up your iPhone or iPad over a wired connection to a computer running the latest version of its iTunes software. After opening iTunes, select your Apple device and hit the Back Up Now button to create a backup on the computer.\nIf something goes awry \u2014 for example, if an important app ceases to work properly \u2014 be aware of the steps to roll back to the previous version of iOS, which are listed onApple\u2019s support website. You will need to erase the new software and use iTunes to restore the backup you created on your computer, which will kick you back to iOS 9.\nAfter you have safely installed the iOS 10 beta, get familiar with some of thenew features. Some big changes won\u2019t be usable yet \u2014 a smarter Siri voice assistant, for example, is awaiting third-party developers to update their apps to work with Siri.\nFor now, a new Messages app, which lets you send drawings and animations to other iOS 10 users, will be the biggest change. Apple also made its Photos app smarter \u2014 a feature called Memories will automatically compile multiple photos from an occasion, like your trip to Spain, into video montages. You can also test Apple\u2019s redesigned apps for music, maps and news.\nA bonus for iPhone 6S or 6S Plus owners is they can use 3D Touch, the feature that triggers different actions based on how hard you press the touch screen, to try some new tricks in iOS 10. When sending a text message, pressing harder on the send arrow opens a menu where you can select an animation to embed, like neon lasers or birthday balloons. Also, when a text-message notification pops up on the iPhone\u2019s lock screen, you can use 3D Touch to press down on the notification and reply to the message without logging in."

        "fulltext": "HALF OF WILLIAMS BOARD RESIGNSAbout half the directors at the Williams Companies resigned over disagreements about the future of the pipeline operator,Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.\nA board vote over whether to oust the chief executive, Alan Armstrong, came out 6 to 6,according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. Those who voted against Mr. Armstrong\u2019s\n                                        remaining on the board resigned.\nThe moves came after the $38 billion merger with Energy Transfer Equity was dismantled this week over a tax issue.According to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the resignations, those\n                                        who resigned felt that Mr. Armstrong was ill-suited to lead Williams on its new course without Energy Transfer.\nThe board members who stepped down included the activists on the board: Keith Meister of Corvex Management and Eric Mandelblatt of Soroban Capital Partners. Frank MacInnis, the independent director chairman of Williams,\n                                        also stepped down, but largely because of personal reasons, these people said. They were joined by Steven Nance, president of Steele Creek Energy, Laura Sugg, a former senior executive at ConocoPhillips, and Ralph\n                                        Izzo, the chairman of Public Service Enterprise Group.\nWilliams is also appealing the termination of the deal with Energy Transfer Equity.Its only real chance is to argue some legal error,Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor.\n                                        But it comes down to whether the Delaware Supreme Court wants to intervene and agrees that \u201creasonable efforts\u201d as a standard required more in this case.\nThese questions are valid, but it will be an uphill battle for Williams given the fact-finding of the lower court judge and the penchant of the state\u2019s Supreme Court to defer to the lower court on these matters.\nHERSHEY REJECTS MONDELEZ TAKEOVER OFFERHershey, which has rebuffed numerous offers to buy it over the years, is facing one of its biggest challenges yet from a fellow chocolate giant,Michael J. de la Merced and Stephanie Strom report in DealBook.\nMondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies and Cadbury Chocolate,made a $23 billion offer, but Hershey is betting that it can remain independent or at least fetch a substantially higher price.\n                                        It rejected the offer, saying that it \u201cprovided no basis for further discussion.\u201d\nHershey\u2019s impregnable defense has historically come from the charitable trust that controls about 81 percent of voting power,asLeslie Picker, Ms. Strom and Mr. de la Merced explainin DealBook. But many observers are asking whether this time its response will be different if Mondelez comes back with a higher offer.\nThe trust has already retained advisers separate from the Hershey Company itself as it weighs its own options. The Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office, which has raised concerns over the trust\u2019s deployment\n                                        of funds, isseeking an overhaul of its board. If that were to happen, some believe Hershey\u2019s largest shareholder would be more apt to sell.\nMondelez has been mindful of the need to win over the trust \u2013 in its letter last week, it promised to maintain jobs and relocate the combined company\u2019s chocolate operations to Hershey, Pa.\nThe Mondelez offer has also raised questions about whether Hershey could attract other buyers or whether Mondelez itself may be put into play.\nPutting the two together would create a powerful force in the business of sweets. Mondelez is the world\u2019s second-largest confectionery company \u2013 but it has very little business in the United States. Hershey\n                                        has more than four-fifths of its sales in North America.\nON THE AGENDA Loretta Mester, the president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve, will speak at the European Economics and Financial Center at 11 a.m. The latestManufacturing ISM Report on Businesswill be published at 10 a.m.\nPUERTO RICO DEBT RELIEF STIRS COLONIAL RESENTMENTPuerto Ricans protested against the \u201cjunta,\u201d a federal control board that will soon direct the island\u2019s failing governance and\n                                        finances, even as President Obama signed the debt relief law,Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook.\n                                        \u201cJunta\u201d in Spanish just means board, although it has dictatorial connotations in English. Protesters converged after hearing that the debt relief law had passed the Senate.\nEven Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla seemed to join in, declaring a moratorium on paying the island\u2019s debts just a day before a big payment was due, even though the new law precludes him from\n                                        making such a move.\nBeneath the rhetoric, however,there was resignationand an awareness that Puerto Rico\u2019s own elected officials had let the island slip into a death spiral.\nThe need to pay the island\u2019s $72 billion debt has crowded out other governmental spending in Puerto Rico, leaving schools closed, fewer hospital beds, and homeless people squatting in abandoned houses. Officials\n                                        also scared off tourists fearful of the Zika virus bywarning that they would stop testing the water supply to save money.\nIn addition to imposing federal control, the so-called Promesa legislation gives Puerto Rico the power to unilaterally reduce its debts, something that a debtor can normally do only in bankruptcy. Federal law explicitly\n                                        bars the Puerto Rican government from entering bankruptcy, an exclusion is seen as a slap in the face by Puerto Ricans.\nBanners hung near the federal courthouse said, \u201cThe problem is not the junta, it\u2019s the colony.\u201d\nThe newsletter will be taking a break on July 4.

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Death, Denial and Self-Driving Cars",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: How\u2019s it going, Mike? I\u2019m very excited because the 4th of July is my favorite holiday. It\u2019s summer, you\u2019re outside, you grill stuff \u2014 how can anything beat that? (Thanksgiving comes a close second, IMHO.) So, how are you celebrating America\u2019s birthday?\nMike:Gas station burrito, sitting in my car.\nFarhad: Oh, so the same as every year. Anyway, speaking of fireworks, this was a surprisingly busy week in tech news. Let\u2019s start with Zenefits, the beleagueredhuman resources start-up, which did something almost unheard-of \u2014 it gave up more of its equity to existing investors as a wayto compensate them for its recently terrible behavior.\nIn 2015, several large investorspoured $500 million into Zenefits, which was then growing faster than you at an all-you-can-eat buffet. But last year it emerged thatZenefits was actually a garbage fire of unruly and potentially illegal behavior. Its founder, Parker Conrad, was pushed out, and the new chief executive, David Sacks, has since been trying to save the sinking ship.\nUnder the new deal, some of Zenefits\u2019 existing investors will get a much higher ownership stake, and the company\u2019s overall valuation will plummet from $4 billion to $2 billion. That sounds like bad news \u2014 andsome of the company\u2019s biggest investors aren\u2019t really happy about it\u2014 but to me the deal seems better than a lot of other potential outcomes for the company, and could shore up its long-term future. Also, $2 billion is not nothing.\nMike: It\u2019s probably a better deal than investors pulling their cash, or perhaps suing the company for investing under false pretenses. What a complete nightmare for employees \u2014 at least, the employees who didn\u2019t cheat to beat compliance exams.\nAt the same time, maybe some employees respect the hustle it takes to grow at all costs? Or maybe they sympathize with Conrad, who was undoubtedly under pressure from the board to have his company live up to the incredible hype. Who knows?\nFarhad: There weresome sparks between Spotify and Apple. According to the music streaming start-up, Apple recently rejected a Spotify update in the iOS App Store. Apple apparently didn\u2019t like that Spotify was giving users a discount if they signed up for Spotify\u2019s subscription outside of the app, on Spotify\u2019s own site \u2014 which allowed Spotify to avoid paying the 30 percent cut that Apple takes when an app uses Apple\u2019s in-store payment system.\nNow Spotify has written a legal letter to Apple decrying the \u201cgrave harm to Spotify and its customers,\u201d and it cleverly sent out copies of the letter to lawmakers in Washington \u2014 a suggestion that Apple might get in trouble with lawmakers over its rejection. Given that Apple has its own music streaming service that directly competes with Spotify, its tactics could raise antitrust issues.\nI can\u2019t speak to the legal nuances here \u2014 antitrust cases are difficult to mount, andApple has defended its practices. But as a Spotify user, I\u2019m looking forward to the fight. I understand that Apple should take some cut for the infrastructure it maintains to support its app store, but 30 percent sounds way too high. Also, other Apple maneuvers \u2014 like not giving Siri the ability to control music apps other than Apple\u2019s own one \u2014 seem deliberately unfair.\nMike: I\u2019ll stay out of legal commentary for now, but just as a regular consumer, Apple prohibiting me from an app update for a service I subscribe to rubs me the wrong way.\nFarhad: Spotify wasn\u2019t the only media company getting pushed around by giants this week. Lots of news companies got bad news from Facebook, which announced that it would lower the ranking of news stories in its News Feed, and instead boost posts from people\u2019s friends and family.As I argued in my column, the end game here won\u2019t be pretty \u2014 Facebook and news companies are now on a collision course, and I can\u2019t see how the news business emerges unscathed.\nMike:Yeah, we\u2019re all freaking out. But we freak out over everything, and Facebook changing its algorithm is like saying the sun will rise in the east. We need to get used to it and adjust accordingly, every time.\nFarhad:Also, you know what these Apple-Spotify and Facebook stories really drove home to me? Independent media is just becoming an impossible business. If you\u2019re trying to run a content business and you\u2019re not named Apple, Google, Facebook or Amazon, good luck to you. You\u2019re going to need it.\nMike: I still think Spotify will be O.K. in the long run. But maybe I\u2019m dumb.\nFarhad: But the big thing I wanted to talk about this week was whether we should be scared of our self-driving future. Tesla said this week that the driver of one of its Model S carswas killed when the car crashed while it was running on Autopilot mode\u2014 a feature that allows the car to drive \u201csemi-autonomously,\u201d without the driver actively controlling it.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla. The car was supposed to stop, but it didn\u2019t. The traffic safety administration is now investigating the crash.\nWhat do you think of this case? Does it give you pause about self-driving cars?\nMike:So I was with a friend who owns a Tesla the other day \u2014 no, he was not a venture capitalist \u2014 and we were on a stretch of road in San Francisco in light traffic, when he decided to show me the feature. It worked fine, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel freaked out that something bad was going to happen.\nThat\u2019s probably to be expected, because it\u2019s a new type of behavior that we\u2019re not used to. Time and conditioning normalizes things, like not steering my car when I\u2019m driving it. All of tech, and really much of the automotive industry, speaks of driverless cars with the gravitas of inevitability: In the future, driving yourself will be more foreign than you think.\nThat\u2019s why something like this isn\u2019t just bad for Tesla, it\u2019s bad for everyone betting on this future. Go listen to the leaders at Lyft, Uber or General Motors talk about driverless. Things like this inhibit this vision.\nWhat I sort of question is the response from Tesla on this one. Thecompany blog poststarted out sympathetic, but then flooded us with a bunch of numbers and statistics. I\u2019m not sure that strikes the right tone after a guy just died.\nAnyway, how does the industry recover from this? Just keep marching toward inevitability?\nFarhad: I actually appreciated the numbers in the piece. Tesla is right: Cars driven by humans kill lots of humans every year. Cars driven by computers tend to kill fewer \u2014 even at this point, when they\u2019re not even especially good \u2014 and the better they get the safer they\u2019ll become in comparison to the human drivers.\nMike:Fair enough. Maybe the timing was off to me. Seemed a bit too defensive too quickly. Whatever, I don\u2019t do PR for a living.\nFarhad:Now, none of this means they\u2019ll be crashproof anytime soon, and we\u2019ll most likely see many more deaths in cars driven by computers. But am I crazy to think that people will respond to this mostly rationally? Today, death is a handmaiden to automobile travel. Every time you get in a car you\u2019re playing Russian roulette. The way we deal with it is the way humans tend to deal with everything \u2014 we just sort of forget about it and pretend everything is O.K.\nSo I bet that\u2019s how we\u2019ll deal with these self-driving cars, too. They\u2019re still gonna kill us, but they\u2019ll kill us less often than the killing machines we use now, We\u2019ll mostly forget about all the death, and we\u2019ll live happily ever after.\nAnyway, happy 4th!\nMike:I\u2019ll be spending it watchingBill Pullman give a motivational speech. Cheers!"

        "title": "The Oppressive Gospel of \u2018Minimalism\u2019",
        "fulltext": "It has become an ostentatious ritual of consumerist self-sacrifice; people who have it all now seem to prefer having nothing at all. And, as with watching birds or going Paleo, talking about the material purge is just as important as actually doing it. So there are blog posts \u2014 in which you can see minimalism\u2019s can-do optimism curdle into something tyrannical.\nA recent account, called\u201cHow Minimalism Brought Me Freedom and Joy,\u201dis emblematic of the budding genre, from its author (a wealthy serial entrepreneur, James Altucher) to its thesis (own fewer things, mostly gadgets) to its one-sentence paragraphs. Altucher explains that he gave up his permanent home, life goals and negative emotions. He threw away his college diploma, which had been gathering dust in storage. (\u201cI don\u2019t hold onto all the things society tells me to hold onto.\u201d) He now carries nothing but a bag of clothes and a backpack containing a computer, an iPad and a smartphone. \u201cI have zero other possessions,\u201d he writes, and thanks to this, he has found peace as a wandering techno-ascetic \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s version of Zen monkhood.\nDespite its connotations of absence, \u201cminimalism\u201d has been popping up everywhere lately, like a bright algae bloom in the murk of postrecession America. From tiny houses to microapartments to monochromatic clothing to interior-decorating trends \u2014 picture white walls interrupted only by succulents \u2014 less now goes further than ever. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by the minimalism glut, as the word can be applied to just about anything. The nearly four million images tagged #minimalism on Instagram include white sneakers, clouds, the works of Mondrian, neon signs, crumbling brick walls and grassy fields. So long as it\u2019s stylishly austere, it seems, it\u2019s minimalist.\nPart pop philosophy and part aesthetic, minimalism presents a cure-all for a certain sense of capitalist overindulgence. Maybe we have a hangover from pre-recession excess \u2014 McMansions, S.U.V.s, neon cocktails, fusion cuisine \u2014 and minimalism is the salutary tonic. Or perhaps it\u2019s a method of coping with recession-induced austerity, a collective spiritual and cultural cleanse because we\u2019ve been forced to consume less anyway. But as an outgrowth of a peculiarly American (that is to say, paradoxical and self-defeating) brand of Puritanical asceticism, this new minimalist lifestyle always seems to end in enabling new modes of consumption, a veritable excess of less. It\u2019s not really minimal at all.\nThe word\u2019s meaning wasn\u2019t entirely literal when it first came into being; \u201cminimalism\u201d was popularized in 1965 as an insult. In an essay for Arts Magazine, the British philosopher Richard Wollheim used it to describe a group of artists whose work was characterized by \u201cminimal art content\u201d \u2014 that is, a lack of art. Arranging bricks on a gallery floor (as Carl Andre did) or manufacturing metal boxes (Donald Judd) or fluorescent light fixtures (Dan Flavin) simply wasn\u2019t, in Wollheim\u2019s estimation, enough to make an object worthy of the title. For good reason, the artists singled out in the essay didn\u2019t identify with Wollheim\u2019s appellation. They used industrial materials to remove themselves from their work, intentionally. In their eyes, this formal frugality was a necessary correction to the heroic individualism of New York School Abstract Expressionism. (After some time, what can you see in a Pollock but Pollock himself?) But the name stuck.\nStill, the artists were maximalists of a sort: The austerity of their objects freed the viewer to experience the work in any way they wished. \u201cMinimalism can return you to this basic state where you\u2019re perceiving purely,\u201d says David Raskin, a professor of contemporary art history at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. \u201cLess is more because you strip away the familiar,\u201d opening an opportunity to see the world without preconceptions. The objects might look mundane, but rather than the plain metal box on the floor, it\u2019s the stark sensory experience the object incites that is the art, no previous knowledge necessary. The artist opens a radical infinity of possibilities. \u201cMinimalism in the 1960s was very much along the lines of taking LSD,\u201d says Miguel de Baca, an associate professor of art history at Lake Forest College.\n\u201cMinimalism\u201d was eventually canonized as an art-historical movement, but the name came to mean something different as it was adopted into consumer culture and turned into a class signifier. What was once a way artists shocked viewers became over the decades a style as delimited and consumable as any Martha Stewart tablescape. The word was defanged, no longer a critical insult and no longer a viable strategy within art \u2014 though it never quite gave up its veneer of provocation. Even austerity can be made decadent: To wealthy practitioners, minimalism is now little more than a slightly intriguing perversion, like drinking at breakfast. \u201cOne of the real problems with design-world minimalism is that it\u2019s just become a signifier of the global elite,\u201d Raskin says. \u201cThe richer you are, the less you have.\u201d\nThe minimalists\u2019 aesthetic of raw materials and aggressive simplicity leaked into fashion, design and architecture, where it became a luxury product, helped along at times by the artists themselves.Judd\u2019s SoHo loft buildingis now an icon of sanitized minimalism, open to tourists. His Chinati Foundation, a permanent installation of concrete and metal boxes in and around a decommissioned military base in Marfa, Tex., is a site of hipster pilgrimage. It even appears in Ben Lerner\u2019s \u201c10:04,\u201d a novel redolent of late-capitalist anxiety. The protagonist visits the town on an artist\u2019s residency, where he wanders the desert landscape, parties with young people and accidentally ingests ketamine \u2014 but it\u2019s Judd\u2019s installation that provides an epiphany. The sculptures, he writes, \u201ccombined to collapse my sense of inside and outside.\u201d Judd\u2019s work \u201chad itself come to contain the world.\u201d\nToday\u2019s minimalism, by contrast, is visually oppressive; it comes with an inherent pressure to conform to its precepts. Whiteness, in a literal sense, is good. Mess, heterogeneity, is bad \u2014 the opposite impulse of artistic minimalism. It is anxiety-inducing in a manner indistinguishable from other forms of consumerism, not revolutionary at all. Do I own the right things? Have I jettisoned enough of the wrong ones? In a recent interview with Apartamento magazine set against interior shots of his all-white home in Rockaway, Queens, the tastemaker and director of MoMA PS1 Klaus Biesenbach explained, \u201cI don\u2019t aim to own things.\u201d\nMinimalism is now conflated with self-optimization, the trend that also resulted in fitness trackers and Soylent (truly a minimalist food \u2014 it looks like nothing, but inspires thoughts of everything else). Often driven by technol\u00adogy, this optimization is expensive and exclusively branded by and for the elite. In Silicon Valley, the minimalism fetish can perhaps be traced back to Steve Jobs\u2019s famously austere 1980s apartment (he sat on the floor) and the attendant simplicity of Apple products. Pare down, and you, too, could run a $700 billion company.A thriving Reddit forum on minimalismdebates the worth of Muji products and which hobbies count as minimalist-appropriate, in a communal attempt to live the most effective, if perhaps not the most joyful, life.\nThese minimalist-arrivistes present it as a logical end to lifestyle, culture and even morality: If we attain only the right things, the perfect things, and forsake all else, then we will be free from the tyranny of our desires. But time often proves aesthetic permanence, as well as moral high ground, to be illusory. And already, the pendulum is swinging back.\nWriting inThe Atlantic in March,Arielle Bernstein described minimalism\u2019s ban on clutter as a \u201cprivilege\u201d that runs counter to the value ascribed to an abundance of objects by those who have suffered from a lack of them \u2014 less-empowered people like refugees or immigrants. The movement, such as it is, is led in large part by a group of men who gleefully ditch their possessions as if to disavow the advantages by which they obtained them. But it takes a lot to be minimalist: social capital, a safety net and access to the internet. The technology we call minimalist might fit in our pockets, but it depends on a vast infrastructure of grim, air-conditioned server farms and even grimmer Chinese factories. As Lerner\u2019s protagonist observes in \u201c10:04,\u201d even a dull convenience like a can of instant coffee grounds reaches him thanks to a fragile and tremendously wasteful network of global connections, a logistics chain that defies all logic, one undergirded by exploited laborers and vast environmental degradation.\nThere\u2019s an arrogance to today\u2019s minimalism that presumes it provides an answer rather than, as originally intended, a question: What other perspectives are possible when you look at the world in a different way? The fetishized austerity and performative asceticism of minimalism is a kind of ongoing cultural sickness. We misinterpret material renunciation, austere aesthetics and blank, emptied spaces as symbols of capitalist absolution, when these trends really just provide us with further ways to serve our impulse to consume more, not less."
