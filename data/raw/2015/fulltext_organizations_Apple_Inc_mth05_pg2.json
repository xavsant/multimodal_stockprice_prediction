        "title": "Tech Giants Urge Obama to Reject Policies That Weaken Encryption",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A collection of tech industry giants likeFacebook,Google,Appleand Microsoft, as well as civil liberties organizations and Internet security experts, sent a letter toPresident Obamaon Tuesday warning of the unintended consequences of any policy meant to weaken the encryption technologies that protect Internet communications.\nThe White House has been weighing whether to mandate that companies use only forms of encryption that provide law enforcement with the means for unscrambled access \u2014 a so-called back door.\nCritics in the technology industry are concerned that a back door for law enforcement in the United States would be a back door for everyone, including other governments and hackers. One Yahoo executive likened the proposal to \u201cdrilling a hole in the windshield.\u201d\n\u201cWe urge you to reject any proposal that U.S. companies deliberately weaken the security of their products,\u201d the letter to President Obama said. \u201cWe request that the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology.\u201d\nGoogle, Facebook, Apple and other tech companies have been moving to encrypt customers\u2019 communications so that the government cannot monitor them without going directly to the customer. The companies\u2019 efforts have been criticized by some in law enforcement who argue the toughened encryption will stymie their investigations.\nThe White House is weighing a proposal in which parts of the key to unlock digital encryption would be held by the government, and part would be held by the companies. That system was articulated by Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, in a recent speech at Princeton University. He called for a compromise in the form of \u201ckey escrow,\u201d where the government would hold onto part of the encryption key and companies would hold onto the other, and it would be secured with \u201cmultiple locks \u2014 big locks.\u201d\nBut technologists say such a solution simply does not work. The White House\u2019s own handpicked National Security Agency review group members, several of whom signed the letter on Tuesday, also recommended that the government support efforts to advance strong encryption.\nThe letter was signed by more than 140 tech companies and dozens of civil liberty, human rights and press freedom groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. It was also signed by 60 security and policy experts including Whitfield Diffie, one of the co-inventors of the public key cryptography commonly used on the Internet today, and the former White House counterterrorism czar Richard A. Clarke, who was one of a handful of experts the White House asked to review its security policies after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden.\nApple recently switched on end-to-end encryption in its mobile operating system. Facebook turned on similar encryption in its WhatsApp messaging service. And Google has unveiled an end-to-end encryption system but has yet to turn it on as the default setting. Once it does, law enforcement will have to go directly to the user, not the companies, to read those messages.\nInside the United States, the most vocal critic of tougher encryption has been James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After Apple and Google\u2019s encryption announcements last fall, Mr. Comey told an audience that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.\u201d\n\u201cSophisticated criminals will come to count on these means of evading detection,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a closet that can\u2019t be opened. A safe that can\u2019t be cracked. And my question is, At what cost?\u201d\nBut technologists say the government\u2019s arguments hold little water. \u201cThe president has been letting his top intelligence and law enforcement officials criticize companies for making their devices more secure, and letting them suggest that Congress should pass anti-encryption, pro-back-door legislation,\u201d Kevin Bankston, the co-director of New America\u2019s Cybersecurity Initiative, said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s despite unanimous consensus in the technical community that back doors are bad for security, and despite lawmakers clearly signaling that they think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\nAt a security conference last month, the nation\u2019s leading cryptographers sharply criticized the notion that the government has a safe way to read encrypted communications. \u201cTechnically speaking, there\u2019s a serious misunderstanding about key escrow,\u201d said Ron Rivest, one of the inventors of the widely used RSA encryption algorithm. \u201cThe head of the N.S.A. is misusing this idea.\u201d\nPaul Kocher, president of Rambus\u2019s Cryptography Research division, said the government was mistaken in believing it could apply the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires telecommunications companies to build allowances for law enforcement surveillance into cryptographic software.\n\u201cThe amount of information that intelligence officials are collecting \u2014 even if some sources go dark \u2014 is dramatically more than it\u2019s been in history,\u201d Mr. Kocher said at a security conference last month. \u201cThe idea that we need to stop rolling out technology to keep our industries and businesses safe to keep a few sources from going dark is certainly not a trade-off.\u201d"

        "title": "A Murky Road Ahead for Android, Despite Market Dominance",
        "fulltext": "In 2005,Googlebought a tiny mobile software company named Android, and almost nobody in the technology industry saw its potential \u2014 not even Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s chairman and then chief executive. \u201cOne day Larry and Sergey bought Android, and I didn\u2019t even notice,\u201d Mr. Schmidttold reporters in 2009, referring to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s founders.\nA company spokesman later assured me that Mr. Schmidt was joking; Android reportedly cost at least $50 million, a big enough sum for the chief to get involved. But the joke suggests how little regard even Google\u2019s executives held for Android a decade ago. Android, software that runs smartphones, tablets and a variety of other machines, was a side bet, and few considered it consequential to the search company\u2019s fortunes.\nThings have changed. In an era ruled by portable computers, Android has become essential to Google\u2019s future. Like an unstoppable friendly bacteria advancing upon a powerless host planet, Android, in the last five years, has colonized much of the known world. Android is now not just the globe\u2019s most popular smartphone operating system but the most popular operating system of any kind. More than a billion Android devices were sold in 2014,according to the research firm Gartner. That\u2019s about five times the number ofAppleiOS devices sold, and about three times the number of Windows machines sold.\nIn other words: About one of every two computers sold today is running Android. Google\u2019s once underappreciated side bet has become Earth\u2019s dominant computing platform.\nYet all is not well on planet Android. On the eve of Google IO, the company\u2019s annual developer conference that starts Thursday, where Android will once again be a primary topic of discussion, cracks are emerging in Google\u2019s hold over the operating system. Google\u2019s version of Android faces increasing competition from hungry rivals, including upstart smartphone makers in developing countries that are pushing their own heavily modified take on the software. There are also new threats from Apple, which has said that its recent record number ofiPhonesales came, in part, thanks to people switching from Android.\nHanging over these concerns is the question of the bottom line. Despite surging sales, profits in the Android smartphone business declined 44 percent in 2014,according tothe independent analyst Chetan Sharma. Over the holidays last year, according to the research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple vacuumed up nearly 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone business. The stark numbers prompted a troubling question for Android and for Google: How will the search company \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 ever make much money from Android?\nGoogle is sanguine about Android\u2019s prospects and said the company\u2019s original vision for Android was never solely about huge profits. \u201cThe bet that Larry, Sergey and Eric made at the time was that smartphones are going to be a thing, there\u2019s going to be Internet on it, so let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a great smartphone platform out there that people can use to, among other things, access Google services,\u201d said Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google\u2019s vice president for engineering for Android.\nGoogle points out that its bet has benefited users. The fact that Google does not charge for Android, and that few phone manufacturers are extracting much of a profit from Android devices, means that much of the globe now enjoys decent smartphones and online services for low prices. So we should all be thankful for Google\u2019s largess \u2014 but, at the same time,given the increasing threats to Google\u2019s advertising business, we might also wonder how long that largess can continue.\nGoogle faces several major Android-related headaches. First, while Google makes most of its revenue from advertising, Android has so far been an ad dud compared with Apple\u2019s iOS, whose users tend to have more money and spend a lot more time on their phones (and are, thus, more valuable to advertisers). Because Google pays billions to Apple to make its search engine the default search provider for iOS devices, the company collects much more from ads placed on Apple devices than from ads on Android devices. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs estimated that Google collected about $11.8 billion on mobile search ads in 2014, with about 75 percent coming from ads on iPhones and iPads.\nA brighter spot for Google is the revenue it collects from sales via Android\u2019s app store, called Google Play. For years, Android apps were a backwater, but sales have picked up lately. In 2014, Google Play sold about $10 billion in apps, of which Google kept about $3 billion (the rest was paid out to developers). Apple makes more from its App Store. Sales there exceeded $14 billion in 2014, and rising iPhone sales in China have led toa growing app haul for Apple. Still, Google\u2019s app revenue is becomingan increasingly meaningful piece of its overall business, and it is also growing rapidly.\nGoogle is investing heavily to make sure that continues. Purnima Kochikar, business development director for Google Play, told me her team supporting Android app makers grew \u201cby 15 times\u201d in the last two and a half years. She added that even if hot Silicon Valley start-ups still create apps for iOS first, app makers in other parts of the world see Android as a surer path to the masses. \u201cThe reality is that folks like you should play a role in educating the Silicon Valley,\u201d she said.\nBut how long Google can expect Play to keep paying remains an open question, thanks to the second Android-related headache. Google\u2019s strategy of giving Android to phone makers free has led to a surge of new entrants in the phone business, several of which sell high-quality phones for cut-rate prices. Among those is Xiaomi, a Chinese start-up making phones that have become some of the most popular devices in China.\nBecause Xiaomi and others don\u2019t make much of a profit by selling phones, they\u2019re all looking for other ways to make money \u2014 and for many, the obvious business is in apps offering mail, messaging and other services that compete with Google\u2019s own moneymaking apps.\nThe situation is especially painful for Google in China, the world\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone market, where Google\u2019s apps are blocked. Even in the rest of Asia, where many low-cost phone manufacturers do include Google\u2019s apps on their phones, there\u2019s growing interest in finding some alternative to Google\u2019s version of Android. About 30 percent of Android smartphones shipped in the last quarter of 2014 were actually modified, or forked, versions of the OS that may not be very hospitable to Google\u2019s services,according to the firm ABI Research. To address this problem, last year the company began a program, Android One, to get its services on high-quality, low-priced phones aimed at the developing world.\nOne software start-up, Cyanogen, has raised about $100 million from several investors \u2014 and has signed a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Google\u2019s arch-competitor Microsoft \u2014 to sell phone makers an alternative user interface that works on top of Google\u2019s Android.\n\u201cWe share services revenue with the phone makers \u2014 and today they get very little of that from Google,\u201d said Kirt McMaster, Cyanogen\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere are very few companies in the world today that really like Google. Nobody wants Google to run the table with this game. So it\u2019s a good time to be a neutral third party. We\u2019re Switzerland, and we want to share that revenue with our ecosystem partners in a meaningful way.\u201d\nGoogle, for its part, said there was ample room in the Android world for a variety of services to thrive. \u201cIt\u2019s up to any party in these ecosystems to figure out how they want to make money,\u201d Mr. Lockheimer said.\nThe final threat for Google\u2019s Android may be the most pernicious: What if a significant number of the people who adopted Android as their first smartphone move on to something else as they become power users? In Apple\u2019s last two earnings calls, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, reported \u201ca higher rate of switchers than we\u2019ve experienced in previous iPhone cycles.\u201d Apple has not specified the rate of switching, but a survey by Cowen & Company found that 16 percent of people who bought the latest iPhones previously owned Android devices; in China, that rate was 29 percent.\nFor Google, this may not be terrible news in the short run. If Google already makes more from ads on iOS than Android, growth in iOS might actually be good for Google\u2019s bottom line. Still, in the long run, the rise of Android switching sets up a terrible path for Google \u2014 losing the high-end of the smartphone market to the iPhone, while the low end is under greater threat from noncooperative Android players like Xiaomi and Cyanogen.\nAndroid has always been a tricky strategy; now, after finding huge success, it seems only to be getting even trickier."

        "title": "Bill Gates, Andy Grove and Steve Jobs: The Strategies They Shared",
        "fulltext": "In retrospect, things look easy, even obvious. Microsoft, Intel and Apple all rose to dominance as if their fates were inevitable.\nOf course, it never looks so clear as it\u2019s happening. Shelves full of books have been written about these three companies and the outsized personalities who built them \u2014 Bill Gates, Andy Grove and Steve\n                                        Jobs. In a new book, David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, and Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, are adding to\n                                        that literature by applying a strategic framework to the corporate handiwork of the three, and find common themes. They call these shared features\u201cStrategy Rules,\u201dwhich is also the title of the book.\nMr. Yoffie and Mr. Cusumano have been studying these companies for nearly three decades and have been collaborating off and on for decades. Initially, Mr. Yoffie was a specialist in corporate strategy, while Mr. Cusumano\n                                        was an expert in software development and managing product teams. \u201cDavid was developing high-level strategy, and I was focused on, O.K., how do you get this stuff done,\u201d Mr. Cusumano recalled.\nThe two have a reputation for taking more than an academic approach to their research, doing a lot of first-hand reporting. Mr. Cusumano dug into the workings of Microsoft for a 1995 book, written with Richard W. Selby,\n                                        \u201cMicrosoft Secrets.\u201d And the Mr. Cusumano and Mr. Yoffie collaborated on a 1998 book that scrutinized the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape, \u201cCompeting on Internet Time.\u201d That\n                                        book was published just as the federal government\u2019s antitrust suit against Microsoft was coming to court. Microsoft obtained an early copy of the manuscript and tried to subpoena copies of the authors\u2019\n                                        transcripts from their interviews with 44 current and former Netscape employees for the book. A federal judge later denied that request.\nAs for insider access, it certainly helps that Mr. Yoffie is a long-time board member of Intel. The new book benefits from interviews with Mr. Grove and other former executives at Intel, Microsoft and Apple.\nThe handful of guidelines in the book, which flow from detailed observations of Mr. Gates, Mr. Grove and Mr. Jobs, include combining long-term vision with the steps needed to get there (\u201cLook Forward, Reason\n                                        Back\u201d) and building an organization that exploits a leader\u2019s strengths (\u201cShape the Company Around Your Personal Anchor\u201d).\nYet what really made these companies huge winners was understanding and applying the dynamics of high-tech markets (\u201cBuild PlatformsandEcosystems\u201d). In digital-age competition, the long goal\n                                        is to establish an industry-spanning platform rather than merely products. It is platforms that yield the lucrative flywheel of network effects, complementary products and services and increasing returns. The payoff\n                                        is market power and huge profits.\nMr. Yoffie and Mr. Cusumano have been studying the impact of the snowballing phenomena as case studies in industry since the 1990s, as these principles of market behavior were also identified in early research by economists\n                                        including Garth Saloner, Carl Shapiro, Michael Katz and W. Brian Arthur.\nThe Windows operating system was one such platform almost from the outset, and the Intel industry-standard microprocessor would become one. Under Mr. Jobs, the authors note, Apple was long a product-first company. He\n                                        preferred beautifully designed products that worked in splendid isolation. But even he eventually grasped the value of platforms. In October 2003, Apple released iTunes for Windows, so Apple\u2019s hit iPod music\n                                        player could enter the larger market of PC users. \u201cApple\u2019s fortunes changed forever,\u201d Mr. Yoffie and Mr. Cusumano write. In June 2007, after initially resisting, Mr. Jobs announced that outside\n                                        developers would be allowed to create software applications for the iPhone. Soon, its App Store took off.\n\u201cBill Gates got it immediately,\u201d Mr. Yoffie said. \u201cIt took Andy Grove 10 years to figure it out, and 20 years for Steve Jobs.\u201d\n\u201cJobs was always a product first, platform second kind of guy,\u201d Mr. Yoffie added. \u201cBut he figured it out eventually.\u201d\nMr. Yoffie and Mr. Cusumano write of \u201cstriking parallels\u201d between the early high-tech leaders and four members of the next generation, who they write about briefly: Larry Page of Google, Mark Zuckerberg\n                                        of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and Huateng Ma of Tencent, a leading Chinese Internet company. They all, the authors point out, have a deep understanding of technology and \u201cplatform thinking.\u201d\nThe authors\u2019 emphasis on the pivotal role of platform strategy raises questions about the long-term prospects for Apple, the reluctant platform adopter. In the book and in interviews, the authors say this could\n                                        be the company\u2019s Achilles heel someday. The market share of the companies in Android camp for smartphones and tablets \u2014 using software Google distributes for free \u2014 is 80 percent, more than\n                                        five times that of Apple\u2019s iOS software. And if the Apple Watch, they say, is to become a \u201cpersonal digital platform,\u201d the company must open it up to work with all smartphones, not only iPhones\n                                        \u2014 just as Apple eventually opened up the iPod to work with PCs as well as Macs.\nStill, while the Android camp rules in market share, Apple harvests most of the profits in the smartphone market. \u201cPlatform theory has always looked at market share, but Apple has taught us to look at profits\n                                        too,\u201d Mr. Cusumano said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly made me think twice about market share.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in print on 05/18/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: The Common DNA of 3 Tech Giants ."

        "title": "Hiding Smartphone Photo Location Information",
        "fulltext": "\nQ.Is it true a smartphone can embed map coordinates in the photos you take with it?\nA.Smartphones have the ability to capture a lot of information about each photo snapped, including the camera\u2019s settings at the time and place the picture was taken. This material is commonly called \u201cmetadata\u201d or the\u201cEXIF data\u201d(short for Exchangeable Image File) and it is stored within the image file itself. You can see the coordinates with a program that displays EXIF data, or even by looking at the photo\u2019s Properties or Info box on a Windows PC or Mac.\nHaving this information can be great if you want to easily arrange your geotagged photos on an online map, but not if you have privacy concerns. Someone could, in theory, copy the photo\u2019s listed longitude and latitude coordinates (like 40\u00b0 44\u2019 52.8\u201d N 73\u00b0 59\u2019 6\u201d W) into a program like Bing Maps and pinpoint the location in seconds. (Many social media sites,including Twitter, do strip out EXIF data from photos posted online.)\nTo stick with undisclosed locations, turn the GPS feature off entirely while you are taking pictures. Open your phone\u2019s Settings icon and select Location (onAndroidandWindows Phone) or Privacy (oniOS 8) to get to the controls for Location Services.\nIf you prefer to leave the Location Services feature on because you use it for other programs, you can prevent your phone\u2019s camera app from using the information. The steps may vary based on the phone and the app involved, but if you do not see controls for the camera app in the Location Services area, check the separate settings for the camera app.\nFinding Dried-Up YouTube Streams\nQ.The YouTube app that came with my Smart TV no longer works. Is there anything I can do?\nA.YouTubehas been doing something of an internal overhaul latelyand according toa note on its Help site, it no longer supports older versions of its app used by certain smart televisions, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes and mobile devices. If your Smart TV was made in 2012 or earlier, it is likely among those products left by the wayside. First- and second-generation Apple TV boxes, devices running iOS 5 and earlier, and the Sony PlayStation Vita have also been shut out.\nMost smart television sets, Blu-ray players, game consoles and other gadgets made in 2013 or later (including the third-generation Apple TV) should still work with the built-in YouTube app. You may have to update the software in the device\u2019s settings area.\nIf your TV is one of the older models \u2014 but it has a web browser that supports HTML 5 or Adobe Flash \u2014 you might still be able to watch YouTube from its website. If not, investing in an inexpensive streaming device like theAmazon Fire TV StickorGoogle Chromecastcan return YouTube to your TV.\nTIP OF THE WEEK:Tired of flat overhead views in your Google Maps when you leave the Satellite mode? In theGoogle Maps appfor Android and iOS, press two fingers and drag them up on the screen totilt the angle of the current mapand get more depth and a different perspective. You can still pinch and zoom in for a close-up in the tilted view, and use two fingers to spin the map around.\nWhen you zoom in the tilted view, you can also see 3-D models of the buildings Google has added to many maps in populated areas, especially tall buildings in major cities. When you want to switch back to the flat, roadmap-style map view, drag your fingers from the top toward the bottom of the screen."

She has already announced formal antitrust charges against Google and the Russian energy giant Gazprom, and the companies could face huge fines and orders to change their business practices.\nBut Ms. Vestager said she was no longer on track to make a decision by late spring in the tax cases, which include an inquiry into Starbucks and a unit of the car company Fiat.\nThere was \u201can ambition to do all four cases before the end of the second quarter,\u201d Ms. Vestager said after giving testimony at the European Parliament to a committee looking into tax issues. \u201cIt is now obvious, with the problems that we\u2019ve been having to get information, this is not possible.\u201d\nAnother reason for the delay was to avoid making \u201cspeed too high a priority,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.

Instead, the European Commission would impose an order on the country that granted the aid.\nApple could be required to pay back huge sums to Dublin, while Amazon and Fiat could have to make payments to Luxembourg. A ruling against the Netherlands would leave the government facing an order to collect large sums from Starbucks.\n\u201cThere is no deadline, but we will get there, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cFast is always better than slow, but it\u2019s always best to be just.\u201d"

The man answers the call with a gesture of his hand.\n\u201cHi,\u201d his mother says over the car speakers. \u201cI just wanted to say I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d the man responds, and then, before signing off, \u201cI\u2019m making a video right now.\u201d\nThat video \u2014 the one posted on YouTube \u2014 was a promotion commissioned by Navdy, one of a handful of start-up companies bringing a futuristic spin to the debate over distracted driving, and how to curb it. The devices project driving information and data streamed from a smartphone into a driver\u2019s field of view. There are several versions of this nascent technology, but they generally work by using a projection device that wirelessly picks up information from the phone and uses sophisticated optics to allow the information \u2014 maps, speed, incoming texts, caller identification and even social media notifications \u2014 to hover above the dashboard.Hand gesturesor voice commands allow drivers to answer a call or hang up.\nThis technology is in its infancy. Navdy\u2019s device isn\u2019t shipping until later this year, and it\u2019s not clear if it will work as seamlessly as presented in the video when used in less perfect real-life conditions. But, broadly speaking, the Navdy device falls into a booming category of in-car gadgetry that might be fairly categorized as \u201cyou can have your cake and eat it too.\u201d Drive, get texts, talk on the phone, even interact on social media, and do it all without compromising safety, according to various makers of the so-called head-up displays, repeating a position taken by a growing number of automakers who sell monitors set into the dashboard or mounted on it. Some carmakers also display basic driving information, like speed and turn-by-turn directions, within a specialized windshield so a driver can remain looking ahead and not down at the instrument panel.\nGooglewith Android Auto andApple, with CarPlay, have also leapt into the evolving business. Each allows phones to be plugged into a car\u2019s USB port so that information streams to a monitor set into the dashboard. IHS Automotive, a company that analyzes car industry trends,expectsmany automakers to integrate these systems. IHS consumer surveys indicate drivers want systems that provide maps, music, news and social connection.\nThese emerging display devices have become part of a debate over whether technology can provide safer ways for people to multitask while driving. Safety advocates argue that technologies that try to minimize the dangers of multitasking are based on the false premise that drivers can safely attend to the road while juggling social communication \u2014 and are, in turn, encouraging a risky behavior.\nThe argument on the other side boils down to a simple notion: Drivers are going to do it anyway, so why not minimize the riskiest kinds of multitasking, like looking down at the phone or handling it?\nPeople use their phones too compulsively to expect them to stop, said Nagraj Kashyap, senior vice president for ventures and innovation at Qualcomm Ventures, an investing arm of the telecom giant, which recently injected $3 million into Navdy. \u201cTo completely eliminate it is a pipe dream,\u201d Mr. Kashyap said of motorist multitasking. \u201cThe best way to handle it is to make it as safe as you can.\u201d\nThe federal government has issued nonbinding guidelines that govern car \u201cinfotainment systems,\u201d and one of its main messages is that performing certain nondriving tasks interferes inherently with a driver\u2019s safety. Experts in the science of attention say that some of the new head-up displays may be raising risks that are so plain that you don\u2019t need to be a driver\u2019s mother to appreciate them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible idea,\u201d said Paul Atchley, a psychologist at the University of Kansas who studies driver distraction. Attending to the road is much more complex than having your head turned toward it, he said. \u201cThe technology is driven by a false assumption that seeing requires nothing more than having the eyes fixed on the right spot.\u201d\nNavdy, which is based in San Francisco, has raised $26.8 million, said Doug Simpson, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive. Mr. Simpson is a computer scientist who spent 10 years at Hewlett-Packard. Even though the company\u2019s $299 device isn\u2019t shipping until later this year, it has already received $6 million in preorders, Mr. Simpson said.\nMr. Simpson said he got the idea for the device during a trip to Bangkok. Like many visitors, he was trying to figure out a map on his phone while driving on unfamiliar streets. He narrowly escaped rear-ending another car.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Mr. Simpson\u2019s aha moment started with navigation. Maps, driving directions and other driving-focused information are important features of many of these products, the idea being that any task that relates to driving should be done as safely as possible. Part of what has created an opening for products like Navdy is a sentiment among many consumers that the navigation and touch-screen systems built into many cars are wonky, and research shows that voice command systems can be so inaccurate that they create distraction.\nAt the same time, though, the developers of head-up displays also are making a major selling point of aiding motorists with tasks that have nothing to do with driving.\nThe Navdy device is roughly the shape and size of a hand-held CD player and mounts on the dashboard. From its top unfolds a small transparent screen through which information streamed from the phone is projected: speed, map information and notifications of incoming calls and texts that include the identity of the sender, but not the text itself. To answer a call, the driver swipes a hand in the air, or slides it across the steering wheel, a gesture picked up by the dashboard device in somewhat the same way a Nintendo Wii console works.\nThe image will look to the driver a bit like a hologram floating about five and a half feet in front of the windshield, Mr. Simpson said, roughly where the front of the car meets the road. \u201cIt\u2019s safer than looking down at the dashboard or at an image on your phone,\u201d he added.\nIn the YouTube video commissioned by Navdy, the driver (who owns the company that made the video), says the technology is \u201cjust like what commercial airline pilots use when they\u2019re landing.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou hear that? Pilots use it. It\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\u201cNot true,\u201d countered Christopher Wickens, a professor at Colorado State University and one of the leading experts in the country in safe use of head-up displays for transportation. Dr. Wickens said that the head-up displays used by airplanes show only information critical to flying, like an outline of the runway or the horizon, and crucially, that information is often displayed as a visual overlay with the actual runway or horizon. By contrast, a head-up display in the car that gives nondriving information that is out of alignment with the road \u201cis the worst of two worlds,\u201d Dr. Wickens said. \u201cIt is clutter, contributing to potential failure and distraction contributing to potential failure.\u201d\nHe said that when the information projected is related to driving and made simple \u2014 like speed or a navigation arrow \u2014 it appears from his research to provide a modest safety advantage. But the social information \u201ccounteracts, takes away\u201d any small benefit the driver might get from driving information that is properly aligned.\nAnother company seeking to draw the airline parallel is WayRay, which has its headquarters in Switzerland. It plans to start selling a device that displays data that is not just in the driver\u2019s line of sight but, the company said, appears to the driver to be at a distance from 32 feet all the way to the horizon. The company has $6 million in funding, mostly from Russian investors, and it expects to close on another round from Silicon Valley venture capitalists by the end of June, said Vitaly Ponomarev, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive.\nHe said the emphasis was on driving information, while social media applications are available at slow speeds. \u201cWhen the vehicle speed is less than 10 miles an hour, we open an additional channel, our \u2018infotainment\u2019 channel,\u201d Mr. Ponomarev said. \u201cWe can push information from any applications \u2014 Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.\u201d\nHe said the information appears slightly to the side so as not to interfere with driving and will be streamlined: \u201cPlain information, plain text, nothing flashing that distracts.\u201d\nBut neuroscientists and safety advocates said any visual clutter disturbs focus by presenting a cognitive distraction, meaning that the images take the mind off the road. Such distraction makes it extremely difficult for a driver to respond to a sudden threat.\nThere is another concern: Head-up technology focused on social media and communication creates the risk of normalizing the behavior of multitasking, \u201cas if we\u2019re telling people it\u2019s O.K. to do it,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the chief executive of the National Safety Council, a nonprofit.\nMs. Hersman was formerly the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, where she was involved in the regulation of head-up displays for airlines. That technology, she said, was permitted after extensive testing on the safest practices, but, she explained, \u201cthe same isn\u2019t true for cars.\u201d\n\u201cTech and innovation in the auto industry are moving so much faster than the regulators can keep up with it,\u201d she said. The Department of Transportation has sponsored research at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute into whether the safety benefit of having head-up displays in cars outweighs the risk of distraction; that study is expected to conclude in 2016.\nAnother take on the fledgling technology comes from a Vancouver, British Columbia, start-up called DD Technologies \u2014 started by two entrepreneurs who said they were inspired to build a head-up display after watching an \u201cIron Man\u201d movie. The company\u2019s display,Iris, which should soon be available in limited quantities, allows drivers to read the contents of a text. But the entrepreneurs say they\u2019re not encouraging the behavior \u2014 well, not exactly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying you should be texting and driving,\u201d said the company\u2019s co-founder Dino Mariutti. \u201cWe\u2019re saying you should make it safer.\u201d"
