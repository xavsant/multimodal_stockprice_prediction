        "fulltext": "(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here\u2019sthe sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest at the end of Wednesday.\n1. Voter fraud prosecution is rare, erratic and often undeserved.\nAs part of ourDemocracy Challenged series, The New York Times reviewedsome 400 voting-fraud charges filed since 2017. Often, voters didn\u2019t know they\u2019d broken a law. Serious penalties usually fell hardest on those least able to fight back: Poor and Black people were likelier to go to jail than comfortable retirees.\nIn Florida, where the governor, Ron DeSantis, has encouraged a show-no-mercy approach, a prison inmate who thought he was allowed to vote was sentenced in May to almost a full extra year in jail. But inThe Villages, a Republican-leaning retirement community, two residents arrested last winter for double voting avoided felony charges by taking a civics class.\nIn other political news:We profiled Judge Aileen Cannon, who ruled to appoint aspecial masterto review materialsDonald Trump took to Mar-a-Lago. And Steve Bannon, a onetime Trump adviser,is expected to surrenderto as-yet-unknown state charges tomorrow.\n2. Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, vowed to fulfill \u201chis duty to the end\u201din Ukraine.\nRussian forces are struggling on the front lines, the country\u2019s economy is straining under sanctions and the U.S. estimates that there have been more than 80,000 Russian casualties during the war.\nDespite these challenges, Putinstruck a confident noteat an economic conference in Vladivostok in eastern Russia, saying that \u201cwe have not lost anything and will not lose anything.\u201d\nPutin also announced that he expected tomeet next week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, an increasingly crucial ally as the Russian leader tries to expand economic ties with Asia.\nIn war news,Russia\u2019s ability touse its natural gas supply as leverage against the rest of Europe may be waningas theEuropean Commission weighs a gas price cap.\n3. Europe\u2019s protected forests are being chopped down in the name of clean energy.\nThe E.U. considers burning pellets made from wood and sawdust to be a form of renewable energy and subsidizes them. Wood is now Europe\u2019s largest renewable energy source, far ahead of wind or solar.\nBut burning wood can release more greenhouse gas emissions than burning gas, oil or coal. ATimes reporter and photographer documented clear-cuttingin one of the continent\u2019s most ecologically significant woodlands over four days in Romania\u2019s virgin forests.\nNext week, the European Parliament is scheduled to vote on a bill that would eliminate most industry subsidies and prohibit countries from burning whole trees to meet clean energy targets.\nIn other climate news,California narrowly averted rolling blackoutsduring an intense heat wave.\n4. Massachusetts might soon see its first elected female governor.\nMaura Healey won the state\u2019sDemocratic primary nominationyesterday and is favored to win in November \u2014 one of the party\u2019s best chances to flip a governor\u2019s seat. Healy and Tina Kotek, the Democrat running for governor of Oregon, could become the country\u2019s first openly lesbian governors.\nHealy was already the country\u2019s first openly gay attorney general, elected in 2014.She\u2019ll face Geoff Diehl, a right-wing former state lawmaker who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and won the Republican primary last night.\nRelated:To many Democrats\u2019 alarm,Stacey Abrams looks increasingly unlikely to oust Brian Kempas Georgia governor.\nFor more midterms coverage,listen to\u201cThe Run-Up,\u201dhosted by Astead Herndon.\n5. China\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d strategy endures,even after most of the world has learned to live with the coronavirus.\nTens of millions of Chinese are still quarantined, schools are closed, businesses are in limbo and whole cities are at a standstill. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, has turned zero Covid into an ideological issue, making use of less effective Chinese vaccines and prioritizing nationalism over the guidance of scientists.\nThe question is how long China will maintain its approach. The country\u2019s economy could hang in the balance, but any reversal would seem to undercut Xi\u2019s vision ahead of an important Communist Party meeting next month where he is all but certain to extend his rule.\nIn other Covid news,Gov. Kathy Hochul of New Yorklifted the mask mandate on New York City\u2019s public transportation.\n6. After a long delay, the portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama hang in the White House.\nThe paintings were finallyunveiled in the East Room todayat a ceremony attended by the former first couple and their successors, Joe and Jill Biden.\nThe portrait of the former president, by Robert McCurdy, is a hyper-realistic depiction, set against an empty background; the former first lady\u2019s, bySharon Sprung, shows her elegantly perched on a red couch.\nThe Trump administration broke with tradition and did not unveil the portraits of the Obamas, which were completed years ago. It is not clear whether the Biden White House will hold a ceremony to unveil the portraits of Donald and Melania Trump once they are completed.\n7. The National Football League season kicks off tomorrow night.We\u2019ve got you covered like a cornerback eyeing a wideout.\nTheTimes\u2019s 2022 season previewwill get you up to speed on all 32 teams, including Russell Wilson\u2019s move to the Denver Broncos and whether this will actually be Tom Brady\u2019s last season. (OK, we don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.)\nThe Buffalo Bills face the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams \u2014 who leadThe Athletic\u2019s Power Rankings\u2014 at 8:20 p.m. Eastern on Thursday in the season opener.\nIn other sports news,Coco GauffandNick Kyrgiosare out of the U.S. Open, and the W.N.B.A. starSue Bird has retired.\n8. Apple unveiled its new iPhone 14 and Apple Watches today.\nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Apple returned to the Steve Jobs Theaterto release product updates. At its annual marketing event, the company showed off the $800 phone\u2019s satellite capabilities for emergency situations and its improved front and rear cameras. Unlike the basic iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro, which costs $999, has a new processor as well as an updated camera.\nSharing the spotlight was the new $800 Apple Watch Ultra, aimed at serious sports enthusiasts. The price of Apple\u2019s entry-level watch, the Apple Watch SE, dropped to $250.\nApple is now manufacturing some of its iPhones outside China, partly in response to rising geopolitical tensions. But the new iPhone\u2019s development also showshow important Chinese engineers have become to the device.\n9. Wakanda\u2019s women spoke movingly of the sequel to \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d opens Nov. 11 (the July trailer drew172 million views in 24 hours). But Chadwick Boseman, who played T\u2019Challa, Wakanda\u2019s leader, died in 2020 of colon cancer. Recasting T\u2019Challa proved controversial, and the studio declined to use another actor even though viewers argued that the character was a role model for Black boys and men.\nThe movie\u2019s fierce female cast leaned on and inspired one another during a tough, grief-stricken shoot. Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Letitia Wright and othersdiscussed the experience with The Times.\n10. And finally,fashion month is \u201cback back.\u201d\nIt partially returned a year ago, writes our chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman. But lingering pandemic effects meant some designers didn\u2019t show. Now, with restrictions mostly gone, a jam-packed schedule of IRL shows will unfurl in New York, London, Milan and Paris. The four-week season will kick off with New York Fashion Week, beginning with Fendi on Friday.\nWhat\u2019s new? Japanese designers are back; NFTs are in.

        "title": "How China Has Added to Its Influence Over the iPhone",
        "fulltext": "This fall, Apple will make some of its flagship iPhones outside China for the first time, a small but significant change for a company that has built one of the most sophisticated supply chains in the world with the help of the Chinese authorities. But the development of the iPhone 14, which was unveiled on Wednesday, shows how complicated it will be for Apple to truly untangle itself from China.\nMore than ever, Apple\u2019s Chinese employees and suppliers contributed complex work and sophisticated components for the 15th year of its marquee device, including aspects of manufacturing design, speakers and batteries, according to four people familiar with the new operations and analysts. As a result, the iPhone has gone from being a product that is designed in California and made in China to one that is a creation of both countries.\nThe critical work provided by China reflects the country\u2019s advancements over the past decade and a new level of involvement for Chinese engineers in the development of iPhones. After the country lured companies to its factories with legions of low-priced workers and unrivaled production capacity, its engineers and suppliers have moved up the supply chain to claim a bigger slice of the money that U.S. companies spend to create high-tech gadgets.\nThe increased responsibilities that China has assumed for the iPhone could challenge Apple\u2019s efforts to decrease its dependency on the country, a goal that has taken on increased urgency amid rising geopolitical tensions over Taiwan and simmering concerns in Washington about China\u2019s ascent as a technology competitor.\nChinese companies with operations in India will still play a key role inApple\u2019s plan to make some iPhonesin the country. In Chennai, India, the Taiwanese supplier Foxconn, which already manufactures iPhones in factories throughout China, will lead Indian workers\u2019 assembly of the device with support from nearby Chinese suppliers including Lingyi iTech, which has subsidiaries to supply chargers and other components for iPhones, according to two people familiar with the plans. China\u2019s BYD is setting operations to cut glass for displays, as well, these people said.\n\u201cThey want to diversify, but it\u2019s a hard road,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, a technology research firm. \u201cThey depend on China for so much.\u201d\nApple declined to comment. Foxconn, BYD and Lingyi iTech didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nCovid-related disruptions have exacerbated Apple\u2019s predicament. When China closed its borders in 2020, Apple was forced to overhaul its operations and abandon its practice of flying hordes of California-based engineers to China to design the assembly process for flagship iPhones.\nInstead of subjecting staff to lengthy quarantines, Apple began empowering and hiring more Chinese engineers in Shenzhen and Shanghai to lead critical design elements for its best-selling product, according to the four people familiar with the operations.\nThe company\u2019s manufacturing and product design teams began holding late-night video calls with counterparts in Asia. After travel resumed, Apple tried to encourage its staff to return to China by offering a stipend of $1,000 a day during the two weeks of quarantine and four weeks of work, these people said. Though the payout could be as much as $50,000, many engineers were reluctant to go because of uncertainty over how long they would have to quarantine.\nIn the absence of travel, the company has encouraged staff in Asia to lead meetings that colleagues in California once led, these people said. The staff also assumed responsibility for the selection of some Asian suppliers of future iPhone parts.\nThe company is now increasingly tapping China to supply high-wage workers to do these jobs, these people said. This year, Apple has posted 50 percent more jobs in China than it did during all of 2020, according to GlobalData, which tracks hiring trends across tech. Many of those new hires are Western-educated Chinese citizens, these people said.\nThe change in the way Apple works has coincided with an increase in the number of Chinese suppliers it uses. A little over a decade ago, China contributed little value to the production of an iPhone. It primarily provided the low-wage workers who assembled the device with components shipped in from the United States, Japan and South Korea. The work accounted for about $6 \u2014 or 3.6 percent \u2014 of the iPhone\u2019s value, according toa study by Yuqing Xing, an economics professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.\nGradually, China nurtured homegrown suppliers that began to displace Apple\u2019s suppliers from around the world. Chinese companies began making speakers, cutting glass, providing batteries and manufacturing camera modules. Its suppliers now account for more than 25 percent of the value of an iPhone, according to Mr. Xing.\nThe gains illustrate how China has expanded its mastery of the smartphone supply chain, said Dan Wang, an analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics, an independent economic research firm. \u201cThat trend isn\u2019t slowing down,\u201d he said.\nThrough most of the pandemic, China has rewarded Apple\u2019s reliance on the country for manufacturing. Its steady production \u2014 even as other countries\u2019 shut down for periods in 2020 and 2021 \u2014 helped Apple increase its smartphone market share and sell its most iPhones ever, according to analysts, a remarkable achievement for a decades-old electronics device that has shifted from offering revolutionary innovations to incremental improvements.\nThis year, analysts expect Apple to release four iPhones that have smaller notches for its Face ID feature than previous models. It is unveiling the phones a week earlier than usual, which could boost revenue in the current quarter by adding a week of sales. It also is expected to increase the price of its iPhone 14 Pro models by $100 to more than $1,600 to offset the higher costs of some components.\nApple expects the iPhone 14 to build on the success of past years. While other smartphone manufacturers are cutting production as the global economy sputters, Apple has called for its suppliers to make more phones than it did a year ago, according to Susquehanna International Group, a financial firm.\nThe increased manufacturing order is a testament to the resilience of Apple\u2019s affluent customers, whose deep pockets allow them to buy high-priced smartphones despite rising inflation and the economic downturn.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge wealth gap in consumer spending in the smartphone industry,\u201d said Wayne Lam, a tech analyst with CCS Insight. \u201cApple is safe relative to the competition.\u201d\nWhen the news media and employees gather Wednesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., for the product\u2019s debut, Apple will accentuate the phone\u2019s abilities \u2014 not how it\u2019s made. The only signs of changes to that process will be visible in the flights coming and going from nearby San Francisco International Airport.\nApple once spent $150 million annually on flights with United Airlines,according to a United promotional banner. Former employees recall that before the pandemic, they boarded flights to Shanghai and Hong Kong in which business class seats were filled with people who worked at Apple.\nNow, United no longer offers nonstop flights from San Francisco to Hong Kong. It flies direct to Shanghai four days a week."

        "title": "Apple, the Ad Critic, Now Embraces Ads",
        "fulltext": "For years, Apple has been aloudcriticof onlineadvertisingthat relies on hogging as much information about us as possible. Now, the company wants to become a bigger seller of online ads, and says it can do so in a less creepy way.\nThe question is: Can Apple successfully sell online ads without the ick?\nThis will be a test \u2014 with us as real-world subjects \u2014 of whether there can be a future of digital advertising that gobbles less of our information, or whether the status quo is too powerful to change.\nApple\u2019s goal is possible, digital advertising experts told me, but it won\u2019t be easy.\nMany companies, including Google, Facebook and obscure data middlemen, track our phones wherever we roam, record all the websites and apps we use and match up bits of seemingly small details like how much battery life is left on our phones.\nThey do this mostly to fine-tune pitches forbutt flap pajamasand other stuff, or tosell our data in bulkin ways wecan\u2019t imagine.\nThe digital advertising system is ugly but lucrative, partly because it works. Apple relies far less on these common online methods of tracking, but it might need to bend to this reality if it wants to become a bigger ad player. Plus, Apple\u2019s campaign tocrack downon existing ad methodsandsell its own ads opens the company to criticism that it\u2019s acting hypocritical.\nLet me explain why Apple wants to go bigger in ads, how the company approaches advertising and how our digital experiences might change.\nWhy does Apple want to sell more ads?\nBecause money.\nIt\u2019s incredibly profitable for Apple to sell ads when people search the iPhone App Store for fitness apps or read articles in the Apple News app.\nApple won\u2019t mention it on Wednesday when itintroduces new iPhone models, but the company wants more ways to earn income to keep growing assales of smartphones stagnate.Bloomberg NewsandThe Financial Timeshave recently reported that Apple plans to expand its advertising business, including by potentially showing commercials in Apple Maps and other sites and apps.\nOther companies that haven\u2019t made money from ads, such as Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart, are increasingly trying theseadvertising side hustles, too.\nHow Apple\u2019s ads are different.\nEverything we click, everywhere we go with our phones and many of our personal details have become commodities to tailor advertisements to us.\nThis might lead to lower prices because businesses know that I am more likely to respond to an ad for a cycling vacation than my neighbor, who is not so enamored with biking.\nBut more consumers, lawmakers, regulators and companies want toput limits on this data arms race. Many of us feel unnerved by digital snooping but don\u2019t really have a choice.\nApple offers an alternative \u2014 to a point.\nOne hypothetical example: The maker of a video game app can tell Apple that it wants to show ads in the app storefront to women using iPads in San Francisco who had previously downloaded an app from the same company.\nUnlike many other companies, Apple won\u2019t let that app maker single out people who recently visited the website of a competing video game or people whose email addresses are on file with the app developer.\nPlus, Apple doesn\u2019t permit ads that will reach fewer than 5,000 people, and it tailors ads to groups of people rather than individuals.\nApple also says that a vast majority of ads on its devices are shown to people who choose the option of not seeing any personalized ads. Those people still see ads, but the ads aren\u2019t tailored to them.\nThe limits of Apple\u2019s approach.\nSeveral digital ad experts told me that if Apple wants to be a bigger player among data-hungry ad sellers, it will have to compete in a reality in which it\u2019s normal to harvest any morsel of our data if it might help sell socks.\nTo appeal to advertisers, Apple might be pressured to be more intrusive and do things like recommend apps based on what other apps you use or what you do in those apps.\nApple says that it won\u2019t do this, and that its ads that aren\u2019t personalized to people\u2019s interestsare no less effective.\nEven so, the more ads that Apple sells, the more it encounters potential conflicts.\nLast year, when Apple started giving iPhone ownersthe option to block apps sharing people\u2019s information with other companies, ad sellers including Facebook and Snap had to rebuild their advertising systems. Some smaller businesses that advertise to customers online said that Apple\u2019s changes hurt them. But that and other changes in digital advertising are empowering ad sellers like Apple, Google and Amazon thatalready have reams of data about us.\nThat said, experts I spoke to said that Apple was mostly genuine about its commitment to steering digital life away from relying on collecting as much information as possible. One big question is whether Apple can stick to its principles to protect people and still make all the money it wants.\nThe drugstore will now make house calls:CVS Health agreed to buy Signify Health for $8 billion, my colleague Lauren Hirsch reported. Signify makes technology and data tools that help thousands of doctors offer in-home health care.\nKiwi Farms, an online message board where people organized harassment campaigns, was essentially taken offline.NBC Newsand the newsletterGarbage Dayexplained the harm that rippled from people on the site.

        "title": "Tech Companies Slowly Shift Production Away From China",
        "fulltext": "In the coming weeks, Apple and Google will unveil their latest generation of smartphones, jockeying to distinguish the new devices from previous models. But one of the most significant changes will go largely unnoticed by consumers: Some of these phones will not bemade in China.\nA very small portion of Apple\u2019s latest iPhones will be made in India, and part of Google\u2019s newest Pixel phone production will be done in Vietnam, people familiar with their plans said.\nThe shift is a response to growing concerns about the geopolitical tensions and pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that have involved China in the last few years. China has long been the world\u2019s factory floor for high-tech electronics, unrivaled in its ability to secure legions of high-skilled workers and the production capacity to handle demand for the next hot device.\nBut American companies are seeing more risk there \u2014 a perspective forged during the Trump-era trade war, with its tit-for-tat tariffs, and cemented by China\u2019s saber-rattling after Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan last month. They fear that basing a supply chain largely in China may thrust them into the middle of its escalating conflict with the United States over Taiwan.\nChina is still, by far, the most dominant consumer electronics manufacturer. But it\u2019s not just smartphone production that is moving out the country. Apple is producing iPads in northern Vietnam. Microsoft has shipped Xbox game consoles this year from Ho Chi Minh City. Amazon has been making Fire TV devices in Chennai, India. Several years ago, all of these products were made in China.\nOn Wednesday, China announced that factory activity contracted for a second straight month in August, according to the country\u2019s closely watched survey of purchasing managers.\n\u201cThe empire of manufacturing in China is being shaken,\u201d said Lior Susan, founder of Eclipse Venture Capital, which invests in hardware and manufacturing start-ups. \u201cMore and more capital is going to pull manufacturing out of China and find an alternative.\u201d\nThe fracturing supply chain is rippling across Asia, causing a spike in industrial land prices in Vietnam,a revival of manufacturing in Malaysiaanda surge in demand for low-wage workersin India. For China, it is siphoning away manufacturing activity when the country is reeling fromits slowest economic growthin decades.\n\u201cEveryone is thinking about moving, even if they\u2019re not acting yet,\u201d said Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, founder of Instrumental, a Bay Area company that remotely monitors assembly lines for electronics companies.\nWhen the first outbreak of Covid-19 shut down factories in China in early 2020, the closures roiled sales plans for many companies, including Apple, which had to cut its quarterly sales forecast because it couldn\u2019t make iPhones.\nThe company\u2019s operations team started to look at alternative manufacturing locations to hedge against future shutdowns in China, said three former employees, who asked not to be identified because they are not permitted to speak about their work at the company.\nVietnam, which Apple had already earmarked for AirPods production in 2020, became a much-discussed option, one of the people said. Since then, Apple has started producing its watch in the country and moved some iPad manufacturing there. In Apple\u2019s most recent list of its top 200 suppliers, 20 use factories in Vietnam. By comparison, 155 of the companies operate factories in China.\nApple plans to assemble and package a small fraction of this year\u2019s iPhone 14, the company\u2019s flagship device, in India for the first time. While most of the initial and most critical production for that device is happening in China, Apple will move some of its overall iPhone production to India later \u2014 mainly as a way to assess the ability for future manufacturing there, two people familiar with the plans said.\nEven as Apple pushed ahead with plans, the company was careful not to antagonize China\u2019s ruling Communist Party since the vast majority of its products are still made there. As China carried out military drills around Taiwan during Ms. Pelosi\u2019s visit, Apple reminded its Taiwanese suppliers to label components destined for China as made in \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d or \u201cTaiwan, China,\u201daccording to a report in Japan\u2019s Nikkeinewspaper.\nApple, Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.\nSo far, the biggest beneficiary of wariness over China has been Vietnam.\nFoxconn, Apple\u2019s largest contract manufacturer,recently signeda $300 million deal to expand in northern Vietnam with a new factory that will generate 30,000 jobs, according to state media. The latest spending was in addition to $1.5 billion that the Vietnamese government had said Foxconn had already invested in the country.\nIn Bac Giang and Bac Ninh Provinces in northeastern Vietnam, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers operate massive factories in scenic countryside that was once rice fields and farmland, surrounded by temples, banyan trees and ponds. Now, workers from around the country descend to these facilities in search of jobs.\nA billboard outside a Foxconn factory in Bac Ninh advertised that the company is looking to hire 5,000 workers \u201curgently\u201d with an offer of roughly $300 in monthly pay for an entry-level position. It is less than half the monthly pay \u2014 4,500 yuan, or about $650 \u2014 that Foxconn is offering new hires at its assembly lines in Shenzhen in southeastern China.\nThe pay disparity underscores another reason that companies are looking for new manufacturing options. Over the past decade, manufacturing workers in China have tripled their annual income to more than $9,300, according to the country\u2019s Bureau of Statistics.\nFoxconn declined to comment for this article.\nTariffs also added to manufacturing costs in China. In 2019, President Donald J. Trump levied a 15 percent tariff on tech products such as smart speakers, smartwatches and wireless headphones.\nAs the tariff battle intensified, Google looked at alternatives to China. This year, Google plans to move manufacturing from Foxconn facilities in southern China to Vietnam, where it will begin assembling its latest model, the Pixel 7, two people with knowledge of the plans said.\nThe company expects Vietnam to provide as much as half of next year\u2019s high-end Pixel phones, the people said.\nBut Google\u2019s planning for next year\u2019s phones demonstrates how hard it will be for companies to move from China completely. Google is exploring a foldable phone for 2023, but making a device like that, using newer screen and hinge technology, would probably require production to be close to key suppliers in China, these people said.\nGoogle declined to comment.\nOver two decades, the tech industry has established an expansive collection of suppliers that make the cords, buttons and machines critical to assembling smartphones and computers. The concentration of suppliers reduces shipment costs and makes it easier to fix faulty parts.\n\u201cWe have a long way to go to have the whole supply chain diversified outside of China,\u201d said Mehdi Hosseini, a financial analyst at Susquehanna International Group who focuses on the tech supply chain.\nSo for alternatives to China, proximity matters. Interest from Foxconn and others has caused industrial real estate prices in Vietnam to spike by nearly a third since 2019 to $105 per square meter (about $9.75 per square foot), while the cost of warehouses has risen 20 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a global commercial real estate firm.\nFive years ago, said Trang Bui, Cushman\u2019s general manager for Vietnam, she showed industrial land to clients once every other month. Now, she travels daily with clients from the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Europe and China to see real estate for factories.\n\u201cIf you come to Vietnam, all you see is energy,\u201d Ms. Bui said. \u201cFor an outsider who hasn\u2019t visited the country, they might be a little shocked.\u201d\nVo Kieu Bao Uyencontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple to Sponsor the Super Bowl Halftime Show",
        "fulltext": "Talks between the National Football League and Apple over a package of Sunday football games have dragged as the league and the tech giant have wrangled over pricing, but another deal has been added to the mix: sponsorship of the Super Bowl halftime show.\nThe N.F.L. has been seeking as much as $2.5 billion for rights to N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, about $1 billion more than what it collects from its current provider, DirecTV. As the sides squabble over a rights fee that high, Apple has agreed to be the main sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show, the league and the company said late Thursday. They did not disclose terms of the deal.\nApple Music will replace Pepsi as sponsor in a deal that the N.F.L. had been shopping around for about $50 million, said three people familiar with the negotiations.\nBecoming the primary sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show is a departure for Apple. The company has prided itself on marketing its brand differently than consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola, Budweiser and McDonald\u2019s, which have long histories of sponsoring sports and cultural events.\nApple seldom sponsors events that it does not control. It has not lent its brand to a high-profile event since 2016, when it sponsored the Met Gala in a bid to increase acceptance of its Apple Watch within the world of fashion.\nThe stalemate on the much larger deal between Apple and the N.F.L. is hampering the league\u2019s efforts to become a leader in the streaming of live sports. With consumers abandoning traditional television packages, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, has put a priority on expanding the league\u2019s reach beyond traditional broadcasters to digital media such as Netflix and HBO Max, where younger viewers are turning their attention.\nLast year, the leaguecut a string of traditional broadcast agreements with CBS, ESPN, Fox and NBCfor its highest-profile games, but it reserved two packages for tech companies that it considered to be the sports programmers of tomorrow. It struck an 11-year, $13 billion deal with Amazon to stream Thursday night games, and it announced that it would sell its Sunday Ticket to a streaming service.\nThough the N.F.L. has discussed Sunday Ticket with Google, Amazon and ESPN, its most extensive negotiations have been with Apple. Executives at both the league and the tech giant have told business partners that they expect to get a deal done, according to the people familiar with the negotiations. But the talks have been complicated by the N.F.L.\u2019s decision to sell several assets simultaneously, including Sunday Ticket, the halftime show and N.F.L. Media properties such as N.F.L. Network and the RedZone channel.\nOne of the biggest problems has been the N.F.L.\u2019s asking price of $2.5 billion. The $1 billion increase from the current deal would be difficult to win from a traditional media company but has been especially tough to capture from Apple, which has deep pockets and an interest in branching into sports but also an unyielding commitment to profitability that leads it to squeeze suppliers.\nThe N.F.L. has signaled its frustration with Apple by reaching out to representatives at other media companies to encourage them to put forward a bid, according to two people familiar with the outreach. But some of those companies have been wary of becoming a tool that the N.F.L. can use to induce a bigger offer from Apple.\n\u201cWhile the foundation and cornerstones of the deal are in place, the devil is always in the details, particularly in a deal that has complex elements that extend beyond the historic Sunday Ticket rights,\u201d said William Mao, a senior media rights executive at Octagon, a sports and entertainment agency.\nApple has pursued Sunday Ticket as part of a broader strategy to increase subscriptions to its streaming service, Apple TV+, by tapping into the popularity of live sports. Despite pouring billions of dollars a year into critically acclaimed series such as \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d Apple\u2019s three-year-old service has only about 16 million subscribers in the United States, fewer than half the subscribers Disney+ has accumulated since launching around the same time, according to Antenna, a media research firm.\nLeaders at Apple have told Hollywood executives that acquiring Sunday Ticket would increase viewership of its shows. The N.F.L. remains one of television\u2019s biggest draws, with its games accounting for three-quarters of the top 100 most-watched programs last year,according to Sports Business Journal.\nIn recent months, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of services, have met with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, and the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, who are leading the league\u2019s negotiations, the people familiar with the negotiations said.\nThe idea of Apple\u2019s sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show bubbled up in the course of the talks as a way to deepen the business ties. The N.F.L. needed a replacement for Pepsi and recognized that Apple had tapped its marketing budget to win rights to live sports. The company offered Major League Baseball $55 million in rights fees for two weekly Friday baseball games, and an additional $30 million in advertising, according to two people familiar with the agreement.Forbes earlier reportedthe terms of the deal.\nThe discussions between the N.F.L. and Apple over the Super Bowl halftime threatened to delay the league\u2019s release of this season\u2019s performers, some of these people said. The N.F.L. and Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, Roc Nation, which produces the show, last yearannounced the artists in September, giving the league ample time to build anticipation. Organizers are eager to build on last year\u2019s event, the Super Bowl\u2019sfirst hip-hop performance, a celebration of rap that made history by winning threeEmmy Awards.\nJay-Z and Roc Nation are expected to continue to take the lead on selecting artists and choosing performers for the event, but Apple will be able to weigh in on the direction of the show, according to a person familiar with the deal.\nA spokeswoman for Roc Nation did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe tech company and the hip-hop pioneer make for strange bedfellows. In 2015, Jay-Z bought a streaming-music service, Tidal, and made his song catalog exclusive to the service, depriving Apple Music of albums such as \u201cThe Blueprint.\u201d Two years later, he released much of his catalog to Apple and eventually exited the streaming-music business, sellingTidal to Square for nearly $300 million in 2021.\nKen BelsonandKevin Drapercontributed reporting."

        "title": "BlackRock Seeks to Defend Its Reputation Over E.S.G. Fight",
        "fulltext": "BlackRock wants to clear the air on \u201cwoke\u201d investing.\nYesterday, the world\u2019s largest money manager published a letter pushing back on one it received last month from19 Republican state attorneys generalwho accused BlackRock of putting its \u201cclimate agenda\u201d ahead of clients, collaborating with climate activists and boycotting energy companies. Tensions between BlackRock and Texas in particular came to a head last month when the state accused BlackRock ofboycotting energy companies, violating a 2021 law that aims to protect the energy industry from the growing popularity of climate-minded investing. As a result, BlackRock could be blackballed from managing the billions in retirement funds of Texas government employees.\nBlackRock says it\u2019s looking to correct \u201cmisconceptions\u201d and \u201cinaccurate statements\u201d about its climate position. In its letter, BlackRock says that the firm has never dictated specific emission targets to any company, and that it doesn\u2019t coordinate its investment decisions or shareholder votes with others on climate issues, as the attorneys general claimed. Far from boycotting, BlackRock says it has invested \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in energy companies.\nThe firm is following a broad trend of policymakers and research when it comes to climate issues, BlackRock says.\u201cYour letter makes several inaccurate statements about BlackRock\u2019s motive for participating in various ESG-related initiatives,\u201d BlackRock writes in the letter, which is signed by the firm\u2019s head of external affairs, Dalia Blass. (E.S.G., or environmental, social and governance, is the latest term for socially conscious investing.) Instead, BlackRock says its shareholder votes and investment decisions reflect that, generally, its investment professionals believe that climate change poses real risks and opportunities for investors. The firm\u2019s belief is \u201cby no means unique,\u201d BlackRock writes.\nBlackRock\u2019s tussle with state officials comes at a time when corporate social policies are becoming a campaign issue.Republican legislators in Texas and elsewhere have looked to punish companies that try to reduce the sales of guns, or help their employees gain access to abortions. At the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, an oversight board voted toban the consideration of \u201csocial, political or ideological interests\u201dwhen making investment decisions about the state\u2019s pension fund.\nYet fund managers in many red states appear to be backing E.S.G. measures anyway.A recent studyfrom the fund research firm Morningstar found that pension funds in those states had an average support rate of 80 percent for shareholders\u2019 proposals that encourage companies to consider environmental, social and governance issues as well as their bottom lines. For instance, this year, Texas\u2019 Employees Retirement System, the state\u2019s second-largest public pension fund, voted for shareholder proposals that urged big banks to cut off lending to fossil fuel companies.\n\u201cDo a lot of red states have the same problem that they point out is an issue among large E.S.G.-promoting asset managers in their own backyards?\u201d Vivek Ramaswamy, the author of \u201cWoke, Inc.\u201d, asks DealBook. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d He recently started his own fund firm, Strive, which promises to prioritize profit considerations in its investment decisions.\nA top Fed official signals more rate hikes are coming.Lael Brainard, the central bank\u2019s vice chair, said the Fed would need to see\u201cseveral months\u201d of low monthly inflation databefore it was convinced that inflation was cooling off. That fortified expectations that the Fedwill raise ratesby three-quarters of a percentage point this month.\nPresident Biden reportedly delays a decision on China tariffs.The White House is holding back on scrappingTrump-era levies on Chinese imports, Bloomberg reports. While the administration is still considering ways to offer American businesses relief, political considerations are playing a role in the delay.\nNew research backs Twitter\u2019s claim on bots.The social network\u2019s assertion that less than 5 percent of its monetizable users are spam accountsis reasonable, according to new findings by the data analytics provider Similarweb. That 5 percent figure has been questioned by both Elon Musk, who cites it as a reason to call off his Twitter takeover bid.Bob Iger, a former C.E.O. of Disney, said he had concluded that a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of Twitter\u2019s users were fake when the entertainment giant weighed buying Twitter.\nApple reaches for the fitness wearables market.At a product event yesterday, the tech giant introduced an$800 version of its Apple Watchaimed at endurance athletes, a bid to snatch market share from rivals like Garmin. Apple also revealed its latest iPhone and updated AirPod models.\nNatural gas prices in Europe have plummeted more than 40 percent over the past 10 days, welcome news for businesses, homeowners and policymakers from London to Berlin.\nThis morning, the futures contract for Dutch T.T.F. natural gas traded below 200 euros per megawatt hour,after soaring to a record of nearly 350 euros per megawatt hourlast month as uncertainties over the flow of Russian gas to Europe jolted the markets.\nDon\u2019t bank on this benign price trend continuing.\u201cA key reason behind the recent price volatility is that traders just don\u2019t know what to make of this market,\u201d Fabian Skarboe Ronningen, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy, told DealBook.\nTraders are watching for whether the European Commission will intervene in the energy markets, in an effort to limit price rises. Until details emerge on what that would look like \u2014 E.U. ministers willhold a meeting on that tomorrow\u2014 trading could be subdued, he said.\nAlso allaying trader worries are Europe\u2019s success infinding alternatives to Russian gasand rising gas storage rates on the continent. Germany is ahead of schedule in filling up its natural storage facilities to nearly 86 percent, according to Rystad. Italy is at 84 percent, and France is at 93.5 percent.\nAll that bodes well for the early winter months,but it doesn\u2019t mean Europe is out of the woods. \u201cEurope may not need to rely on Russia to get through this winter,\u201d Ronningen said. \u201cBut in March, next year? If they are down to 10 to 20 percent storage levels, that will make things difficult to get through the spring.\u201d\nThe world is still grappling with the turmoil that the coronavirus pandemic dealt to global supply chains, which snarled the production of huge sections of goods including automobiles and iPhones. But experts warn that delicate industrial networks are at risk from another major threat, The Times\u2019s Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher report:climate change.\n\u201cWhat we just went through with Covid is a window to what climate could do,\u201dsaid Kyle Meng, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Extreme weather events around the world are becoming more frequent, causing an array of knock-on effects, including component shortages and shipping delays.\nConsider a record drought in southwestern China: It reduced the amount of available hydropower, leading to power cuts at regional factories, including those for Foxconn and Toyota. Vegetables in the area wilted from heat, driving up meat prices.\nFinding solutions and alternatives isn\u2019t easy.Building factories elsewhere could be costly for both companies and consumers. And competition for food production could lead to more export controls that reduce global agriculture flows, a fear that prompted the World Trade Organization to warn against countries imposing protectionist policies.\nTo many economists, trade can help solve climate-related problems \u2014 but also aggravate them. \u201cWe are so interconnected from our supply chains that events on one side of the world can dramatically impact people\u2019s well-being elsewhere,\u201d Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Times.\n\u2014 Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s C.E.O.,pushing back against demandsby some of the retailer\u2019s workers that starting salaries be raised to $25 an hour. At the Code Conference, Jassy also criticizeda recent unionization voteat a Staten Island warehouse.\nWall Street firms have long believed in the need to portray and protect a strong and consistent image, and that aim generally extends to their social media policies. But those strict guidelines are running up against two forces: a tight labor market and a talent pool of potential recruits full of social media natives who want the ability to freely express themselves.\nThat\u2019s caused the media-shy Wall Street firms to jump into creating their own social media content, rather than fight their junior associates\u2019propensity to post. Are they winning? Not yet.\nBlackRock joined TikTokthis year, andGoldman Sachs isreportedly planningto follow.Why TikTok? Because that\u2019s where the potential hires are. BlackRock has about15,000 followerson TikTok. Its videos tend to be more about financial education and less about giving a picture of what it\u2019s like to work at the firm. The videos feature a young and diverse crowd. Jackie Nov, BlackRock\u2019s global head of social media, told DealBook that BlackRock featured \u201cemployees from all over the firm\u201d and that its engagement on TikTok was geared toward promoting \u201cfinancial well-being.\u201d That said, BlackRock has yet to produce a viral hit on TikTok.\nBut can Wall Street firms, known to prize privacy and secrecy, also do authentic?Jeffrey Younger, an associate professor of management communication at N.Y.U. Stern, isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cEffective business strategies require communication that becomes more predictive or proactive, looking to ultimately build interactive relationships with stakeholders,\u201d he told DealBook, meaning, at some point, if done right, the brand becomes a part of consumers\u2019 everyday life.\nFor now, the finance industry\u2019s most junior employees are the ones who are winning on TikTok.Social media posts showing what it\u2019s like to work as an entry-level analyst remain extremely popular. One TikTok user, Naeche Vincent, 24, shares her experience working 19-hour days andtips on how to make a good impressionin the industry.

        "title": "Judge Hands Elon Musk a Win in Court",
        "fulltext": "Some potential major cracks are beginning to appear in Elon Musk\u2019s suit to undo his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, yesterday\u2019s hearing in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery revealed. But Musk has also scored a major victory.\nNearly two hours after DealBook published on Wednesday, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the case,ruled that Musk can amend his suitto include whistle-blower accusations from Peiter Zatko, a former Twitter security chief who claimed that the social networkhad misled the publicabout its security practices. However, she rejected Musk\u2019s request for a delay of the trial, which will proceed on Oct. 17. Twitter shares surged 4 percent on the news.\nHere are some of the highlights from the hearing on Tuesday:\nMusk told his Morgan Stanley banker to slow the deal down less than two weeks after the purchase agreementwas announced.On May 8, Musk texted Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to express concerns about the geopolitical environment that could weigh on the deal. \u201cLet\u2019s slow down just a few days. Putin\u2019s speech tomorrow is really important,\u201d said the text, which was read during the hearing and referred to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cIt won\u2019t make sense to buy Twitter if we\u2019re heading into World War 3.\u201d On May 13,he tweeted that the deal was on hold.(A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.)\nThat revelation could put him in breach of contract,which requires the buyer to use his or her best efforts to close a deal. It could also undermine Musk\u2019s complaint thatTwitter was not providing information about botshe needed to close the deal. The text makes it seem as if Musk\u2019s private concerns over the transaction had little to do with bots.\nMusk discussed re-pricing the deal with Bob Steel, a partner at Perella Weinberg,according to text messages Twitter\u2019s lawyers disclosed yesterday. They detailed an exchange in mid-June in which the two were contemplating using a \u201ccontingent value right arrangement\u201d that would have adjusted the payout to Twitter shareholders depending on certain bot figures. (A spokeswoman for Perella Weinberg declined to comment.)\nMcCormick, at times, showed little patience for Musk\u2019s legal team.\nShe told Musk\u2019s team that its efforts to fully identify all of the people with whom he spoke to about the deal \u201cbothered me a lot.\u201d She added, \u201cI ordered you to do the job,\u201d and called his team\u2019s response to her request about naming those parties \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s lawyers argued that even if Musk had done full due diligence for the deal, the Twitter board would have hid the whistle-blowers\u2019 accusations. McCormick replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what would have happened in diligence because there wasn\u2019t any due diligence, right?\u201d\nJuul settles a youth vaping inquiry for $438.5 million.The move willend an investigation by nearly three dozen statesover marketing and sales practices that the states contend drove up teen vaping. But the company still faces more lawsuits on the matter.\nBed Bath & Beyond names an interim C.F.O.The embattled retailerappointed Laura Crossento the role days after Gustavo Arnal, its former finance chief, died by suicide. Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond, which faces a daunting turnaround effort, fell over 18 percent yesterday.\nCalifornia narrowly avoids rolling blackouts amid a heat dome.Electricity continued flowingdespite record energy use as Californians grappled with a sixth day of ferocious temperatures. Still, officials are pleading with residents to turn down air conditioning.\nThe strong dollar is inflicting pain on rival currencies, and global stocks.With investors flocking to the greenback as the Fed tightens interest rates, other countries\u2019 currencies \u2014 including the British pound, the euro and the Japanese yen \u2014 arefalling to yearslong lows. Few analysts see relief in sight, even as other countries\u2019 central banks raise rates. Stocks in Asia and Europe slumped again today.\nIllumina last week scored abig win over U.S. antitrust regulatorsin its battle to buy Grail, a maker of early cancer-detection tests, for $8 billion. But yesterday, the gene-sequencing company faced a major setback when the E.U.\u2019s competition authorityblocked the same transaction. The decision makes the deal a test case for a new era of stricter global scrutiny of M.&A.\nThis is the first application of new E.U. antitrust standards,which were adopted last year. They allow E.U. member states to request a merger review even if the companies involvedaren\u2019tconcentrated in the eurozone market. The European authorities concluded that the merger would stifle innovation and reduce choice in the emerging market for a new kind of cancer-detection test.\nThe move is a sharp reversal in Illumina\u2019s fortunes from last week, when an F.T.C. administrative law judge ruled that the deal did not pose a threat to competition. The agency is appealing.\nIt\u2019s a sign that antitrust is still a global matter, even if the companies argue that their deals aren\u2019t.Illumina has said its deal posed no issues for the bloc: \u201cGrail has no products or customers in Europe,\u201d Francis deSouza, Illumina\u2019s C.E.O., told DealBook. But antitrust experts say that may not matter, if the E.U.\u2019s precedent holds. DeSouza said that could lead \u201cany country\u201d asserting jurisdiction over any business, regardless of whether it operates in a region.\nIllumina is preparing for worst-case scenarios,including divesting Grail, which it formally acquired last year despite continuing antitrust reviews by the U.S. and the E.U. Still, the company plans to appeal both this E.U. ruling and the previous one that gave the European Commission jurisdiction in the matter. \u201cWe think everyone needs clarity,\u201d deSouza said.\nJust weeks ago, President Bidensigned into law a landmark climate billto spur investments in the green tech needed to produce clean energy. The bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, is the latest in a series of policy moves that has led to a recent surge in funding for battery factories, solar panel manufacturing and mining.\nInvestment in renewables will reach $1.2 trillion by 2035,analysts atWood Mackenzieestimate \u2014 in part because the bill, which will invest$369 billion over 10 years in direct funding, loans and loan guarantees, has brought much-needed certainty to companies that political leaders are serious about steering the country away from fossil fuels,report The Times\u2019s Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn.\nCorporations like Toyota and Honda have announced that they are investing billions of dollars to build new factories for batteries for electric cars and hybrids. The mining company Piedmont Lithium said it wouldbuild a lithium processing plant in Tennesseeas the U.S. looks to ease its dependence on Chinese refineries. First Solar, a big solar panel manufacturer, said it would spend $1.2 billion building a factory in the Southeast to meet growing demand.\nBut even with the bill delivering a large infusion of federal funding, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a challenge, analysts and industry representatives say. The new projects will take time to finish; Toyota\u2019s factory, as well as Honda\u2019s venture with LG, won\u2019t start producing batteries until 2025. Procuring the raw materials for batteries is another challenge. So is location. Landowners, environmentalists and businesses have raised concerns about offshore wind farms near fisheries and about building power lines through farmland, which are needed to transmit solar energy.\n\u2014 Lucille Lam, one of the many recruiters who has had toadapt to an abrupt slowdown in the tech job market.\nAt 10 a.m. Pacific today, Apple will unveil the iPhone 14. But Apple watchers say the newest iPhone is not the main event this year. Expectations for anything truly wowie are teensy-weensy. The 14 is likely to have a pro-size screen, even for the basic model. The camera will be slightly better.\nBut while the iPhone 14 might not be a big reveal, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, could still make news if he addresses the biggest issues facing the company \u2014privacy,Chinaand how muchinnovationis still left in the tech giant. Here\u2019s what to listen for.\nOn privacy:Unlike its rivals Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook), Apple has long used its commitment to consumer privacy as a selling point. That stance could be under threat as the company seeks more revenue from online advertising, delivering ads on its websites, in Apple Maps or through apps.The Times\u2019s Shira Ovidesays it\u2019s hard to do that and not suck up some, or a lot, of consumer data.\nOn China:Apple\u2019s strong ties to Beijing are perhaps its biggest risk. Apple knows it. The company is making more of its products outside the country. But quitting China,as The Times\u2019s Tripp Mickle reports, will not be easy. \u201cThe iPhone has gone from being a product that is designed in California and made in China to one that is a creation of both countries,\u201d Mickle writes.\nOn innovation:Apple has always used lofty goals to elevate its marketing. And this year\u2019s event, with the tagline \u201cfar out,\u201d is no different. But Apple these days has been less about getting consumers to buy new devices, and more about getting users to do more things with their iPhones, like making payments or tracking health. If Cook and others talk about all of the cool new things that an iPhone can do \u2014 and less about what Apple might do \u2014 today\u2019s event may hardly be the \u201cfar out\u201d affair investors had hoped for.\nDeals\nA prominent anti-E.S.G. activist investor is pushing Chevron topumpmoreoilover the next decade.

        "title": "A Smartphone That Lasts a Decade? Yes, It\u2019s Possible.",
        "fulltext": "What would a smartphone look like if it could last for 10 years?\nIt\u2019s a question that most of us have not had the luxury of pondering. That\u2019s because many smartphones are designed to be replaced every two or three years. And Apple, Samsung and other handset makers unveil new models \u2014 along with big marketing campaigns \u2014 each year, encouraging us to upgrade.\nBut bear with me and fantasize for a moment.\nIf a smartphone were designed to last a decade, it would probably be made so that we could simply open it up to replace a part like a depleted battery or a cracked screen. Many of its components would be able to be upgraded \u2014 if you wanted a better camera, you could just swap out the old one for a newer, more powerful one. You could also download software updates from the phone\u2019s maker indefinitely.\nSensible and sustainable, right?\nThinking of what such a device might be like is especially relevant now as phone season \u2014 that time of year when tech companiesblitz us with new models\u2014 begins again. On Wednesday, Apple unveiled theiPhone 14, which bears a striking resemblance to its predecessor. Also this week Google announced plans toshow new Android phones in October. And last month Samsung introduced an array ofcellphones that fold like books.\nThese latest wares underscore how today\u2019s smartphones aren\u2019t made for longevity. Most of the gadgets come tightly sealed up with glue to keep you out of them. Parts, like cameras and screens, are impossible to upgrade \u00e0 la carte. Software updates are guaranteed for only a finite amount of time, usually two years for Androids and about five years for iPhones.\nKeeping us on such short cycles of smartphone ownership is great for the tech companies and their coffers \u2014 but maybe not so much for us and our wallets.\nDon Norman, a former vice president for advanced technology at Apple and the author of nearly two dozen books on design, said smartphone makers were guilty of treating consumer technology as if it were fashion wear, releasing products each year that become harder to repair and adding features that hasten obsolescence.\n\u201cYou want to make the computer out of one piece of metal, and you want it to be as thin as possible,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cSo you had to make the battery with no case so it gets really hard to get to. You use glue instead of screws.\u201d\nYet the idea of a longer-lasting phone needn\u2019t be a fantasy. One already exists: the$580 Fairphone 4made by a start-up, Fairphone, in Amsterdam. The Fairphone 4, which is sold only in Europe, has a plastic cover that can be easily removed to expose its innards. Its components can be swapped out in minutes by removing a few ordinary screws.\nThe idea behind the Fairphone is that if you want a phone with new technology, you can get it without having to replace your current device entirely \u2014 and if something goes wrong with the phone, like you drop it, it can be easily fixed. That makes the Fairphone the antithesis of most smartphones today and shows how tech companies can design the gadgets differently, for durability and sustainability.\nTake your iPhone or Android phone and look at it closely. Notice how it is shut tight with unique screws that require special screwdrivers. Apple even inventedits own screw.\nBut the Fairphone comes with a small screwdriver that invites you to open up the phone. So, when I began testing it, that was the first thing I did.\nTaking the Fairphone apart turned out to be a breeze. Removing its plastic cover revealed its camera, battery, speakers and other components. They were held in place with ordinary screws that could be quickly taken out with the screwdriver. In less than five minutes, I removed all of those parts. In about the same amount of time, I reassembled the phone.\nThe experience of taking the phone apart was empowering. I had the confidence that if I had to do a repair or some basic maintenance, like swapping in a new camera or battery, I could do so in minutes and for cheap. (Fairphone charges $30 for a new battery and $80 for a new camera.)\nDisassembling my iPhone, on the other hand, was a nightmare.\nWhen I took the Apple device apart during a previous test, it involved removing the proprietary screws with a special screwdriver and melting the glue that held the case together. To remove the battery, I had to use tweezers to yank on the tiny strips of glue underneath it. Even though I eventually succeeded in replacing the battery, I broke the iPhone\u2019s screen in the process \u2014 and a replacement display cost about $300.\nThe Fairphone\u2019s plastic cover isn\u2019t pretty, and it would probably pop off if the phone fell on a hard surface. But even less fun would be dropping an Apple or Samsung phone with a glass back, shattering it and shelling out hundreds of dollars to get it repaired (or to get it replaced).\nUsing the Fairphone was rather unremarkable. It runs vanilla Android software, which means it can load Google\u2019s apps and software downloaded through the Play store.\nBut Eva Gouwens, Fairphone\u2019s chief executive, said the company was committed to providing software updates to its phones for as long as possible. These updates are crucial for protecting your hardware from the latest cyberattacks and malware; they also ensure that your phone can run the latest apps.\nA Fairphone model that came out six years ago is still getting Android updates. Most Android phones stop getting updates after two years.\nThe Fairphone 4\u2019s computing processor and camera left much to be desired, however. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench, the Fairphone 4 was about 35 percent slower than Google\u2019s $600 Pixel 6 at doing things like checking email and taking photos. Pictures produced by the Fairphone 4 were grainier and less attractive than shots taken with iPhones and other mainstream Android phones.\nStill, I wouldn\u2019t expect Fairphone\u2019s small team \u2014 about 110 people \u2014 to crank out computing and camera technology on a par with the big tech companies.\nFairphone said it was making money, generating a few million euros in profit in 2020 and 2021. Beyond selling phones and easy-to-install parts, the company is experimenting with selling services like helping people fix their devices or maintain their smartphone software, Ms. Gouwens said. That\u2019s a slow and steady revenue stream as opposed to the more rapid model of selling new phones every year.\n\u201cIf you design a phone that lasts, and your users actually keep your device and use it longer, then you become more profitable,\u201d she said.\nThis column is not about recommending that people buy a Fairphone 4. The broader point is that tech companies with incredible wealth could do a better job of making their phones easier to repair and friendlier to the environment and our wallets. And we, as consumers, could do better by changing how we think about personal technology, Mr. Norman said.\n\u201cConsumers do have considerable power but only if people band together,\u201d he said.\nOne important step is to maintain our devices as we do our cars \u2014 consider, for instance, taking a broken device to a repair shop before resorting to replacing it. Another action is to reject the marketing hype over every incremental feature introduced with every new phone.\nBecause if we\u2019re already happy with our smartphones, we will probably continue to be \u2014 so long as they work. And now we know that some models can work for a very long time."

        "title": "Text Messaging Is Cool. But Where Are Its Boundaries?",
        "fulltext": "Thetext-messaging apphas always been the most-used app on my phone. It\u2019s fun and efficient, and it\u2019s often a quicker way to get a response than sending an email or making a phone call.\nYet, even as Apple delivered a slew of new text-messaging features in a software update this week \u2014 and as Googlehas made improvementsto its Android messenger app over the years, like adding colorful emojis \u2014 texting still leaves much to be desired.\nApple\u2019s latest software system,iOS 16, which was released on Monday, includes enhancements to its iMessage app. Texts can now be edited after they are sent to scrub out embarrassing typos; a message can also be retracted. Google\u2019s Messages app for Android has tools that automatically generate responses to texts.\nThese changes help us sidestep awkward situations and save time, but they don\u2019t address a larger societal problem: Texting is distracting, demanding and, at least at times, stressful.\nThe pros of text messaging can easily turn into cons. Since texting typically takes only a few seconds and is widely considered the most urgent, attention-grabbing form of digital communication, it\u2019s difficult to set boundaries around texting with our colleagues and friends. Texting invites us to intrude on other people\u2019s time.\n\u201cWhere does your work end, and where does your personal life begin?\u201d said Justin Santamaria, one of the iPhone engineers who developed the iMessage app more than a decade ago. \u201cThat\u2019s something over the past three years everybody has struggled with, and it\u2019s playing out on your home screen.\u201d\nTexting is also not the most secure form of communication, especially in a post-Roe era when privacy is more important than ever, said Caitlin George, a managing director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group.\n\u201cIt should be something that everybody should have and not have to worry or think about,\u201d she said of the need for a universal private texting service.\nThe new messaging features are simple to use. On iPhones running iOS 16, holding down on a sent message opens options to edit or retract it. Android users can open Google\u2019s Messages app, enter the settings and toggle on \u201cEnable chat features\u201d to use the new texting technology, called Rich Communication Services.\nHere\u2019s my wish list to improve texting.\nTo minimize the likelihood that we will be bombarded by texts, Apple and Google have added layers of settings to tell others when we are busy. Yet the tools are ineffective.\nApple\u2019s iOS includes Focus, a tool released last year to manage how phone notifications appear in various aspects of our lives, including at work, at home, when we\u2019re driving or heading to bed. In a work profile, for example, Focus can be set up to let text and phone notifications arrive only from colleagues; anyone not on the approved list gets a message that notifications aren\u2019t being received.\nMy problem with Focus is that it\u2019s overly complex. Setting up each Focus profile is time-consuming, and it requires effort to schedule a Focus to activate at certain times, or to remember to toggle the feature on or off. In my experience, even when my Focus setting tells people that I\u2019m not receiving notifications, they text me anyway.\nMr. Santamaria, the former iPhone engineer, now runs Future, a messaging app for people to talk to fitness trainers. He said that he understood the intent behind Apple\u2019s Focus but that he agreed it was too cumbersome to set up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my friend on the East Coast to not send me some funny meme because I\u2019m asleep if it\u2019s not going to wake me up,\u201d he said.\nYet every notification for a new text message adds to a to-do list to respond to someone. \u201cThis red dot grows,\u201d he said.\nGoogle\u2019s messaging app has a so-called Smart Reply tool, which automatically generates possible responses to a text message, including one that says you are busy. But you still have to manually select a response.\nApple\u2019s and Google\u2019s text messaging apps would benefit from a much simpler tool: the away message.\nAmerica Online Instant Messenger, one of the earliest online messaging services, from the 1990s, had a simple autoresponder with a memo that users could use to tell people why they were unavailable. Slack, the chat app for workplace collaboration, has the ability to display an away status like \u201con vacation until Monday.\u201d It\u2019s effective at stopping people from sending a message.\nOne of the beauties of text messaging is the ability to share something \u2014 like an idea or a photo \u2014 immediately. But the iPhone messaging app still lacks an easy way to avoid pestering people at unreasonable hours: the ability to schedule a message to send later.\nHere is where Android\u2019s messaging app has a clear advantage. Last year, Google added a scheduling tool. After composing a message, hold down the send button. A \u201cSchedule send\u201d button appears, letting you set a time and date for the text to be sent. That\u2019s useful because we often send texts at unreasonable hours for fear of forgetting to send it later, and a scheduling tool solves this problem.\nThe lack of interoperability between the iPhone and Android messaging services makes photos and videos look pixelated when sending them between Androids and iPhones, a dreaded digital phenomenon known as the\u201cgreen bubble\u201d effect.\nAt a tech conference last week, an audience member raised this issue with Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. In a question-and-answer session, Mr. Cook was asked whether Apple would consider making the iPhone\u2019s messaging servicework with Google\u2019s Rich Communication Servicesso that the questioner could send clearer videos to his mother, who had an Android phone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cBuy your mom an iPhone.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nMs. George of Fight for the Future said Mr. Cook\u2019s comment was elitist because not everyone could afford an iPhone. The incompatibility between Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s messaging apps also posed a problem to digital privacy, she said.\nApple and Google encrypt their messaging apps to make messages indecipherable to anyone but the sender and the recipient. But the encryption works only when Apple phones text Apple phones and Android phones text Android phones. When users of different mobile operating systems text each other, their messages lack encryption, making the content readable to other parties like phone carriers.\nWhile third-party texting apps like Signal offer encrypted messaging between Apple and Android phones, those tools are not as widely used as the default texting apps that arrive on our phones.\nA Google spokesman referred to aseries of tweets by Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Google executive overseeing Android, stressing the need for Apple to support Rich Communication Services to strengthen privacy protection for Android and iPhone users.\n\u201cBy not incorporating R.C.S., Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\u201d Mr. Lockheimer said.\nThe content of text messages has become even more sensitiveafter the reversal of Roe v. Wade, Ms. George said, now that law enforcement agencies can seek data from tech companies and phone carriers to prosecute women who seek abortions. This is one reason it would serve a greater good if Apple and Google found a way to work together on their messaging apps, she said.\n\u201cAt a time when half the country needs to be concerned about how they\u2019re communicating about their bodily autonomy, there\u2019s a moral obligation to see your marketing through if you\u2019re telling people they can trust you,\u201d she said of Mr. Cook, who hasstaked his reputation on digital privacy."

        "title": "The Week in Business: Job Growth Is Solid but Slowing",
        "fulltext": "After a surprisingjobs report in July, which showed employers adding jobs at a blistering pace, August\u2019s numbers fell more in line with expectations. The economy gained315,000 jobslast month, well within range of the roughly 300,000 that forecasters had projected. That was a significant deceleration for the labor market \u2014 and is just what the Federal Reserve was looking for. Policymakers at the central bank have been trying to slow job growth as part of their campaign to rein in inflation and cool the economy. The Fed is likely to see this latest jobs report as a sign that its policies are working, but it well knows that its work isn\u2019t over. The August jobs numbers still reflect a strong pace of growth, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has indicated that there is little that would sway the central bank from itspath of raising rates, including at its Sept. 20-21 meeting.\nThere are many in Silicon Valley who would rather avoid the legal battle surrounding Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to step away from a deal to buy Twitter, but others are eager to get in on the action. The former group is made up of the tech industry\u2019s elite, a great number of whom have been summoned by Mr. Musk\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s lawyers to share what they know about the $44 billion deal. In the latter group are the lawyers who wish to represent them. The swirl of subpoenas before an October date in Delaware Chancery Court has created afrenzy of excitement for top-tier law firms. So far, Twitter\u2019s lawyers have been more aggressive, as they prepare to argue that Mr. Musk\u2019s reasons for trying to back out of the deal are unfounded. They have issued more than 84 subpoenas, with some going to Mr. Musk\u2019s inner circle of friends and associates, as well as the investors who agreed to help finance his acquisition. Mr. Musk\u2019s lawyers escalated his side of the fight last week, issuing a subpoena to the whistle-blowerPeiter Zatko, Twitter\u2019s former security chief \u2014 a sign that Mr. Musk may try to use Mr. Zatko\u2019s accusations of false statements and security shortcomings at Twitter to shore up his case.\nIn an attempt to turn around a spectacular sales slump, Bed Bath & Beyond confirmed on Wednesday that it had taken outmore than $500 millionin new financing, including $375 million from the investment firm Sixth Street. The sorely needed infusion of cash is intended to help the retailer recover from the steady decline in its sales and profits over the last few years, which did not let up even as the pandemic led people to spend more on home goods. The new funds are a kind of stopgap, as the company focuses on a new \u201cback to basics\u201d approach, which involves figuring out how to get more foot traffic to its stores and stock shelves with merchandise customers want to buy. The company also said it planned to close 150 of its approximately 1,000 stores, lay off employees and slash spending.\nA former chief of security at Uber is heading to court this week in what may be a first for Silicon Valley. The charges faced by Joe Sullivan, who worked for the ride-hailing company for two years, are believed to be the first against an executive stemming from a company\u2019s response to a security incident, and other chief security officers are following the case closely. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Sullivan learned that hackers had gained access to the personal data of more than half a million Uber drivers and some personal information linked to 57 million riders and drivers. When the hackers demanded money, Mr. Sullivan and other Uber employees negotiateda $100,000 Bitcoin paymentand persuaded them to sign nondisclosure agreements. He was fired in 2017, andlater chargedwith attempting to conceal the hack from federal investigators. He has pleaded not guilty.\nAt its product launch event on Wednesday, Apple is poised to build on a number of security protections itunveiled in June, which included a service that hides users\u2019 internet traffic from internet providers and changes to its Mail app to better protect users\u2019 identities from people sending them emails. At the time, Apple said iOS 15, which it planned to roll out in the fall, would offer users a so-called app privacy report that told them what data their apps were collecting about them \u2014 another part of the company\u2019s campaign to be seen as a gatekeeper between consumers and the larger tech world. Much flashier for many, however, will be Apple\u2019s expected unveiling of the iPhone 14 and new Apple Watches, which have recently found anunexpected audience among children.\nCentral bankers in the eurozone are likely to announce another large rate increase when they meet this week as they come under pressure to act on high prices.Fresh inflation datashowed that consumer prices in the eurozone in August rose 9.1. percent from a year earlier. That number gives policymakers at the European Central Bank all the more reason to continue raising interest rates, as they did in July for the first time in more than a decade, lifting the E.C.B.\u2019s benchmark rate by half a percentage point. Some analysts expect an even larger increase this time, with Goldman Sachs, for example, projecting a three-quarter-point increase.\nSnap, the parent of Snapchat, said it was laying off20 percent of its staff. Architects at a New York company formed the country\u2019sfirst formal unionat a private-sector architecture firm. And Twitter announced anedit button for tweetslast week."
