        "title": "Rihanna to Perform at Super Bowl Halftime",
        "fulltext": "Rihanna will perform at the Super Bowl in Glendale, Ariz., on Feb. 12 as the N.F.L. enters the first year of anew deal with AppleMusic as primary sponsor of the halftime show, replacing Pepsi.\nIt is the first scheduled return to the stage for an artist who last performed publicly at the Grammy Awards in early 2018, and whose most recent solo album, \u201cAnti,\u201d was released in January 2016.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Rihanna, Roc Nation and the N.F.L. to bring music and sports fans a momentous show,\u201d said Oliver Schusser, Apple\u2019s vice president for Apple Music and Beats.\nThe announcement is an about-face for the singer, who was among the artists who rebuffed invitations to perform on football\u2019s biggest stage in support of Colin Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback who has been unable to find a new team since he became a free agent in March 2017. Kaepernick accused the league of blackballing him because of his kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality toward Black people.\nFacing player protests and an impending loss of cachet for the show, theN.F.L. in 2019 signed on Jay-Z and Roc Nation, the rapper\u2019s entertainment and sports company, as \u201clive music entertainment strategist,\u201d to consult on the Super Bowl halftime show and contribute to the league\u2019s activism campaign, Inspire Change.\nRihanna is both managed by Roc Nation and signed to its record label, according to thecompany\u2019s website.\nLast February\u2019s halftime show in Inglewood, Calif., was the third under Roc Nation\u2019s guidance. The hometown rap icons Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar and the singer Mary J. Bligedelivered well-regarded performances which book-ended that of the rapper Eminem. In what appeared to be a reference to Kaepernick\u2019s protest, Eminem knelt after performing \u201cLose Yourself\u201d in a move that was anticipated by N.F.L. officials who had seen him do it in rehearsals.\nIn the years since Rihanna\u2019s last album release, she has appeared as a guest on a small handful of singles by other artists \u2014 including DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cWild Thoughts,\u201d which hit No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 2017 \u2014 and intermittentlyteased new musicof her own, though none has materialized.\nAs a result, what would be Rihanna\u2019s ninth studio album has taken on a near-mythic quality among fans \u2014 who regularly refer to it as \u201cR9\u201d \u2014 even as the singer has focused instead on her business empire, which includes the Savage x Fenty lingerie brand and skin care and makeup lines that have contributed to her $1.7 billion net worth,as estimated in 2021 by Forbes.\nEarlier this year, Rihanna had her first child with the rapper ASAP Rocky.\nIna 2019 interview with T Magazine, the singer of hits like \u201cUmbrella\u201d and \u201cWe Found Love\u201d said the new album would, as long rumored, be a reggae project, while joking about the fan-given name. \u201cI\u2019m about to call it that probably, \u2019cause they have haunted me with this \u2018R9, R9, when is R9 coming out?\u2019 How will I accept another name after that\u2019s been burned into my skull?\u201d\nMore recently, Rihannatold Vogue, \u201cI\u2019m looking at my next project completely differently from the way I had wanted to put it out before,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s authentic, it\u2019ll be fun for me, and it takes a lot of the pressure off.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Extends Reach With $800 Watch, as New iPhone Inches Along",
        "fulltext": "Over the past decade, September has been the month when Apple revealed its latest iPhone. The company served up swaggering advances in technology, year after year, that propelled its business as Apple became the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nBut as the marquee device has grown older and its improvements have gotten more incremental, the tech giant has shifted its focus to younger products with more runway for innovation: the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nApple on Wednesday unveiled a fitness-focused version of its wearable computer, the Apple Watch Ultra. Aimed at triathletes, distance runners, scuba divers and backcountry enthusiasts, the rugged $800 model features a larger screen and improved durability. It also has an \u201caction\u201d button to make it easier to use while wearing gloves, bigger speakers for calls in windy conditions and a larger battery with a 36-hour life span on a charge.\nNew features for Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, include the ability to change the volume with the swipe of a finger.\nWhile the iPhone still accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s sales, the smartwatches and AirPods, which require an iPhone to work optimally, have helped the company build a fortress around its most important device, deepening customer loyalty.\n\u201cThe more products you have from Apple, the more impossible it becomes to leave Apple for another player,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of device research at IDC, a market research firm. \u201cYour entire life becomes part of a single ecosystem.\u201d\nApple has used the iPhone, which has more than one billion users, to enter new markets and conquer unrelated businesses. It has helped Apple disrupt the finance industry with its own credit card, the watchmaking profession with its own timepiece and the audio industry with its wireless headphones.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is the latest example of how the company can extend its tentacles. It thrusts Apple into a corner of the smartwatch market dominated by Garmin, which does about $2.6 billion in sales to endurance-sports competitors, according to IDC. With Apple\u2019s brand recognition and the iPhone\u2019s popularity, it should be able to cut into that share, Mr. Jeronimo said. It already claims nearly 51 percent of the smartwatch market, more than double its closest competitor, Samsung.\nGarmin said on Wednesday that Apple\u2019s move into adventure smartwatches validated the business it had built.\n\u201cWe will continue to push the limits of GPS-enabled technology and remain committed to creating innovative products designed for active lifestyle customers around the world,\u201d said Krista Klaus, a company spokeswoman.\nIn addition to the fitness-focused watch, Apple released an update for its traditional watch, the Series 8, with a sensor to track body temperature and a feature called \u201ccrash detection,\u201d which can identify when an Apple Watch wearer is in a car crash and notify family and emergency services.\nApple unveiled the products at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., the first time it had held a product event there since 2019. The venue was packed with journalists and employees, who celebrated the return to normalcy by cheering as Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, took the stage to introduce an infomercial detailing the new products.\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s new abilities overshadowed more modest updates to the iPhone lineup. Apple released introductory and higher-priced versions of the iPhone 14 with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays. Both models add the abilities of a satellite phone, allowing users to connect with emergency services in rural and other remote environments so they can get help if they are lost while hiking or find themselves in some other dire situation.\nThe lower-priced iPhone 14, which costs $800, features last year\u2019s processor but has improved front and rear cameras with larger sensors to capture clearer photos in low light.\nApple saved its biggest design changes for the iPhone 14 Pro, which costs $999, the same as last year\u2019s flagship phone. The new phone eliminates the notch for its Face ID system in favor of a small cutout that contains the front camera and displays alerts and notifications. The phone also has an \u201calways on\u201d display to illuminate information like a clock without unlocking the phone, and a slimmer, black border around the screen.\nUnlike the lower-priced iPhone 14, the Pro model features a new processor, the A16, which supports an improved camera with a larger sensor for better photos. It also supports new machine-learning algorithms to enhance the details and sharpness of photographs.\nDespite having some of the highest prices in the smartphone market, the iPhone enjoyed a business revival during the pandemic. For its last fiscal year, Apple posted a record $192 billion in revenue from the iPhone alone, a 14-year-old device that has become better known for incremental improvements than revolutionary innovations.\nApple expects the iPhone 14 to sustain that momentum. Though other smartphone manufacturers are cutting production as the global economy cools, Apple plans to make more phones than it did a year ago, according to Susquehanna International Group, a financial firm.\nThe company has broadened its customer base in recent years by offering seven models of the iPhone, ranging in price from $429 to more than $1,500. Its luxury pricing has helped it accumulate more affluent customers than rival smartphone makers, but about a third of iPhone buyers earn less than $50,000 a year, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a tech research firm.\nThe iPhone 14 may be more notable for where it\u2019s being made than its new features. This year, for the first time,Apple will assemble some of its flagship phones in India, part of a strategy to decrease its dependency on China, where it produces the vast majority of its products.\nEfforts to diversify its supply chain have assumed greater urgency for Apple this year amid pandemic-induced disruptions in China and escalating geopolitical tensions over Taiwan\u2019s status.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a post-maturity phase of the iPhone,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, founder of Technalysis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to tell generations of the device apart.\u201d"

        "title": "The Markets Face a Rare Double Decline",
        "fulltext": "Technology stocks have long been seen as the market\u2019s most rewarding but riskiest investments. Bonds have the opposite reputation. This year, both have ended up in the same place \u2014 deep in the red.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell nearly 3 percent yesterday, and is now down nearly 30 percent for the year. Meanwhile bonds, spooked by inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s promise to keep raising interest rates to fight rising prices, are facing theirmost devastating period since at least 1926.\nIt\u2019s rare for bonds and tech stocks to tumble together.In 2000, when the dot-com bust cratered tech, bond prices rose nearly 12 percent. Same was true in 2008. Tech stocks fell 42 percent, while bond prices rose 5 percent.\nThe alignment might be more natural now.Tech companies are more vulnerable to higher interest rates than they used to be.\nOne reason is borrowing. Apple, for instance, had just $300 million in debt in 2000. The iPhone maker now hasnearly $95 billion.\nAnother is their size. Microsoft\u2019s sales are seven times as much as they were 20 years ago. And as technology companies have grown, they are more tied to the ups and downs of the economy in general.\nBut don\u2019t expect the relationship to continue forever.Venture capital and private equity funds remain full of cash, and ready to invest in promising firms. What\u2019s more, higher interest rates will send investors looking for higher returns, and that favors tech shares. For now, though, higher interest rates, and the threat of a recession, are pounding every investment, and that includes tech. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful quicksand moment for the tech sector,\u201d said Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities.\nNasdaq futures this morning point to a mild rebound when markets open.But the macro data indicates more trouble ahead. Inflation is running red hot \u2014 this morning,eurozone price increases hit a record high\u2014 putting pressure on central banks to raise interest rates further to rein in consumer demand, placing the global economy at further risk of slowing. In such a climate, corporate profits could suffer, dealing another headache to investors whose portfolios hold a heavy mix of stocks and bonds.\nIan heads toward South Carolina.The storm, strengthened again to a hurricane, leftabout two million customers without powerin Florida this morning. More than 2.5 million people near the ocean in multiple states were also under hurricane warnings early today.\nThe Senate passes an emergency funding bill.Legislation approved yesterday willkeep the federal government runningpast today\u2019s deadline and will send more aid to Ukraine. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law by midnight.\nThe E.U. backs a power-reduction plan.Energy ministers agreed today tomeasures to reduce consumptionand tame climbing gas prices. Steps will include windfall taxes on fossil-fuel companies and targets for lowering electricity use during peak hours.\nLook to Nike for what ails multinationals.Shares in the company fell more than 10 percent in premarket trading after the companydisclosed problemsthat reflected an array of economic ills: growing inventories tied to supply-chain disruptions, a need to hold more sales to liquidate them and weaker overseas sales because of a strong dollar.\nMeta prepares for layoffs.The tech giant\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, told employees this week thatthe company would freeze all hiring. Zuckerberg said a drop in the company\u2019s revenue made the job cuts necessary.\nYesterday, a slew of text messages between Elon Musk, the Twitter board, Musk\u2019s bankers at Morgan Stanley and a supportive cadre of Silicon Valley stalwarts were made public as part of the billionaire\u2019s legal fight to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy the social network. The texts, revealed in a court filing, offer fresh insights into therally of supportfor Musk\u2019s bid. They also exposedhow desperate Wall Street wasto get Musk\u2019s business, and shed new light on some fundamental issues about the case.\nMusk believed bots were a big problem.In a text to Bret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s chairman, the day he told the company he planned to take it private, Musk wrote that it would be hard to fix Twitter as a public company, because \u201cfake users will make the numbers look terrible, so restructuring should be done as a private company.\u201d Twitter cited this textin its lawsuit seeking to force Musk to acquire the company, and it goes to the heart of one of the main legal arguments in the case: Despite hisconcern about the spam count, Musk made his offer without any stipulations around the accuracy of its spam numbers.\nAnd the spam data may not help Musk\u2019s case, anyway.When Musk first sought to call off the deal,on July 8,he cited an analysis by his own advisers that concluded that the percentage of active Twitter users who are actually spam is \u201cwildly higher than 5 percent.\u201d (Musk has said that Twitter\u2019s estimates that 5 percent of active users are spam is misleading.) But according to a court filing revealed yesterday, one outside firm put the percentage at5.3. Could such a meager difference derail the deal?\nMusk\u2019s intent in buying Twitter could matter, too.Many of the texts between Musk and the Twitter board in the lead up to the deal \u2014 as well as those with his various supporters \u2014 center on Musk\u2019s goal to rid the platform of spam and use it promote free speech. Expressing such noble aims could overshadow his complaints of bots and spam being part of some larger \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d that\u2019s eroding the value of a firm he once wanted to buy. \u201cCourts talk about whether there have been sufficient changes to call the economics of the deal into question,\u201d said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School. It\u2019s unclear how that applies when the buyer makes clearthe economics don\u2019t matter much to him, Lipton adds.\nSpeaking of those text messages \u2026Here\u2019s a sample of the many that were released yesterday:\n\u201cPut me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job,\u201d theinvestor Jason Calacaniswrote to Musk.\nTheventure capitalist Steve Jurvetsonrecommended Musk hire the former Uber executive Emil Michael as Twitter\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 and his own son as an engineer.\nWhen Musk tried urgently to reach out toOracle\u2019s Larry Ellison, a former Tesla board member, Ellison brushed him off: \u201cSorry. Let\u2019s talk tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Oprah would be interested in joining the Twitter board if my bid succeeds,\u201d Musk wrote to thejournalist Gayle King, a noted friend of Oprah Winfrey\u2019s. (King called Musk\u2019s offer a \u201cgangsta move.\u201d)\nThis week\u2019s extreme weather in Florida heightened the debate in Washington \u2014 and beyond \u2014 about the financial risks that climate change poses to banks.\nYesterday, the Fed announced thatsix of the biggest U.S. banks\u2014 Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u2014 were expected to participate ina pilot programnext year to test their resilience and risks under different climate hypotheticals.\nThe Fed said that the program was \u201cexploratory in nature\u201d and that it would not have capital consequences.\nEnvironmentalists lauded the move.Adele Shraiman of the Sierra Club told DealBook the program was \u201clong overdue.\u201d She argued that there was \u201creally broad consensus\u201d among financial authorities around the world that climate risk is a reality, but that the banks and regulators were notaddressing those risks fast enough. The storm in Florida has been a \u201cprime example\u201d of physical risk, she said, but the much less visible risks come from failing to transition to green energy, from continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies and from the possibility that those types of companies could fail.\nSimilarly, a report yesterday from Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group, said thatbanks were making progresson climate goals, but that important aspects of the business, like the $600 trillion derivatives market, remain a \u201cblack box in terms of climate risk.\u201d\nClimate requirements may be an overstep, some industry representatives counter.In response to the Fed\u2019s announcement, theBank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing the nation\u2019s leading banks, said that recent research suggested \u201cthat the near-term risks are entirely manageable for large banks\u201d and that regulatory requirements \u201cseem to be disproportionate to the risk.\u201d\nThe conflicting stances are creating friction for banks.Whether climate change presents material financial risks has long been a fraught political question, so American banking officials have been slower to explore the answers than their counterparts in Europe. At the same time, Republican politicians are amping up their fight against environmental, social and governance investing, creating headaches for banks and making themwary of international climate commitments.\nDavid Gottesman, a longtime friend of Warren Buffett and a billionaire financier, died on Wednesday at age 96. Known as Sandy to his intimates, he quietly became a force in money management, as well as a major donor to charity.\nGottesman became one of Buffett\u2019s close associates early on,after the two met in 1963 and bonded over investing discussions. Gottesman went on to foundFirst Manhattan, an investment firm that now manages some $20 billion. But Gottesman\u2019s most profitable decision was betting on Buffett: Gottesman invested in Berkshire Hathaway, gaining a stake that made him a billionaire.\n\u201cThere probably has never been a better return on any stock held for 44 years in the history of Wall Street,\u201d Gottesman wrote a decade ago.\nBuffett regarded him as a close friend and adviser.He credited Gottesman with helping prevent an investment in a department store from becoming a financial disaster, and put Gottesman on Berkshire\u2019s board. (Gottesman reportedly inadvertentlyinspired Buffett to invest in Applewhen he lost his iPhone in a cab.)\n\u201cAbsent Sandy doing anything financially for me, we would have been the best of friends,\u201d Buffett told The Times yesterday.\nDeals\nBanks tasked with helping finance Apollo\u2019s leveraged buyout of telecom assets reportedlycalled off a $3.9 billion debt offeringafter struggling to find investors.

        "title": "Big Tech Reconsiders the \u201cMade in China\u201d Way",
        "fulltext": "This month, Apple is expected to release the iPhone 14. Beyond rumors, little is known about what the crew from Cupertino, Calif., has planned for the company\u2019s newest version of its nearly ubiquitous smartphone.\nBut there is one major change that most consumers will probably fail to notice: A small but growing number of the latest iPhones will be manufactured outside China,report The Times\u2019s Daisuke Wakabayashi and Tripp Mickle. That\u2019s a big change for Apple, and it is not alone.\nAfter years of growing their Chinese operations, U.S. tech firms are starting to relocate production.The moves have been small so far. China is the world\u2019s most dominant consumer electronic manufacturer, but there are growing signs of a great remapping of the global supply chain. Yesterday, China said that factory activitycontractedin August.\nGeopolitical tensions have driven the exit.Some companies began looking for options outside China during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, when tit-for-tat tariffs created risks of supply disruptions. Coronavirus-related shutdowns \u2014Chengdu is the latest\u2014 raised further concerns. And China\u2019s saber-rattling after Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s August visit to Taiwan has hastened the pace of American companies looking to add manufacturing capacity outside China.\nDespite talk of reshoring, though, very few of the jobs appear headed for the U.S.\nApplemoved some production of AirPods to Vietnam in 2020, where it also makes watches and iPads. More iPhone production will be done there as well.\nGooglewill shift a portion of its latest Pixel phone manufacturing to Vietnam from China.\nMicrosoft\u2019sXbox andAmazon\u2019sFire TV devices, both of which used to be exclusively made in China, now ship from Vietnam and India, respectively.\nThe Biden administration has placednew restrictions on the chips makersNvidiaandAMDselling to China and Russia.\nIt will be hard for many companies to leave China completely.Google, for instance, is considering a foldable phone that will most likely need to be made in China because it requires advanced materials. More generally, over two decades, the tech industry has built up a low cost and formidable supply chain in China (at least before the pandemic). \u201cWe have a long way to go to have the whole supply chain diversified outside of China,\u201d said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group who focuses on the tech supply chain.\nVietnam appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the China exodus.Real estate brokers say they are busy showing properties to multinationals, even as the price of industrial land there has increased in the past few years. Foxconn, Apple\u2019s largest contract manufacturer, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars expanding in Vietnam.\n\u201cThe empire of manufacturing in China is being shaken,\u201d said Lior Susan, the founder of Eclipse Venture Capital, which invests in hardware and manufacturing start-ups. \u201cMore and more capital is going to pull manufacturing out of China and find an alternative.\u201d\nHouse Republicans pledge to investigate Twitter whistle-blower\u2019s claims.Representative Elise Stefanik, chair of the House Republican Conference, said caucus leaders would examine Peiter Zatko\u2019s accusations that the company had misrepresented its security and privacy protections, according to a message to House Republicans reviewed by DealBook. It\u2019s the latest front for Twitter as it defends itself against Zatko\u2019s claims.\nThe U.N. accuses China of potential crimes against humanity over Xinjiang.Minutes before Michelle Bachelet was set to leave her role as the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, the organization released a report that said Beijing\u2019s mass detention of Uyghur Muslims and others in the region was aserious human rights violation.\nDisney weighs a new membership program.The media giant confirmed that it was consideringa planthat could better link its Disney+ streaming service with other parts of its empire. Internally, some executives reportedly called the concept \u201cDisney Prime,\u201d likening it to Amazon\u2019s Prime program, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nPeter Thiel rebuffs Republican calls for more money.The Silicon Valley billionairerejected entreaties by Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, for more money to help the Arizona Senate campaign of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Blake Masters, The Washington Post reports. Thiel\u2019s move is a potential setback for Republicans; another emerged last night when the DemocratMary Peltola beat Sarah Palinfor Alaska\u2019s lone House seat.\nIn recent years, impact investment funds have increasingly emerged to bet on start-ups advancing reproductive health and innovation. After theSupreme Court decision in Juneto overturn the constitutional right to an abortion, the retail investment community turned its attention to reproductive health care.\nAlmost immediately after the court\u2019s decision, the investing app Alinea, which is geared toward young adults, saw a new investment focus on companies that support reproductive health, said Alinea\u2019s founders, Eve Halimi and Anam Lakhani. \u201cWhen the news came out, one of the community members created a pro-abortion-rights playlist\u201d \u2014 as in, a basket of stocks \u2014\u201cwith companies that were supporting the cause,\u201d Halimi told DealBook. \u201cWe saw a rush of activity.\u201d\nReproductive health as a criteria.That first user-created playlist included companies that were taking a public stand to support abortion access, echoing public demand for businesses to weigh in on the issue.\nLater, users asked for an updated version of the playlist, and the founders adopted that same inclusive standard. It now includes about 50 firms \u2014 including Levi\u2019s, Apple, Pfizer and Tesla \u2014 that have taken a stand against the overturning of Roe v. Wade, or those that help pay for employees\u2019 access to abortion services, or both.\nData shared with DealBook shows reproductive rights looming large in investment decisions.But location and gender matter. One month after the decision, Alinea had about 10,000 female users. Of those:\nAbout 11 percent are in Texas, where abortion access was threatened, and slightly more than half are now investing in anti-abortion companies.\nAbout 25 percent are in New York City, where reproductive rights remain robust, and only about 40 percent of them are investing in anti-abortion companies.\nMore than 30 percent of new app users now cite the change in reproductive rights as a reason for their interest in both investing and financial independence.\nNo male users have invested in playlists that are made up of companies supporting abortion rights.\nReproductive rights at the corporate level are the \u201cnewest E.S.G. frontier,\u201daccording to Confluence Philanthropy, a network of investment managers, shareholder activists and others that conveneda panel discussion on the matterin June. Expect a flurry ofproxy proposalsas activists plan to push deeper into the corporate arena. Previous efforts have failed, but E.S.G. experts are certainly telling companies tostart preparing.\n\u2014 Chris Couvelier, a managing director at the investment bank Lazard, on the impact ofuniversal proxy cards, which go into effect today, for shareholder campaigns.\nYesterday, the president of McDonald\u2019s U.S.A., Joe Erlinger,came out in full force againsta new California bill that he says \u201cshould raise alarm bells across the country.\u201d The measure, A.B. 257,could transform the way the service sector is regulated.\nThe bill, which the California Senate passed on Monday and which awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature, would create a state council to establish minimum pay and safety conditions. Supporters sayit will protect fast-food workersfrom pay theft, discrimination and unsafe work environments.\nErlinger says the bill goes too far. His open letter is a sign of just how high the stakes are for McDonald\u2019s and the restaurant industry, which fears similar legislation being adopted elsewhere.\n\u201cThis is a clear example of picking \u2018winners and\u2019 losers,\u201dsaid Erlinger, who called the legislation \u201cthe outcome of backroom politicking.\u201d The bill excludes independent operators with fewer than 100 locations. But it applies to chains that are part of a larger company, like McDonald\u2019s. The bill also providesan exemptionfor restaurants that produce bread \u201cas a stand-alone menu item,\u201d meaning it probably won\u2019t extend to chains like Panera.\nErlinger isn\u2019t against reform.He said that he wanted to see progress on worker pay and protections, and that new measures should be applied equally across the industry. \u201cShouldn\u2019t all restaurant workers benefit?,\u201d he asked.\nErlinger also worries about theinflationary effectof the bill. McDonald\u2019s, for its part, raised the minimum wage at restaurants it owns last year by 10 percent to reach an average of $15 an hour by 2024. But its franchisees are free to set pay, and they have not all moved in tandem. Some franchisees \u201cstill focus too much on the cost side, and don\u2019t see investment in people as a way actually to grow their cash flow over time,\u201d the McDonald\u2019s C.E.O. Chris Kempczinskitold The Timeslast year.\nMichael Saylor became a hero to the cryptocurrency faithful in recent years for directing MicroStrategy, the software company he co-founded, to spend roughly $4 billion to buy Bitcoin. That move has looked disastrous as the price of Bitcoin has dropped below $20,000. Saylor and MicroStrategy face a new problem: tax charges.\nSaylor is accused of evading $25 million in taxes owed to the District of Columbia,according to a lawsuitby Karl Racine, the district\u2019s attorney general. Though Saylor has claimed to live in Virginia or Florida \u2014 states with little or no personal income taxes \u2014 he has actually lived in several properties around Washington, Racine claims. (As proof, the district points to Facebook posts by Saylor that reference a home in Washington.)\nMicroStrategy is also named as a defendant.In his complaint, Racine accused the company of knowing that Saylor was evading D.C. taxes and of working with him to help hide that fact.\nIt\u2019s a potentially big problem for Saylor and MicroStrategy,with Racine seeking what could amount to more than $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. That\u2019s on top of a plunge in the value of MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings amid the broader decline in the crypto market.

        "title": "An Apple Watch for Your 5-Year-Old? More Parents Say Yes.",
        "fulltext": "Florian Fangohr waffled for about a year over whether to buy anApple Watch SEas a gift. The smart watch cost $279, and he worried that its recipient would immediately break or lose it. In May, he decided the benefits outweighed the costs and bought the gadget.\nThe beneficiary: his 8-year-old son, Felix.\nMr. Fangohr, a 47-year-old product designer in Seattle, said he was aware that many people were pessimistic about technology\u2019s creep into children\u2019s lives. But \u201cwithin the framework of the watch, I don\u2019t feel scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI want him to explore.\u201d\nFelix, a rising third grader, said he actually wanted a smartphone. \u201cBut the watch is still really, really nice,\u201d he said.\nAcross the United States, parents are increasingly buying Apple Watches and strapping them onto the wrists of children as young as 5. The goal: to use the devices as a stopgap cellphone for the kids. With the watch\u2019s cellular abilities, parents can use it to reach and track their children, while the miniature screens mitigate issues like internet addiction.\nChildren and teenagers appear to have become a disproportionately large market for smart watches as a whole. Ina 2020 surveyof American teenagers by the investment bank Piper Sandler, 31 percent said they owned a smart watch. That same year, 21 percent of adults in the United States said they owned one, according to thePew Research Center.\nThe use of smart watches as a children\u2019s gadget shows how the audience for a consumer technology product can morph in unexpected ways. It has also given new life to the Apple Watch, which was unveiled in 2015 and has been variously positioned as afitness tracker, a style statement or a way to free yourself from an iPhone.\nApple has deliberately turned the watch into a device that can be attractive for children and their parents. In 2020, the company released the Apple Watch SE, which had fewer features than a premium model and was priced $120 cheaper. Apple also introducedFamily Setup, software that let parents track their children\u2019s locations, manage their contacts list and limit their notifications.\nThe Silicon Valley company\u2019s moves to make the Apple Watch a child-friendly cellphone took about three years, said two people involved with the project, who were not authorized to speak publicly. A chief concern wasbattery life, since the watch used more power when it functioned independently from an iPhone, they said.\nApple plans to compete more aggressively soon for young smart watch customers. At an event on Wednesday, it is set to release a new version of the Apple Watch that is cheaper than the Apple Watch SE, the two people said. The model will be introduced alongside other new versions of the watch, including a high-end wearable for serious athletes that will rival fitness trackers made by its competitor Garmin, they said.\nApple referred to a statement from Jeff Williams, the chief operating officer, who said, \u201cFor family members who do not have an iPhone, Apple Watch offers a remarkable set of features that can help them keep in touch with loved ones, be more active and stay safe.\u201d The company declined to comment on the new watches at its coming event.\nApple does not break out sales of the Apple Watch. To date, there are at least 120 million Apple Watch users \u2014 most of them in the United States \u2014 according toestimatesby Counterpoint Research. In China and South Korea, Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung have also rapidly increased wearable sales among young people.\nAny technology used by children raises questions of risks and harms. Social media platforms in particular have faced scrutiny in recent years, with lawmakers holdingcongressional hearingson the issue in 2021 and homing in on whether sites like Instagram led to poor self-esteem among teenagers.\nBut smart watches are inherently limited in their abilities, said Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and technology for families. Since smart watches haveminimal appsand no web browser or camera, children are less likely to be exposed to distracting games, sexting and other adult content, he said. Not owning a smartphone also encourages children to continue learning how to do things independently, like completing homework assignments without looking up answers online, he said.\n\u201cYou want to be able to contact them, but you don\u2019t want them spending all day on a screen,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.\nJean M. Twenge, who writes books on how tech contributes to generational differences, added that the longer that parents could hold off on providing children with a smartphone \u2014 and increased accessibility to social media and other internet wormholes \u2014 the better.\nReceiving a smartphone later means children \u201cwill be older, more mature and more able to handle the challenges and potential dangers of having their own smartphone,\u201d she said.\nStill, buying a smart watch for children can hook them to technology early. When young people use a product, they tend to remain loyal to the brand as they grow up and become working professionals, analysts said.\nJon Desi and his wife recently used an Apple Watch SE as training wheels for a smartphone for their daughter, Catie, when she was 10. When she started playing outside more at the beginning of the pandemic, they couldn\u2019t find an \u201cold-style phone\u201d so their daughter would have more freedom to venture around their neighborhood in Hunt Valley, Md., they said. They settled on the Apple Watch instead.\n\u201cWe wanted to give her a way to communicate without giving her Pandora\u2019s box at the age of 10,\u201d Mr. Desi said.\nBut the watch came with a stipulation: Catie had to charge it and wear it regularly, answer when they called and text back in a reasonable amount of time to receive a smartphone.\nIt became \u201cthe carrot to enforce responsible behaviors,\u201d Mr. Desi said.\nIn July, he and his wife purchased an iPhone for Catie, now 11, and handed her Apple Watch down to their 10-year-old son, Tommy. When their 5-year-old daughter, Ellie, is older, they anticipate handing down the Apple Watch again.\n\u201cI had wanted it for a little while, and I was trying to earn it,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cIt always looks cool when someone has it.\u201d\nA smart watch is not a guaranteed delay to a cellphone. Todd Golub and his wife, who live in New York City, gave an Apple Watch SE to their son Ronan when he was 10, as he began exploring the city by himself. The watch was more difficult to break and lose than a phone, and Ronan used its mobile wallet to pay for food and public transit.\nBut last fall, they bought an iPhone for Ronan, now 12, when he entered middle school because all his schoolmates had smartphones. Mr. Golub, 49, said he would have preferred to introduce a smartphone at least a year later but worried his son would feel like he was missing out.\n\u201cShould I have pushed that out further? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I remember being their age.\u201d\nNow Ronan often forgets to charge and wear the watch. The watch, Mr. Golub said, is \u201calmost irrelevant.\u201d\nTripp Micklecontributed reporting."

        "title": "An Anti-E.S.G. Activist Takes on Apple and Disney",
        "fulltext": "A conservative investor, with backing from Peter Thiel and Bill Ackman, has two new targets in his anti-E.S.G. campaign. Yesterday, Vivek Ramaswamy sentlettersto the C.E.O.s of Apple and Disney, urging them to refrain frommaking political statementson behalf of their companies, orhiring decisions based on race, sex or political beliefs.\nRamaswamy has emerged as one of Wall Street\u2019s most prominent critics of the environmental, social and governance investing movement.Earlier this year, the investor, who is the author of \u201cWoke, Inc.,\u201d launched Strive Asset Management, which he says will combat pressure on companies to consider liberal politics before bottom lines. Its first exchange-traded fund, which is focused on energy, launched last month and already has roughly $320 million in assets. Its ticker symbol, which echoes Ramaswamy\u2019s prescription for the energy industry, is DRLL.\nStrive\u2019s second fund, the Strive 500 E.T.F., which invests in large public companies, launches today.Ramaswamy\u2019s plan is to use the power of shareholder votes to refocus large companies on maximizing profit, a goal from which Ramaswamy says boardrooms have strayed. One of the first issues it\u2019s tackling is hiring policies; Apple, Ramaswamy says, is a prime example of the problem.\nRamaswamy is urging Apple to halt its \u201cracial equity audit\u201d and to remove diversity considerations from its hiring and compensation policies.His letter hints that if Apple doesn\u2019t change its policies, Strive will try to raise the issue at its next shareholder meeting. In his letter to Disney, Ramaswamy says the company has hurt its brand by speaking out against government policies that do not directly affect its business, namely Florida\u2019s recent law thatlimits the discussion of sexuality and genderin the classroom. \u201cWe would be best served to have an honest debate about why we need E.S.G.,\u201d Ramaswamy told DealBook. \u201cYou can make the argument that companies have a social responsibility that goes above and beyond profits, but to retrofit E.S.G. to say that it\u2019s about long-term profit maximization, well, that glove doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d\nIt\u2019s part of a growing debate over the influence of E.S.G. investors.Critics say the managers of such funds are limiting companies\u2019 profits and ability to compete. E.S.G. proponents say looking at the long-term impact of corporate decisions on the environment and society might sacrifice short-term gains, but will lead to higher profits and more sustainable firms.In an essay this weekend, Martin Lipton, the prominent corporate attorney and founding partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, argued that companies have a legal responsibility to consider those longer-term questions. \u201cWe continue to believe it is essential that boards operate under a governance model that permits consideration of E.S.G. principles and sustainable investment strategies,\u201d he wrote.\nChamath Palihapitiya winds down two of his SPACs.The financier said this morning that he wouldreturn their funds to investors, after failing to find suitable merger targets for either. Palihapitiya, who became a serial SPAC mogul during the pandemic, said he considers such funds \u201cjust one of many tools\u201d to invest.\nSupply-chain issues cost Ford dearly.Shares in the carmaker were down nearly 5 percent premarket after it said it wouldpay $1 billion morefor parts this quarter. Ford blamed inflation and shortages.\nNew York City faces a fiscal crisis.City officials expect tax revenue \u2014 including from businesses and personal income taxes \u2014 to drop, leading to what New York State\u2019s comptroller estimates will be a$10 billion budget shortfall in 2026. That could result in drastic reductions in city services, including garbage pickups and policing.\nHouse Republicans reportedly consider investigating the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.G.O.P. lawmakers may begininquiries into the lobbying groupand some of its largest members if they retake the House this fall, according to The Intercept. Behind the drive: Republican opposition to the Chamber\u2019s support for E.S.G.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s bid to block a UnitedHealth deal is denied.A federal judgerejected the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuitto prevent the health insurer from buying Change Healthcare. It was the latest setback for the administration\u2019s more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement.\nTherabody, the maker of the Theragun hand-held massage device, a cult favorite among athletes, has raised $165 million, DealBook is first to report. The fund-raising round, which was led by the private equity firm North Castle Partners, comes as wellness businesses seek to regain their footing as the pandemic recedes.\nDuring the height of the pandemic, money poured into home fitness.Sales of Peloton and Tonal workout equipment skyrocketed. While companies like Pelotonare scaling back as demand falters, Therabody\u2019s C.E.O., Benjamin Nazarian, says the pandemic highlighted a need to take care of your body. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a recession or not, your body is the most valuable thing you have in your life,\u201d he said. Last year, Therabody\u2019s revenues reached $396 million, up from $224 million in 2020.\nExecutives did not disclose the valuation of the latest fund-raising round.\u201cThe idea of having products for recovery in your home \u2014 we still think is a fairly young concept,\u201d said Jon Canarick, a managing partner at North Castle, whose investments include Barry\u2019s Bootcamp and HydroMassage.\nTheragun will use the money to invest in digital content and acquisitions.It\u2019s also announcing eight new products today, including smart goggles to help relieve facial tension and headaches as well as a new mini Theragun. The financing includes investment from a broad array of celebrities, including the comedian Kevin Hart\u2019s Hartbeat Ventures and the model Karlie Kloss. \u201cI had been a consumer and a superfan for a while,\u201d Kloss told DealBook. She did not disclose the size of her investment.\nFending off copycats will be key.Therabody has settled with more than 15 companies over I.P. infringement. Still, it continues to see competitors offering massage guns cheaper than its $400 Theragun Elite. People \u201cthink that the low price point is going to take the entire market \u2014 and that is probably a very na\u00efve understanding of I would say any consumer business,\u201d Nazarian told DealBook. \u201cTell me one industry where there is no premium brand.\u201d\nA Canadian lithium mine owned by the Australian company Sayona Mining could produce the raw materials needed to advance the Biden administration\u2019s climate goals and rival China\u2019s dominance of the battery supply chain. If it opens on schedule early next year, it will be the second North American source of lithium. But the mine has had several owners, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, and mining the materials needed for electric vehicles is an arduous process,writes The Times\u2019s Jack Ewing.\nThe price of lithium has soared fivefold since mid-2021, pushing the cost of electric vehiclesout of reach for many drivers. (Last year, the average new electric car in the U.S. cost about $66,000 \u2014 just a few thousand dollars less than the median household income.) Dozens oflithium minesare in various stages of development in North America, and Canada is determined to become a major source of raw materials and components for E.V.s. But most projects are years from production. Even if they raise the billions of dollars needed to get going, there is no guarantee they will yield enough lithium to meet the continent\u2019s needs.\nThe stakes are rising for the auto industry.The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed in August, provides incentives and subsidies for car buyers and automakers. But to qualify for the savings, which are worth a total of $10,000 or more per electric vehicle,battery makersmust use raw materials from North America or a country with which the U.S. has a trade agreement. Whether there will be enough lithium to meet soaring demand for electric vehicles is another question. \u201cThose of us in the industry are quite confident that lithium will be in short supply for the next decade,\u201d said Keith Phillips, chief executive of Piedmont Lithium, which owns 25 percent of the Sayona\u2019s Quebec project. He added, \u201cOthers are taking a contrarian view.\u201d\n\u2014Mark Russell, the outgoing C.E.O. of the electric vehicle maker Nikola, testifying at the securities fraud trial of the company\u2019s founder, Trevor Milton. Russell said he opposed Milton becoming executive chairman and maintaining power.\nThe rout in metaverse stocks is having a tangible effect on shareholders big and small. Exhibit A: Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta, has seen his personal fortuneshrink by $71 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nTech is one of the worst-performing sectors on the S&P 500 this year,and within that blur of red is the smaller subset of so-called metaverse stocks, or tech companies thatare building virtual worldsfor gaming, socializing and work. The investor Cathie Wood and Goldman Sachs were among those who heralded the metaverse as the biggest breakthrough in consumer tech since the introduction of the iPhone. They predicted the metaversewould be worth trillionsby the end of the decade.\nZuckerberg changed his company\u2019s name to Meta from Facebook last autumn, and has committed billions of dollars in investments to make his metaverse vision a reality. But investor appetite for tech companies embarking on ambitious, capital-intensive projects has sunk as interest rates soar. This has hurt metaverse stocks of all stripes. Exhibit B: The Metaverse E.T.F. is down 46.7 percent since its inception last year. Here are itstop five holdings, benchmarked against the S&P 500:\nThe lousy share price performance isn\u2019t just because of the metaverse.A slowing global economy, soaring energy prices and the bear market in crypto assets is also weighing down many of these stocks.\nDeals\nInstacart reportedly plans tosell mostly employees\u2019 sharesin its I.P.O. and won\u2019t raise much new capital for itself.
