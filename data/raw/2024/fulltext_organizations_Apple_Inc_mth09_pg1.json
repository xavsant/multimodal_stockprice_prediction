        "fulltext": "The European Union\u2019s highest court delivered the 27-nation bloc a major victory on Tuesday in its yearslong campaign to regulate the technology industry, ruling against Apple and Google in two landmark legal cases.\nThe decisions, issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union, were seen as an important test of efforts in Europe to clamp down on the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Apple and Google have been frequent targets for E.U. regulators, and the companies have battled the cases with appeals.\nIn the Apple case, the court sided with aEuropean Union order from 2016 for Irelandto collect 13 billion euros, worth about $14.4 billion today, in unpaid taxes from the company. Regulatorsdeterminedthat Apple had struck illegal deals with the Irish government that allowed the company to pay virtually nothing in taxes on its European business in some years.\nApple won an earlier decision to strike down the order, a ruling that the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive branch, appealed to the Court of Justice. As the case wound its way through the appeals process, the \u20ac13 billion was placed in an escrow account. The money will now be released to Ireland, a sizable injection to the country\u2019s treasury.\nApple said the decision effectively allowed the European Union to impose an additional tax on company income that was already taxed in the United States.\n\u201cThis case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the U.S.\u201d\nApple said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it expected to record a one-time income-tax charge of nearly $10 billion in its fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 28.\nIn the Google case, the court agreed with the commission\u2019s 2017 decision tofine the company \u20ac2.4 billionfor giving preferential treatment in Google search results to its own price-comparison shopping service over rival offerings. Google lost an appeal in 2021.\nGoogle said in a statement Tuesday that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the ruling, but that it had already adjusted its products to comply with the 2017 decision, including new designs to steer consumers to rival shopping price comparison websites. Some competitors have complained that Google\u2019s changes have not gone far enough.\n\u201cOur approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,\u201d Google said in the statement.\nWhen the European Union first penalized Apple and Google, the cases represented a major shift in how the tech industry was regulated. Until then, governments around the world had largely taken a hands-off approach to tech oversight as Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 now renamed Meta \u2014 ballooned in size and remade how people live, work, shop and communicate.\nThe cases helped establish the European Union and its antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, as the world\u2019s most aggressive tech industry watchdog. Other countries have followed Europe\u2019s lead to intensify scrutiny of the sector\u2019s business practices, particularly in the United States.\nYet years later, the cases have also come to represent the grinding pace of the E.U. regulatory system and have raised broader questions about whether authorities can keep up with the rapidly evolving tech sector.\nThe two cases address different legal issues. The Google case is largely about antitrust law, while the Apple case centers on the European Union\u2019s ability to intervene in areas of tax policy in one of its member nations.\nMs. Vestager cheered the court decisions at a news conference on Tuesday in Brussels. She said she was so surprised by the Apple decision that she cried because the commission had lost the earlier appeal. She added that the Google case should be remembered for starting a new era of antitrust law for the digital economy, providing a model for other regulators.\n\u201cThis case marked a pivotal shift in how digital companies were regulated and also perceived,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore this case, the prevailing belief was that digital companies should be left to operate freely.\u201d\nThe Apple case put Ireland in the unusual position of reluctantly collecting \u20ac13 billion from the tech giant. The Irish government said in a statement on Tuesday that it did not give Apple preferential tax treatment, but noted that it had already made changes to its tax laws.\n\u201cThe Apple case involved an issue that is now of historical relevance only,\u201d the governmentsaid.\nApple and Google are facing additional legal scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. This week, Google landed in U.S. federal court onantitrust chargesbrought by the Justice Department, which accused the company of abusing its dominance in the digital advertising sector. Last month, a federal judge ruled in a separate case thatGoogle was a monopolistin internet search because it had rigged the search engine market. In December, a federal jury said Google\u2019s management of the Google Play app store had also broken antitrust laws.\nApple also faces a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit over its iPhone policies.\nIn Europe, Google is appealing two other antitrust cases in addition to the shopping case. In 2018, regulators fined Google \u20ac4.34 billion for breaking antitrust laws to bolster its Android operating system. In 2019, the company was fined \u20ac1.49 billion for unfair business practices in the digital advertising market.\nApple is also facing E.U. charges related to its management of its App Store and policies in the music streaming market.\nThe European Union\u2019s protracted appeals process has drawn criticism from consumer rights groups and rival businesses that argue the slow pace has helped the two technology giants solidify their dominant market positions.\nThe European Union is trying to speed up its handling of competition cases. In 2022, the bloc passed theDigital Markets Act, which gives regulators broader authority to fine large tech platforms and force them to change business practices."
