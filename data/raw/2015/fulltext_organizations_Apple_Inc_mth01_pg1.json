        "title": "How, and Why, Apple Overtook Microsoft",
        "fulltext": "WhenMicrosoftstock was at a record high in 1999, and its market capitalization was nearly $620 billion, the notion thatApple Computerwould ever be bigger \u2014 let alone twice as big \u2014 was laughable. Apple was teetering on bankruptcy. And Microsoft\u2019s operating system was so dominant in personal computers, then the center of the technology universe, that the government deemed the company an unlawful monopoly.\nThis week, both Microsoft and Apple unveiled their latest earnings, and the once unthinkable became reality: Apple\u2019s market capitalization hit $683 billion, more than double Microsoft\u2019s current value of $338 billion.\nAt Apple\u2019s earnings conference call on Tuesday, its chief executive,Timothy D. Cook, called the quarter \u201chistoric\u201d and the earnings \u201camazing.\u201d Noting that Apple sold more than 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, during the quarter, he said the sheer volume of sales was \u201chard to comprehend.\u201d\nAppleearned $18 billionin the quarter \u2014 more than any company ever in a single quarter \u2014 on revenue of $75 billion. Its free cash flow of $30 billion in one quarter was more than double what IBM, another once-dominant tech company, generates in a full year, noted a senior Bernstein analyst, Toni Sacconaghi. The stock jumped more than 5 percent, even as the broader market was down.\nA far more subdued Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, who is trying to transform the company and reduce its dependence on the Windows operating system, referred to \u201cchallenges.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s revenuewas barely one-third of Apple\u2019s, and operating income of $7.8 billion was less than a quarter of Apple\u2019s. Microsoft shares dropped over 9 percent as investors worried about its aging personal computer software market.\nRobert X. Cringely, the pen name of the technology journalist Mark Stephens, told me this week that when he interviewed Microsoft\u2019s co-founder,Bill Gates, in 1998 for Vanity Fair, Mr. Gates \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine a situation in which Apple would ever be bigger and more profitable than Microsoft.\u201d\n\u201cHe knows he can\u2019t win,\u201d Mr. Gates said then of the Apple co-founderSteve Jobs.\nBut less than two decades later, Apple has won. How this happened contains some important lessons \u2014 including for Apple itself, if it wants to avoid Microsoft\u2019s fate. Apple, after all, is now as dependent on the success of one product line \u2014 theiPhoneaccounted for 69 percent of its revenue \u2014 as Microsoft once was with Windows.\nThe most successful companies need a vision, and both Apple and Microsoft have one. But Apple\u2019s was more radical and, as it turns out, more farsighted. Microsoft foresaw a computer on every person\u2019s desk, a radical idea when IBM mainframes took up entire rooms. But Apple went a big step further: Its vision was a computer in every pocket. That computer also just happened to be a phone, the most ubiquitous consumer device in the world. Apple ended up disrupting two huge markets.\n\u201cApple has been very visionary in creating and expanding significant new consumer electronics categories,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cUnique, disruptive innovation is really hard to do. Doing it multiple times, as Apple has, is extremely difficult. It\u2019s the equivalent of Pixar producing one hit after another. You have to give kudos to Apple.\u201d\nWalter Isaacson, who interviewed Mr. Jobs for his biography of the Apple co-founder and chief executive, said: \u201cSteve believed the world was going mobile, and he was right. And he believed that beauty matters. He was deeply moved by beautiful design. Objects of great functionality also had to be objects of desire.\u201d\nLike many successful companies, Microsoft nurtured its dominant position, but at the risk of missing potentially disruptive innovations. \u201cYou have to acknowledge that Microsoft has been successful and it still is,\u201d said Robert Cihra, a senior managing director and technology analyst at Evercore. \u201cBut clearly, they\u2019ve struggled over how to protect the Windows franchise while not having that hold them back in other areas. I think even Microsoft would agree that they\u2019ve been too concerned with protecting Windows over the years, to their detriment.\u201d\nBy contrast, \u201cSteve ingrained in the DNA of Apple not to be afraid to cannibalize itself,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cWhen the iPod was printing money, he said that someday the people making phones will figure out they can put music on phones. We have to do that first. Now, what you\u2019re seeing is that the bigger iPhone may be hurting sales of iPads, but it was the right thing to do.\u201d\nMr. Cihra agreed: \u201cApple laid waste to its iPod business. They\u2019re happier selling 74.5 million iPhones than they would be even if they still were selling that many iPods, which they wouldn\u2019t be anyway because someone else would have cannibalized them.\u201d\nMicrosoft has repeatedly tried to diversify, and continues to do so under Mr. Nadella. But \u201cit\u2019s been more of a follower whereas Apple has been more of a trendsetter, trying to reinvent an industry,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.\nIn belatedly buying Nokia, Microsoft is offering its own smartphone, the Windows phone, in head-to-head competition with Apple. While the device has garnered some critical praise, \u201cI\u2019m not sure consumers need a third option\u201d to the Android and iOS platforms, Mr. Cihra said. Microsoft\u2019s already tiny share of the smartphone market has been dropping.\nPerhaps more surprising, the Apple model of integrating all aspects of the design and manufacture of a product, long abandoned by other manufacturers, has been vindicated. Microsoft was once content to stick to software, ceding processors to companies like Intel and the PCs themselves to an array of other manufacturers.\n\u201cMicrosoft seemed to have the better business model for a very long time,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cBut in the end, it didn\u2019t create products of ethereal beauty. Steve believed you had to control every brush stroke from beginning to end. Not because he was a control freak, but because he had a passion for perfection.\u201d\nApple \u201cproved that you want to own the hardware and not just the platform,\u201d Mr. Cihra said. \u201cWith the advent of PCs, everyone gave up on that model except Apple. But if you get that model right, the upside leverage is huge. If you want an Android device, you can go anywhere. But if you want an iPhone, you have to go to Apple.\n\u201cIf you can do that, you get pricing power, and the profitability is unbelievable.\u201d Apple reported profit margins this quarter of just under 40 percent.\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s successful leadership transition to Mr. Cook, who took over as chief executive in 2011, shortly before Mr. Jobs died. It\u2019s not that Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates\u2019s immediate successor, and now Mr. Nadella haven\u2019t done a decent job at the helm of Microsoft. Until this week\u2019s dip, Microsoft shares were close to a record high. But Mr. Gates is still very much alive, and remains engaged with the company.\nMr. Jobs \u201ctold me that Tim Cook would be an inspiring leader,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cHe knew Tim wouldn\u2019t wake up every morning trying to figure out what Steve Jobs would do. Steve would never have made a bigger iPhone. He didn\u2019t believe in it. But Tim did it, and it was the right thing to do.\u201d\nSome investors worry that Apple could become the prisoner of its own success. As Mr. Sacconaghi noted, 69 percent of the company\u2019s revenue and 100 percent of its revenue growth for the quarter came from the iPhone, which makes Apple highly dependent on one product line. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk of another paradigm shift,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knows what that might be, but Apple is living and dying by the iPhone. It\u2019s a great franchise until it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nApple is also running into \u201cthe challenge of large numbers,\u201d Mr. Cihra said. With a market capitalization approaching $700 billion, the number \u201cscares people,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can it get much bigger? How is that possible?\u201d Apple is already the world\u2019s largest company, by a significant margin.\nBut he noted that by many measures, Apple shares appeared to be a bargain. \u201cThe valuation is still inexpensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s less than 13 times next year\u2019s earnings and less than 10 times cash flow,\u201d both below the market average. \u201cThose are very low multiples. They have $140 billion in cash on the balance sheet and they\u2019re generating $60 billion in cash a year. All the numbers are just enormous, which is hard for people get their heads around.\u201d\nMr. Cihra noted that Microsoft already dominates its core businesses, leaving little room for growth. But, he said, \u201cApple still doesn\u2019t have massive market share in any of its core markets. Even in smartphones, its share is only in the midteens. Apple\u2019s strategy has been to carve out a small share of a massive market. It\u2019s pretty much a unique model that leaves plenty of room for growth.\u201d\nCan Apple continue to live by Mr. Jobs\u2019s disruptive creed now that the company is as successful as Microsoft once was? Mr. Cihra noted that it was one thing for Apple to cannibalize its iPod or Mac businesses, but quite another to risk its iPhone juggernaut.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting tougher for Apple,\u201d Mr. Cihra said. \u201cThe question investors have is, what\u2019s the next iPhone? There\u2019s no obvious answer. It\u2019s almost impossible to think of anything that will create a $140 billion business out of nothing.\u201d"

        "title": "Bigger Settlement Said to Be Reached in Silicon Valley Antitrust Case",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most embarrassing episodes might be finally drawing to a close.\nCourt papers to be filed as early as Thursday will most likely put an end to a legal battle that has consumed the tech world since the Justice Department revealed in 2010 that several leading companies had conspired against their own employees.\nThe companies were accused of making secret deals not to hire each other\u2019s engineers, which kept the new products flowing but put a brake on the workers\u2019 mobility and incomes. The government investigation prompted private lawsuits, which were rolled up into one big class action that was scheduled to go to trial this spring.\nTo head off a trial and the exposure of reams of incriminating emails, Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe \u2014 the four remaining defendants \u2014 are offering to pay $415 million, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations. That sum is acceptable to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. If a judge approves, the case will end.\nThe settlement money is pocket change to the companies, which include some of the world\u2019s wealthiest. If they let the case go to trial, however, it might corrode their image as forward-thinking, worker-friendly benevolent empires. Steve Jobs of Apple was portrayed in court papers as the mastermind of the deals, but executives from Intel and Google also came off poorly.\nThis is the second effort at a settlement. Last spring, the two sides agreed on $324.5 million. After legal fees, that would have amounted to a few thousand dollars for each of the 64,000 class members.\nMichael Devine, a former Adobe engineer who was one of the five named plaintiffs in the case, disagreed with his lawyers and protested the first agreement. It was not enough money, Mr. Devine said then, given the wealth of the companies and the scale of their collusion.\nIn an unusual move for a judge in a class-action case, Lucy H. Koh of United States District Court in San Jose agreed. In August, she said the initial settlement was not \u201cwithin the range of reasonableness\u201d and rejected it.\nJudge Koh appeared annoyed that the lawyers for the class were taking the easy way out by settling rather than going to trial.\nThe new settlement, Mr. Devine said, is at least in the right ballpark. \u201cA reasonable person could go either way on whether it is adequate,\u201d he said.\nThe lawyers\u2019 share of the settlement is as much as 25 percent. If the case went to trial, the plaintiffs might lose, in which case the lawyers would get nothing for years of work. On the other hand, a jury could award the plaintiffs billions. At one point, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the damages were $3 billion, which would be tripled after a guilty verdict.\nJoseph R. Saveri of Joseph Saveri Law Firm and Dean Harvey of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not respond to requests for comment. Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe either declined to comment or did not respond.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s initial investigation resulted in antitrust complaints against Google, Apple, Intel, Intuit, Adobe, Pixar and Lucasfilm. The companies settled without admitting guilt or paying any fines. EBay settled a related case last year.\nPixar, Lucasfilm and Intuit settled the suit in 2013 before it was approved as a class action, when its legal prospects were much shakier. The companies paid a combined total of $20 million. One longtime employee of Intuit said in an interview that he had received $1,000 \u2014 not enough to pay for the vacation in the Caribbean that he had been hoping for.\nOrly Lobel, a professor of employment law at the University of San Diego who has been following the case closely, predicted that Judge Koh would approve the new settlement.\n\u201cIt still is low, given the egregious violations over a sustained period of time and embarrassing emails from the very top of these companies knowingly colluding to impede their employees\u2019 job mobility,\u201d Ms. Lobel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good result in that there has been much media attention to the illegality of such retention practices, real monetary consequences and promises to cease all such practices in the future.\u201d\nMr. Devine, who now works on a mobile start-up, said that \u201cno amount of money would be punitive to these defendants.\u201d Still, he agreed that after coming up with the settlement and enduring the publicity about the case, \u201cthey or any other firms would likely think twice\u201d before doing something like this again.\nThe market for engineers is at least as tight in 2015 as it was in 2005. But there is another reason that such collusion is now unlikely: Silicon Valley itself is disrupting the power of its executives.\nTom Leung was a Google engineer when the no-poaching agreements were in force. Last year he created a start-up, Poachable, where employees secretly list what it would take to make them jump. Companies that are hiring use Poachable as a source of talent. About 25,000 tech workers are on the site.\n\u201cServices like ours increase the liquidity and transparency of the employment market,\u201d Mr. Leung said. \u201cPower is going back to the talent, and a secret handshake between a few leaders is not going to stop it.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is famous for setting trends.\nIn China, though, Apple has found success by following one.\nFor years, Apple rivals like Samsung offered large-screen smartphones. Although the bigger phones sold well in China, Apple held off on releasing a similar model, and the country remained a weak spot. But Apple introduced its own versions last September, and now the sales spigot is wide open.\nThe company on Tuesday reported$16.1 billion in revenue from \u201cgreater China\u201d \u2014 which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 in its first fiscal quarter, up 70 percent from the same period a year ago. Canalys, a research firm, estimates that Apple is now the No. 1 smartphone maker in China.\nThe success in China helped push Apple to a blockbuster first quarter, increasing overall profit to $18 billion and revenue to $74.6 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, the company had profit of $13.1 billion and revenue of $57.6 billion.\nOverall sales of iPhonesshattered analysts\u2019 predictions. Apple said it sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, as many as 12 million more than expected.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call that excitement in China over the new phones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, was \u201cphenomenal.\u201d He also noted that the new iPhones had attracted the highest number of customers who switched from an Android device.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible market,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cPeople love Apple products. And we are going to do our best to serve the market.\u201d\nNot too long ago, sales of Apple products in China were slipping. Last October, Apple was the No. 6 smartphone maker in China, trailing its Asian rivals Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Xiaomi and Yulong, according to Canalys.\nFor Apple, gaining a foothold in overseas markets like China has become increasingly vital. Its growth has slowed over the last few years as the smartphone market has become saturated in the United States and parts of Europe.\nOver the last couple of years, Apple has made a series of moves to compete more aggressively in China. In late 2013, it reached an important deal to sell iPhones with China Mobile, the largest wireless network in the world, with more than 800 million subscribers. The company also continues to build its operations in greater China and has plans to open 25 new stores over the next two years, adding to the 15 stores it currently operates in the region.\nIn 2013, Apple released the iPhone 5C, a lower-cost version of the smartphone that analysts thought would help increase its growth in China. But the latest numbers suggest that consumers in China wanted bigger iPhones, not cheaper ones.\nIn an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, declined to say how many iPhones were sold specifically in China. But he said that iPhone sales in greater China were up 83 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nMr. Maestri also noted that iPhone sales were still higher in the United States than in China. Some earlier news reports had predicted that Apple\u2019s sales in China would surpass sales in the United States.\nMost of Apple\u2019s revenue in the quarter came from the Americas, where Apple reported $30.6 billion in sales. Mr. Cook recently said it was only a matter of time until most of Apple\u2019s sales came from China.\nThe company\u2019s overall revenue, almost $75 billion, easily beat analysts\u2019 average estimates of $67.7 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. The company\u2019s shares, which have gained more than 50 percent in the last year, rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.\nBen Bajarin, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said Apple\u2019s earnings showed that it did not hurt for the company to be late to releasing larger smartphones.\n\u201cEverybody was saying they\u2019re losing share \u2014 maybe they\u2019ll never get it back,\u201d he said. \u201cSure enough, there was tremendous demand. The fact that they weren\u2019t first didn\u2019t really hurt their customer base.\u201d\nStrong sales of Macs also contributed to the company\u2019s growth. The company said it sold 5.5 million of the computers in the quarter, up from 4.8 million in the same quarter of last year.\nBut iPad sales continued to shrink. The company sold 21.4 million iPads in the quarter, down 18 percent from 26 million in the quarter a year ago.\nMr. Maestri said it had become clear that customers were upgrading to newer models of iPads more slowly than they upgraded iPhones. But he said the company was pleased with overall customer satisfaction with iPads.\n\u201cWe feel confident about the future of iPad,\u201d he said.\nOn the earnings call, Mr. Cook said he continued to be optimistic about the iPad, partly because there were still many customers buying iPads for the first time. Over 70 percent of people buying iPads in China are first-time buyers, he said.\nIncreasingly, though, the company\u2019s fortunes rely on the iPhone. Sales of iPhones accounted for 69 percent of the company\u2019s revenue in the quarter, up from 56 percent in the same quarter a year ago.\n\u201cA bet on Apple is increasingly a bet on the iPhone,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. \u201cThe good news is, iPhones are great. The bad news is, right now that\u2019s driving over 100 percent of the revenue growth of the company.\u201d\nMany investors would like to see Apple\u2019s revenue be more diversified, which is raising some of the expectations for Apple\u2019s coming entry into the smartwatch market.\nOn Tuesday, the company said its smartwatch, the Apple Watch, was set to be released in April.\nMr. Cook said he had been wearing his Apple Watch every day.\n\u201cI can\u2019t live without it,\u201d he said."

        "title": "New York Attorney General Seeks Expanded Reports on Data Breaches",
        "fulltext": "Across much of the United States, companies are not required to report a data breach if it is limited to the theft of email addresses and passwords, even though many companies do so of their own volition.\nEric T. Schneiderman, the\n                                        New York attorney general, intends on Thursday to propose a bill that would expand his state\u2019s definition of what constitutes the type of private information whose breach would mandate a disclosure to include\n                                        email addresses and passwords. Companies would be required to keep this data secure and notify consumers and employees in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach involving that information.\nThe proposal would be a significant change to the state\u2019s current definition, which mainly covers the unintended disclosure of a person\u2019sSocial Securitynumber, driver\u2019s license or credit card number. The proposal\n                                        would update a consumer protection measure that Mr. Schneiderman sees as \u201coutdated and toothless,\u201d given a growing number of hackings at big companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time we updated our data security law and expanded protections for consumers,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.\nThe attorney general, a Democrat, expects to attract both Democratic and Republican sponsors for the bill, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The attorney general, who cannot\n                                        introduce a bill on his own, wants the proposal in New York to become a model for expanding the safeguarding of personal information in other states.\nEarlier this week,President Obama said that he intended to pushfor a federal law that would set a national standard for when companies must inform consumers of a breach that resulted in the disclosure or theft of personal information. The measure would require companies to\n                                        notify consumers within 30 days of the discovery of an incident.\nThe various proposals to stiffen company reporting requirements in the case of a data breach come after several prominent corporate hackings, including those atTarget,Home Depot,Staples,JPMorgan ChaseandSony Pictures.\n                                        Last summer, Mr. Schneiderman issued a report that said the number of data breaches reported to New York authorities had more than tripled from 2006 to 2013.\nIn New York, the proposed expanded definition of private information would also include data about a consumer or employee\u2019s medical history, health insurance information or biometric data. The expanded definition\n                                        would go beyond a standard adopted in California in 2013 that also requires companies to notify consumers if their email addresses and passwords are pilfered or hacked. Last summer, Florida stiffened its breach\n                                        notification requirements as well.\nBiometric identification of consumers and employees is likely to grow in the coming years.Apple,\n                                        for instance, is already using a fingerprint identification system \u2014 a type of biometric data \u2014 in its Apple Pay electronic payment system. For several years, some banks have used biometric identification\n                                        systems to safeguard access to safe deposit boxes.\nThe New York bill would reward businesses for taking steps to protect personal information and cooperating quickly with New York authorities in the event of a breach. It would provide them some protection from liability\n                                        in civil lawsuits if they can demonstrate having taken adequate steps to protect private information from being hacked or inadvertently released.\n\u201cWe are trying to find a way that businesses can pick up the phone and report an incident without feeling like law enforcement is breathing down their necks, while at the same time allowing us to do meaningful\n                                        investigations and get to the root of why consumers weren\u2019t adequately protected,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said of his proposal.\nThe measure would include some guideposts about the kind of security measures large corporations and small businesses should be expected to enact to protect customer and employee personal information.\nNew York\u2019s current law concerning the notification of security breaches has not been updated since 2005.\nMr. Schneiderman is part of a group of about 15 state attorneys general who have been conducting an investigation into last summer\u2019s cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase that affected 83 million consumers and small\n                                        businesses. The attorneys general want the bank, the nation\u2019s largest in terms of assets, to explain how it can be certain that no sensitive account information was compromised.\nThe group, led by the state attorneys general from Illinois and Connecticut, sent a letter on Jan. 8 to JPMorgan and its outside lawyers seeking more details about the nature of the breach and what measures the bank\n                                        is taking to prevent a similar incident.\nJPMorgan has said the breach, which went undetected at the bank for at least two months, resulted in the hackers\u2019 getting access to only customer phone numbers, addresses and email addresses. More sensitive information,\n                                        like financial information, Social Security numbers, and email password and user identification combinations, remained safe, the bank said.\nJPMorgan began working with federal law enforcement officials in the investigation of the breach shortly after it was discovered in early August.\nThe bank has noted that under existing federal and state laws it was not required to publicly disclose the breach to consumers since the data taken was largely contact information, yet it did so on its own accord.\nA version of this article appears in print on 01/15/2015, on pageB3of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: New York Attorney General Seeks Expanded Reports on Data Breaches."

        "fulltext": "Q.I recently got a new printer for my Mac, but I still see my previous printer (which I got rid of) listed in the options when I go to print. How do I get the old model out of the list?\nA.You canremoveyour former model from the list of available printers in the OS X Print box in your Mac\u2019s System Preferences. To get there, go to the Apple menu and select System Preferences, or click the System Preferences icon in the Mac\u2019s desktop Dock.\nIn the System Preferences box, click the Printers & Scanners icon; some older versions of OS X have a Print & Scan icon instead. In the list on the side of the window, select the name of the printer you want to remove and click the minus (-) button underneath. In the confirmation box that appears, click Delete Printer.\nOS X itself includes drivers for many printers and can update the software from the App Store when needed. If you installed special software yourself to use with the printer and want to remove it from your system, you should check with the printer\u2019s manufacturer for specific instructions. Depending on its maker, your printer may have included its own utility for uninstalling the software or you may have toremove it manually.\nEditing Your Netflix Viewing History\nQ.How do I prevent certain movies that I\u2019ve watched on Netflix from being listed on the main Netflix screen?\nA.You can remove video titles displayed in the Continue Watching or Recently Watched area by logging into your Netflix account online and clicking the link for theViewing Activitypage. In the list of movie and TV show titles, click the \u201cX\u201d next to each one you would like to remove. (Keep in mind, Netflix user profiles specified as \u201cKids\u201d do not have the option to remove recently viewed videos.)\nIf you use the Netflix app with your account for watching video on mobile gadgets and TV set-top boxes, it may take up to 24 hours for the titles you deleted from the Viewing Activity page to also disappear from your other gadgets. Because Netflix uses items in your viewing history as part of its formula for suggesting other shows that may appeal to you, it will no longer factor in those deleted titles when recommending similar videos for you to consider in the \u201cBecause you watched...\u201d area."

        "title": "In a World of Phones, Gadgets Must Adapt",
        "fulltext": "Technology fanatics descend every January on Las Vegas for the International CES, a colossal gathering of gadgetry and geekery where some of the world\u2019s largest companies show off their best ideas for the future.\nThis year, as ineveryrecentyear, the show has been burdened by existential angst, with many tech writers saying they planned to skip an event no longer seen as vital. It has been ages since anything momentous was unveiled at CES.\nBut the travails of CES are a symptom of a larger transformation in tech. The era dominated by consumer electronics \u2014 what most of us call gadgets \u2014 is in turmoil.\nOne reason is that many devices have been superseded by a single, all-powerful tool: the smartphone. Today, just about everything that once required a small, dedicated electronic device \u2014 from cameras to portable game consoles to GPS navigators to music players totoo many others to name\u2014 works better as an app on a phone.\nAt the same time, smartphones have created new categories of capabilities that have eclipsed gadgets as the tech industry\u2019s center of energy and innovation.\nI\u2019m talking about photo apps like Instagram, messaging companies like WhatsApp and Snapchat, transportation systems like Uber and Lyft, and Apple Pay, the wireless payment system created by a company best known for its hardware.\nThese services, powered by smart software, use our phones\u2019 constant connection to the cloud, and their powers to connect us with one another, to create tech experiences that wouldn\u2019t have been possible with the gadgets of yesteryear. None of them would ever have graced a stage at CES, because none of these things are really gadgets; they\u2019re way more exciting than that.\nHere\u2019s the important lesson for consumer electronics companies: The future of tech may not be in flashier, more powerful hardware, but instead in services enabled by clever software. The gadgets matter, but only if they allow for software that can create useful, perhaps groundbreaking services that work across all our gadgets.\n\u201cToday, what every customer expects is for their device to be a platform,\u201d said John MacFarlane, the chief executive of the connected-speaker company Sonos, referring to a design practice in which the machine\u2019s intelligence and user interface are built out of flexible software rather than baked into the hardware \u2014 thus enabling future improvements through updates.\nSonos, which was founded in 2002, was one of the first hardware start-ups todesign its products this way.\nSonos\u2019s speakers offer the best example of why a design that is intended to be flexible can be so useful.\nIn 2005, when Sonos sold its first multiroom music system, the units played music stored on a computer, and they had to be controlled by the company\u2019s own touch-screen remote control. But the company believed that anyone who bought its speakers would keep them for a long time, probably a decade or more, so the device would have to be able to live through unpredictable tech changes.\nSo early in its design process, Sonos decided to make sure the software brains of its devices could be regularly updated. Every few months, the device would check in with the home base and acquire new capabilities.\n\u201cDid we know there would be an iPhone?\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t knowApplewas working on one. And we certainly didn\u2019t foresee tablets. But we made a decision to put the user experience on any device that was close to you, like your phone or P.D.A.\u201d\nAs a result, in the years since, Sonos\u2019s speakers have gained a range of new powers. They can be controlled by a smartphone app, play music from dozens of streaming music services and connect to a home-automation system, allowing the system to read you the weather report when you step into your kitchen for breakfast. If you bought those 2005-era Sonos speakers, you would have noticed something almost unheard-of in consumer tech, not to mention in life: The older the speakers got, the more they seemed capable of doing.\nSonos was a pioneer, but a range of hardware start-ups have embraced a philosophy that prizes flexible software as the heart of gadgetry.\nNest transformed the previously staid market for home thermostats by creating a model that leverages software connected to the Internet. In the same vein, firms like Dropcam made software-powered cameras, and companies like Fitbit and Jawbone made connected fitness gadgets.\nBenedict Evans, an analyst at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, noted that a lot of these novel devices might not have been possible without the rise of smartphones. Not only do apps function as the user interface for many of these devices, but the phone industry has also created a supply chain of cheap computing components like processors and motion sensors that are used in many new connected devices.\n\u201cIf you sit and count how many devices have been destroyed by the smartphone, you may end up with a dozen categories \u2014 but you may also end up with two or three dozen new things that become possible thanks to the smartphone,\u201d said Mr. Evans, the author of \u201cMobile Is Eating the World,\u201d an examination of how smartphones have roiled the traditional tech business.\nStill, these forward-thinking manufacturers must take pains to keep their devices one step ahead of the advance of smartphones, which are always gaining new, gadget-destroying capabilities. Consider the market for basic fitness trackers \u2014 for instance, devices like theFitbit Zip, a thumb-size, $60 device that hooks to your belt and counts your steps as you move.\nSuch a tracker, which connects to a phone to sync its data, might have made sense a few years ago, when people weren\u2019t as hooked to their phones. But as people carry their phones around with them more often \u2014 and as our phones become capable of better measurement, including elevation \u2014 will people still need a basic activity tracker? After all, today\u2019s top phones, including the iPhone and Samsung\u2019s new devices, have built-in apps that track your motion.\nIt\u2019s precisely because of this risk of being displaced by phones that gadget makers ought to think of their hardware as a platform for software.\nIn that world, a basic activity tracker that was rendered superfluous by a phone might acquire new capabilities for some other use. Maybe it could be converted, via software, into an activity tracker for pets? Or perhaps it could become part of a home automation system.\nAs mycolleague Molly Wood reported, many companies at CES this week are focusing on plans for integrating their devices into connected systems, rather than simply bringing out flashier hardware.\nDon\u2019t expect this integration to happen overnight; it could take years before we get to a point where it\u2019s a given that any device you buy will connect to any other. Gadget makers would do well to hasten this era: Their salvation lies in software."

        "fulltext": "Q.When I use Facebook on my computer, I want to see the most current posts in my news feed, and not the \u201cTop Stories,\u201d which always seem to be older. When I change the view to \u201cMost Recent,\u201d it always reverts back to \u201cTop Stories\u201d after a while. Why won\u2019t it stay on \u201cMost Recent\u201d?\nA.Over the years, Facebookhas been known to tinkerwith the algorithms used to compile the stories in a user\u2019s news feed. Certain things, like new comments on a post, may cause it to resurface in the feed ahead of newer posts. Other factors, liketrending topicsorposts seen as too promotionalcan also affect the content and chronology of the news feed.\nThe inability of the \u201cMost Recent\u201d setting to stick permanently, however, is by design. Facebook\u2019shelp guide even states it: \u201cYour News Feed will eventually return to the Top Stories view.\u201d\nIf you are tired of changing the setting when it flips back to \u201cTop Stories,\u201d you may be able to find a browser extension that lets you customize your Facebook experience.Social FixerandF.B. Purityare two such add-ons, but keep in mind that software updates, or changes Facebook itself makes, could affect how well the extensions work. In addition, pasting the URLhttp://www.facebook.com/?sk=h_chrinto your browser can force your news feed to sort itself in the order of most recent posts. You can also create a bookmark from the URL and use it when you visit the site.\nTaking a Mac Off the Map\nQ.How do I make my Mac stop using my current location?\nA.Both Mac OS X and your browser can track your current geographical location. While some people find this useful for getting more relevant search results (businesses that are actually close to you, for example), others find it creepy. However, certain programs on the computer you may want to use \u2014 like theFind My Macservice, Maps and weather apps \u2014 also use the Mac\u2019s location function.\nIf you just want to stop the browser from noting your whereabouts when you search, you can adjust the program\u2019s settings so that it stops using your coordinates. Apple\u2019s site has the steps forturning off location services in its Safari browser. Google has similarinstructions for Chromeand Mozilla has information about using (or not using) thelocation-aware browsing feature of Firefox. Windows users candisable Internet Explorer\u2019s Location Servicesas well.\nTo go beyond the browser and turn off the location-tracking function at the system level in Mac OS X 10.8 and later, go to the Apple menu in the top-left corner and choose System Preferences, or just click the System Preferences icon on the Mac\u2019s Dock. In the System Preferences box, click the Security & Privacy icon and then select the Privacy tab.\nMake sure Location Services is selected on the left side of the box and turn off the checkbox next to \u201cEnable Location Services.\u201d If the checkbox is on but dimmed, click the padlock icon in the bottom corner of the box and enter the administrator\u2019s user name and password to unlock the setting, then turn off the checkbox."

        "title": "Apple and Ericsson Sue Each Other Over Mobile Patents",
        "fulltext": "Apple and Ericsson have sued each other in federal courts after reaching an impasse over mobile patents.\nApple filed its complaint on Monday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in which it said that Ericsson,\u00a0the telecommunications company, was demanding excessive royalties\n                                        for patents related to LTE, for Long Term Evolution, which is the latest high-speed wireless technology used for transmitting data between cellular networks and mobile devices.\nEricsson responded with a lawsuit on Wednesday filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Ericsson said it had failed to reach an agreement with Apple after two years of negotiations,\n                                        resulting in Apple lacking a license for its technologies. It asked a court to decide\u00a0whether its offers to Apple were fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory.\nKristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the company had deep respect for intellectual property and it had always been willing to pay a fair price for using so-called standards-essential patents. Essential patents\n                                        cover basic technologies that companies have to use in their products to comply with industry standards.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have not been able to agree with Ericsson on a fair rate for their patents so, as a last resort, we are asking the courts for help,\u201d Ms. Huguet said in a statement.\nEricsson said its goal was to reach a mutually beneficial resolution with Apple, which had long been a partner. It also noted that every Apple mobile device used Ericsson\u2019s patented technologies and that it wanted\n                                        reasonable compensation from companies that benefited from technologies it had developed.\n\u201cWe believe it is reasonable to get fair compensation from companies benefiting from the development we have made over the course of the last 30 years,\u201d Kasim Alfalahi, chief intellectual property officer\n                                        at Ericsson, said in a statement.\nFor Apple, a fight over standards-essential patents is nothing new. In 2013, the United States International Trade Commission ordered a ban of older Apple products, after determining that Apple had violated a patent\n                                        that Samsung owned related to transmission of data over cellular networks. Apple fought the ban, and the decision was ultimatelyoverturned by the Obama administration.\nA version of this article appears in print on 01/15/2015, on pageB11of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Apple and Ericsson Sue Each Other Over Patents."
