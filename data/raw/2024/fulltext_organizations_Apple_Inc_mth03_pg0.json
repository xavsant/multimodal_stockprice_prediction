        "title": "Apple Blocks Epic Games From Using iPhone Tools in Escalation of Feud",
        "fulltext": "When the European Union passed a 2022 law to loosen Apple\u2019s grip on the app economy, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, began planning to launch a competing app store for developers.\nBut before that law could go into effect this week, Apple has blocked Epic\u2019s European subsidiary from using iPhone software tools, making it impossible for the game developer to create the Epic Games Store.\nIn correspondence from Apple to Epic Games, the tech giant said that Epic had shown in the past it was unwilling to follow Apple\u2019s rules to protect the App Store and that it couldn\u2019t return to the Developer Program that supports it. Apple also objected to Epic\u2019s criticism of Apple\u2019s plans to comply with Europe\u2019s tech competition law.\nApple\u2019s move is the latest salvo in a long-running battle with Epic. In 2020, Epic broke the App Store\u2019s rules by encouraging customers to pay it directly for features in Fortnite. Apple threw Epic out of the App Store, andEpic sued Apple for violating antitrust lawsby requiring developers to use its payment system.\nWith its rejection of Epic\u2019s access to developer tools in Europe, Apple is testing the boundaries of the European Union\u2019s tech competition law. The Digital Markets Act, which takes effect Thursday, requires Apple to give app makers alternatives for selling software to iPhone and iPad users, including the ability to use alternative payment systems and competing app stores.\nAn Apple spokesman said in a statement that \u201cApple has the right to terminate\u201d any of Epic\u2019s games and that it had done so because of Epic\u2019s \u201cegregious breach of its contractual obligations.\u201d\nTim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic, said his company had invested billions of dollars to create the Epic Games Store and would file a complaint to European regulators over Apple\u2019s action.\n\u201cWe see Apple\u2019s decision to block us from competing as a blatant effort to kneecap its leading competitor,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said, adding: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about Epic versus Apple. The D.M.A. is about ensuring consumers the benefit of competition, of better prices.\u201d\nIn 2018, Epic Games launched a digital store to distribute games on PCs and other devices. The store currently takes a 12 percent commission for every game it sells, which is less than the 30 percent Apple typically collects.\nEpic is the among the first app makers to complain that Apple is blocking competing app stores. But other developers havecriticized Apple\u2019s plans to comply with the Digital Markets Actand called on E.U. regulators to investigate the tech giant.\nShould the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, open a formal investigation into complaints from Epic or other developers, it could set up a lengthy legal battle that might force Apple to change or risk fines of up to 10 percent of its global annual revenue, which was nearly $400 billion last year.\nAn investigation would deepen the challenges confronting Apple over its App Store policies. On Monday, E.U. regulators finedApple 1.8 billion euros($1.95 billion) for thwarting competition among streaming music rivals. Last year, South Korea\u2019s telecommunications regulator said itmight fine Apple $15.4 millionfor \u201cunfair practices.\u201d\nApple\u2019s dispute with Epic\u2019s plans to create a competing app store in Europe began last month. Epic wrote Apple saying it planned to use its subsidiary in Sweden to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite to iPhones and iPads in Europe. Initially, Apple granted the subsidiary, Epic Games Sweden A.B., a developer account, but it later terminated the account.\nIn an email to Mr. Sweeney,which Epic Games posted on its website, Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store, questioned Epic\u2019s willingness to follow Apple\u2019s rules. He said that Epic had deliberately broken Apple\u2019s policies before filing its lawsuit in the United States and that Mr. Sweeney had called Apple\u2019s plan to comply with Europe\u2019s tech law\u201chot garbage\u201d and a \u201chorror show.\u201d\n\u201cYour colorful criticism of our D.M.A. compliance plan, coupled with Epic\u2019s past practices of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not plan to follow the rules,\u201d Mr. Schiller wrote.\nMr. Sweeney replied that Epic was \u201cacting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple.\u201d\nA lawyer representing Apple later wrote Epic Games to tell it that its Sweden subsidiary\u2019s account had been terminated. Mr. Sweeney said the correspondence was the totality of Epic\u2019s exchange with Apple."

        "title": "Apple Reverses Course and Allows Epic Games to Start Competing App Store",
        "fulltext": "Days afterEpic Games, the maker of Fortnite, complained publiclythat Apple had blocked it from starting a competing app store in Europe, the technology companies said Apple had reversed course and would allow Epic to go ahead with its plan.\nThe reversal highlights the way that Apple is changing its operations to comply with a new European tech competition law. That law, the Digital Markets Act, which went into effect on Thursday, requires Apple to give app makers alternatives for selling software to iPhone and iPad users, including the ability to use competing app stores and payment systems other than its own.\nBy opening up the iPhone to competing stores, European regulators hope that smartphone users across the region will benefit from lower prices. Epic Games, which planned to start a competing app store, currently takes a 12 percent commission for every game it sells on personal computers and other platforms. The fee is less than half of the 30 percent that Apple typically collects.\n\u201cPeople ask: Why do you need another app store?\u201d said Justin Kan, one of the founders of the video game streaming service Twitch and the creator of Stash, an open payments platform for video game companies. \u201cBut competition generally creates lower prices. Ultimately, it\u2019s probably good for Apple because it could grow the market of apps.\u201d\nApple and Epic have been feuding over App Store commission for years. In 2020, Epic broke the App Store\u2019s rules by encouraging customers to pay it directly for features in Fortnite. Apple threw Epic out of the App Store, andEpic sued Apple for violating antitrust lawby requiring developers to use its payment system.\nThe feud was reignited in the wake of Europe\u2019s competition law. Epic planned to start a competing app store called the Epic Games Store through a subsidiary in Sweden. Initially, Apple granted the subsidiary, Epic Games Sweden A.B., a developer account so that it could access the software tools necessary for the release.\nBut Apple later terminated Epic\u2019s account, saying that it couldn\u2019t trust Epic to follow its rules. Apple also complained that Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive, had called Apple\u2019s plan to comply with the new tech law \u201chot garbage.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Sweeney said that he had assured Apple that Epic would follow the rules. He also released emails where he made those assurances directly to Apple.\nAn Apple spokesman said Friday that Epic had committed to following its rules, including its policies in Europe.\nMr. Sweeney said that Apple changed its plan after a \u201cswift inquiry\u201d by European regulators. He called it \u201ca big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Annie Wu Henry hasn\u2019t gotten a notification on her phone in two years. Calls go straight to voice mail. Apps vibrate their updates into the ether. Texts pile up silently. Same with emails. They have to wait until she decides to look at her device next.\nThat\u2019s because of Do Not Disturb mode, a phone setting that acts as a modern-dayaway messagefor smartphone users, cautioning those who contact you that you\u2019re likely to take a while to return their messages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s expectation setting,\u201d said Ms. Henry, a 28-year-old digital strategist who worked to elect Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get to it, it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019m just busy.\u201d (She noted that she had notifications on when she wasmanaging his social mediaduring the 2022 campaign \u2014 but only then.)\n\u201cIf it\u2019s important, they will send the message or try to make the call or get in touch with me in one way or another,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not, maybe it\u2019ll just give them a second to think about if it\u2019s actually important.\u201d\nThe modern phone seems to never stop vibrating, pinging and lighting up in an unending quest for our attention. Short of turning the phone off and rendering it a useless brick, there\u2019s little one can do to get distance from a device. That\u2019s where Do Not Disturb mode comes in.\nWhen the setting is enabled on an iPhone, any would-be texters see a disclaimer that the person they are trying to contact has notifications silenced. Beneath that is a tempting offer: \u201cNotify Anyway.\u201d If clicked, the notification will go through as it normally would, but the message seems clear enough: Don\u2019t expect an answer, at least not right away.\nAppleintroducedDo Not Disturb in 2012 \u2014 with other smartphone operating systemsfollowing suitnot long after \u2014 but the use of the setting seems to have become more popular lately, as people seek more measures to limit screen time orditch their devices altogether. After more than a decade of smartphones, some of us are jumping at the chance to establish boundaries.\n\u201cPhones are built for addiction,\u201d said Sean Grover, a psychotherapist in New York. \u201cAnd like anything that\u2019s an addictive substance, you need to contain it. You need to have a structure around it.\u201d\nMr. Grover sees Do Not Disturb as the virtual version of the signs that people can choose to hang outside their hotel doors. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a hand up and saying, \u2018Don\u2019t enter,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI like the firmness of that.\u201d\nBut once it goes up, it can be hard to take down. Like Ms. Henry, some say they switched on the mode long ago and may never turn back \u2014 occasionally to the frustration of their friends.\n\u201cI understand if someone is sleeping or busy, but if it\u2019s on all the time, it functions like a locked door and a \u2018Go Away\u2019 doormat,\u201d said Katriel Nopoulos, a 35-year-old disability activist in Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of hospitality and welcoming.\u201d\nAnd that is often the point. Zoe Marzo, 36, said she first enabled Do Not Disturb when a friend wouldn\u2019t stop texting her. \u201cIt was incessant,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I kind of started using it as an extra defense and boundary. Now I have it on all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that because we have our phones with us all the time, there is an entitlement to people\u2019s time,\u201d Ms. Marzo, a Ph.D. student who is researching the use of technological devices in everyday life, added. \u201cWe need to have our own personal space.\u201d\nNicholette Leanza, a clinical counselor in Ohio, says the use of Do Not Disturb can be a way of navigating the feeling of being stretched too thin by the demands of life \u2014 which often arrive in the form of infinite phone notifications. But if patients have Do Not Disturb on all the time, she would want to explore why they felt the need to be constantly unreachable.\n\u201cFor some people, it is avoidance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I don\u2019t want to be connected at all, to anyone.\u2019 So I would have them dive deeper, like what\u2019s that about? When you\u2019re isolating yourself, that could be indicative of other stuff going on, too.\u201d\nMs. Henry says there have been some downsides of the setting \u2014 she often misses the notifications from the appBeReal, which prompts users at a different time once a day to snap a photo of what they\u2019re doing. And once, she missed an email for a job she had applied to asking her to interview. By the time she saw the notification, the job had been filled.\nBut for the most part, she appreciates that the feature buys her some time to respond to the many demands on her attention. Despite these hiccups, she says she\u2019s sticking with it.\n\u201cI think it just gives me a little grace,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Is China\u2019s Era of High Growth Over?",
        "fulltext": "China announced an officialgrowth target of about 5 percenton Tuesday that\u2019s already looking hard to pull off. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is facing headwinds, from a consumer slowdown to weak investor confidence and a trade war with the West.\nBut the growth target only tells part of the story of how Beijing is rethinking economic policy.\nLeft out of the pronouncements: a stimulus package.Investors watch the annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, and a parallel meeting of China\u2019s top policy body, for clues on thegovernment\u2019s priorities. Spending is set to remain at roughly last year\u2019s level, suggesting that there\u2019s no big-bang boost on the horizon.\nThat\u2019s not great news for Western brands that have ridden a surge in Chinese consumer spending to big growth in recent years. Apple reportedly has seen its Chinese iPhones salesplummet this year.\nThe growth target matches last year\u2019s too,when the post-lockdown economy grew 5.2 percent. (Some analysts say the real growth rate was much lower.) Global investors need to accept that slow growth is the new norm,says Yu Jie, a senior fellow on China at Chatham House, a think tank. \u201cBeijing wants to draw a line under the past economic model which focused on infrastructure and property,\u201d she told DealBook.\nBeijing\u2019s real focus is reshaping the economy.The government knows that it faces a raft of challenges, but China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is trying to move away from debt-fueled sectors like property and move toward strategically important industries. The terms it uses are \u201chigh-quality development\u201d and \u201cnew productive forces,\u201d which includes electric vehicles, climate tech, life sciences, and artificial intelligence. The latest measures to achieve that: Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s second-highest official, said on Tuesday that the government would increase spending for science and technology research by 10 percent.\nMore state-led investment is the priority,rather than \u201cother kinds of more politically painful reforms,\u201d George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Center and a former chief economist at UBS, told DealBook.\nIt may also mean more pressure on private businesses to toe the party line, with evenbankers being ordered to be more patrioticand develop a \u201cfinancial culture with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\nDonald Trump is expected to win big in Super Tuesday contests.Voters in 15 states, including California and Texas, are headed to the polls. A sweeping Trump victory in Republican primaries could force Nikki Haley to drop out. Elsewhere, the outspoken billionaireMark Cuban endorsed President Bidenin the general election, and supporters of the No Labels third-party initiative worry that the group isno longer politically viable.\nThe White House takes on \u201ccorporate rip-offs.\u201dThe Biden administration said on Tuesday that it was forming a \u201cstrike force\u201d to coordinate federal efforts to combat\u201cunfair and illegal pricing.\u201d It\u2019s part of Biden\u2019s effort to pin rising prices \u2014 a voter concern that iscosting him politically\u2014 in part on greedy companies, a topic sure to resurface during his State of the Union address on Thursday.\nNelson Peltz publishes his full case against Disney.The activist investor shared hiswhite paperoutlining his recommendations for turning around the media giant; among them are finding a partner for Disney\u2019s broadcast TV assets and scrapping plans to introduce a new ESPN streaming service that would supersede ESPN+. Peltz\u2019s 133-page dossier comes less than a month before Disney shareholders vote on whether to give him control of two board seats.\nEuropean antitrust authorities have finally taken on Apple,fining the iPhone maker $2 billionfor trying to thwart competition in music streaming. A bigger test of the E.U.\u2019s ability to constrain tech giants is still to come.\nOn Thursday, the Digital Markets Act, intended to ensure competition across popular digital platforms, will come into force. But skeptics think that tech behemoths like Apple will find ways to avoid being hemmed in.\nThe D.M.A. represents an aggressive effort to police digital competition.Monday\u2019s fine covered the narrow issue of Apple moving to thwart rivals like Spotify in music streaming. The new law is supposed to prevent \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of major platforms \u2014 including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta \u2014 from using their market power to lock out new entrants.\nThe cost of not complying is steep: D.M.A. offenders could be forced to pay up to10 percent of their global revenue, or up to 20 percent for repeated violations.\nApple says it will comply with the law,offering multiple optionsto app developers that it says could reduce their fees. Several involve paying Apple a per-download fee once their apps hit a million downloads a year.\nBut critics say Apple has sought to skirt the new rules.In the Netherlands and South Korea, both of which adopted legislation that required app store owners to allow alternative payment systems, the iPhone maker agreed to open up its app store. But it began charging a 26 percent commission to those using non-Apple payment methods, a move that the Korean government said undermined its law.\nIn aletter to the European Commissionpublished last week, three dozen companies argued that Apple was taking a similar approach to the D.M.A. \u201cApple has a history of skirting these rules,\u201dDaniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., said after the E.U. fine was announced on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep on acting the way it has been acting.\u201d\nApple has the resources to fight.The company said it planned to appeal Monday\u2019s ruling and could contest accusations made under the D.M.A. It\u2019s worth noting that the tech giant is still fighting against other government punishments, including a \u20ac13 billion tax assessment that the European Commission handed down in 2016.\nThe S.E.C. is set to vote on a new rule tomorrow that would require companies to disclose the climate risks from their business, a key piece of the Biden administration\u2019s green agenda.\nWhen the proposal was introduced two years ago, Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said it would help safeguard \u201ctens of trillions of dollars\u201d of investors\u2019 money. But climate experts and former S.E.C. commissioners expect the measure will have been watered-down amid intense corporate lobbying and a wider conservative pushback against agency power.\nThe rule was meant to help investors assess climate risks.The money flowing into companies that prioritize environmental, social and governance principles has boomed in recent years, a huge profit driver for Wall Street. But E.S.G. investorshave begun to pull back latelyamid concerns about greenwashing, red-state boycotts and regulatory uncertainty.\nSome fear that muted S.E.C. rules could hinder transparency.Another issue:CaliforniaandEuropehave advanced aggressive disclosure mandates, leaving large companies to potentially navigate a mishmash of regulations.\nWhat\u2019s expected to be gone?The most contentious aspectsaid to have been axedinvolves so-called Scope 3 discharges, which would apply to the bulk of a company\u2019s emissions. But measuring Scope 3 involves an expensive examination of the entire suppliers-to-customers value chain.\nScope 3 is a \u201ccentrally important metric for investors\u201d and critical to preventing greenwashing, Allison Herren Lee, the former acting chair of the S.E.C., told DealBook. (In 2021, she pushed for this requirement.)\nWhat\u2019s probably in?Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, measuring a company\u2019s direct carbon footprint, are expected to be part of the new rules, but only if they\u2019re deemed \u201cmaterial.\u201d This qualification leaves companies some wiggle room.\n\u201cIf the S.E.C. ultimately leaves climate disclosure decisions up to corporate executives, that\u2019s a policy choice with an unhappy history,\u201d said Satyam Khanna, a former S.E.C. climate adviser.\nEven watered-down rules could ignite a legal battle.Business groups have repeatedly challenged the Biden administration\u2019s environmental agenda in the courts.\nThe S.E.C. will be sued \u201cjust as surely as the sun rises in the East,\u201d said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former S.E.C. commissioner.\n\u201496Phoenix, a member of the WallStreetBets online community, on Reddit\u2019s I.P.O. plans. Reddit has been betting on enthusiasm among its users but some are expressing reservations instead.\nMore than a year after Elon Musk closed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter (now X) the challenges \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 are stacking up.\nMusk, who filed his ownblockbuster lawsuitlast week against OpenAI, has faced down a mountain of legal trouble before. But these distractions come at an especially rough moment for the billionaire. Musk is wrestling with aninvestor exodus at Tesla, his electric vehicle maker, and the banks that lent him billions to buy Twitter two years ago havereportedly met with himto discuss refinancing the terms.\nFormer Twitter executives are the latest to join in.One of Musk\u2019s first acts after he bought the company was to fireParag Agrawal, its C.E.O.; Ned Segal, the C.F.O.; Vijaya Gadde, the legal and policy chief; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel. Theysued Musk for $128 millionon Monday, accusing him of withholding severance payments and depriving them of unvested stock awards when he took the company private in October 2022.\nMusk believes he fired them \u201cfor cause.\u201dThe lawsuit quotes Musk telling the biographer Walter Isaacson that he would \u201chunt\u201d the executives \u201ctill the day they die.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Musk playbook: to keep the money he owes other people, and force them to sue him,\u201d the executives\u2019 lawyers write. \u201cEven in defeat, Musk can impose delay, hassle and expense on others less able to afford it.\u201d\nThe case puts Musk\u2019s multiple legal suits back in the spotlight.Here are a couple more:\nMusk isappealing a Delaware rulingthat voided his multibillion-dollar pay package at Tesla.

        "title": "If Nvidia Keeps Rising Like This, It Will Be Bigger Than the Global Economy",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s not a household name quite yet, but anyone who follows the stock market knows at least a little about Nvidia.\nThe company is the wonder of the year, a stock by which all others are measured. Nvidia designs the chips that make artificial intelligence work, and because A.I. is being hailed as the most important technological development since the internet, Nvidia shares have been rocketing since last year.\nI\u2019m not qualified to assess how important \u2014 or how dangerous \u2014 A.I. will one day become, but I do pay close attention to the stock market, which values Nvidia at more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest public company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\nEnthusiasm for A.I. is raising the share prices not only of Nvidia, but also of many other tech companies that are believed to be imbued with the technology\u2019s potential, including Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet as well as other chipmakers like AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel.\nBut the blistering rate of Nvidia\u2019s gains \u2014 an increase of about 290 percent over the past 12 months \u2014 has me and many Wall Street analysts wondering how sustainable this run is. The answer has implications for the entire market.\nSource: FactSet\nBy The New York Times\nThere are many ways to examine this, including traditional stock analysis, which considers sales, earnings, cash flow, business growth and momentum. I took an offbeat approach: asking several A.I. chatbots about Nvidia\u2019s prospects as a stock. Specifically, I asked how big Nvidia\u2019s market value would be in a decade if the company\u2019s share price kept its current pace.\nWhat they told me amounted to this: Nvidia stock\u2019s sharp rise can\u2019t continue like this for very long. And because much of the stock market is bound up in the same feverish A.I.-driven stock frenzy, the message is broadly true. If the market doesn\u2019t slow down soon, it may inflate itself into a bubble \u2014 and all bubbles eventually burst.\nOn a personal level, I love new tech but I try not to become too excited about it until I\u2019m confident it works safely and reliably. From what I can tell, A.I. produces spectacular images and is fun to play with, but it\u2019s neither reliable nor safe (yet).\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\nTo their credit, all three of the A.I. chatbots I asked \u2014Microsoft Copilot, powered by OpenAI\u2019sChat GPT-4;Google Gemini; andAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3\u2014 were reluctant to answer my questions directly.\nEach one said it couldn\u2019t assess stock valuations reliably or predict with the slightest degree of accuracy how a stock or the overall market would perform in the future. I wish human stock analysts said as much.\nJust because Nvidia\u2019s stock price is growing fast now doesn\u2019t mean it will keep growing fast, and certainly not over periods as long as a decade, they all warned me.\nBut I pressed them to perform some basic calculations anyway, which I backstopped with 20th-century technology \u2014 a spreadsheet and a calculator.\nThe chatbots didn\u2019t arrive at the same numbers every time and never agreed on the details. That\u2019s another sign, in my humble estimation, that they\u2019re not ready for prime time. I wouldn\u2019t use them for math homework.\nBut in this case, the details didn\u2019t really matter. Ultimately, and with considerable prompting, they all came up with the same basic conclusion: The simple laws of compound arithmetic tell us that if the company\u2019s share price keeps rising at its current rate, Nvidia will end up with a market cap in the quadrillions of dollars.\nQuadrillions are an order of magnitude I\u2019m not comfortable with, so I resorted to adictionary: One quadrillion dollars is1 with 15 zeros after it, or a thousand trilliondollars in American parlance. (In British English, a quadrillion is even bigger: 1 with 24 zeros. I\u2019m using the American definition.)\nHow big is that? The world economy \u2014 the combined size of all of the annual gross domestic products of every country on the planet \u2014 amounted to $100.88 trillion in 2022, according to theWorld Bank. So if Nvidia kept growing at its current annual rate, it would dwarf the output of the entire known economic universe within 10 years.\nClaude 3, the Anthropic A.I. chatbot, calculated that Nvidia, at its current growth rate, would become a $2.76962 quadrillion company in 10 years, and then warned me: \u201cThis is an extraordinarily large number that seems implausible in reality, as it would make Nvidia larger than the entire global economy many times over.\u201d\nIn plain English, Nvidia\u2019s astonishing growth rate over the past year is far too high to continue for long. I\u2019d be wary about buying shares of Nvidia, or any other stock, in the belief that its momentum is perpetual. What goes up can come down, and, somewhere down the line, it certainly will.\nThis warning reinforces whattraditional valuation measuresshow. Nvidia\u2019s share price, and the prices of many stocks, are high. They can be justified on the assumption that their sales and earnings will grow at a rip-roaring pace. But if share prices rise faster than earnings, the market party will eventually crash.\nNvidia is an impressive company. Its products have a great reputation and are in high demand, and it generates enormous, rapidly growing profits.\nIts latest earnings report in February, which unleashed tremendous stock market optimism, contained eye-popping numbers. And in a conversation with Wall Street analysts then, Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, gave Wall Street something exciting to mull over. The company\u2019s technology is providing the foundations for a new industrial revolution, he said.\n\u201cWe are now at the beginning of a new industry where A.I.-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cLike A.C. power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, Nvidia A.I. supercomputers are essentially A.I. generation factories of this industrial revolution.\u201d\nThe sky is the limit for the next couple of years, he suggested.\nBut Nvidia will inevitably begin to grow more slowly. It\u2019s absurd to think it can become bigger than everything else in the universe.\nBut it could still grow swiftly. Some companies have managed to sustain long-term rapid growth before.\nApple, at various stages since its founding in 1976, has perplexed skeptics who have periodically said it had become too large to keep expanding quickly. In 2012, for example, Apple\u2019s market capitalization was $500 billion and its stock price had risen 68 percent in just eight months.\nBack then,The New York Timescited an analyst who used a spreadsheet, not a chatbot, to assess Apple\u2019s prospects. The analyst concluded that if the company grew at just 20 percent a year over the following decade \u2014 much slower than its growth rate had been in 2012 \u2014 Apple would be worth an impossible number by 2022: more than $3 trillion. That number doesn\u2019t look outlandish now.\nApple\u2019s market cap isn\u2019t quite there yet, but it\u2019s close, at about $2.7 trillion. Its old rival, Microsoft, which was much smaller than Apple in 2012, now has a market cap that surpasses $3 trillion. These two giants have risen and fallen many times and show every prospect of being able to do so again.\nI don\u2019t know whether Nvidia belongs in that exalted category, but it\u2019s clear that even though Nvidia won\u2019t be bigger than the entire universe, it could end up being substantially more valuable in the next 10 or 20 years. Then again, it might not.\nIt could be more like Cisco Systems, the most valuable company in the stock market in March 2000. That was the peak of another technology boom \u2014 the dot-com bubble. Cisco is still a solid company. Its products make up the backbone of the internet. But its market capitalization in 2000 was $567 billion. Now, it\u2019s around $200 billion.\nIt will be fascinating to watch Nvidia\u2019s destiny unfurl. But because I can\u2019t predict how it or any company will fare in the long run, I don\u2019t buy individual stocks \u2014 not Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco or anything else.\nInstead, I settle for broad low-cost index funds that track the entire market. They are a passive and less risky bet on the future that requires no stock picking.\nIf Nvidia grows rapidly for years to come, I won\u2019t miss out entirely because the overall stock market will probably grow, too. If Nvidia falters, other stocks are likely, at some point, to pick up the slack. That\u2019s what has happened over the past 100 years, anyway. The A.I. boom is a thrilling ride. If it starts to slow, those who have hedged their bets will be pleased that they did."

        "title": "How Regulations Fractured Apple\u2019s App Store",
        "fulltext": "Since introducing the App Store in 2008, Apple has run it largely the same way across 175 countries, right down to the 30 percent commission it has collected on every app sold.\nThe company calls the result an economic miracle. The store has generated more than $1 trillion in sales, helped create more than seven million jobs and delivered Apple billions of dollars in annual profits.\nBut as the App Store approaches its 16th anniversary, a patchwork of local rules are upending Apple\u2019s authority over it.\nOn Thursday, European Union regulators will begin enforcing theDigital Markets Act, a 2022 law that requires Apple to open iPhones in the bloc to competing app marketplaces and alternative payment systems for in-app sales.\nThe changes follow similar demands in South Korea and the United States, where Apple has been forced to allow alternative payment processors. Similar concessions are being discussed inBritain,JapanandAustralia.\nThe rules are fracturing what was once a single store into a jumble of digital shops across national borders. The once uniform experience of shopping for software on an iPhone now differs, depending on where people live.\n\u201cThe App Store is being completely splintered,\u201d said Eric Seufert, who invests in app makers and runs Mobile Dev Memo, a blog about the app economy. \u201cThe approach to complying is pretty similar: \u2018Let\u2019s cut the fee a little bit.\u2019 But it\u2019s a pain.\u201d\nApple has worked hard to adapt to the shifting regulatory landscape. An Apple spokesman said the company had spent months talking with the European Commission about the Digital Markets Act and hosted meetings with developers as it developed plans to change the App Store while minimizing the risks of malware, fraud and scams on iPhones.\nOn Monday, Apple was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) by European Union regulators for thwarting competition among music streaming rivals. The penalty was the result of a five-year investigation set in motion by the music service, Spotify. Apple said it would appeal the ruling.\nApple says its control over the App Store is critical to the safety and quality of the apps it distributes. The company has stopped short of abandoning the 30 percent commission. But over time, it has made some concessions to developers and regulators by reducing the commissions that smaller app makers pay and allowing developers to link out to their websites to charge users directly for subscriptions.\nThe changes are expected to pinch Apple\u2019s sales and cut into profits. Last year, the App Store generated an estimated $24.12 billion in revenue, according to Bernstein Research.\nWhen the App Store first appeared, Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said the fee was a \u201cgreat deal\u201d because it allowed every developer \u2014 big or small \u2014 to deliver software to every single iPhone. But for years, Apple\u2019s fees have been a point of frustration for developers. Over time, regulators began to listen to those complaints.\nIn 2019,Spotify filed a complaintagainst Apple in Europe, accusing it of anticompetitive practices because it prevented streaming music services from advertising where and how users could subscribe to their app. A year later, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite,filed a lawsuitin U.S. federal court accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment system.\nThe complaints galvanized developers around the world to begin lobbying for changes to the app economy. In 2021,South Korean lawmakerswere among the first to respond by passing legislation to force app store operators to allow alternative payment systems. Apple relaxed its requirement that developers use its in-app payment service, but said developers who used alternative services would owe Apple a26 percent commissionon sales.\nDevelopers have argued that the new commission rate is the same as the 30 percent rate after credit card processing fees are added. Their criticisms have resonated with regulators in South Korea, who said Apple\u2019s plan undermined the law\u2019s goal. The country\u2019s telecommunications regulator said itmight fine Apple $15.4 millionfor \u201cunfair practices.\u201d\nApple said it disagreed with the conclusion of regulators in South Korea and believed that its changes complied with the law.\nThe company took a similar approach in the United States. During the Epic Games lawsuit, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said that being forced to offer alternative payment systems \u201cwould be a mess.\u201d\n\u201cWe would have to come up with another system to invoice developers,\u201d he said, adding that Apple would still charge a commission.\nThe federal judge in the caseruled in 2021that Apple needed to allow alternative payments in the United States. Apple has complied much as it did in South Korea, except it said developers that used alternatives oweda 27 percent commission.\n\u201cClearly, it\u2019s window dressing,\u201d said Colin Kass, an antitrust lawyer with Proskauer Rose who has no connection to the case. \u201cDoes it satisfy the court? Maybe.\u201d\nApple said that the judge had upheld its right to charge a commission, and that its solution fulfilled the judge\u2019s request to allow out-of-app purchases. Epic said it planned to file a motion challenging the 27 percent fee and asking the court to intervene.\nIn 2022, the European Union passed the Digital Markets Act to introduce competition to the App Store on iPhones, among other changes. Apple had two years to comply.\nThe company\u2019s engineers have spent thousands of hours creating more than 600 new software tools for developers. In January, the company introduced those tools andoutlined three options for app makersin the European Union, home to roughly 450 million people.\nUnder Apple\u2019s plan, developers could stick with the status quo App Store system and pay up to a 30 percent commission on sales. They could reduce their commission to 17 percent while adding a new 50-euro-cent charge on every download above one million annually. Or they could avoid Apple\u2019s commission by selling through a competing app store while still paying the download fee.\nApple said the plan complied with the law and meant that 99 percent of developers in the European Union would reduce or maintain the fees they owed.\nButapp makers said the planviolated the letter and spirit of the law. Under the new rules, a tech giant like Apple is supposed to allow app makers to sell subscriptions and services outside their apps \u201cfree of charge,\u201d said Damien Geradin, a European antitrust lawyer who is advising app developers. He said Apple\u2019s 50-euro-cent fee and 17 percent commission broke that part of the law.\nEuropean regulators won\u2019t weigh in on Apple\u2019s proposal until after the effective date on Thursday. Should they open a formal investigation, it could set up a lengthy legal battle that could force Apple to change or risk fines up to 10 percent of its global annual revenue, which was nearly $400 billion last year.\nMr. Geradin said Apple was unlikely to succeed but, in the interim, could continue collecting commissions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of their tactics,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Problems Around the Globe Are Piling Up",
        "fulltext": "For more than a decade, Apple could do almost no wrong. The iPhone made it the world\u2019s most valuable company. The App Store helped launch businesses such as Uber and Airbnb. And the company\u2019s new products made it a player in health, Hollywood and finance.\nNow, the difficulties are piling up. The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday for giving its own products advantages that it deprived rivals of having. The suit is the latest in a series of actions brought against the company by regulators on four continents.\nThe troubles are testing the resiliency of Apple\u2019s brand and undermining its business dominance, even though Apple\u2019s products remain popular and continue to power an extremely profitable business. The company reported $97 billion in profit last year on $386 billion in sales.\nHere\u2019s a look at the challenges ahead.\nThe Justice Departmentfiled a sweeping antitrust lawsuitagainst Apple on Thursday that takes direct aim at the company\u2019s most important business: the iPhone. The government argued in an 88-page lawsuit that Apple broke antitrust laws by preventing other companies from offering applications that compete with Apple products, like its digital wallet.\nThe suit follows a yearslong investigation into Apple that focused on the ways that the company has controlled the user experience on iPhones and other devices to create what critics call an uneven playing field. It has granted its own products and services access to core features like its NFC chip and notification system that it denies rivals like PayPal and Garmin smartwatches.\nIt could be months before the case goes to trial.\nOn March 4, the European Commissionfined Apple 1.8 billion euros($1.95 billion) for thwarting competition by preventing music streaming rivals from offering users promotions and subscription upgrades. Because Apple is the sole gatekeeper controlling developers\u2019 access to iPhone customers, European regulators said that it wrote the rules for the App Store in ways that allowed Apple Music to offer benefits that it denied rivals like Spotify.\n\u201cFrom now on, Apple will have to allow music streaming developers to communicate freely with their own users,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees competition policy. The size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects both Apple\u2019s financial power and the harm that Apple\u2019s conduct inflicted on millions of European users.\u201d\nSince the fine was issued, Apple has delayed a request by Spotify to inform users of offers on its website, Spotify said. The European Commission has said that Apple could face additional fines if it fails to comply with orders.\nApple isfacing fines from regulatorsin the Netherlands and South Korea, as well.\nIn 2021, Dutch regulators ruled that Apple violated competition laws in the dating app market by preventing services such as Tinder from using payment systems other than the one Apple provides. Rather than allow other payment systems to collect that money, Apple reduced its commission to 27 percent on the price paid per user, from its usual rate of 30 percent. But Dutch regulators said that move didn\u2019t comply with the law and last year fined Apple \u20ac50 million ($53 million).\nA similar situation is playing out in South Korea, where lawmakers were among the first in the world to respond to developer complaints about App Store commissions by passing legislation to force Apple to allow alternative payment systems. Apple relaxed its requirement to26 percent. The country\u2019s telecommunications regulator said itmight fine Apple $15.4 millionfor \u201cunfair practices.\u201d\nApple said that it disagreed with the findings of Dutch and South Korean regulators. It is appealing the Dutch fine and awaiting the results of a South Korean investigation.\nSeveral other countries are exploring legislation or regulation that could force Apple to loosen its grip, including Japan, Australia and Britain. The regulatory changes they are discussing could require Apple to offer alternative payment options and reduce its commissions. Having watched how Apple has complied with similar laws elsewhere, the lawmakers could choose to be more prescriptive in their rule making.\nThe rules would be the latest to fracture what was once a single App Store into a jumble of digital shops across national borders.\nLast fall, China begantelling employees of government agencies not to use iPhonesfor work. Theauthorities made no public pronouncementsbeyond pointing out that there were \u201cmedia reports\u201d about security flaws in iPhones. But the directive has rippled through the country\u2019s smartphone market.\nSales of iPhones in China fell 24 percent in the first six weeks of the year,according to Counterpoint Research, which tracks the smartphone industry. At the same time sales of Huawei, once China\u2019s largest smartphone maker, surged 64 percent behind the introduction of a new phone with 5G wireless capabilities.\nApple largely triumphed over Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, after the video game company sued Apple in 2020 over the App Store. But a federal judge struck a serious blow against Apple\u2019s control of the App Store, ruling that it violated California\u2019s competition laws by preventing app makers from providing alternative ways to pay for services.\nAfter the Supreme Court decided not to take up the case, Apple said that it would comply with the ruling just as it has complied in the Netherlands: by cutting its commission to 27 percent for developers who use alternative payment options.\nLast week, Epic filed a motion in court challenging Apple\u2019s compliance, saying that the new fees and rules subvert the judge\u2019s order. Meta and Microsoft have filed a brief in support of Epic, setting the table for the court to have to rule again on whether Apple is violating California law.\nBefore European regulators began enforcing a new competition law to give customers more choice this month,app makers were complainingthat Apple\u2019s response to the law defied the rules. The company was supposed to open the iPhone to alternative app stores and payment systems, but it added those capabilities alongsidenew commissions and requirements.\nOn Monday, developers met with Apple in Europe and questioned how the fees complied with the law, which has several \u201cfree of charge\u201d provisions. Apple has insisted that its policies are consistent with the new rules.\nEuropean regulators could open a formal investigation into Apple\u2019s plans. The process could set up a lengthy legal battle that could force Apple to change or risk fines up to 10 percent of its global annual revenue, which was nearly $400 billion last year.\nApple\u2019s investors are clamoring for it to jump into the world of generative artificial intelligence. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, has been heralded for its potential to create trillions of dollars in economic value.\nBut at a time when peers such as Microsoft and Google are beginning to build generative A.I. businesses, Apple has yet to introduce a product. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has assured investors that something is coming later this year. The company has heldtalks with Google about adding its A.I. model called Geminito iPhones.\nInvestors have sent shares of Apple down more than 3.75 percent this year. At the same time, the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is chock-full of tech stocks, has risen nearly 11 percent."

        "title": "Big American Tech Profits From Chinese Ad Spending Spree",
        "fulltext": "The trade relationship between China and the United States has plenty of friction. But at least one area is booming: Chinese start-ups looking to establish a presence in the West are spending billions of dollars for advertisements on services owned by some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology companies.\nTemu, the international arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is flooding Google with ads for absurdly inexpensive goods. With aninitial public offering looming, the fast-fashion merchant Shein is inundating Instagram with ads for clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices. Developers of China\u2019s video streaming and gaming apps are dumping marketing dollars into Facebook, X and YouTube to entice potential users.\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said on a call with analysts that Chinese-based advertisers accounted for 10 percent of its revenue, almost double over two years ago. In the last year, Temu has placed about 1.4 million ads globally across Google services, and at least 26,000 different versions of ads on Meta, according to Meta\u2019s Ad Library.\n\u201cWhat companies like Temu have done is really just open a fire hose of money that it is pouring into ads,\u201d said Sky Canaves, senior analyst for retail at eMarketer. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape their ads across Facebook, Instagram and Google Search.\u201d\nThe surge in spending shows how interconnected China and the United States remain, despite vigorous efforts by each country to be more self-reliant. The Chinese companies are gaining access to vast audiences of consumers, and the Silicon Valley companies are making money off a market they are otherwise not doing business in.\nThe marketing blitz is fueled by the global ambitions of Chinese start-ups. At home, the economy isno longer growing by leaps and boundsas it had for years, and companies are subject to a thicket of government rules that have quashed their growth.\nThecrackdown on firmslike the e-commerce giant Alibaba and the once high-flying ride share provider Didi underscored the message that a company, no matter how successful, can be brought to its knees if it runs afoul of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limit on the degree that a company can grow in China,\u201d said Andrew Collier, founder of Orient Capital, an economic research firm in Hong Kong. \u201cXi Jinping is perfectly happy for Chinese companies to make money overseas as long as they toe the line within China.\u201d\nBut going global comes at a cost. It\u2019s hard to garner significant amounts of digital attention without paying Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Meta. Together, the two companies sell a majority of all internet advertising largely through their online properties like Google Search, YouTube, the Google Play App Store, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\nFor the most part, Alphabet\u2019s and Meta\u2019s products are not available in China. Efforts to offer their services in China meant abiding by Chinese government censors, which caused employee protests at both companies.\nAlphabet and Meta have such significant reach in the rest of the world that Chinese firms are now going to them.\nThe rush of spending by Temu and Shein has \u201csingle-handedly\u201d driven up the cost of digital advertising, Josh Silverman, chief executive of Etsy, said on a call with analysts in November.\nDiscount Chinese e-commerce companies have grabbed increasing attention in the United States over the past few years, tempting buyers with low-cost goods when inflation was driving up prices.\nTemu opened its U.S. site in September 2022. It sold things like a garlic press for $2 or a cotton swab dispenser for $1.50. Temu is now available in 50 countries.\nWith the slogan \u201cShop Like a Billionaire,\u201d Temu has been a voracious buyer of all forms of advertising, from low-cost Facebook ads to pricey spots during the Super Bowl. Temu has the deep pockets of PDD Holdings, which operates Pinduoduo.\nBernstein Research estimates that Temu spent $3 billion on marketing last year. Ina lawsuit filed against Sheinin December, Temu said it served about 30 million daily users in the United States. Temu\u2019s app is the most downloaded on both Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm.\nShein, which entered the U.S. market about seven years ago, is also continuing to spend aggressively on marketing. It does not sell products in China, although it was founded in Nanjing and relies heavily on Chinese sellers and the country\u2019s supply chain.\nIt has run about 80,000 ads across Google in the past year alone, including product advertisements that appear next to search results. On Meta, Shein has more than 7,000 advertisements active, according to Meta\u2019s Ad Library.\nFor Temu and Shein, spending heavily on Facebook will not guarantee success. Nearly a decade ago, Wish, another buzzy e-commerce appfocused on low-cost goodssourced from China, spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Facebook ads. But the retail app failed to sustain the interest of shoppers. Last month, Wish was sold to Singapore\u2019s Qoo10, another e-commerce platform, for $173 million, one-hundredth of its public offering valuation in 2020.\nShein and Temu allow third-party sellers to upload product images directly to Meta\u2019s advertising systems, and feature those products inside their ads on Instagram and Facebook. Those ads, which are targeted to users\u2019 interests based on Meta\u2019s vast troves of data, are generally more effective at luring shoppers.\nThe ad spending is not limited to retailers. In recent months, Instagram has become inundated with previews of short addictive dramas \u2014 soap operas for users with limited attention spans. Each episode is usually a minute long, with the series running about 80 to 100 episodes.\nThe shows tend to be overly dramatic, with grabby titles like \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband\u201d or \u201c30 Days Till I Marry My Husband\u2019s Nemesis.\u201d\nThese short dramas are popular in China, and a handful of companies \u2014 apps like Reelshort, DramaBox and FlexTV \u2014 are competing to export this form of entertainment. Instead of selling monthly subscriptions like, say, Netflix, the short-content apps use a model similar to online games, requiring users to purchase what are known as coins that can be used to pay for episodes. A viewer can also earn coins by watching commercials.\nSimilar to games, these apps require a steady stream of users to get hooked on samples of the programs and feel compelled to keep spending to see how the show ends. On Meta, DramaBox is running more than 1,000 active ads, according to Meta\u2019s Ad Library, while Reelshort and Flex TV are running hundreds of ads.\nAnother major Chinese advertiser on Meta is a Hong Kong-based game developer called First.Fun. The developer seems to be blanketing Facebook, Instagram and even X with ads to promote its flagship game, Last War: Survival, with hundreds of paid previews.\nThe previews have enticed players to download the app. It is the fifth-most-downloaded app on Google Play and 12th on Apple\u2019s App Store.\nSensor Tower estimated that the game generated $22 million in revenue last month.\nMarketing on platforms like Meta has given the game developers a lifeline to customers outside the country as the Chinese government has made it harder to do business. The most recent example was in December when Chinese regulators announced plans to limit how much money people could spend on online video games. The agency drafting the plansbacked offits initial proposals in the face of protests, but Beijing has been adopting an increasingly tougher stance against the game industry.\nThe message has not been lost on game developers. On its website, Beijing Yuanqu Entertainment, First.Fun\u2019s parent company, said it was focused purely on overseas markets, because it \u201cfirmly believes that China\u2019s internet industry will continue to internationalize.\u201d\nClaire Fucontributed reporting."
