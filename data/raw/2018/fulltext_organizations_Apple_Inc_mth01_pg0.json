        "title": "Tech Backlash Catches Up to Apple",
        "fulltext": "The tech backlash has caught up to Apple. The activist hedge fund Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Systemwant Apple to give parents better controls over their children\u2019s iPhones. It\u2019s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets.\nTogether, the hedge fund and teachers\u2019 pension giant want Apple to take responsibility for how its products are affecting children.In a letter to the board on Saturday, the activists \u2014 which include the pop star Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, as advisers \u2014 cited research that suggests heavy smartphone use is linked to a rise of depression and suicide among teenagers and young adults.\nThe popularity of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago, has spread to an ever-younger demographic, leaving educators and researchers scrambling to understand how it may be affecting children\u2019s development. Yet other technology outfits are culprits, too, and provide rich targets. More people have smartphones that run on Google\u2019s Android system, rather than on Apple\u2019s operating system. Facebook\u2019s and Snapchat\u2019s business models depend on increasing the time spent on mobile phones and target children under the age of 13 with specialized apps.\nIt\u2019s a worthy theme to explore but a departure for Jana. The hedge fund, led by Barry Rosenstein, is best known for getting tangible results measured in dollars by agitating for things like a sale of Whole Foods or a shake-up of the board of Tiffany. In this case, it\u2019s smartly teaming up with Calstrs, the largest public-sector teachers\u2019 pension fund in the United States and one that\u2019s increasingly emphasizing social responsibility with its investments. Together, the two hold roughly $2 billion worth of Apple stock.\nThe fact that Jana is starting a campaign in the more squishy territory of sustainability and ethics could signal a broader shift in the winds. Investors are increasingly pushing companies to address a wider range of issues and risks. Exxon Mobil and climate change are one example. Gender equality and the ability to attract more diverse talent are also issues that are rising to the level of proxies.\nSilicon Valley used to enjoy an exalted status, but questions about the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election and the way digital technologies may threaten jobs and promote monopolies are breeding skepticism. The new focus on Apple shows how much technology has lost its halo."

        "title": "Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple, which had long deferred paying taxes on its foreign earnings and had become synonymous with hoarding money overseas,unveiled plans on Wednesdaythat would bring back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and said it would make a sizable investment in the United States.\nWith the moves, Apple took advantage of the new tax code that President Trumpsignedinto law last month. A provision allows for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple, which has 94 percent of its total cash of $269 billion outside the United States, said it would make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on the repatriated cash.\nFor years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple\u2019s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.\nIn return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.\n\u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201dMr. Trump tweetedon Wednesday. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.\u201d\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement, \u201cWe have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.\u201d\nApple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple\u2019s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.\nA. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.\n\u201cThis is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.\nApple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.\nBy shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.\nOther tech giants are set to follow suit in the coming months. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet and Cisco also shifted their profits intooffshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes, and are now in a better position to bring the money back.\nAlthough Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.\nApple\u2019s announcement, couched as a major investment in the United States instead of a massive financial windfall, followed years of criticism that the company did not do enough for the American economy because it makes most of its products in China andparked its profitsabroad.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn\u2019t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.\nThe company has highlighted the number of jobs created by the so-called app economy, an ecosystem of software and services that run on the iPhone and other Apple products. Last year, Apple also said it wascreating a $1 billion fundto invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. On Wednesday, Apple said it was increasing the size of that fund to $5 billion and noted that it was already backing projects from manufacturers in Kentucky and Texas.\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also took a page out of Amazon\u2019s public relations strategy on Wednesday by saying it will open a new domestic campus in a location where it currently has no operations. Amazon garnered good will throughout the country last year when it announced plansto open a second corporate headquartersoutside its home base of Seattle.\nApple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.\nFor a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.\nFor Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nPaying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple\u2019s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.\n\u201cFrom a financial statement perspective, it\u2019s going to be a nonevent,\u201d saidJ. Richard Harvey, a Villanova University law professor and former Internal Revenue Service official. Other companies are not as prepared, he said, and would likely have to take a significant loss should they make a one-time cash repatriation.\nApple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed."

        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviewsthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nGood morning! Let\u2019s talk tech.\nPeople on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.\nThe companyreported this weekthat it had added 8.3 million subscribers in the last quarter, about two million more than analysts were expecting. But it\u2019s still spending tons of money on content \u2014 about $8 billion this year, and perhaps more in future years. Many in the industry continue to wonder whether the company\u2019s business will ever work.\nThe problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?\nWell, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.\nI suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.\nRemember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.\nThen, nothing.\nA new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.\nIt was a crucial miss \u2014 the Echo seems to have had a gangbusters holiday, with Amazon expanding its head start in the category by probably tens of millions of devices. In a widely passed-around post,the venture capitalist M. G. Siegler wonderedwhether Amazon was so far ahead that HomePod was essentially dead on arrival.\nWell, we\u2019ll see. Apple announced this week that HomePod was back in action \u2014available to order on Friday, and in stores starting Feb. 9.\nIt\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.\nMy colleagues Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi hadan interesting articlethis week about the growing tensions between the tech industry and the Democratic Party. Democrats and techies have long been reliable allies \u2014 techies donate tons of money, and Democratic candidates get to show off their association with widely admired visionaries of the future.\nThat\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.\nThere\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.\nIt\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.\nFarhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column calledState of the Art.

        "title": "Managing an iPad\u2019s Battery Use",
        "fulltext": "Q.Is Apple also slowing down older iPads? If so, will it replace batteries at a reduced rate?\nA.In response to accusations that it intentionallyhindered older products, Apple\u2019s publicexplanation and apologysays that only certain iPhone models were affected by the software updates designed to prevent the battery from conking out unexpectedly. In fact, Apple\u2019s mea culpa states, \u201cThis power management feature is specific to iPhone and does not apply to any other Apple products.\u201d\nThe \u201cpower management\u201d tool was first introduced in early 2017 with iOS 10.2.1 for iPhones. Longer times for apps to start up, lowered audio volume and screen brightness, a disabled camera flash and jerkier frame rates are signs of the performance reduction in action. Apple said only the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE models were included at first, but it added the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with the iOS 11.2 update in December.\nTo make amends, Apple is replacing batteries in older iPhones for $29 (instead of the usual $79) until the end of the year; new batteries typically let the phone avoid the power-management throttle kicking in. However,Apple\u2019s pricefor an out-of-warranty iPad battery replacement is still $99; third-party repair services can cost less but it\u2019s worth researching the provider\u2019s reputation first.\nOlder iPads might be running slower because the latest software is more demanding and is optimized for the processors in newer models. You may be able to boost the performance of older hardware withthe standard tricks, like optimizing your settings \u2014 including lowering screen brightness, turning off push alerts and disabling location services when not in use. Dumping unused apps and avoiding extreme hot and cold external temperatures when using the iPad can help, too."

        "fulltext": "Apple has taken another step toward becoming a power in the entertainment business by scooping up the rights for a TV project from Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning writer and director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the unlikely critical and box office hit from 2016.\nThe tech giant announced the new series on Thursday. It marks the latest television entry from Mr. Chazelle, whosigned a deal with Netflixin September to make \u201cThe Eddy,\u201d an eight-episode musical series set in Paris.\nApple said that Mr. Chazelle would direct and write each episode of the new series\u2019 first season.

Rarer still is an announcement of a coming series without a public disclosure of what was purchased.\nFor the mysterious new assignment, Mr. Chazelle will reunite with the producers Jordan Horowitz and Fred Berger, both of whom worked on \u201cLa La Land.\u201d MRC, which produced \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d is the studio behind the show.

After realizing the error,Mr. Horowitz revealedthat \u201cMoonlight\u201d was the true winner and called the rival film\u2019s team to the stage.\nThe untitled Chazelle project is the eighth one to be made public by Apple. The Cupertino, Calif., company entered the streaming wars last year when it announced that it would spendmore than $1 billionon a slate of original programming.\nApple is making three other shows with Reese Witherspoon as a producer \u2014 onestarring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, one with Octavia Spencer and a third with Kristen Wiig.

He plans to use that to cover the bureau\u2019s projected quarterly expenses of $145 million.\nWhile the move is largely symbolic, it follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney that spotlight the Trump administration\u2019s desire to shift the consumer bureau\u2019s trajectory.\nIgnore all the one-time charges related to the new tax law that banks announced this week, the industry, long-term, should be among the biggest winners.\nBut how much of the windfall will end in the pockets of employees and customers?\nSince the tax overhaul became law last month, bankshave rushed to shower employees with bonuses and raises.\nYet despite this largess, \u201cthe industry stands to retain more than 75 percents of the savings\u201d from the tax law, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

His conversations with investors have shifted recently from discussions about how to protect their nest eggs to worrying about missing out on big returns.\nPimco is in the same boat:\n\u201cThe fact that the fear is gone is the main reason why we should be worried,\u201d Joachim Fels, a global economic adviser at Pimco, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday from Newport Beach, California. \u201cThat means most investors are now pretty fully invested and that means they will want to get out if the markets start to correct \u2014 exacerbating the downdraft.\u201d\nThis post onwhat may be next for Alwaleed bin Talalby Jeffrey Towson, a professor at Peking University and a former employee of the prince\u2019s Kingdom Holding, has started to circulate around the financial world. (A reminder: Mr. bin Talal has been caught up in Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s anti-corruption purge.)\nAmong Mr. Towson\u2019s forecasts:\n\u2022 Mr. bin Talal would be prepared to stay imprisoned for a long time.\n\u2022 He would not sign any plea deal that implies serious wrongdoing, like corruption.\nHarder to predict:What will happen to Kingdom Holding, which owns stakes in Citigroup, Lyft and Twitter.\n\u2022 Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital told Silicon Valley start-ups to be more like Chinese companies, where longer work hours and a disregard for physical fitness is the norm and where discussions about \u201clife\u2019s inequities\u201d are seen as distractions. (FT)\n\u2022 Facebook said it would reopen and broaden an investigation into whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 Brexit vote.

(WSJ)\nEarlier this week, the virtual currency dropped below $10,000. Now, it\u2019s above $11,000.\nIt\u2019s been a wild/scary ridein particular for newcomers who were late to the Bitcoin game. This is from a Reddit user who persuaded family members to buy cryptocurrency late last year:\nI opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it\u2019s just a correction and don\u2019t sell but they aren\u2019t listening.\nThe context:Bitcoin\u2019s run has dwarfedthe Nasdaq run of the dot-com boom and, potentially, Dutch tulip-mania, according to Bloomberg.\nMore in virtual currency news:Ledger, a specialist in blockchain security technology,has raised $75 millionin a fund-raising round led by Draper Esprit.\nWilliam Bain Jr., the management consulting mogul who helped turn Mitt Romney into a private equity power, died on Tuesday. He was 80.\nThe native Tennessean went from Vanderbilt\u2019s alumni office to Boston Consulting Group to foundingBain & Company. Several years later, he capitalized on his firm\u2019s relationships and expertise to found Bain Capital, where he installed Mr. Romney as C.E.O.\nHere\u2019sMr. Romney on Mr. Bain, via the Boston Globe:\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine my life and career without Bill Bain\u2019s mentoring,\u201d Romney said in a statement. \u201cHe hired me, taught me, and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime.

        "title": "Stampede of Tech Giants Gives Rebalancing New Appeal",
        "fulltext": "Index-based investing is appealing partly because it promises to simplify decision-making. Buy a fund that tracks a major index like theStandard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock indexand you can sit back knowing you don\u2019t have to switch in and out of sectors and stocks.\nYou own a balanced portfolio that should perform well in all sorts of market conditions.\nBut do you really?\nIf you think you\u2019re protected from market swings by holding index-based investments, think again.\nThe central story of 2017\u2019s thundering bull market was the relentless advance of shares of fast-growing companies, particularly in the technology industry. The so-called Faang stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) rose so far so fast that index-based investments that were once balanced now seem top-heavy with risky highfliers. Faang stocks made up just 6 percent of the S.&.P. 500 in 2013. By the end of last year, they accounted for 12.3 percent, noted Joe Abbott, chief quantitative strategist withYardeni Research.\nOver all, large growth stocks soared 25.4 percent in 2017. Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.\nSo is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?\nFor investors with long horizons, \u201crebalancing is an excellent strategy,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer forResearch Affiliates. \u201cWealth is built long term with periodic rebalancing,\u201d he added.\nOne way to offset the heavy weighting of tech stocks in exchange-traded funds and index funds that reflect market advances is through an index like theGuggenheim Equal Weight S.&.P. 500 E.T.F., Mr. Brightman said. Equal weight indexes own the same amount of all stocks and so are not overexposed to market highfliers. Over the last decade, theS.&.P. 500 Equal Weight indexhas returned just over 10 percent annually, while the market-cap-weighted S.&.P. 500. has returned less than 9 percent annually.\nTom Galvin is lead manager of theColumbia Select Large Cap Growthfund. Though his mandate requires holding growth companies, he has been lightening up on some highfliers. \u201cWe have been trimming back some of the winners,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. The fund has sold off roughly 20 percent of its Amazon stock and roughly one-third of its position in Facebook, he said.\nStill, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.\nSimilarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.\nGrowth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.\nSebastien Page, head of the Global Multi-Asset division withinT. Rowe Price, also sees merit in increasing value holdings. \u201cAs a general statement, value should benefit more than growth from the tax cut,\u201d he said. Financial companies, typically considered value stocks, pay relatively high taxes and will benefit from a tax cut.\nBut because the market has risen almost nonstop since 2009, value stocks are also fairly expensive, some argue. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to buy your beaten down, distressed deep value stocks,\u201d said Mike Fleisher, lead portfolio manager of theLegg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Valuefund. \u201cYou want to buy a value stock with a catalyst.\u201d\nMr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.\nFor investors disinclined to pick through hundreds of stocks to find the right value catalyst, there is another way to rebalance. Mr. Page of T. Rowe Price favors stocks in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. \u201cNon-U.S. stocks have only been this cheap relative to U.S. stocks 7 percent of the time in the last 15 years,\u201d he explained. Two E.T.F.s that invest in such developed market stocks are theiShares MSCI EAFE E.T.F.and theVanguard FTSE Developed Markets E.T.F.\nMr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201d\nSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.\nThe market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.\nMr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\n\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple Can\u2019t Resist Playing by China\u2019s Rules",
        "fulltext": "Apple is selling out. It\u2019s not about the latest version of the iPhone, but the huge cache of personal data that will be going directly to the largest, and one of the harshest, authoritarian regimes in the world: the Communist government of China.\nGiven the Chinese government\u2019s continuing crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech under President Xi Jinping, as well as its deepening reach into Western democracies, Apple\u2019s policies in China have far-reaching implications for us all.\nLast summer, Apple announced thatit would be partneringwith Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, a state-owned company with Communist Party connections, to build Apple\u2019s first data-storage center in China. Beginning Feb. 28, the iCloud content of Apple ID users registered in China will be sent to and managed by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data.\nCustomers registered in China, according to Apple\u2019s new terms and conditions agreement for the country, must \u201cunderstand and agree that Apple and G.C.B.D. will have access to all data that you store on this service, including the right to share, exchange and disclose all user data, including content, to and between each other under applicable law.\u201d\nIn short, all personal user information stored on the iCloud \u2014 including photos, videos, text files, contacts, calendars and iCloud email \u2014 will be shared with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data and could be available to the Chinese authorities as well. Apple has said that G.C.B.D. will not have access to the personal data stored in its facility without Apple\u2019s permission, but the new terms and conditions agreement appears to say the opposite.\nUnder the agreement, Apple seems to be absolving itself of responsibility for what the authorities may choose to do with personal data in G.C.B.D.\u2019s hands. Users who refuse Apple\u2019s terms will be denied iCloud services. Users who accept run the risk of unwittingly provoking the ire of the aggressive police state, resulting in deleted data or accounts, or harassment and imprisonment.\nThis kind of partnership between an American company and a dictatorial regime is at odds with the image Apple has built as a company committed to privacy and a willingness to stand up to pressure from larger entities like the United States government. In a 2015 interview with NPR, the Apple chief executive Tim Cook emphasized that privacy \u201cis a fundamental human right that people have,\u201d from a \u201cvalues point of view,\u201d not \u201ca commercial interest point of view.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it now seems that such \u201cvalues\u201d are taking a back seat to profits.\nIn 2017, Apple also announced it was halting the sale of virtual private networks, apps that allow users inside China to get access to blocked content that is critical for activists and regular citizens. IPhones in China also no longer include some Western news outlets like The New York Times on the News app.\nIn response to criticism about these steps, Apple has blithely responded that it is obeying China\u2019s laws. Is this how American companies should respond to dictatorial demands and arbitrary, unjust legal codes?\nThe Chinese regime makes no apologies about its human rights violations and seems not to care whom it crushes in its quest for power and control, whether it is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died last year in Chinese custody, or the many human-rights lawyers and activists who have been detained and tortured in recent years.\nWhen dealing with the Chinese regime, American companies should likewise not apologize for their commitment to the fundamental values \u2014 human rights, democracy, freedom of information, the rule of law \u2014 that have allowed them to flourish. American companies should not follow practices in authoritarian countries that are illegal in the United States.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that Apple is caving in to the regime like this. The only conclusion I am left to draw is that the company is O.K. with taking part in the suppression of freedoms abroad while espousing high-minded values at home.\nTo be fair, many American tech companies have been tripping over themselves to get into China. Facebook has reportedly beendeveloping censorship softwareso that it can win approval to operate in China, while the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long been courting the Chinese leadership. For such companies, the Chinese market is simply too big of a temptation when weighed against less quantitatively measurable things like human rights and freedom of expression.\nThose companies, institutions and organizations that play an outsize role in society should not shirk their responsibility to uphold social justice. The Chinese people have been fighting for human rights for decades, including the rights to privacy, freedom of speech and democracy. Many have lost their lives doing so. Instead of aiding dictatorships and following a misguided path to the future, Apple should return to its core values and protect the rights of its users at home and abroad."

        "title": "TV Content Wars: Too Many Characters Chasing Not Enough Action",
        "fulltext": "The golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.\nNetflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.\nTotal spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC.\nThat means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle \u2014 and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.\nNetflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2014 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.\nHulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action."

        "title": "Your iPhone Slowed Down. Here\u2019s What to Do When the Solution Is Just as Slow.",
        "fulltext": "When Kathryn Schipper discovered in December that her iPhone had slowed down because it needed a new battery, she unknowingly walked into the middle of a growing Apple controversy \u2014 and is now mired in the continuing fallout.\nLate last year, Apple saida software feature was slowing down iPhonesthat had aged batteries, immediately drawing accusations that the company was trying to force people to upgrade to its newest iPhones. In response, Apple said customers could get their iPhone batteries replaced at its stores for a discounted price of $29, down from $79.\nYet when Ms. Schipper, who lives in Seattle, took her iPhone 6 Plus, purchased in 2014, to an Apple store in early January, she was told that the store was out of replacement batteries for at least two weeks. An Apple representative later left her a voice mail message with a new estimated wait time: up to four months.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m waiting outside of a club and the bouncer won\u2019t let me in because I\u2019m not fashionably enough dressed,\u201d Ms. Schipper said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m at the back of the line because I don\u2019t have a fancy phone.\u201d\nFor iPhone owners, Ms. Schipper\u2019s experience does not have to be the way forward. Even as Apple appears to be struggling to keep up with customers asking for new batteries, there are other ways to make sure your smartphone is still running. The workarounds include finding a reputable third-party repair shop, using a battery pack or replacing the battery on your own.\nApple may be dealing with the fallout for a while. The company published a lengthymemoin December saying that smartphone batteries became less effective over time and that its software was intended toprevent iPhones with older batteries from unexpected shutdowns. Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.\nYet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential.Bloomberg earlier reportedthe inquiry.\nEarly Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.\nAs for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019ssupport webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.\nLet\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.\nPlenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.\nThird-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.\nAnother issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.\nThere\u2019s a less risky route here. On Apple\u2019ssupport webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.\nIf you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.\nFor another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d\nFinding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:\n\u25a0 In Chicago:uBreakiFix Chicago\n\u25a0 In San Francisco:MacRepair\n\u25a0 In New York:Simple Mac\n\u25a0 In Boston:Mega Mobile Boston\n\u25a0 In Washington:Computer Geeks\n\u25a0 In Austin, Tex.:Austin Mac Repair\nYou can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.\nA good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs isiFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts onbattery replacement kitsfor older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.\nInstalling a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.\nIf you don\u2019t feel confident hiring a third-party fixer or installing your own battery, you can always wait for Apple to replace your battery. But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.\nA better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, hastested hundreds of battery packsto recommend a few. My favorite is theAnker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.\nMs. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack. In the meantime, she is constantly plugging her iPhone into a power outlet because her battery lasts only two hours a day.\nYet she has resisted what she thinks Apple wants: for her to buy a new phone.\n\u201cI was tempted to just chuck this phone and suck it up and spend $1,000-plus and get the iPhone X,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, darn it, I have a budget I\u2019m saving up.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to let Apple push me around.\u201d"
