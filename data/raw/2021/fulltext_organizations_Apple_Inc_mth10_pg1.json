        "title": "Cybersecurity Experts Sound Alarm on Apple and E.U. Phone Scanning Plans",
        "fulltext": "More than a dozen prominent cybersecurity experts on Thursday criticized plans by Apple and the European Union to monitor people\u2019s phones for illicit material, calling the efforts ineffective and dangerous strategies that would embolden government surveillance.\nIn a46-page study, the researchers wrote that the proposal by Apple, aimed at detecting images of child sexual abuse on iPhones, as well as an idea forwarded by members of the European Union to detect similar abuse and terrorist imagery on encrypted devices in Europe, used \u201cdangerous technology.\u201d\n\u201cIt should be a national-security priority to resist attempts to spy on and influence law-abiding citizens,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nThe technology, known as client-side scanning, would allow Apple \u2014 or, in Europe, potentially law enforcement officials \u2014 to detect images of child sexual abuse in someone\u2019s phone by scanning images uploaded to Apple\u2019s iCloud storage service.\nWhen Appleannounced the planned tool in August, it said a so-called fingerprint of the image would be compared against a database of known child sexual abuse material to search for potential matches.\nBut the plan sparked an uproar among privacy advocates and raised fears that the technology could erode digital privacy and eventually be used by authoritarian governments to track down political dissidents and other enemies.\nApple said it would reject any such requests by foreign governments, but the outcry led it topause the release of the scanning tool in September. The company declined to comment on the report released on Thursday.\nThe cybersecurity researchers said they had begun their study before Apple\u2019s announcement.Documentsreleased by the European Union and a meeting with E.U. officials last year led them to believe that the bloc\u2019s governing body wanted a similar program that would scan not only for images of child sexual abuse but also for signs of organized crime and indications of terrorist ties.\nA proposal to allow the photo scanning in the European Union could come as soon as this year, the researchers believe.\nThey said they were publishing their findings now to inform the European Union of the dangers of its plan, and because the \u201cexpansion of the surveillance powers of the state really is passing a red line,\u201d said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge and a member of the group.\nAside from surveillance concerns, the researchers said, their findings indicated that the technology was not effective at identifying images of child sexual abuse. Within days of Apple\u2019s announcement, they said, people had pointed out ways to avoid detection by editing the images slightly.\nThe technology allows \u201cscanning of a personal private device without any probable cause for anything illegitimate being done,\u201d added another member of the group, Susan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity and policy at Tufts University. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily dangerous. It\u2019s dangerous for business, national security, for public safety and for privacy.\u201d"

        "title": "Spending Is Big Tech\u2019s Superpower",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nI keep writing about thebonkers dollarsthat Big Tech companies are generating in revenue and profits. But what may be even more astounding is what the technology giants are spending to keep their businesses humming and growing long into the future.\nI have watched, mouth agape, as America\u2019s five biggest tech superstars \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 have splurged on big-ticket investments in their businesses. That includes specialized equipment to assemble iPhones, hulking computer hubs and undersea internet cables that zip YouTube videos to your phone, and the warehouses for Amazon workers to assemble and ship orders.\nWhat the companies spend on physical assets that last for years \u2014 capital expenditures, for you wonks \u2014 is one of the best glimpses at how Big Tech leverages success into even more success.\nThe combined profits of these five companies climbed more than 25 percent in the most recent year, according to financial statements. The tech giants have the cash and the permission from their investors to spend almost whatever it takes to stay on top. It\u2019s an advantage that few companies can match.\nOne example: In the past year, UPS spent the equivalent of about 5 cents of each dollar of its sales on more planes, trucks, delivery depots, package handling equipment and software to manage it all, according to the company\u2019sfinancial statements. My calculations from Amazon\u2019s disclosures show that the company\u2019s similar category of spending works out to 13 cents for each dollar in sales.\nUPS and Amazon do not do exactly the same things. Amazon\u2019s major investments include technology hubs for its cloud computing business. UPS delivers for many businesses, while Amazon mostly handles packages for itself.\nBoth companies have done dandy in the pandemic surge of online shopping. But UPS is scaling back what it spends on long-lasting assets while Amazon is spending far more each year.\nThe good news is that this is exactly what we want rich and successful companies to do: Invest a big chunk of their wealth to improve their business \u2014 for their benefit and ours. When Microsoft drops big bucks to upgrade its computer centers, it helps all the businesses that use online versions of Excel and Outlook. When Amazon outfits its warehouses with new assembly lines, orders might move more efficiently to our homes.\nWe can be impressed and still wonder whether anyone can keep up with Big Tech\u2019s levels of investment.\nHow does a driverless car start-up compete with what Google and Apple can spend on sensors, computer chips, prototype laboratories and the best minds to figure it all out? (The answer: It doesn\u2019t. A lot of driverless car start-ups havegiven up or sold to bigger companies.)\nGeneral Motors recently said that it\u2019s going to devote about $10 billion a year on big-ticket assetsto remake itself into an electric vehicle and tech company. That includes overhauling factories and investing in new projects like electric battery development.\nThat\u2019s only about half of what Facebook spends, in both raw cash and the percentage of each company\u2019s total annual sales, for computer centers and other long-term investments. In short, Facebook\u2019s investments to shoot Instagram posts around the world are far more than GM has earmarked to reinvent a 113-year-old American industrial icon.\nThe question I keep coming back to in this newsletter \u2014 and I don\u2019t know the answer \u2014 is whether Big Tech is invincible. History suggests thatdominant companies don\u2019t stay that way for long. What seems potentially different now, though, is the existence of a handful of overwhelmingly dominant companies in a dynamic sector of the economy with the power to spend anything to stay on top.\nNeighborhood watch for delivery couriers:In New York, people who deliver restaurant food form nightlypatrols on bridges and roadways to help deter robberies. Some couriers told my colleague Coral Murphy Marcos that they believed the police hadn\u2019t done enough to protect them from a surge in thefts of couriers\u2019 electric bicycles. New York Magazinewrotelast month about courier patrols and organizing.\nDid you hate the food, or something else?Axios writes about instances in Washington of \u201creview bombing,\u201d or people leaving negative reviews on a restaurant\u2019s Yelp page to protest its policies about masks or vaccinations. Yelp has elaborate systems to try to weed out people who bad mouth a restaurant they have never been to.\nBehind China\u2019s crackdown on video games:An anthropologist writes in Sixth Tone about the Chinese government\u2019s recent time limits on children playing video games. \u201cUnderlying China\u2019s internet addiction panic are deeper social problemsrelated to the social transformations of the past 40 years,\u201d Rao Yichen says. (My colleagueswrotelast month about China\u2019s gaming restrictions.)\nHere areglorious portraits of cows, including a groupon a white sand beach(?!?!). The Atlantic recently recirculated this 2019 collection of moo images.\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.
