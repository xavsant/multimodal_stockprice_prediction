        "title": "Apple\u2019s Illusion of Privacy Is Getting Harder to Sell",
        "fulltext": "Even iPhone users with nothing to hide could be forgiven for being a little creeped out that Apple will scan their photos and see if they match existing databases of known illegal pornographic images. Privacy experts called the idea a potentialback doorfor governments to request or demand scans for other images or files. Some of Apple\u2019s own employees arereportedlypushing back on the idea.\nIt\u2019s a good indication that things are headed in the wrong direction when your company\u2019s anti-child-pornography initiative gets panned.\nA major reason for the failure of Apple\u2019s defense is that the photo-scanning program confirms a fear many users already harbor: Personal data, even the most sensitive, is effectively out of users\u2019 control, accessible at the flip of a switch.\nApple says, relentlessly, that privacy is the central feature of its iPhones. But as the photo scanning demonstrates, that\u2019s true only until the company changes its mind about its policies.\nThe iPhone is a gluttonous collector of user information. The devicesbeam location dataas well as information about Wi-Fi usage and internet usage to Apple\u2019s servers, even when we think the devices areslumbering. That type of data opens up iPhone owners to alarmingly accurate tracking by third parties, including their whereabouts, political leanings, job and family status, ethnicity and net worth.\nAparticular concernaround the photo-scanning initiative is that countries may compel Apple to use the technology for their own ends, which Apple says it will resist. But, through a third party, Apple has made Chinese users\u2019 data accessible to the Chinese government, as The Timesreported, a sleight of hand that allows the company to say it doesn\u2019t directly turn the information over. That makes it hard to believe that Apple might not act similarly where its business interests demand it \u2014 even at home in the United States, where technology companies fulfillsecret personal data requestsdaily.\nIt\u2019s not just the child pornography project that should give users pause. Apple received plaudits, includingfrom me, for rolling out an option this year to prevent apps from tracking users\u2019 activity as they surf the mobile web. But the tracking was enabled in the first place by something Apple created called an \u201cidentifier for advertisers,\u201d which turned on the fire hose of personal data available to marketers for the purpose of targeted ads. If Apple believes that tracking is anathema to privacy, why not disable the identifier itself or disable tracking as a default?\n\u201cThe do-not-track option didn\u2019t really solve privacy,\u201d said Patrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of the privacy firm Disconnect. \u201cIt was designed to make users feel like they could press a button and fix it.\u201d He said advertisers and others can still use a process known as fingerprinting \u2014 which relies on things like phone model, operating-system version and screen resolution \u2014 to identify users and continue keeping tabs on them.\nApple is also building out its own online advertising business, portions of which aFrench privacy watchdogsaid may run afoul of European laws. The agency said that Apple doesn\u2019t appear to require users\u2019 consent for tracking, as it now does from other app makers, meaning it could benefit from the targeted advertising that its do-not-track feature is meant to hinder.\nGoogle\u2019s Android mobile software also has a voracious appetite for data but may be less vulnerable than the iPhone to broad attacks, such as the recently uncovered one affecting tens of thousands of phones reportedly targeted byNSO Group\u2019s Pegasus software. That\u2019s because Android runs on many different phone types, each with slightly different versions of the software, said Zuk Avraham, the C.E.O. of the cybersecurity firm ZecOps. Pegasus software reportedly collected all manner of personal information, such as emails, voice mail messages, passwords, contacts, call logs, social media posts, web browsing history and photos, and it can remotely activate a user\u2019s phone camera and microphone, according toThe Washington Post.\nOf course, no software will be invulnerable to every type of hack, but when your marketing states, \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone,\u201d the bar ought to be set higher.\nOne way to keep prying eyes off your data is to resist putting files into Apple\u2019s iCloud service, but that means potentially choosing another service, with its own privacy concerns. The child pornography scanning project, Apple says, is only for consumers who store their photos in iCloud. Apple also hasaccess to text messagesthat it says are otherwise encrypted when they are backed up in iCloud, a workaround that\u2019sapparentlynecessary to aid law enforcement. But for most consumers, it\u2019s a distinction without a difference; photos and text messages are primarily created and accessible on the phones that Apple tells us are sacrosanct.\nApple could take a big lead over its rivals by supporting a single setting at the browser level, known as theGlobal Privacy Control, to prohibit companies from selling your data to others. That would take the place of prohibiting such actions site by site. (The initiative is supported by a host of privacy and media organizations, includingThe New York Times, as well as California\u2019sattorney general.)\nTech companies would like users to believe that they hold the keys to their own privacy. But, locked into Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s ecosystems, our data is as secure as their policies. I\u2019d like to trust that the biggest technology companies have the best intent, but when they have to say out loud that our privacy is paramount, it sure is difficult.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple delays its return to office until January.",
        "fulltext": "Apple again delayed itsreturn-to-officedate, until January, because of the continuing spread of the coronavirus in the United States.\nDeirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s head of human resources, told employees in an email late Thursday that the company\u2019sofficesand retail stores remained open, but that employees would not be required to return until January at the earliest, according to a copy of the email viewed by The New York Times. She said Apple would give employees at least one month\u2019s notice before asking them to return to offices.\nLast month, Apple was one of the first major companies to push back its mandatory return-to-office date as the Delta variant was starting to fuel a surge in U.S. coronavirus cases,changing the return date to October from September.\nSince then, cases have continued to increase and companies across the country have told employees to stay home for the foreseeable future. Apple\u2019s decision to delay its return into 2022 is further evidence that the prepandemic workplace is not returning as quickly as some executives and employees had hoped.\nStill, many employees are happy with the delays. In an internal Slack group at Apple for people who support remote work, many of the more than 7,000 members cheered the decision, according to Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer who has pushed executives to allow employees to continue to work from home.\nMs. Scarlett said the decision to delay was welcome news but she and many other colleagues don\u2019t ever want to be forced to return to the office. \u201cI do hope that they see that some of our other concerns are valid as well,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people, whether they have children or at-risk people at home, just feel safer working at home.\u201d\nIn the email on Thursday, Ms. O\u2019Brien encouraged employees to get vaccinated, noting that government data show that 99.6 percent of people hospitalized for the coronavirus since January have been unvaccinated.\nLast month, Apple returned tomask requirementsinside its U.S. stores and offices, regardless of vaccination status."

        "title": "Will Hearing Aids Ever Be Hip?",
        "fulltext": "You may be tired of reading columns about the dismally poor use ofhearing aidsby Americans. And, to be honest, I\u2019d rather nothave to write oneeveryyear or two. However, most people who could significantly benefit from these miracles of miniaturization still do not use them. But help is on the horizon.\nTwo-thirds of Americans aged 70 and older \u201chave clinically relevant hearing loss,\u201d according to the Johns Hopkins Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health. Unaddressed hearing loss can increase the risk of cognitive decline, dementia, falls, cardiovascular disease, social isolation, depression and anxiety, but less than 20 percent of the adults who could benefit from ahearing aidcurrently wear one.\nAlthough the need is generally greatest for those 65 and older, the Medicare legislation of 1965 excluded the coverage for hearing aids (as well as for vision aids and dental care) and never updated it. Medicare does cover the cost of a hearing exam performed by an audiologist, who can diagnose and prescribe treatment for hearing loss. But if the result is a prescription for hearing aids, which can range in cost from about $2,000 to $12,000 a pair, they will not be covered by Medicare and only rarely by private insurance.\nMaybe, like me, you\u2019re still waiting for the long-promised availability of low-cost, over-the-counter hearing aids. In 2017, a bipartisan congress passed a law that would allow for the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids for those with mild to moderate hearing loss, but the Food and Drug Administration has yet to issue regulations to assure that such devices are both safe and effective. The agency, preoccupied with the pandemic, failed to meet the law\u2019s mandated deadline to publish the required rules by August 2020.\nAs things now stand, given the high and often prohibitive out of pocket cost of hearing aids, many have waited far too long to get needed technological help. But the wait may end soon.\nOn July 9, President Biden signed an executive order giving the drug agency 120 days to issue guidelines so that those with mild to moderate hearing loss could purchase high-quality hearing assists directly from retailers like Apple, Bose or Samsung that cost several hundred dollars a pair, not several thousand.\nSuch companies have already proven themselves by creating superior sound quality and are expected to not take long to market top-of-the-line hearing aids that cost no more than a basic cellphone. (I already hear much better when using the speakerphone feature on my cellphone rather than my landline. FaceTime or Skype also provide greater clarity.)\nAffordable access to a device is just the first step toward improved hearing for the millions of people who now struggle to understand conversations, lectures, movies or broadcasts on radio and television. Additional legislation now before Congress would expand Medicare coverage not only for medically prescribed hearing aids, but also for critically important audiology services that could benefit those who purchase over-the-counter hearing devices and need adjustments, as well as those who might benefit from seeing an audiologist, but who don\u2019t necessarily need a hearing aid.\nDr. Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and director of the Johns Hopkins center, explained that audiologists can provide their patients with better communication tips, even if they don\u2019t require a hearing aid. \u201cFor example, by speaking face-to-face with people, shutting out background noise, adjusting the volume on the phone or using a cellphone on speaker or FaceTime instead of a land line,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, audiologists are not paid to do this unless you purchase a hearing aid.\u201d Dr. Lin applauded the Democrats\u2019 budget draft of $3.5 trillion that includes Medicare coverage for such hearing care services.\nBut high cost and inconvenient access are not the only reasons many people who need hearing aids are unwilling to get them. I had gifted an elderly aunt an $8,000 pair years ago and they sat in a drawer unused. \u201cThey make me look old,\u201d was her excuse, a common impediment to hearing aid use, even if unspoken.\nYet a similar concern doesn\u2019t keep people with poor vision from wearing glasses. And modern digital hearing aids border on invisibility. They come in three main styles: behind-the-ear, in-the-ear and in-the-ear-canal. Sound is conveyed through a tiny speaker that fits inside the ear, attached by a barely visible wire to a very small flesh-colored \u201ccomputer\u201d containing a microphone, amplifier and battery that sits behind the ear.\nMy friend Michael Stoff, proprietor of an eyeglass shop in Brooklyn, who recently got hearing aids at age 64, said that for him, vanity is not an issue. \u201cI just want to hear well \u2014 at dinner with friends, in the movies, the theater, when shopping or talking with customers,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m realistic. If I was so interested in vanity, I\u2019d be 50 pounds lighter!\u201d\nMr. Stoff\u2019s hearing aids, like most modern ones, connect to his television and cellphone via Bluetooth. He\u2019s thrilled with the aids, which he purchased at Costco for $2,000, including all needed adjustments and counseling. \u201cThe sound is so crystal clear, it\u2019s as if my ears are 15 years old,\u201d he said.\nWhen the new generation of over-the-counter hearing aids become available, they may look very much like the already popular AirPods that so many people of all ages now walk around with while listening to music and podcasts, and while making calls on their cellphones. Perhaps people might not even notice them.\nMisplacing the tiny devices, however, is an issue for some people, especially those who are older. Hearing aids must be removed once a day and recharged, usually overnight. And unlike a water-resistant watch, hearing aids also must be kept dry, so they should be removed when showering or swimming.\nForewarned: Dr. Lin cautioned that \u201ca lot of the cheap hearing assists currently sold in pharmacies are bad; they make speech harder to understand by amplifying the wrong sounds.\u201d They are not hearing aids; they may raise the level of incoming sounds, but at the expense of clarity. But he gave a thumbs up to the hearing aids and services at Costco that cost $2,000 or less."

Apple takes a cut of up to 30 percent through in-app purchases; last year, Google indicated that it intends to follow suit by applying a 30 percent cut to more purchases than it had in the past. The legislation will be a blow to the profit they make in South Korea, where the two control more than 85 percent of the app market, according to lawmakers.\nThe measures were proposed last year and faced strong resistance from Apple and Google.

        "title": "The Labor Market\u2019s Message",
        "fulltext": "This morning, the government will report how many workers U.S. employers added to their payrolls in July.Economists expect a big number\u2014 as many as 850,000 \u2014 in another sign that the economic recovery continues.\nThe stakes are higher than usual, as various emergency stimulus measures areabout to expire, the infrastructure bill isnearing passage, and the Fed is contemplating how and when to taper itsextraordinary effortsto support the economy during the pandemic. Economists have their eyes on both the number of jobs created as well as wages, which were up a relatively high 3.6 percent in June versus a year ago. Here\u2019s how to interpret the results.\nWeak job gains and little growth in wages:This is bad. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is causing more economic damage than thought. Congress could speed forward the infrastructure bill, and President Biden may emerge with more leverage to push through a bigger budget. As for the Fed? The urgency to taper bond purchases, and to eventually raise interest rates, fades away.\nWeak job gains, but a big jump in wages:This is OK. Vincent Reinhart, Mellon\u2019s chief economist, points to a growing mismatch between employers and job seekers, and notes that the economy isn\u2019t weakening yet. That\u2019s not a roadblock for an infrastructure bill, but it makes passing a big budget tougher. The Fed, meanwhile, needs to thread the needle between rising inflation and a job market that isn\u2019t growing as fast as it could.\nStrong job growth with muted wage gains:This is good, at least for businesses. The economy is strong, workers are returning to the job market and the supply and labor issues that have pushed up prices are receding. Biden would no longer have to fight arguments that government spending is causing inflation. The Fed can let the economy run with fewer fears of overheating.\nStrong job growth and hefty wage gains:This is great, for now.The post-pandemic economy is in full swing, with workers reaping the rewards. But the recovery is likely closer to the end than the beginning. That puts ambitious government spending plans in jeopardy. The Fed may taper its support sooner, possibly leading to market tantrums.\nThe infrastructure bill will add $256 billion to thedeficitover 10 years.The Congressional Budget Office analysis could complicate plansto vote on the bill this weekend. But the C.B.O.\u2019s report didn\u2019t include tens of billions in projected additional revenue, nor billions saved from redirecting unused stimulus funds.\nAmazon, BlackRock and Wells Fargo push back their returns to the office. Amazon said corporate employees did not need to returnuntil January, and BlackRock said only vaccinated workers would be allowed in offices starting in October. CNNfired three employeeswho violated its policy by going to the office unvaccinated, one of the first known examples of enforcement of a workplace mandate.\nRobinhood loses its meme momentum.The stock of the trading appplunged 27 percentyesterday as early investors registered to sell shares after a red-hot run. Venture capital firms collecting big paydays as Robinhood\u2019s shares sink (although they remain well above the I.P.O. price) could challenge the company\u2019s image as a champion of small investors.\nExxon Mobil may pledge to go carbon neutral by 2050.Executives have previously called such pronouncements meaningless, andpushed backagainst government climate policy, but The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is nowconsidering a \u201cnet zero\u201d pledge.\nFamilies of 115 U.S. service members killed overseas sue big banks.The lawsuit says that Deutsche Bank, Standard Charter and othershelped to finance terrorist attacksby not policing its accounts. It is broader than past actions brought under a 2016 antiterrorism law, which had mixed results.\nBidensigned an executive order yesterdaycalling for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 to be electric. \u201cThey\u2019re a vision of the future that is now beginning to happen, a future of the automobile industry that is electric,\u201d he said at the White House, standing before an array of electric vehicles.\nThe shift to electric cars won\u2019t be easy.Manufacturers and suppliers need to transform factories, charging stations need to be built and consumers need to be persuaded to buy. In June,less than 4 percentof new cars sold in the U.S. were pure electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, a quarter of the share of electric sales in Europe. Biden\u2019s order envisions building a nationwide network of charging stations, providing financial incentives and instituting new fuel-efficiency rules, moves akin to those made in Europe and China.\nPolicymakers have framed the push as part of a geopolitical competition, overhauling a major industry to compete with China, which makes about 70 percent of all electric-vehicle batteries, in an effort that blends environmental, economic and foreign policy. \u201cThis is the first example of how Biden\u2019s administration would do industrial policy in the climate change context,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton.\nThe auto industry is mostly on board.Ford\u2019s C.E.O., Jim Farley, said in a statement that his company was \u201ccounting on strong cooperation\u201d between the administration, Congress and state and local governments. Ford, G.M., Volkswagen and other auto giants have already begun selling tens of thousands of electric cars. Biden\u2019s announcement isunequivocally good for Tesla, and could also help electric vehicle start-ups like Rivian and Lucid Motors get a jump on more established competition.\nBut automakers\u2019 current preoccupation is shortages.New car production, of all kinds, is hampered byscarcity in key componentslike semiconductors, meaning that supply can\u2019t keep up with demand as people get out again but are wary of crowds. That has led to\u201cinsane\u201d market conditionsfor new and used cars alike, somewhat thwarting the efforts to push car buyers away from internal combustion engines. For now, most road trips are happening in gas guzzlers.\n\u2014 Bob Costas, who spent 24 years as NBC\u2019s prime-time Olympics host before leaving the network in 2017, on the Tokyo Olympics\u2019relatively low television ratings.\nApple launched a sophisticated system yesterday to detect whether an iPhone user is storing images of child sexual abuse, or if a child under 13 is sending or receiving sexual imagery by text. The Times and othershave shownthat tech companies have failed to police their platforms for child exploitation.\nSome are concerned about Apple\u2019s methods,writes The Times\u2019s Jack Nicas. Cybersecurity experts say that the tools Apple is using to monitor sexual abuse images tips its hand that the company has more powerful surveillance tech than it has previously claimed. In the future, law enforcement and governments might compel Apple to use those tools in other ways.\nApple says that it has put in guardrails to protect privacy, and that the tech allows it only to see images flagged as child pornography. Apple\u2019s attempt to police what few would defend highlights the thin line that tech companies walk between public safety and customer privacy concerns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be on the side of child porn and I\u2019m not a terrorist,\u201dsaid Matthew Green, who teaches cryptography at Johns Hopkins. \u201cBut the problem is that encryption is a powerful tool that provides privacy, and you can\u2019t really have strong privacy while also surveilling every image anyone sends.\u201d\nThe S.E.C.\u2019sGary Gensler, SenatorElizabeth Warrenand others sounded off this week on the need for stricter regulation of crypto, giving an impression of an industry under siege.\nCracking down on crypto also came up in negotiations over the infrastructure bill, which included a provision to raise $30 billion in taxes on crypto transactions. But on that front, the industry\u2019snascent lobbyrallied to press senators for an amendment to clarify the tax provision, showing the lobby\u2019s growing power.\nHeavyweights chimed in.The venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz wroteto Senate leaders, calling the tax provision \u201coverly broad\u201d and suggesting a lawsuit looms if the language isn\u2019t changed. Brian Armstrong, the C.E.O. of the crypto exchange Coinbaseprotested in a Twitter thread. Lobbyists worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators onan amendmentset to be considered before the bill goes to a vote.\nThis is a preview of bigger battles.In addition to Gensler and Warren, the leaders of theHouse Financial Services Committeeand theSenate Banking Committeehave called for sweeping new rules and tougher enforcement. Representative Donald Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, recently introduceda comprehensive billon digital assets that industry groups told DealBook they haven\u2019t had time to analyze yet because the infrastructure fight is more pressing. After mounting a resistance to one provision in a 2,700-page bill, more serious battles await, and the true strength of the crypto lobby will be tested.\nIn other news, officials at the Fedseem increasingly dividedover whether to issue a digital dollar.\nDeals\nThe state-run China Telecom is selling $8.4 billion in stock on the Shanghai exchange, months after being forced to delist in the U.S. (Nikkei Asia)\nLevi Strauss is stretching its product line with the acquisition of the active-wear brand Beyond Yoga.

        "title": "Are Apple\u2019s Tools Against Child Abuse Bad for Your Privacy?",
        "fulltext": "Appleunveiled a plantwo weeks ago founded in good intentions: Root out images of child sexual abuse from iPhones.\nBut as is often the case when changes are made to digital privacy and security, technology expertsquickly identified the downside:Apple\u2019s approach to scanning people\u2019s private photoscould give law enforcement authorities and governments a new way to surveil citizens and persecute dissidents. Once one chip in privacy armor is identified, anyone can attack it, they argued.\nThe conflicting concerns laid bare an intractable issue that the tech industry seems no closer to solving today than whenApple first fought with the F.B.I.over a dead terrorist\u2019s iPhone five years ago.\nThe technology that protects the ordinary person\u2019s privacy can also hamstring criminal investigations. But the alternative, according to privacy groups and many security experts, would be worse.\n\u201cOnce you create that back door, it will be used by people whom you don\u2019t want to use it,\u201d said Eva Galperin, the cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights group. \u201cThat is not a theoretical harm. That is a harm we\u2019ve seen happen time and time again.\u201d\nApple was not expecting such backlash. When the company announced the changes, it sent reporters complex technical explainers and laudatory statements from child-safety groups, computer scientists and Eric H. Holder Jr., the former U.S. attorney general. After the news went public, an Apple spokesman emailed a reportera tweet from Ashton Kutcher, the actor who helped found a group that fights child sexual abuse, cheering the moves.\nBut his voice was largely drowned out.Cybersecurity experts,the head of the messaging app WhatsAppandEdward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked classified documents about government surveillance, all denounced the move as setting a dangerous precedent that could enable governments to look into people\u2019s private phones. Apple scheduled four more press briefings to combat what it said were misunderstandings, admitted it had bungled its messaging and announced new safeguards meant to address some concerns. More than 8,000 people responded withan open lettercalling on Apple to halt its moves.\nAs of now, Apple has said it is going forward with the plans. But the company is in a precarious position. It has for years worked to make iPhones more secure, and in turn, it has made privacy central to its marketing pitch. But what has been good for business also turned out to be bad for abused children.\nA few years ago, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children began disclosing how often tech companies reported cases of child sexual abuse material, commonly known as child pornography, on their products.\nApple was near the bottom of the pack. The company reported 265 cases to the authorities last year, compared with Facebook\u2019s 20.3 million. That enormous gap was largely due, in most cases, to Apple\u2019s electing not to look for such images to protect the privacy of its users.\nIn late 2019, afterreports in The New York Timesabout the proliferation of child sexual abuse images online, members of Congress told Apple that it had better do more to help law enforcement officials or they would force the company to do so. Eighteen months later, Apple announced that it had figured out a way to tackle the problem on iPhones, while, in its view, protecting the privacy of its users.\nThe plan included modifying its virtual assistant, Siri, to direct people who ask about child sexual abuse to appropriate resources. Apple said it would also soon enable parents to turn on technology that scans images in their children\u2019s text messages for nudity. Children 13 and older would be warned before sending or viewing a nude photo, while parents could ask to be notified if children under 13 did so.\nThose changes were met with little controversy compared with Apple\u2019s third new tool: software that scans users\u2019 iPhone photos and compares them against a database of known child sexual abuse images.\nTo prevent false positives and hide the images of abuse, Apple took a complex approach. Its software reduces each photo to a unique set of numbers \u2014 a sort of image fingerprint called a hash \u2014 and then runs them against hashes of known images of child abuse provided by groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nIf 30 or more of a user\u2019s photos appear to match the abuse images, an Apple employee reviews the matches. If any of the photos show child sexual abuse, Apple sends them to the authorities and locks the user\u2019s account. Apple said it would turn on the feature in the United States over the next several months.\nLaw enforcement officials, child-safety groups, abuse survivors and some computer scientistspraised the moves. In statements provided by Apple, the president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children called it a \u201cgame changer,\u201d while David Forsyth, chairman of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said that the technology would catch child abusers and that \u201charmless users should experience minimal to no loss of privacy.\u201d\nBut other computer scientists, as well as privacy groups and civil-liberty lawyers, immediately condemned the approach.\nOther tech companies, like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, also scan users\u2019 photos to look for child sexual abuse, but they do so only on images that are on the companies\u2019 computer servers. In Apple\u2019s case, much of the scanning happens directly on people\u2019s iPhones. (Apple said it would scan photos that users had chosen to upload to its iCloud storage service, but scanning still happens on the phone.)\nTo many technologists, Apple has opened a Pandora\u2019s box. The tool would be the first technology built into a phone\u2019s operating system that can look at a person\u2019s private data and report it to law enforcement authorities. Privacy groups and security experts are worried that governments looking for criminals, opponents or other targets could find plenty of ways to use such a system.\n\u201cAs we now understand it, I\u2019m not so worried about Apple\u2019s specific implementation being abused,\u201d said Alex Stamos, a Stanford University researcher who previously led Facebook\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. \u201cThe problem is, they\u2019ve now opened the door to a class of surveillance that was never open before.\u201d\nIf governments had previously asked Apple to analyze people\u2019s photos, the company could have responded that it couldn\u2019t. Now that it has built a system that can, Apple must argue that it won\u2019t.\n\u201cI think Apple has clearly tried to do this as responsibly as possible, but the fact they\u2019re doing it at all is the problem,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cOnce you build a system that can be aimed at any database, you will be asked to aim the system at a database.\u201d\nIn response, Apple has assured the public that it will not accede to such requests. \u201cWe have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,\u201dthe company said in a statement.\nApple has indeed fought demands to weaken smartphone encryption in the United States, but it has also bowed to governments in other cases. In China, where Apple makes nearly all of its products, it stores its Chinese customers\u2019 dataon computer servers owned and run by a state-owned company, at the demand of the government.\nIn the United States, Apple has been able to avoid more intense fights with the government because it still turns over plenty of data to law enforcement officials. From January 2018 through June 2020, the most recent data available, Apple turned over the contents of 340 customers\u2019 iCloud accounts a month to American authorities with warrants. Apple still hasn\u2019t fully encrypted iCloud, allowing it to have access to its customers\u2019 data, and the company scrapped plans to add more encryption when the F.B.I. balked,according to Reuters.\nApple\u2019s fights with the F.B.I. over smartphone encryption have also been defused because other companies have regularly been able tohack into iPhones for the police. It is still expensive and time-consuming to get into a locked iPhone, but that has created an effective middle ground where the police can gain access to devices they need for investigations but it is more difficult for them to abuse the technology.\nThat stalemate on encryption has also enabled Apple to retain its brand as a champion of privacy, because it is not actively giving the police a way in. But that compounds the potential harm of its new tools, security experts said.\nFor years, technologists have argued that giving the police a way into phones would fundamentally undermine the devices\u2019 security, but now governments can point to Apple\u2019s endorsement of its photo-scanning tools as a method that helps the police while preserving privacy.\nApple has \u201ctaken all their platinum privacy branding and they\u2019ve applied it to this idea,\u201d Mr. Stamos said. \u201cThis Apple solution screws up the entire debate and sets us back years.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Wants to Protect Children. But It\u2019s Creating Serious Privacy Risks.",
        "fulltext": "Apple last weekannounced a planto introduce new tools that will allow it to scan iPhones for images related to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. Apple is billing these innovations as part of a child safety initiative, and indeed they may help make the online world a safer place for children, which could not be a worthier goal.\nBut these tools, which are scheduled to become operational in the coming months, also open the door to troubling forms of surveillance. Apple should refrain from using these technologies until we can better study them and understand their risks.\nApple\u2019s plan has two main prongs. First, parents can opt to have their children\u2019s iMessage accounts scanned for nude images sent or received, and to be notified if this occurs in the case of children under 13. All children will receive warnings if they seek to view or share a sexually explicit image.\nSecond, the company will scan the photos you store on your iPhone and check them against records corresponding with known child sexual abuse material provided by organizations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple says it will do this only if you also upload your photos to iCloud Photos, but that is a policy decision, not an essential technological requirement.\nThe technology involved in this plan is fundamentally new. While Facebook and Google have long scanned the photos that people share on their platforms, their systems do not process files on your own computer or phone. Because Apple\u2019s new tools do have the power to process files stored on your phone, they pose a novel threat to privacy.\nIn the case of the iMessage child safety service, the privacy intrusion is not especially grave. At no time is Apple or law enforcement informed of a nude image sent or received by a child (again, only the parents of children under 13 are informed), and children are given the ability to pull back from a potentially serious mistake without informing their parents.\nBut the other technology, which allows Apple to scan the photos on your phone, is more alarming. While Apple has vowed to use this technology to search only for child sexual abuse material, and only if your photos are uploaded to iCloud Photos, nothing in principle prevents this sort of technology from being used for other purposes and without your consent. It is reasonable to wonder if law enforcement in the United States could compel Apple (or any other company that develops such capacities) to use this technology to detect other kinds of images or documents stored on people\u2019s computers or phones.\nWhile Apple is introducing the child sexual abuse detection feature only in the United States for now, it is not hard to imagine that foreign governments will be eager to use this sort of tool to monitor other aspects of their citizens\u2019 lives \u2014 and might pressure Apple to comply. Apple does not have a good record of resisting such pressure in China, for example, havingmoved Chinese citizens\u2019 datato Chinese government servers. Even some democracies criminalize broad categories of hate speech and blasphemy. Would Apple be able to resist the demands of legitimately elected governments to use this technology to help enforce those laws?\nAnother worry is that the new technology has not been sufficiently tested. The tool relies on a new algorithm designed to recognize known child sexual abuse images, even if they have been slightly altered. Apple says this algorithm is extremely unlikely to accidentally flag legitimate content, and it has added some safeguards, including having Apple employees review images before forwarding them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But Apple has allowed few if any independent computer scientists to test its algorithm.\nThe computer science and policymaking communities have spent years considering the kinds of problems raised by this sort of technology, trying to find a proper balance between public safety and individual privacy. The Apple plan upends all of that deliberation. Apple has more than one billion devices in the world, so its decisions affect the security plans of every government and every other technology company. Apple has now sent a clear message that it is safe to build and use systems that directly scan people\u2019s personal phones for prohibited content.\nProtecting children from harm is an urgent and crucial goal. But Apple has created a model for attaining it that may well be abused for decades to come.\nMatthew D. Green (@matthew_d_green) is a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.

        "title": "Apple and Google\u2019s Fight in Seoul Tests Biden in Washington",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For months,Appleand Google have been fighting a bill in the South Korean legislature that they say could imperil their lucrativeapp storebusinesses. The companies have appealed directly to South Korean lawmakers, government officials and the public to try to block the legislation, which is expected to face a crucial vote this week.\nThe companies have also turned to an unlikely ally, one that is also trying to quash their power: the United States government. A group funded by the companies has urged trade officials in Washington to push back on the legislation, arguing that targeting American firms could violate a joint trade agreement.\nThe South Korean legislation would be the first law in the world to require companies that operate app stores to let users pay for in-app purchases using a variety of payment systems. It would also prohibit blocking developers from listing their products on other app stores.\nHow the White House responds to this proposal poses an early test for the Biden administration: Will it defend tech companies facing antitrust scrutiny abroad while it applies that same scrutiny to the companies at home?\nWashington has a longstanding practice of opposing foreign laws that discriminate against American firms, sometimes even when doing so conflicts with domestic policy debates. But President Biden wants a consistent approach to his concerns about the tech giants\u2019 incredible power over commerce, communications and news. In July he signed anexecutive order to spur competitionin the industry, and his top two antitrust appointees have long been vocal critics of the companies.\nThe approach the White House chooses may have widespread implications for the industry, and for the shape of the internet around the world. A growing number of countries are pursuing stricter regulations on Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, fragmenting the rules of the global internet.\nAmerican officials have echoed some of the industry\u2019s complaints about the proposal, saying in a March report it appeared to target American companies. But trade officials have yet to take a formal position on it, said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. He said officials were still considering how to balance the claim that the legislation discriminates against American companies with the belief among tech critics in South Korea and America that the legislation would level the playing field.\n\u201cWe are engaging a range of stakeholders to gather facts as legislation is considered in Korea, recognizing the need to distinguish between discrimination against American companies and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Hodge said in a statement.\nApple said that it regularly dealt with the United States government on a range of topics. During those interactions it discussed the South Korean app store legislation with American officials, including at the U. S. Embassy in Seoul, the company said in a statement.\nThe company said the legislation would \u201cput users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases\u201d and endanger parental controls.\nA Google spokeswoman, Julie Tarallo McAlister, said in a statement that Google was open to \u201cexploring alternative approaches\u201d but believed the legislation would harm consumers and software developers.\nThe proposal was approved by a committee in the Korean National Assembly last month, over the opposition of some in the Korean government. It could get a vote in the body\u2019s judiciary committee as soon as this week. It would then require a vote from the full assembly and the signature of President Moon Jae-in to become law.\nThe proposal would have a major impact on Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store in Korea.\nThe Google store accounted for 75 percent of global app downloads in the second quarter of 2021, according to App Annie, an analytics company. Apple\u2019s marketplace accounted for 65 percent of consumer spending on in-app purchases or subscriptions.\nOne way software developers make money is by selling products directly in their apps, like Fortnite\u2019s in-game currency or a subscription to The New York Times. Apple has insisted for years that developers sell those in-app products through the company\u2019s own payment system, which takes up to a 30 percent cut of many sales. Last year, Google indicated it would follow suit by applying a 30 percent cut to more purchases than it had in the past. Developers say that the fees are far too steep.\nAfter South Korean lawmakers proposed the app store bill last year, the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based group that counts Apple and Google as members, urged the United States Trade Representative to include concerns about the legislation in an annual report highlighting \u201cbarriers\u201d to foreign trade. The group said in October that the rules could violate a 2007 accord that says neither country can discriminate against firms with headquarters in the other.\nApple said that it was not unusual for an industry group to provide feedback to the trade representative. The company said the government had explicitly asked for comment on potentially discriminatory laws. In a statement, Naomi Wilson, the trade group\u2019s vice president of policy for Asia, said that it encouraged \u201clegislators to work with industry to re-examine the obligations for app markets set forth in the proposed measure to ensure they are not trade-restrictive and do not disproportionately affect\u201d American companies.\nWhen the trade representative\u2019s report was published in March \u2014 just weeks after Mr. Biden\u2019s nominee to the position was sworn in \u2014 it included a paragraph that echoed some of the tech group\u2019s concerns. The report concluded that the South Korean law\u2019s \u201crequirement to permit users to use outside payment services appears to specifically target U.S. providers and threatens a standard U.S. business model.\u201d\nThe American report did not say the law would violate the free trade agreement with South Korea. But in July, the managing director of a group called the Asia Internet Coalition, which lists Apple and Google as two of its members, pointed to the report when he told Korea\u2019s trade minister that the law \u201ccould provoke trade tensions between the United States and South Korea.\u201d\n\u201cThe Biden administration has already signaled its concerns,\u201d the director said in a written comment in July.\nAmerican diplomats in Seoul also raised questions about whether the legislation could cause trade tensions.\n\u201cGoogle said something like that, and a similar opinion was expressed by the U.S. Embassy in Korea,\u201d said Jo Seoung Lae, a lawmaker who backs the legislation. He added that the embassy had been in touch with his staff throughout June and July. Park Sungjoong, another lawmaker, also said that the embassy had expressed trade concerns about the law.\nMr. Jo said that a Google representative had visited his office to express opposition to the proposal, and that Apple had also \u201cprovided their feedback\u201d opposing the legislation.\nMr. Jo said that he had requested that the United States provide its official position, but he said he had not received one yet.\nAmerican trade officials sometimes defend companies even when they are criticized by others in the administration. While former President Donald J. Trump attacked a liability shield for social media platforms, known as Section 230, his trade representative wrote a similar provision into agreements with Canada, Mexico and Japan.\nBut Wendy Cutler, a former official who negotiated the trade agreement between South Korea and the United States, said that it would be difficult for America to argue that the Korean rules violate trade agreements when the same antitrust issues are being debated stateside.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be calling out a country for potentially violating an obligation when at the same time your own government is questioning the practice,\u201d said Ms. Cutler,now the vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cIt weakens the case substantially.\u201d\nSouth Korean and American app developers have run their own campaign for the new rules, arguing it would not trigger trade tensions.\nIn June, Mark Buse, the top lobbying executive at the dating app company Match Group and a former board member of a pro-regulation group called the Coalition for App Fairness, wrote to Mr. Jo, the Korean lawmaker, supporting the proposal. He said that the Biden administration knew about concerns around the tech giants, making trade tensions less likely.\nLater that month, Mr. Buse attended a virtual conference about the app store legislation hosted by K-Internet, a trade group that represents major Korean internet companies like Naver, Google\u2019s main search competitor in South Korea, and Kakao.\nMr. Buse, who traveled to Seoul this month to press the case for the legislation on behalf of the Coalition for App Fairness, made it clear that his employer considered it a high-stakes debate. He listed the many other countries where officials were concerned about Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s practices.\n\u201cAnd all of this,\u201d he said, \u201cis following the leadership that the Korean assembly is showing.\u201d"

        "title": "The Lesson to Learn From Apple\u2019s Tool to Flag Child Sex Abuse",
        "fulltext": "As we all put more of our photos, documents and videos online, how much of that data really belongs to us anymore?\nThat\u2019s the question many are now pondering because of a change coming to iPhones. The debate has implications for online privacy and government surveillance and underlines how the storage of our digital data has changed over time, raising concerns about the ways we should conduct ourselves technologically.\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let me back up.\nThe hubbub began last week whenAppleintroduced asoftware tool for iPhones to flag cases of child sex abuse. That seems good, right? The tool will be included in Apple\u2019s next mobile software update this fall. It works by scanning an iPhone for code linked to a database of known child pornography when photos from the device are uploaded to iCloud, Apple\u2019s online storage service. Once there are a certain number of matches, an Apple employee reviews the photos before informing theNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nBut some cybersecurity experts countered that the content-flagging system was invasive and infringed on people\u2019sprivacy. They warned that Apple was creating a precedent that made it simple for surveillance-heavy countries like China to pass laws that could require the company to use the technology for other purposes, such as scanning for political images that are unfavorable to an authoritarian government.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve said they don\u2019t have any plans to do worse things with this technology, but this just feels, at this point, na\u00efvely optimistic,\u201d said Erica Portnoy, a technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital-rights nonprofit.\nIn response to the backlash,Apple this week published a documentexplaining that the new system will not scan people\u2019s private iPhone photo libraries. Also, the matching technology will cease to work if peopledisable their iPhone\u2019s photo libraryfrom backing up images to iCloud, a company spokesman said.\nBut no matter how this Apple episode plays out, it\u2019s a reminder of just how much our digital data storage has changed. In the past, most of us stored our digital photos on our personal computer drives and on miniature USB sticks. Those belonged to us alone.\nNow we increasingly store our documents and other information in \u201cthe cloud,\u201d where big companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft host the data on their server computers. In the process, those companies gained a lot more power over our information.\nThat leads me to something I have said before: It\u2019s wise to have anexit strategyforpulling your datafrom the cloud in the event that you want to leave. All it takes is a little forethought.\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve embraced a hybrid approach of storing copies of my data online and offline so I can reap the benefits of the cloud but also retain independent ownership of my data. My efforts culminated in creating an online server at home, which is essentially a private cloud.\nHere\u2019s how I did that, along with other approaches to a hybrid approach for storing your data.\nMany of us have become accustomed to automatically backing up our data to Apple\u2019s, Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s online servers. These cloud services are convenient, and using them ensures your data is regularly backed up over the internet.\nBut the best practice is a hybrid one: Store local copies on physical drives, too, according to Acronis, a data protection firm. It\u2019s nice to have a local backup for when you lack an internet connection and need immediate access to a file.\n\u201cIt is shocking how few people follow a hybrid backup plan,\u201d said Topher Tebow, a senior cybersecurity researcher at Acronis. \u201cThe whole point of backups is to ensure continuity of data, and that just isn\u2019t something that can be guaranteed with a single solution in place.\u201d\nTo me, having local copies is important for self-reliance. What if I get tired of paying a company\u2019s cloud subscription fees? What if the company\u2019s servers are hacked? Or what if the company changes the product in an unappealing way?\nWithout a local backup, you could feel locked into a company\u2019s ecosystem; the longer you put one off, the more difficult it will become to pull your data out if you decide to leave. Yet only 17 percent of consumers take the hybrid approach, according to an Acronis survey last year.\nFortunately, creating a local backup isn\u2019t hard. The first step is to safely back up all of your digital information to another device.\nFor iPhone photos, the simplest option is to back up your images to a computer. On a Mac, you would plug in your iPhone, open Apple\u2019s Photos app and import all your photos. On Windows, you would use the Windows Photos app to do the same. And if you want to be extra thorough, you can make abackup of all your iPhone datawith the Finder tool on Mac or the iTunes app on Windows.\nFrom there, you cancreate a backup of your computer datato an external drive that plugs into your computer. Apps like Apple\u2019s Time Machine for Macs or File History for Windows will take care of that for you.\nNow that you have pulled your photos off your phone, you can decide what to do from there, like delete them from the cloud and port them to another cloud service such asGoogle Photos. Just remember not to become entirely dependent on the next cloud.\nThere\u2019s also an extreme version of the hybrid backup, which is what I do but don\u2019t recommend for everyone. It\u2019s to set up aso-called network attached storage device, which is a miniature server that plugs into your internet router and gives you remote access to your data. It\u2019s like having a private cloud in your home.\nBuilding a server is not for the faint of heart. For one, the software is not easy to use. For another, it\u2019s not cheap. An internet-connected storage device, like theSynology DS220+, costs roughly $300, and hard drives must be bought separately.\nBut I found it was worth the investment and time. I plug my phone into my Mac weekly, which backs up data to my computer, and when I\u2019m asleep, the Mac backs up its data to my miniserver.\nIt\u2019s not as seamless as a company\u2019s cloud storage but convenient enough \u2014 plus I was tired ofpaying for multiple subscriptionsto cloud services.\nEven if you take a hybrid storage approach, does that get you away from Apple\u2019s new content-flagging tool?\nNo, said Matthew D. Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University who has been a vocal critic of Apple\u2019s move. There is no true escape, he said, because part of the technology will reside on the phone hardware \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing we can do to remove it.\nThe cryptographer said that for the first time, he was contemplating switching to a phone that used Google\u2019s Android software instead. That would involve pulling out all the photos that he had stored in Apple\u2019s cloud.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so painful,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cI have 20,000 photos that go back to 2010. This is stuff I can\u2019t bear the thought of losing.\u201d"
