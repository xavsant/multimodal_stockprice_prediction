        "title": "I Used Apple\u2019s New Controls to Limit a Teenager\u2019s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)",
        "fulltext": "Even as people have embraced the smartphone as one of the most powerful tech products, they are keeping a wary eye on the addictiveness of turning on the device to check for social media updates, read websites and play games. Some studies have tied extended screen time to distraction in classrooms, sleep deprivation and depression.\nI, for one, probably have a problem with compulsively picking up my phone. So when Appleannounced new softwareto help people restrict the amount of time they spend on iPhones, I knew I had to test it on myself. I also wanted to try it on a \u201cscreenager,\u201d a teenager who is addicted to screens \u2014 exactly the kind of person generating so much concern.\nJust one problem: I don\u2019t have a child, so I needed to borrow one. Fortunately, my editor gleefully volunteered her 14-year-old, Sophie, to be a test subject. So last month, I lent Sophie an iPhone X loaded with an unfinished version of iOS 12, Apple\u2019s new operating system, that included theScreen Timefeature, which is set for release this fall. We set up the account so that I was a parent, with the ability to set limits, and she was my child.\nFirst, a primer on how Screen Time works. The feature, which lives inside the iPhone\u2019s settings, shows a dashboard of data about your iPhone use. You can look at your stats for the day or week, including the amount of time you spent on specific apps and on the phone over all. Inside the dashboard, you can create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games. When you run out of time with an app, it locks you out.\nOver the last three weeks, I studied Sophie\u2019s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on \u2014 Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter \u2014 I placed a few time limits on each of us.\nHere\u2019s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt \u201ctriggered\u201d (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat.\n\u201cIt was just a pattern for me \u2014 to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I\u2019m trying not to do that.\u201d\nBut in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie\u2019s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie\u2019s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself).\nThese early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple\u2019s new software.\nHere\u2019s a weekly diary on how Screen Time altered our phone use.\nSophie and I had a rough start with the experiment because of technical difficulties. Apple\u2019s iOS 12 is still in beta, meaning an unfinished version of the software system is being tested by app developers and early adopters \u2014 and we ran into major bugs.\nFor most of the first week, a bug prevented me from seeing Sophie\u2019s Screen Time statistics. But at the end of the week, after Apple released a software fix, her weekly stats appeared. They revealed that she had used her phone for six hours and seven minutes a day on average over the week. I could also see that Sophie was sometimes sneaking glances at her iPhone past midnight, when she was supposed to be asleep.\nAfter I shared the data with my editor, she bombarded Sophie with a flurry of disapproving text messages and fiery emoji.\nMeanwhile, my stats showed that I had used my phone for three hours and 46 minutes a day on average over the week. The majority of my time was spent using the Twitter app Tweetbot, and a significant amount was wasted playing Zynga Poker.\nWith Screen Time now working properly, I placed limits for both Sophie and myself. For her, I set a 30-minute limit on gaming and a 60-minute limit on social networking. To help her sleep, I also turned on Downtime, a setting that disables most parts of the phone for a set time, from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.\nI gave myself the same one-hour limit for social networking apps. But instead of setting a limit for games, I opted to nip my Zynga Poker addiction in the bud by deleting the game and kissing my dreams of being a fake-money billionaire goodbye.\nEven though Sophie was initially incensed about being locked out of Snapchat after an hour, she eventually came around to enjoying the limit.\nIn fact, she asked for more limits. She said she was wasting too much time reading articles on the Safari browser, so she asked for a 90-minute limit there. She also requested that I keep all the limits on until she finished the monthlong summer camp she was just beginning.\nI happily obliged. \u201cI raised her so well,\u201d I told my editor.\nAs for me, I realized that when I ran into my limit on Twitter, I would find other ways to stay glued to my phone. I caught myself repeatedly checking my bank account and loading the same news sites over and over.\nSophie\u2019s progress was remarkable. Mine not so much. By the end of that week, she managed to cut her average phone use to four hours and 44 minutes a day, down 23 percent from the previous week. (I\u2019m sure the trauma from her mother\u2019s outburst of emoji had something to do with it.)\nMy average screen use barely decreased \u2014 to about three and a half hours a day.\nAt the beginning of the third week, phone use continued to steeply decline for Sophie.\nOn some days that week, Sophie\u2019s phone use was lower than mine. On Tuesday afternoon, her screen time dipped to about two and a half hours, whereas mine had already exceeded three hours.\nAt this point, I felt pathetic. (If I were young, I might have said I felt \u201ctriggered.\u201d) I asked myself: What kind of parent am I if I\u2019m more addicted than my teenage daughter to a smartphone? Who would listen to this degenerate?\nWhen I shared this revelation with Sophie, she chuckled and replied: \u201cYou use your phone more than me?\u201d\nSo for the rest of the week, I kept pushing myself to beat her. I logged out of Twitter after each time I used it in the web browser. I stopped checking my bank account, assuring myself that no more money would magically appear.\nIt felt similar to competing with friends on Fitbit to see who could accumulate the most steps \u2014 the only difference here was that I was trying to win by doing less.\nOn Friday, my phone use was one hour and 51 minutes. Sophie\u2019s was three hours and 17 minutes. With a fist pump I exclaimed, \u201cWhat now, Sophie?\u201d\nYet in the end, my average daily use for the week was three hours and 36 minutes. That\u2019s largely because on the Fourth of July and throughout the weekend I spent a total of eight hours driving \u2014 with Google Maps running on my phone screen. That doesn\u2019t seem as if it should count against my Screen Time since my eyes were mostly on the road.\nBut alas, with Sophie averaging just over three hours a day, I lost fair and square.\nI checked in with Sophie to ask how she felt after completing the experiment. She said that other than being a bit more focused on homework for her camp, and sleeping with fewer interruptions, she felt about the same.\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying having my phone but not being able to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it increases my good habits, though.\u201d\nShe also made one more request: \u201cCould you add another limit for Netflix?\u201d"

        "title": "Have the Tech Giants Grown Too Powerful? That\u2019s an Easy One",
        "fulltext": "In start-up lore, no figure is more venerated than the tech-world founder. No mere entrepreneur, the founder is unique, sitting above the categories other people might use to order the society around them. In fact, the personage is cast as a sort of revolutionary, proposing big solutions to questions nobody else is even thinking to ask \u2014 less often because the questions are too complicated or obscure than because they\u2019re tooobvious, too expansive.\nIn a widely read2005 essay, Paul Graham, a founder of the start-up incubator Y Combinator and the closest thing the start-up world has to a pre-eminent guru, shared his big idea about ideas: Many of the best ones are questions. \u201cA few grammatical tweaks,\u201d he writes, \u201cand a woefully incomplete idea becomes a promising question to explore.\u201d And many of the best questions are ones that might seem insoluble at first blush. \u201cI found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to recognize it statistically,\u201d Graham says of his own work. \u201cAnd it turns out that was all you needed to solve the problem.\u201d The recipe for good questions, he goes on, is simple: \u201cfinding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it.\u201d\nThe easy question is a common start-up origin story: One day, the founder asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d before going on to figure out, though hard work, that he or she actually can. According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results? Facebook: Why aren\u2019t social networks connecting people with real names? Uber: Why can\u2019t I use an app to summon a taxi? Twitter: Why isn\u2019t there a dead-simple way to just publish whatever you want for a gathered audience? In real life, each of these companies had more sinuous origins, with dead ends and discarded ideas. But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.\nIn 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways. Most recently, however, the case for \u201cjust asking questions\u201d \u2014 for finding a problem intolerable and believing there must be some way to fix it \u2014 has proved remarkably well suited for a fresh purpose: challenging the tech companies themselves.\nIn political terms,the dominant tech companies have settled into a sort of permanent revolution. If they were founded to address an easy question, that question has either been answered and forgotten or repeated enough times to convert it into an odd, self-justifying ideology. (See: Facebook\u2019s \u201cConnecting the world.\u201d) The questions became companies, which then, mostly without explicitly deciding to, became institutions. And now, for anyone affected by the tech industry, the most obvious and important questions are about the world that these companies are making.\nThe first easy question to ask of the big tech companies: What are they, really? Certainly not what they tell consumers they are. Twitter and Facebook are not merely places to hang out with or meet people, or competitors with the news media, but entirely new forms of discourse built around centralized advertising marketplaces. Uber is not a car company but an attempt to build a new private transit layer over the places in which it operates. Amazon is not a competitor to bookstores or brick-and-mortar retail \u2014 or even a store of any kind \u2014 but a new logisticalmodelfor the exchange and transport of goods, media and services.\nThis leads to other obvious questions. How does Facebook make money while connecting the world? (Many, many ways, most of which involve advertising transactions in which users have a passive role.) How does Facebook decide what to show me next? (Using many \u201csignals\u201d and algorithms that you\u2019ll just have to trust were written to show you what\u2019s most relevant.) How does Twitter decide which users are suspended as it recreates public discourse? (According to inconsistently enforced rules and with the help of a large, invisible contract labor force.) Are Uber drivers employees? (Strictly speaking, no.)\nOther questions are more technical. An easy question with a hard answer: Who owns the content I upload to Instagram? (You do \u2014 except you have granted Instagrama license to use itfor almost any purpose.) Is Instagram listening to me? Because these ads are kind of creeping me out. (No, but the company partners with other firms that collect information about your online behavior, so if for instance you talked about something, then searched for it on your phone in a different app, maybe it could end up helping Instagram serve an ad, so, well, yes,but not literally, no, it is not listening to your spoken words.) O.K., then, what about my Echo \u2014 is my Amazon Echo always listening to me? (No \u2014 well,only so it can hearwhen you say \u201cAlexa.\u201d So, yes?) So is my Echo listening when, for example, I\u2019m having sex? (Again, no, only for the word \u201cAlexa,\u201d so, well, actually yes.)\nThe companies mostvulnerable to easy questions tend to be the ones that can no longer be understood in terms of former competitors or current peers \u2014 because they don\u2019t really have any. Google doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing its users; it simply wants them to use Google more and to use more Google products. Vindicated by growth, these businesses take the liberty to redesign more of our online lives than any of us have asked for. As with Facebook, and to some extent now Amazon, there is no overarching pitch to its users beyond: Where else could you possibly go?\nWith impressive speed, companies founded to confront \u201cintolerable\u201d problems that it \u201cmust be possible to solve\u201d have become intolerable in ways obvious to everyone but them. When Mark Zuckerberg was summoned in front of American and European lawmakers, the hardest questions to answer were some of the easiest to ask: Would Mr. Zuckerberg, whose company trades in such information, be comfortable sharing with the world the name of the hotel he stayed at last night, or the people he messaged with this week? (No,of course not.) How does Facebook make money? (An unilluminating \u201cWe run ads.\u201d) Does Facebook have any competitors, really? (Sure, like ... email?)\nThere are companies that are mostly immune to the easy-question-hard-answer dynamic. Easy questions about Netflix, for one, tend to have easy answers: You pay; they stream. Most obvious questions about Apple can be answered by pointing out that it would like to sell you expensive items on a fairly regular basis. What these more straightforward companies have in common is that their founding questions doubled as consumer rallying cries \u2014 they asked, and continued to ask, about things that their customers need, or at least want, and tend to understand.\nBut for the rest of the tech giants, the easy questions have much harder answers. As these companies grew, they did more than just vanquish their competition. Their growth and free-service benevolence succeeded at making the very idea of competitors\u2019 challenging their efforts \u2014 the industry\u2019s traditional way to solve the problems they\u2019ve created \u2014 seem unnecessary or even counterproductive. They\u2019ve ducked the easy questions for so long that it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that they doubt we will like the answers."

        "title": "E-Waste Offers an Economic Opportunity as Well as Toxicity",
        "fulltext": "The police raid on a junkyard on the outskirts of Bangkok had all the trappings of a drug bust. Swarming onto the open-air property in late May, officers from the Royal Thai Police found undocumented workers from Laos and Myanmar engaged in dangerous work that exposed them to blasts of toxic fumes and dust \u2014 a common hazard on the lowest rung of their illegal and booming international trade. The products these workers handled, however, were not heroin or methamphetamines but vast piles of discarded computers, electrical wires and circuit boards. And it\u2019s very likely that much of this electronic waste came from one of the world\u2019s biggest producers: the United States.\nE-waste has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing trash stream. For all of us who have discarded a phone or computer for a newer, sleeker model, the reasons are hardly a mystery. Still, the growth is staggering: The worldwide accumulation of e-waste has more than doubled in the last nine years. In 2016, according to the United Nations University, a global think tank that tracks the problem, the yearly accumulation reached 49.3 million tons \u2014 enough to fill more than a million 18-wheel trucks stretching from New York to Bangkok and back. By 2021, the annual total is predicted to surpass 57 million tons.\nThe explosion of e-waste highlights its dual (and dueling) identities as both environmental scourge and potential economic resource. Though often laced with lead, mercury or other toxic substances, laptops and phones also contain valuable elements like gold, silver and copper. Yet barely 20 percent of the world\u2019s e-waste is collected and delivered to formal recyclers. The fate of the rest is largely unknown. Only 41 nations compile e-waste statistics, and their partial data can\u2019t keep up with the expansion of electronic devices into so many consumer categories \u2014 toys and toilets, watches and refrigerators. In the United States, which generated an estimated 6.9 million tons of e-waste in 2016 (42 pounds per person), most e-waste probably goes straight into the trash. By one account, e-waste makes up just 2 percent of the total volume in American landfills \u2014 but more than two-thirds of heavy metals.\nDespite being theworld\u2019s second-largest producer \u2014 China recently claimed the top spot \u2014 the United States is the only developed country that hasn\u2019t ratified the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, a treaty that restricts the exports of e-waste and that has the support of 186 parties. Moreover, the United States has no national law for managing e-waste, leaving the issue to the states. (Fifteen states still have no e-waste legislation in effect.) The European Union, by contrast, has some of the toughest enforcement of e-waste laws in the world, banning exports to developing countries and compelling manufacturers to help fund recycling. Europe\u2019s recycling rates for electronics \u2014 around 35 percent overall \u2014 are much higher than the American rate. \u201cThe U.S. has always been the elephant in room that nobody wants to talk about,\u201d says Deepali Sinha Khetriwal, a Mumbai-based research associate at the United Nations University. \u201cUntil it decides to play a part, we can\u2019t really solve the problem of e-waste shipments.\u201d\nA significant but ultimately unquantified portion of American e-waste is quietly exported, mostly to Asia. Until last year, China was handling an estimated 70 percent of the world\u2019s processed e-waste. In January, Beijing imposed a sweeping ban on the import of e-waste as part of its \u201cNational Sword\u201d campaign to slash the levels of what it calls \u201cforeign garbage.\u201d Though spurred by environmental concerns \u2014 rivers choked with toxic chemicals, local children with high levels of lead in their blood \u2014 Beijing\u2019s move also seems emblematic of its increasing self-sufficiency and growing rejection of the West. The ban has caused upheaval in the global trade in e-waste, diverting huge amounts to smaller nations ill equipped to handle the overflow.\nEven before the ban came into full effect, Chinese waste traders were setting up shop in Thailand. Days after the May raid outside Bangkok, the Thai police displayed seven containers at a local port, each packed with 24 tons of mostly broken electronics. So far, the Thai police have suspended the operations of five illegal e-waste processing facilities and found evidence of dozens of smaller high-polluting operations that risk contaminating the countryside. \u201cThailand is getting hit by a tidal wave of electronic waste,\u201d says Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based nonprofit that has used GPS devices to track illegal exports of e-waste to Asia. \u201cThe rest of Asia better get ready, because they are next.\u201d\nThe bulk of usedelectronics shipped to the developing world are meant to give second and third lives to devices and help bridge the world\u2019s digital divide. But the cloak of \u201creuse and repair\u201d is often used to hide illegal exports of e-waste. This is ostensibly scrap, but the frenzy of hazardous e-waste activity in cities in Pakistan and Ghana, for example, testifies to the riches hidden in the piles of discarded electronics. According to researchers at U.N.U., the raw materials contained in e-waste were worth roughly $61 billion in 2016, more than the gross domestic product of even middle-income countries like Croatia or Costa Rica.\nThe precious metals in e-waste, found especially in circuit boards, are more concentrated than in the most productive mines. In 2016, the gold in the world\u2019s e-waste equaled more than a tenth of the gold mined globally that year. And yet much of this treasure is simply reburied in landfills. Based on e-waste disposal rates, Americans alone throw out phones worth $60 million in gold and silver every year.\nThe idea of \u201cmining\u201d e-waste has tantalized the recycling and electronics industries for decades. Until recently, most methods to extract value have been costly, inefficient and hazardous. Backyard recyclers in places like India and Indonesia recover gold by bathing circuit boards in nitric and hydrochloric acid, thus poisoning waterways and communities. Others, like the migrant workers in Thailand, break down used electronics with cooking stoves and shredders and wear no protection against the emissions.\nOver the last few years, however, innovators have devised safer techniques in the lab that would wrest value from e-waste. One isolates rare-earth elements with carbon nanotube technology; another recovers key minerals by bombarding them with underwater sound waves. Josh Lepawsky, a Canadian geographer and the author of \u201cReassembling Rubbish,\u201d finds hope in a curious phenomenon: the growing re-export of e-waste from the developing world back to advanced countries that have greater recycling capacity. An \u201ce-waste offset\u201d by which countries importing high-quality used electronics send back an equal volume of e-waste \u201cis very promising,\u201d Lepawsky says.\nAs the extraction of metals becomes more efficient and eco-friendly, tech manufacturers may feel compelled to get raw materials from their own end-of-life products rather than from the earth. Apple, for instance, has pledged to make all of its future laptops and iPhones out of renewable resources or recycled materials. The idea goes beyond business to national security. \u201cGovernments are starting to take a more strategic view of e-waste, too,\u201d Khetriwal says. \u201cThey ask, \u2018How can we secure the raw materials we need for the future?\u2019\u2009\u201d Some of these metals and rare-earth elements are scarce, and some, like cobalt, are found mostly in conflict zones. By mining the ever-expanding mountains of e-waste, countries could steel themselves against the volatility in prices and supplies of the global market.\nSome e-waste optimists envision a \u201ccircular economy\u201d in which refurbished, reused and recycled raw materials help fuel a sustainable future. Japan was an early leader of this movement, pushing e-waste recycling with tough laws and, more recently, appealing gimmicks. At the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, athletes will receive gold, silver and bronze medals forged from recycled e-waste \u2014 emblems of a world in which e-waste can take on the sheen of immortality.\nThe utopian vision of a circular economy is a long way off, though. E-waste recycling remains stubbornly low in most parts of the world. Even the extraction of precious metals has proved hard for companies to capitalize on. And the remaining mass of e-waste \u2014 mainly plastics laced with metals, chemicals and flame retardant \u2014 pose a more intractable problem. The recycling of these complex plastics would probably need to be subsidized or enforced through legislation \u2014 and few countries outside Europe or Japan have shown the commitment to make that happen.\nTo move toward a circular economy, manufacturers would also need to embrace a \u201cgreen design\u201d that minimizes the generation of e-waste in the first place. Companies like Apple and Dell, though, have not taken enough measures to make their products easier to use longer. \u201cPlanned obsolescence,\u201d the intentional creation of products that rapidly become outdated so customers must replace them with ever-newer models, remains the modus operandi of the tech industry. Manufacturers argue that the approach stimulates not only profits but also the very innovation that drives the global economy. And it has produced a Pavlovian response in consumers, for whom the temptation to buy a slightly cooler phone every couple of years has hardened into a seeming necessity. Not long ago, one tech manufacturer introduced a cheaper, longer-lasting phone \u2014 the perfect antidote to planned obsolescence. It was not a hit \u2014 but it was a reminder that we all share some responsibility for the explosion of e-waste in scrap yards across the world."

        "title": "Taking Away the Phones Won\u2019t Solve Our Teenagers\u2019 Problems",
        "fulltext": "Apple has introduced newsoftwaredesigned to help users restrict the time they spend on their phones \u2014 just change your settings and your favorite app will lock you out after a certain number of hours. It\u2019s been especially welcomed by parents who fret about the habits of their \u201cscreenagers\u201d \u2014 young people who seem permanently attached to their mobile devices.\nEven Silicon Valley insiders demanded that Apple make its devices \u201cless addictive.\u201d Some researchers have gone so far as to declare that smartphones have psychologicallydestroyed a generationof millennials and are fueling theepidemic of teenage anxiety and suicidein the United States. Onestudynotes a spike in anxiety and depression among teenagers in 2011 \u2014 around the time of broad smartphone adoption.\nBut I\u2019ve come to believe that conventional wisdom about the relationship between troubled kids and their favorite technology is wrong.\nAlthough someresearchdoes show that excessive and compulsive smartphone use is correlated with anxiety and depression, there is a lack of direct evidence that devices actuallycausemental health problems.\nIn other words, there simply does not yet exist a prospective longitudinal study showing that, all things being equal, teenagers who use smartphones more often or in certain ways are more likely than their fellows to subsequently develop mental illness.\nLarge studies that fail to follow individuals over time can reveal only correlation, not cause. Luckily, some recently begunstudieswill be poised to weigh in on causation \u2014 but we\u2019ll have to wait years for the results.\nIn the meantime, we can\u2019t just blame the machines. This is especially important because if smartphones aren\u2019t a direct cause of teenagers\u2019 mental health struggles, their use might instead be a crucial way in which these struggles are expressed. This calls for a different set of solutions.\nTeenagers are struggling withanxietymore than any other problem, and perhaps more than ever before. There\u2019s a good chance that it is anxiety that is driving teenagers (and the rest of us) to escape into screens as a way to flee fears. Across most types of anxiety runs a common thread \u2014 difficulty coping with feelings of uncertainty: something today\u2019s teenagers have more than their fair share of.\nThey haveuncertain economic lives:Unlike previous generations, they can anticipate aworse economic future than their parents.\nThey\u2019ve also grown up withuncertain truthsand unreliable sources of news and facts, yet they cannot easily escape the digital ecosystem that\u2019s to blame.\nFinally, teenagers haveuncertain independence,many having been raised under the whirring of helicopter parents, overinvolved and trying to fix every problem for their children. This suffocates independence at a time when teenagers should be exploring autonomy, limits thedevelopment of self-reliance and gritand may even directly produceanxiety and depression.\nWhen we\u2019re anxious, we gravitate toward experiences that dull the present anxious moment. Enter mobile devices, the perfect escape into a two-dimensional half-life, one that teenagers can make sense of.\nWe already know that teenagersgo onlineto avoid feelings of stress, depression and anxiety, and we also know this strategy has morenegative emotional consequencesthan positive ones. With their slot-machine logic and addictive properties, smartphones keep us coming back for more: for distraction, a message from a friend, news, a funny cat meme.\nDigital technology isdesignedto grab our attention, so it exhausts us, distracts us and detracts from our ability to nurture fulfilling relationships. With that in mind, teenagers should reduce their reliance on smartphones, and we must heed the call to make smartphones and social media less addictive while figuring out how they affectusandour children.\nAt the same time, if smartphone addiction is a reflection of adolescent anxiety, cutting screen timemay not solve the broader problemsthat drive teenagers to their screens. Just blaming the machines is a cop-out, a way to avoid the much more difficult task of improving young people\u2019s lives so they won\u2019t need to escape.\nYes, we should devote resources to making smartphones less addictive, but we should devote even more resources to addressing the public health crisis of anxiety that is causing teenagers so much suffering and driving them to seek relief in the ultimate escape machines."

        "fulltext": "Apple reported another strong quarter of profits on Tuesday, as consumers kept buying iPhones and paying more for them, news that could soon help make the Silicon Valley giant the first public company to be worth more than $1 trillion.\nApple said its profit increased to $11.52 billion in its most recent quarter, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier, showing that the company\u2019s enormous business selling iPhones and other gadgets continues to breeze along.\nThe strong results beat Wall Street estimates, sending the company\u2019s shares about 4 percent higher on Wednesday to a new record and for a market value of more than $950 billion.\nApple\u2019s ascent past $1 trillion in market value would further confirm a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago. The steep growth was driven by a series of new products that upended the technology industry \u2014 and, in some cases, society \u2014 and that remain big sellers.\nApple said it sold 41.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up less than 1 percent from a year earlier. But iPhone revenues rose 20 percent because Apple is getting customers to pay nearly 20 percent more for the devices on average, a trend driven by its flagship $1,000 iPhone X.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sign that the iPhone X, despite its high price, is resonating with consumers,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research.\nApple is also offsetting some slowing growth of its hardware sales with an accelerating business charging customers for apps, data storage and other services. Revenue from those services grew 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the quarter, and Apple Music surpassed Spotify in the quarter as the most popular music-streaming service in North America, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, suggested on the company\u2019s earnings call.\nTotal revenues in the quarter were $53.27 billion, up 17 percent from a year earlier.\nWith the huge profits, Apple is sitting on $243.7 billion in cash, much of which it plans to return to investors. In April, it unveiled plans tobuy back $100 billion in stock. On Tuesday, the company said it had returned $25 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $20 billion in share repurchases.\nBuying back so much stock helps keep its price high, rewarding investors. \u201cThey have so much cash and so much buying power, they can synthetically support the stock. So it\u2019s very hard to bet against,\u201d said Sander Read, chief executive of Lyons Wealth Management. His firm, an investment adviser near Orlando, Fla., has invested roughly $30 million of the $200 million it manages in Apple stock.\nApple\u2019s outlook does have challenges. Arguably no American company has a greater reliance on China for its success, and the growing trade war between the United States and Chinacould threaten its high-flying business.\nApple makes most of its products in China, which is also its third-largest sales market. Mr. Cook said Apple was evaluating a new round of proposed American tariffs on Chinese goods that could hit some Apple products,like the Apple Watch, \u201cand we will be sharing our views of it with the administration.\u201d\nSome Apple executive are also concerned that the tariffs could prompt Chinese officials to hamstring Apple\u2019s business in China as retaliation, The The New York Timesreported in June. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nApple said Tuesday that its revenue in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had increased 19 percent to $9.55 billion, nearly the same rate of growth for its sales in the United States."

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nThe race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer.\nAmazon\u2019s stock hit a high of $1,858.88 on Wednesday after the e-commerce giant announcedmore than 100 million productswere purchased during its Prime Day sale event. The brief rise pushed Amazon\u2019s stock market value to $902 billion \u2014 the first time that it has exceeded $900 billion.\nAmazon\u2019s market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple\u2019s market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006.\nInvestors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple\u2019s.\nBut Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon\u2019s move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon\u2019s gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon\u2019s increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.\nBy comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company\u2019s market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday\u2019s close.\nAmazon\u2019s time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion.\nApple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: What Trump\u2019s Trade War Is Really About",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nEstimable readers! My name is Ray Zhong, and I\u2019m a tech reporter based in Beijing.\nMy patch of the world is rarely out of the news these days; President Trump\u2019strade fighthas made sure of it. But with all the tariffs and talks, it\u2019s easy to forget how this all got started: China wants to build ahigh-tech economy, and the Trump administration says it is doing so using unfair tactics, such as forcing American companies to share their know-how.\nThis is why the White House sounded so galled this week when Beijing responded to Washington\u2019s recent tariffs not by addressing those practices, but by imposingtariffs of its own.\n\u201cWe have been very clear and detailed regarding the specific changes China should undertake,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative,said on Tuesday. \u201cUnfortunately, China has not changed its behavior \u2014 behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk.\u201d\nAs it happens, the week offered a fresh reminder of the kind of behavior Mr. Lighthizer was referring to, in the form of acriminal complaintfiled in California.\nThe defendant: Xiaolang Zhang, a former Apple engineer with the company\u2019scar projectwho was arrested at the airport in San Jose, Calif., while trying to go to China. According to an affidavit from the F.B.I., Mr. Zhang stole company secrets before leaving Apple this spring for a new job at XMotors, a Chinese start-up.\nA well-oiled heist this was not. The F.B.I.\u2019s affidavit said Apple\u2019s security team had found extensive downloads by Mr. Zhang from confidential databases. According to the F.B.I., he was caught on camera entering Apple\u2019s campus on a Saturday evening while on paternity leave, then leaving less than an hour later with some equipment. He transferred sensitive files to his wife\u2019s personal laptop, though he told Apple that he hadn\u2019t forwarded them to anyone else, the F.B.I. said in the court documents.\nMy colleague Paul Mozur recently coveredanother case of corporate theft, one involving a Chinese state-backed company and the American chip maker Micron Technology. The actions that the F.B.I. linked to Mr. Zhang seem far more bumbling. And there\u2019s no sign they were state-sanctioned.\nSuch cases are still worth watching, though, particularly as more Chinese tech companies, XMotors included, set up offices in Silicon Valley.\nThe White House has accused the Chinese government of conducting and supporting cyberattacks to steal information from American companies. But as my colleague Li Yuanwrote recently, China\u2019s high-tech push is being driven as much by hungry companies as by Communist Party leaders. It\u2019s hard to see how higher taxes on Chinese exports are supposed to stop businesses from breaking the rules to get an edge.\nElsewhere this week:\n\u25a0 The Trump administration may think it is merely punishing Chinese economic policies. But officials in Beijing see a campaign to suppress Chinese aspirations, Keyu Jin of the London School of Economics wrote in aFinancial Times op-ed.\n\u25a0 Jeff Ding at Oxford University hastranslated five reportsfrom a Chinese consultancy on the state of play in the country\u2019sartificial intelligence industry. Mr. Ding\u2019s newsletter is a great resource for keeping up to speed on Chinese A.I. policy and strategy. Sign uphere.\n\u25a0 From the department of\u201cOrwellian nonsense\u201d: Applefixed a bugthat was causing some devices to crash when users typed the word \u201cTaiwan\u201d or received messages containing a Taiwanese flag emoji. According toone researcher, the bug was the result of code that prevents the Taiwanese flag from appearing in Chinese users\u2019 emoji menus.\n\u25a0 Tesla, which is stillstruggling to mass-produceits cars in the United States, is opening agiant plant in Shanghai. The rap on Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, is that he overpromises and underdelivers, all while sounding infuriatingly blas\u00e9 about the consequences. But to many in China, Mr. Musk is a fearless dreamer who overcomes failure to do things thatordinary people cannot. Here\u2019sa blog post(in Chinese) that came out after one of Mr. Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 shot a car into space this year.

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nToday marks the start of the latest Allen & Company conference in the sleepy Idaho resort of Sun Valley \u2014 and, as ever, there will be the possibility of deals being struck on the sidelines.\nSome of the biggest names in tech and media, from Jeff Bezos of Amazon to Bob Iger of Disney, will be in attendance. (The nearby airport,as it tends to beat this time of year, will most likely bejammed full of private jets.) They will arrive knowing that conditions are perfect for discussing a new round of deal-making.\nThe conference istightly closed offfrom the public and reporters, and the relaxed atmosphere lends itself to early-stage negotiations. (Warren Buffett once said it was perfect for ABWA, or \u201cacquisitions by walking around.\u201d) The Sun Valley get-together has an impressive track record, as the breeding ground forComcast\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal,Mr. Bezos\u2019 purchase of The Washington PostandDisney\u2019s takeover of ABC/Capital Cities.\nBut what might shake out this year? Here are DealBook\u2019s guesses about which attendees might strike up deal talks in between panel discussions, rounds of golf and drinks in the Sun Valley Lodge bar.\n\u25a0John Malone:The cable mogul is one of the most active deal-makers around. And as telecom giants increasingly look to combine with media properties to gain new sources of income \u2014 and fend off competition from Silicon Valley \u2014 analysts have wondered whether he and his companies, Charter Communications and Liberty Media, are on the hunt for a new property.Among his current interestsare regional sports networks \u2014 some of which would be up for grabsas part of 21st Century Fox\u2019s potential saleto Disney or Comcast \u2014 and Spanish-language outlets.\n\u25a0Masa Son:The SoftBank founder has amassed nearly $100 billion for his Vision Fund, which has invested in everything from Uber to the messaging service Slack to the dog-walking app Wag.Given his rather expansive vision, it\u2019s possible that he could be interested in buying a media company. (He\u2019s currentlypursuing a bidto stage two new soccer tournaments with FIFA, and would like to take control of its gaming and merchandise rights.) Or perhaps he would also like to own all of Slack, after having alreadyinvested in the company. Its C.E.O., Stewart Butterfield, is an invitee as well.\n\u25a0Tim Cook:Apple\u2019s chief has faced questions for years about what to do with the iPhone maker\u2019s enormous cash hoard. (It stood at $163 billion in February.) The company has pledged to take that down to nearly zero \u2014 and one way to do that would be through acquisitions. Given that Mr. Cook and his team are pushing more heavily into content to compete with Netflix and Amazon, now might be the time to broach conversations with any of the media moguls in attendance."

Apple, however, may soonface headwinds outside its controlwith an accelerating trade war between the United States and China. The company assembles many of its products, including iPhones, in China, while also depending on the country as its No. 3 market.\n\u2014 Jack Nicas\nECONOMY\nThe European Union statistics agency will publish an estimate of its economic growth during the second quarter on Tuesday, shedding light on whether trade tensions are taking a toll on growth. President Trump\u2019s tariffs on European steel and aluminumaffect a relatively small sliver of the economy.But Mr. Trump\u2019saggressive stance on trademay have unsettled European business executives and made them reluctant to invest, which would cut into gross domestic product.\n\u2014 Jack Ewing\nECONOMY\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at the end of a two-day meetingon Wednesday.The Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, does not have a news conference scheduled, which means Fed watchers will have to wait to hear his opinion of President Trump\u2019srecent criticismof the Fed\u2019s interest rate increases this year.\n\u2014 Jim Tankersley\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nTesla reports its second-quarter earningson Wednesday,and again the focus will be less on the expected loss than on any update on the number of Model 3 sedans the company has built. The electric-car maker is striving to be able to produce at least5,000 Model 3s per week. The company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said that Tesla will be profitable in the second half of the year if it can reach that number. Tesla built that many in the final seven days of June, but it\u2019s unclear if it has been ableto sustain that level of output.Analysts expect a loss of about $3.50 a share for the quarter. A year ago, the company reported a loss of $2.04 a share.\n\u2014 Neal E. Boudette\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nOn Wednesday, automakers will report new vehicle sales in July in the United States. The market researcher Cox Automotive said it expected sales of1.4 million cars and light trucks, in line with the same period from a year ago. So far this year, new car sales are coming instronger than expected. Sales in the first half of the year are running ahead of the same period in 2017. But Cox said sales could soften in the second half, with both gasoline prices and interest rates on the rise, and some manufacturers reaching their limits on incentives and discounts.\n\u2014 Neal E. Boudette\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nThe German automakers Volkswagen and BMW will report earnings this week, and they will most likely warn about the ill effects of the trade disputes involving the United States on their sales and profits. BMW, which reports on Thursday, faces stiff tariffs on cars it exportsfrom a factory in South Carolinato China, which is retaliating against punitivemeasures enacted by the United States. Volkswagen,which reports on Wednesday, has factories in Tennessee and Mexico and faces higher production costs because of American tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as uncertainty about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\u2014 Jack Ewing\nECONOMY\nThe Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee is widely expected raise the bank rate slightly to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent on Thursday, butweak wage growth and inflation numbershave made the move less certain. A rise could lift the pound, but the currency is also under pressure from concerns aroundBritain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\u2014 Amie Tsang\nECONOMY\nOn Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation\u2019s hiring and unemployment for July. Wall Street analysts are looking for another strong month of growth with payrolls expected to expand by 190,000. The jobless rate is expected to decrease to 3.9 percent; it inched back up to 4 percent in Junebecause a surge of Americans decided to join the labor force, a sign that more people are optimistic about their employment prospects. Wage growth, though, hascontinued to disappoint. Economists are expecting the average hourly wage to climb by 0.3 percent, which would keep the annual year-over-year increase level at 2.7 percent.\n\u2014 Patricia Cohen"

        "title": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Giants Take Their Talent Hunt to Cambridge",
        "fulltext": "CAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 When you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station, you will not see the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel or the turrets atop the Trinity Great Court. The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.\nJust down the block, inside a stone building of its own, Microsoft is designingsome sort of computer chip for artificial intelligence. And if you keep walking, you will soon reach a third building, marked with a powder-blue Apple logo, where engineers are pushingthe boundariesof Siri, the talking digital assistant included with every iPhone.\nFor years, journalists, city planners and other government officials have called this \u201cSilicon Fen,\u201d envisioning the once sleepy outskirts of Cambridge as Britain\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley. The name \u2014 a nod tothe coastal plain, or Fenlands, that surrounds Cambridge\u2014 never quite stuck. But the concept certainly did, so much so that the world\u2019s tech powers have moved in, snapping up engineers and researchers, particularly in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.\nTheir arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThere are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.\nJust across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\n\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.\nBut those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.\nIn London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201d\nOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nIn 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.\nMr. Bishop joined the lab in 1997, just after it was founded. In those days, Microsoft was the one tech giant paying big money to lure top academics into this kind of corporate research. Now, as artificial intelligencetakes center stage at leading tech companies, paying big dollars for academics is common.\nFive years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.\nNeil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.\nMany of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\n\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201d\nLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\n\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201d\nThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.\nIn Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.\nZoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.\nHis colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.\nHis comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.\nVishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\nFor Mr. Chatrath, Prowler shows how acquisitions by foreign companies can spur the creation of new start-ups. A second VocalIQ employee left and recently founded a start-up called PolyAI, which is trying to buildtruly conversational computing systems.\n\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.\nFor others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.\nThe big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\n\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.\nBut some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.\nIan Hogarth trained as a machine learning researcher at Cambridge, founded the live music app Songkick and is now an angel investor in Britain.He arguedthat if DeepMind had remained an independent, it may have grown into the country\u2019s first tech superpower.\nFollowing a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.\nMany have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.\nLast year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley."
