        "title": "Cooling the Economy Without Crushing It",
        "fulltext": "This week, the Federal Reserve will decide on its next move for interest rates. The decision, expected to be announced on Wednesday, will almost certainly be to raise its benchmark rate. The U.S. economy is facing its worst bout of inflation in four decades, and higher interest rates are likely to slow the economy and ease price increases. But how much remains a question.\nMany on Wall Street believe that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates by as much as a full percentage point. If that happens, it would be the first time the Fed has raised rates that much in one meeting since at least the 1980s. The central bank has vowed to do whatever it takes to lower inflation \u2014 much like it did in the 1980s under Paul Volcker.\nThe Fed\u2019s express goal, however, is to cool the economy without crushing it.In anop-ed yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts writes that the Fed\u2019s interest-rate hikes \u201cwon\u2019t address many causes of today\u2019s inflation,\u201d including skyrocketing energy prices. Other signs of economic stress that may keep the Fed from going for a full percentage point increase:\nEarnings slowdown: Many large companies have, in the past few weeks, reported second-quarter profits that have drastically slowed. Earnings from companies in the S&P 500 are on track to grow just 4.6 percent on average from the same period a year ago, which is the lowest in a year and a half. Still, earnings have been a mixed bag and not as grim as previously predicted \u2014 but the season is still in its early innings.\nYield curve: The yield curve is the difference between short-term interest rates, like what it costs to take out a loan for two years, and long-term interest rates, such as what it costs to take out a loan for 10 years. Long-term rates are almost always higher than short-term rates. But recently, that relationship has flipped. Inverted yield curves are a problem. Banks don\u2019t want to lend when they would make more just sitting on their money. That\u2019s why more Fed rate increases, which generally cause short-term interest rates to rise more than longer-term ones, can be a problem.\nLayoffs: Silicon Valley\u2019s world of easy money of the past decade is fading, leading companies tolay off thousands of employees. Since the beginning of the year, some 394 start-ups have let go employees amid a worsening outlook for young companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced site that tracks layoffs at tech start-ups.\nStill, some argue that there is room for interest rates to move higher without causing an economic crash.Peter Berezin, a global strategist at BCA Research, argues that job openings, as well as solid reserves at most large banks, should buffer the economy from a recession even if the Fed raises interest rates. What\u2019s more, the expiration of pandemic-related aid should slow the excess money injected into the U.S. economy.\n\u201cThe odds of recession in the U.S. are lower than widely perceived,\u201d Berezin wrote in a note to clients on Friday. In Europe, on the other hand, the probability is higher, he said.\nCongo will allow auctions of oil and gas blocks, a major step back for efforts to curb global warming.The Democratic Republic of Congo, home to one of the largest old-growth rainforests, is auctioning off vast amounts of land in a push to become\u201cthe new destination for oil investments,\u201dpart of a global shift as the world retreats on fighting climate change in a scramble for fossil fuels. The oil and gas blocks, which will be auctioned by the end of this month, extend into Virunga National Park, the world\u2019s most important gorilla sanctuary, as well astropical peatlandsthatstore vast amounts of carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere and from contributing to global warming.\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg of New York City proposes an overhaul of the Democratic primaries.Under his plan, thebattleground states would have more prominencein the primaries. \u201cThe party\u2019s best hope for success lies in creating a primary calendar that reflects the importance of cities, diversity, open balloting and swing states,\u201d he said in an op-ed yesterday in The Hill.\nThe C.E.O. of China Evergrande resigns after loans come under scrutiny.Once China\u2019s biggest property developer, the company has struggled to pay down debts of more than $300 billion to creditors after the government forced debt-laden real estate firms to curb borrowing. Theresignation of the company\u2019s C.E.O., Xia Haijun, was the latest setback for the embattled developer, which is expected to announce a plan to restructure its debt.\nThe Senate will vote today to advance a package of subsidies and research funding to increase chip production and U.S. competitiveness.The broad bipartisan bill has gained traction as part of efforts tocounter China\u2019s technological and manufacturing dominance. Final passage of the $280 billion package is expected tomorrow or Wednesday.\nAs the Jan. 6 panel\u2019s evidence piles up, conservative media doubles down. Many topconservative media personalities have continued to pusha more sanitized narrative of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, portraying the Capitol Police as villains and alleging the existence of a government plot to criminalize political dissent.\nApple, Amazon and Google (via YouTube) are competing to pay billions for the rights to broadcastthe N.F.L.\u2019s Sunday evening game live on their streaming services. The current broadcaster of the weekly game, DirectTV, reportedly loses about $500 million a year airing the matchup, and has decided not to try to renew its contract with the league. Yet the tech giants, eager to force their streaming businesses into the market for live sports, may pay as much as $2.5 billion a year for the broadcasting rights.\nThe tech giants see live sports as ripe for disruption,report The Times\u2019s Tripp Mickle, Kevin Draper and Benjamin Mullin. Their interest is a thrill for sports leagues, but it\u2019s also a terror for the media companies that have traditionally broadcast live events. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re competing with entities that aren\u2019t playing by the same financial rules,\u201d Bob Iger, the former chief executive and chairman of the Walt Disney Company, which controls ESPN, said, referring to tech companies\u2019 bankroll.\nApple is considered the front-runner. The iPhone maker has made winning the package a priority, even though Amazon, ESPN+ and YouTube also still appear to be in the running. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has met with league officials and influential team owners like Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, and the Kraft family of the New England Patriots, according to three people familiar with the process. Apple declined to comment.\nApple and Amazon are trying to position themselves for a future without cable.Since 2015, traditional pay television has lost a quarter of its subscribers \u2014 about 25 million homes \u2014 as people traded cable packages for apps like Netflix and Hulu, according to MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the industry.\nBut the price of live sports rights is projected to only increase.The biggest media companies, including Disney, Comcast, Paramount and Fox, are expected to spend a combined $24.2 billion for rights in 2024, according to data from MoffettNathanson, nearly double what they spent a decade earlier.\nAnd the interest in live sports is a departure for the streaming industry.For years, many executives agreed with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, who said that his company was not interested in sports or news because it was watched just once \u2014 live \u2014 and never watched again. But many streaming companies are reconsidering as competition for subscribers intensifies, stock prices have tumbled and profitability for many remains out of reach. \u201cIt comes down to a Silicon Valley ego thing,\u201d Daniel Cohen, who leads global media rights consulting for Octagon, a sports agency, told The Times of the high-dollar N.F.L. deal. \u201cI don\u2019t see a road to profitability. I see a road to victory.\u201d\n\u2014 Elon Musk, ina tweetresponding toa report by The Wall Street Journal that he had an affair with the wife of his longtime friend and the Google co-founder Sergey Brin.

Their entity, Libermans Co., holds all the income from their enterprises, as well as debts, assets and profits they may gain, and investments they might make or start in the next three decades.\nHeller writes that the Libermans so far have traded around 3 percent of their futures, which investors have valued at $400 million. The brothers are in conversation with the S.E.C. to list on the stock market and believe they can use this idea as a way to address economic inequality.

        "title": "Will Streaming Save Sports or Kill It?",
        "fulltext": "Sports and TV have thrived together. Our entertainment future will be shaped by whether streaming and sports can repeat that mostly happy partnership.\nMy colleaguesreportedrecently that Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s YouTube may be willing to pay billions of dollars for popular sports like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association to move their games from TV to tech streaming services.\nFor decades, TV companies \u2014 including CBS and ESPN in the United States and Sky in Britain \u2014 have paid sports leagues a bunch of money to be the only place where people could watch games. The TV money has made sports wealthy and influential in entertainment and culture. Airing sports made TV rich and powerful, too.\nToday\u2019s newsletter looks at three questions that would be relevant if tech companies follow the old school TV playbook and go bigger into airing sports online.\n1) Why do tech companies want sports?\nThis is an obvious answer: Companies want to attract subscribers to their video streaming services, and lots of people love sports.\nThere are two unknowns for Silicon Valley bosses. First, no one has proved yet that a bunch of people will sign up and stick with a streaming service to watch six months of baseball games or top-tier European soccer matches. (To be fair, so far, few popular sports are available to watch only online.)\nThe related unknown is whether big tech companies will find it logical to pay sports leagues stupid amounts of money, as old-school TV has.\nThe math may not work as well for streaming companies. Disney collects billions of dollars a year from cable companies to include TV channels like ESPN in their programming lineups, and more from advertising. That\u2019s a huge pile of cash to pay for N.B.A. games, squash or whatever.\nStreaming subscription fees don\u2019t have the same oomph. The biggest streaming company, Netflix, has about the same annual revenue as a relatively small TV company, Paramount Global, which owns the CBS and Comedy Central TV networks and streaming service Paramount+. Streaming is awesome in many ways, but it may not be lucrative enough to sustain the sports industrial complex.\nA counterpoint: Apple, Google and Amazonhave infinite dollarsand can afford to lose money to see if sports draw a bunch of new subscribers. But they also won\u2019t hesitate to ditch sports webcast contracts if they no longer fit corporate goals.\n2) Why do sports leagues want streaming?\nBig-time sports leagues have twosometimes conflicting missions.They want as much money as possible, and they want huge numbers of viewers for games. Tech companies can offer the first one but not necessarily the second.\nFor now, sports on TV have far more viewers than sports on the internet. It\u2019s puzzling, actually. Kevin Draper, a sports reporter for The New York Times, told me that when the same N.F.L. game airs simultaneously on the Fox television network and on Amazon Prime\u2019s streaming service, the viewership on Fox is many times larger. During the Super Bowl,about 90 percent of viewerswatch on boring old TV rather than online.\nThis is a dilemma for sports executives. They\u2019re thrilled that Apple, Amazon and Google might rain cash on them to stream sports. They\u2019re also anxious that streaming services might reduce sports viewership, which could make their leagues, teams and players worth far less.\nOdds are that sports leagues will take the big bucks from the tech companies \u2014 assuming the money is there. Or they\u2019ll hedge their bets and keep the most popular stuff on TV and sell streaming companies the lower-profile games.\n3) What does this mean for us?\nProbably higher streaming bills.\nAnyone who pays for TV \u2014 whether you watch sports or not \u2014 is footing the cost when ESPN or CBS pays for the rights to air college football games or March Madness basketball. Those sports costs have only gone up over time.\nThat has made sports a double-edged sword in entertainment. Games are the most popular TV programming by far, and they\u2019re a big reason that Americans keep paying for cable or satellite TV. But the increasing cost of sports is also persuadingpeople to ditch TV service.\nApple, YouTube and Amazon can afford to spend billions of dollars on sports without raising subscription prices for their streaming services. But hahahahahaha. If programming costs a lot more, streaming subscription prices likely will, too.\nI don\u2019t know what will happen next. I can sketch out a scenario in which streaming services have a long marriage of mutual benefit with sports as conventional TV did for decades. This could be great for fans, team owners and players, too.\nI can also imagine a sports and streaming death spiral. If people grow tired of big streaming bills for sports, then leagues have less money and fewer fans.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nMark Zuckerberg is eager (or desperate) to change his company fast:My colleague Mike Isaactakes us insideZuckerberg\u2019s project to steer Meta through a difficult phase.\nRelated: Kylie Jenner doesn\u2019t like the new Instagram:She\u2019s one of the app\u2019s biggest celebrities, andcomplained about Instagram\u2019s TikTok-like redesignwith posts that appear based on computerized assessments of what people might like.

        "title": "Big Tech and the Fed",
        "fulltext": "The long-booming bottom lines of major tech companies are all of a sudden smaller than expected. That might be a good thing. Big Tech sailed through the pandemic with its profits mostly intact. The fact that some firms\u2019 results are now flagging could be a positive sign for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to engineer a slowdown as it fights the nation\u2019s worst bout of inflation in four decades.\nThe big question for investors, and perhaps the Fed, is whether the profits of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and the other tech giants, along with corporate America in general, have fallen enough.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, kicked off what appears to be a disappointing roundof quarterly reportsfor the U.S.\u2019s largest tech companies yesterday.Meta will release its results this afternoon, with Apple and Amazon rounding out Big Tech\u2019s earnings announcements tomorrow.\nMicrosoft\u2019s profits, while below expectations, were still up.Sales of its signature software products, like Office,rose 13 percent. Its cloud services were up 40 percent. And LinkedIn, the professional social network Microsoft bought in 2016, grew 26 percent from a year ago, continuing to benefit from the tightest job market in decades.\nAlphabet\u2019s sales rose 13 percent.In another good sign for the economy, the jump was driven by better-than-expected sales in its core Google search engine business, whileresults were mixed elsewhere. A jump in expenses and an exit from its Russian-related businesses caused profits to slump 14 percent.\nThe results were positive enough for investors.Alphabet\u2019s shares rose nearly 5 percent on the earnings news to $110. Microsoft\u2019s shares jumped $10, or nearly 4 percent, to $262. Executives at both companies said they saw evidence of a weaker economy. \u201cWe are not immune to what is happening in the macro broadly,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told analysts that a pullback in spending by some advertisers reflected \u201cuncertainty about a number of factors.\u201d\nFew are betting that the earnings reports will change the Fed\u2019s approach.Its policymakers are meeting this week, and they are widely expected to continue raising benchmark interest rates. While central bankers \u201cwill likely acknowledge a recent weakening in economic momentum, the Fed will likely feel the need to appear resolute in battling inflation until there are clear signs that it is abating,\u201d wrote David Kelly, the chief global strategist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note to clients earlier this week.\nKraken, the crypto exchange, is under investigation for possible sanctions violations.The Treasury Department is looking into whetherKraken illegally allowed users in Iran and elsewhere to buy and sell digital tokens. Shares of Coinbase, a larger crypto exchange, plunged yesterday after reports thatthe S.E.C. was investigatingwhether it allowed trading in unregistered securities. Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark funds reportedlydumped Coinbase sharesyesterday for the first time this year.\nAntitrust legislation aimed at Big Tech may be off the table for now.Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told donors at a Capitol Hill fund-raiser yesterday that the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which he had promised to bring to a vote this summer,lacks the support neededto get it to the Senate floor, Bloomberg reported. The bill\u2019s bipartisan backers have beenpressuring Schumerto act fast, before midterm elections that could change the balance of power in Congress.\nOne America News, once a dependable Trump promoter, is struggling to survive.The network is being dropped by major carriers and faces a wave of defamation lawsuitsfor its outlandish stories about the 2020 election. OAN\u2019s most recent blow is from Verizon, which will stop carrying the network on its Fios television service this week. It is now available to only a few thousand people who subscribe to regional cable providers.\nTeva Pharmaceuticals reaches a tentative $4.25 billion settlement over opioids.The proposed settlement, which is with some 2,500 local governments, states and tribes, would end thousands of lawsuits againstone of the largest producers of the painkillers during the height of the opioid epidemic.\nFlorida\u2019s largest utility secretly funded a website that attacked its critics.Florida Power & Light bankrolled and controlled The Capitolist, a news site aimed at Florida lawmakers, through intermediaries from an Alabama consulting firm,an investigation by The Miami Herald found. The site claimed to be independent, but it advocated rate hikes and legislative favors in efforts that were directed by top executives at the utility.\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, slashed its support for shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues this year, backing only 24 percent of such resolutions in the proxy season that ended in June, down from 43 percent in the previous period. The firm, which has long led the conscious investing movement, saidthis year\u2019s proposalswere \u201cless supportable\u201d and cited newregulatory guidancethat opened the door to a broader range of policy-related proposals.\nThe firm has criticized overly \u201cprescriptive\u201d resolutions.In a May memo, BlackRock signaled that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine was straining global energy supplies and shifting its calculations. \u201cMany climate-related shareholder proposals sought to dictate the pace of companies\u2019 energy transition plans despite continued consumer demand,\u201d wrote the firm\u2019s global head of investment stewardship, Sandy Boss. She noted that shareholders generally supported fewer environmental and social proposals this year as well, voting for 27 percent of resolutions, down from 36 percent in the previous proxy period.\nOpposition to E.S.G. is mounting.The environmental, social and governance investment push has been labeled \u201cwoke capitalism\u201d by critics and isunder firefrom executives like Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk,major investorslike Bill Ackman andRepublican politicians. In a speech yesterday, former Vice President Mike Pence, a possible 2024 hopeful, said that big government and big business were together advancing a \u201cpernicious woke agenda.\u201d\nE.S.G. supporters say critics may have a point.Andrew Behar, C.E.O. of the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, agrees that many supposed E.S.G. investments don\u2019t reflect true sustainability \u2014 with ever more capital directed toward the idea and many funds failing to live up to their promises. Behar argued that more corporate disclosures \u2014 which anti-E.S.G. groups oppose \u2014 would help to ensure that green investing actually works. He argues that critics also ignore a key financial incentive driving investor interest: knowing and lowering thecosts of environmental issuesthroughout company operations, including risks from changing weather and the transition to more sustainable models. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an E.S.G. problem,\u201d Behar told DealBook. \u201cWe have a naming problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Fontaine Weyman, a 43-year-old songwriter from Charleston, S.C., on changing her coffee habits. Many Americans are dealing withthe fastest inflation of their adult livesacross a broad range of goods and services.\nInstagram responded yesterday to criticism from some of its most popular users, including Kylie Jenner, about new features that made it more like its top rival, TikTok, the fast-growing video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.\nAdam Mosseri, Instagram\u2019s head, said that it was experimenting with several changes,and that he knew users were unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet good,\u201d he said of some of the tweaksin a video post. He stressed Instagram\u2019s commitment to photos, the app\u2019s original focus, but said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest, I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.\u201d\nReels, a short-video product, is one of the six main investment priorities at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram,according to an internal memo last month from Chris Cox, the company\u2019s chief product officer. Cox said that users had doubled the amount of time they spent on Reels year over year, and that Meta would prioritize boosting ads in Reels \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d Last week, Instagram announced that almost all videos in the app would be posted as Reels.\nThe changes come as Meta heads into a new phase.Mark Zuckerberg, its founder and chief executive, has cut costs, reshuffled his leadership team and made clear that low-performing employees will be let go,writes The Times\u2019s Mike Isaac. \u201cRealistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Zuckerbergsaid on a calllate last month.In recent months, profit at Metahas fallenand revenue has slowed as the company has spent lavishly on augmented and virtual reality projects, and as the economic slowdown has hurt its advertising business.\nThe high-profile complaints about Instagram\u2019s revamp started in recent days, when Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul with 361 million Instagram followers,shared an imageon the site that read: \u201cMake Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\u201d\n\u201cPRETTY PLEASE,\u201d Kim Kardashian, Jenner\u2019s half sister and the seventh-most-followed Instagram user, echoed in a later post. Yesterday, Chrissy Teigen, a model and author with 39 million followers, responded to Mosseri in atweet, saying, \u201cwe don\u2019t wanna make videos Adam lol.\u201d\nCompanies have reason to listen when social media stars speak up,writes The Times\u2019s Kalley Huang. In 2018, after Snapchat overhauled its interface, Jennertweeted: \u201csooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore?

        "title": "The Default Tech Settings You Should Turn Off Right Away",
        "fulltext": "There\u2019s a catchy saying going around with a valuable lesson about our personal technology:The devil is in the defaults.\nThe saying refers to the default settings that tech companies embed deep in the devices, apps and websites we use. These settings typically make us share data about our activities and location. We can usually opt out of this data collection, but the companies make the menus and buttons hard to notice, likely in the hope that we don\u2019t immediately tweak them.\nApple, Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft generally want us to leave some default settings on, purportedly to train their algorithms and catch bugs, which then make their products easier for us to use. But unnecessary data sharing isn\u2019t always in our best interest.\nConsider how several whistle-blowers confessed in 2018 that they had listened in on Apple\u2019sSiri recordingsandAmazon\u2019s Alexa activationsthat inadvertently recorded couples having sex. The recent reversal of Roe v. Wade also underscored themany ways that women can be trackedthrough their personal tech when seeking options to terminate pregnancies.\nSo with every tech product we use, it\u2019s important to take time to peruse the many menus, buttons and switches to pare down the data we share. Here\u2019s a streamlined guide to many of the default settings that I and other tech writers always change.\nWith iPhones, users can open the settings app and enter the privacy menu to changehow they share dataabout their app use and location. (Apple technically asks people to opt in to some of these settings when they activate a new iPhone, but these steps can easily be missed. These tips would disable the data sharing.)\nSelect Tracking and toggle off Allow Apps to Request to Track. This tells all apps to not share data with third parties for marketing purposes.\nSelect Apple Advertising and toggle off Personalized Ads so that Apple can\u2019t use information about you to serve targeted ads on its App Store, Apple News and Stocks.\nSelect Analytics & Improvements and toggle off Share iPhone Analytics to prevent the iPhone from sending device data to Apple to improve its products.\nSelect Location Services, tap System Services and toggle off iPhone Analytics and Routing & Traffic to prevent the device from sharing geodata with Apple for improving Apple Maps.\nGoogle products, including Android phones and web services like Google search, YouTube and Google Maps, are tied to Google accounts, and the control panel for tweaking data management is on the websitemyactivity.google.com.\nFor all three categories \u2014 Web & App Activity, Location History and YouTube History \u2014 set auto-delete to delete activity older than three months.

In the near term, it can still make helpful recommendations based on recent searches.\nA bonus tip for Android phones comes from Ryne Hager, an editor of the tech blog \u201cAndroid Police\u201d: Newer versions of Android offer people the ability to share an approximate location rather than their precise location with apps. For many apps, like weather software, sharing approximate data should be the way to go, and precise geodata should be shared only with software that needs it to work properly, like maps apps.\nMeta\u2019s most important settings can be reached through theprivacy checkup toolinside the settings menu. These are some important tweaks to prevent snooping by employers and marketers:\nFor \u201cWho can see what you share,\u201d select \u201cOnly me\u201d for people with access to your friends list and pages you follow, and select \u201cFriends\u201d for who can see your birthday.\nFor \u201cHow people can find you on Facebook,\u201d choose \u201cOnly me\u201d for people who can look you up via email or phone number.\nFor \u201cYour ad preferences on Facebook,\u201d toggle off the switches for relationship status, employer, job title and education. This way, marketers can\u2019t serve targeted ads based on this information.\nAmazon offers some control over how information is shared through its website and products like Alexa and Ring cameras. There are two settings that I highly recommend turning off:\nAmazon last year launchedAmazon Sidewalk, a program that automatically makes newer Amazon products share internet connections with other devices nearby. Critics say Sidewalk could open doors for bad actors to gain access to people\u2019s data.\nTo disable it for an Echo speaker, open the Amazon Alexa app and tap More in the lower right-hand side of the screen. Inside the settings, tap Account Settings, choose Amazon Sidewalk and toggle Sidewalk to the off position.\nFor a Ring camera, in the Ring app, tap the three-lined icon in the upper left and then tap Control Center. Tap Amazon Sidewalk, and slide the button to the off position.\nOn Amazon\u2019s website, some shopping lists \u2014 like items saved on a wish list \u2014 are shared with the public by default, which can be revealing information. Visit theYour Listspage and set each shopping list to private.\nWindows PCs come with a host of data-sharing settings turned on by default to help Microsoft, advertisers and websites learn more about us. The switches to toggle those settings off can be found by opening the settings menu and clicking on Privacy and security and then General.\nYet the worst default setting on Windows may have nothing to do with privacy. Whenever Kimber Streams, a Wirecutter editor, tests new laptops, one of their first steps is to open the sound menu and select No Sounds to mute the many annoying chimes that play whenever something goes wrong with Windows."

        "title": "Apple Agrees to $50 Million Settlement Over Butterfly Keyboard Complaints",
        "fulltext": "Apple agreed on Monday to pay a $50 million settlement on a class-action lawsuit over so-called butterfly keyboards, a component of some MacBook laptops that left many users fuming in key-smashing frustration over typing failures.\nThe butterfly keyboard, a thin model that aimed to provide more precision, ended up not being as graceful as the flapping wings of the nectar-seeking creature. Many customers complained that characters were repeated when pressed or didn\u2019t show up on their screens at all. Some said the devices hadkeys that felt stickyand didn\u2019t respond consistently.\nThe typing meltdowns motivated a class-action lawsuit filed in 2018, which led to the settlement filed on Monday night after four years of litigation in the San Jose Division of the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. Apple said the agreement did not represent an admission that it was at fault.\nU.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila still has to approve the proposal, Simon S. Grille, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said.\n\u201cPlaintiffs are pleased to submit for court approval their $50 million settlement with Apple that would resolve many years of litigation over the MacBook butterfly keyboard,\u201d Mr. Grille and Steven A. Schwartz, a plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cMacBook purchasers across the country are eligible to participate.\u201d\nAs a result of the agreement, Apple could soon make amends to MacBook users who got repairs on a laptop with a defective butterfly keyboard from 2015 to 2019. Customers said the company knew about the defect on these MacBooks; Apple offered free repairs to customers with the defective keyboards in 2018 and then phased them out.\nThe company has proposed to pay amounts ranging from $50 to $395 to customers who were affected.\nThe lawsuit represents purchasers of about 15 million computers, the court documents said.\nApple \u201cvigorously denies liability,\u201d the court documents said. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThe proposed settlement to resolve this case is not an admission of guilt or wrongdoing of any kind by Apple,\u201d the agreement said.\nAnyone in the United States who received repairs for keyboard issues for MacBooks purchased from 2015 to 2017, MacBook Pros from 2016 to 2019 and MacBook Airs from 2018 to 2019 can claim a share of the settlement. The company will consider customers who received replacements of a \u201ctopcase\u201d \u2014 which includes the battery, the touch-sensitive pointing device known as a trackpad, the speakers and the keyboard \u2014 or of a \u201ckeycap,\u201d which refers to the covers for letters on the keyboard.\n\u201cAll settlement class members who went to Apple or an authorized service provider and received a \u2018topcase replacement\u2019 or a \u2018keycap replacement\u2019 within four years after the date they purchased their class computer are eligible for a cash payment,\u201d the court documents said.\nCustomers will be sorted into one of three groups, depending on the scale of repairs their devices received at the time.\nThe first group includes people who obtained two or more topcase replacements, the court documents said. They will be paid a maximum of $395.\nThe second group \u2014 users who received a topcase replacement that didn\u2019t resolve their issues \u2014 will receive up to $125. The third group includes people who replaced a keycap but not the entire topcase. They will be eligible to up to $50.\nMany customers will be contacted by Apple, but people can also submit claims with documentation proving that repairs were done.\nPlaintiffs representing the consumers intend to apply for awards of up to $5,000 each from the settlement money, the court documents said.\nApple introduced the troubled keyboards with an \u201call-new MacBook\u201d in 2015. The butterfly referred to a novel switching mechanism that expanded like wings under the keys, differing from the more common and thicker switches shaped like scissors. The keyboard was billed as\u201c34 percent thinner\u201d and \u201cfour times more stable\u201dthan the earlier scissor model. But it also seemed prone to capturing dust and experiencing other problems. Soon the customer complaints began.\nOver the next five years, Apple tried to modify the keyboard in updated models before abandoning it completely by 2020, when all of its laptops includeda redesigned and well-received keyboardthat restored the scissor switches.\nJesus Jim\u00e9nezcontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "No boom can last forever, even for the technology industry\u2019s most affluent companies. Investors punished the biggest tech companies earlier this year, erasing $2 trillion in market value over fears the industry would falter in the face of rising inflation and a slowing economy.\nBut this week, as the United Statesreported that economic outputfell for the second straight quarter,Microsoft,Alphabet,AmazonandAppleposted sales and profits that showed their businesses have the dominance and diversity to defy the economic woes hurting smaller companies.\nMicrosoft and Amazon proved that their lucrative cloud businesses were continuing to expand even as the economy cools. Alphabet\u2019s subsidiary, Google, demonstrated that search advertisements remained in demand among travel companies and retailers. And Apple papered over a downturn in its device business by increasing its sales of apps and subscription services.\nCollectively, it was a sign that tech may have already hit a bottom and is beginning to rebound, said Dave Harden, the chief investment officer at Summit Global, a firm near Salt Lake City with about $2 billion under investment that counts Apple among its holdings.\n\u201cThese guys are still delivering,\u201d Mr. Harden said. \u201cThey\u2019re acting responsibly and navigating through a choppy period.\u201d\nThe better-than-feared results lifted the companies\u2019 share prices and provided a jolt to the stock market,even as AlphabetandMicrosoft fell shortof Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nThe results made clear that the companies are not immune to problems such as supply-chain disruptions, rising costs and shifts in customer spending. But their giant businesses are not as vulnerable to the various challenges sweeping across the economy as smaller companies likeTwitterandSnap, the owner of Snapchat.\nDuring calls with analysts, the companies\u2019 chief executives cautioned investors about the months ahead, using words like \u201cchallenges\u201d and \u201cuncertainty.\u201d Concerns about the economy are leading some of them, including Alphabet, to slow the pace of hiring and take other precautions, but none have said they plan to begin making layoffs.\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, cast the slowing economy as an opportunity, saying the company would sharpen its focus and \u201cbe more disciplined as we go forward.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in growth mode, it\u2019s tough to always take the time to do all the readjustments you need to do and moments like this give us a chance.\u201d\nIn what many investors interpreted as a testament to the industry\u2019s optimism, Microsoft said it expected double-digit revenue growth for the next year, and Amazon said it expected sales to increase at least 13 percent in the current quarter.\nSatya Nadella, the chief executive officer at Microsoft, said the company would invest over the year to take share and build its businesses, while Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s finance chief, said it would have more product in stock and speedier deliveries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a recession forecast,\u201d said Sean Stannard-Stockton, president of Ensemble Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm with $1.3 billion under management. \u201cIf we do avoid a severe recession, it\u2019s clear that a lot of these businesses will see growth rate pick back up.\u201d\nThough Apple and Alphabet didn\u2019t provide guidance, the companies bought back tens of billions of dollars in stock during the period. Apple\u2019s purchase of $21.7 billion and Alphabet\u2019s purchase of $15.2 billion testified to the companies\u2019 belief that their businesses will continue to grow in the years ahead.\nMeta, the company formerly known as Facebook, was an outlier among the biggest tech companies, reporting its first decline in quarterly revenue since going public a decade ago. Its woes were an outgrowth of rising competition from TikTok, which has sapped it of users and advertisers, and challenges from privacy changes on iPhones implemented by Apple.\nThe advertising market is forecast to grow 8.4 percent this year and 6.4 percent in 2023, according to GroupM, a market research firm. Facebook\u2019s sales growth last year, when quarterly sales jumped 56 percent, made it \u201cimplausible to keep growing,\u201d said Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM.\nSimilar challenges have hit the e-commerce market. Convinced that a surge in online orders during the pandemic represented a fundamental change in the way people shopped, Amazon advanced an ambitious plan to open dozens of new warehouses. But as sales have cooled \u2014 with the number of items it sold up just 1 percent in the most recent quarter \u2014 it has reversed course and decided to close, delay or cancel at least 35 warehouse openings.\nAmazon\u2019s smaller e-commerce rival, Shopify, said it wouldcut about 10 percent of its staff. Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, said this year would be \u201ca transition year in which e-commerce is largely reset\u201d to the growth levels it recorded before Covid-19.\nApple\u2019s biggest obstacle came from its dependency on China to manufacture most of its devices. In April, the company said it would lose about $4 billion in sales because of factory shutdowns in Shanghai, where it manufactures iPads and Macs. But it still managed to increase its sales of iPhones in the period by 3 percent and set a quarterly record for the number of people who traded Android smartphones for iPhones.\nTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said that Apple saw \u201ca cocktail of headwinds,\u201d including the supply constraints, the strengthening dollar that increased device prices overseas and the slowing global economy.\n\u201cWhen you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up,\u201d Mr. Cook said. He added that the company would invest through a downturn, but be \u201cdeliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Big Tech Is Making a Big Play for Live Sports",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 More than a decade after Apple disrupted the music industry and Amazon upended retail, the tech heavyweights have set their sights on a new arena ripe for change: live sports.\nEmboldened by their deep pockets and eager to boost viewership of their streaming-subscription services, Apple and Amazon have thrust themselves into negotiations for media rights held by the National Football League, Major League Baseball, Formula One racing and college conferences.\nThey are competing to replace DirecTV for the rights to N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, a package the league wants to sell for more than $2.5 billion annually, about $1 billion more than it currently costs, according to five people familiar with the process. Eager not to miss out, Google has also offered a bid from YouTube for the rights beginning in 2023, two people familiar with the offer said.\nThe tech companies\u2019 interest is a thrill for sports leagues and a terror for media companies that fear competition from rivals that collect tens of billions of dollars from dominant positions in other businesses. Last year, sports accounted for 95 of the 100 most viewed programs on television.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re competing with entities that aren\u2019t playing by the same financial rules,\u201d said Bob Iger, the former chief executive and chairman of the Walt Disney Company, which controls ESPN, referring to tech companies\u2019 bankroll.\nThe N.F.L. Sunday Ticket package \u2014 which shows out-of-market Sunday N.F.L. games that aren\u2019t being shown on local television \u2014 is available because DirecTV chose not to bid. It has been losing as much as $500 million annually on the package, though it has also benefited from a reliable base of about 2 million subscribers.\nApple is considered the front-runner, according to a dozen people in the sports, media and tech industries. But a final deal has been delayed by negotiations over a concurrent sale of N.F.L. media assets, including the NFL Network, RedZone channel and NFL+, a new subscription service that provides access to live games on mobile devices.\nApple has made winning the package a priority. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has met with league officials and influential team owners like Jerry Jones, who owns the Dallas Cowboys, and the Kraft family, who own the New England Patriots, according to three people familiar with the process. Apple declined to comment.\nStill, Amazon, ESPN+ and YouTube, which explored a bid for the rights in 2014, remain in the hunt, some of these people said. Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.\u2019s chief media and business officer, said in a statement that the league expects to finalize a deal in the coming months. \u201cA number of companies are in strong position to potentially land Sunday Ticket, but we still have a ways to go in this process,\u201d Mr. Rolapp added.\nSome details of the negotiations have been previouslyreported by the SportsBusiness Journal.\nFans will still be able to access all the games on Sunday, regardless of who wins the rights, but they will probably pay a premium to add the service to their Apple, Amazon, ESPN+ or YouTube service, some of the dozen people said. It is not yet clear if that premium would be more or less than the $294 that DirecTV charges for a year, they added.\nApple and Amazon are trying to position themselves for a future without cable. Since 2015, traditional pay television has lost a quarter of its subscribers \u2014 about 25 million homes \u2014 as people traded cable packages for apps like Netflix and Hulu, according to MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the industry.\nBut the price of live sports rights is only projected to increase. The biggest media companies, including Disney, Comcast, Paramount and Fox, are expected to spend a combined $24.2 billion for rights in 2024, according to data from MoffettNathanson, nearly double what they spent a decade earlier.\nThe fragmenting of a decades-old distribution model has created an opportunity for Apple and Amazon. The companies want to expand deeper into media by selling subscriptions to Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime. Besides containing their own exclusive shows and sports, those services double as portals selling additional streaming offerings like Starz and HBO Max, which pay Apple and Amazon 15 percent or more of each subscription sold.\nAmazon generates more than $3 billion annually from third-party subscription sales, according to estimates by the investment bank BMO Capital Markets. To make the business model work, Apple and Amazon must attract more viewers, and sports are the most powerful draw in media. The companies may be willing to lose money on Sunday Ticket to expose new customers to other parts of their business, the same calculation that DirecTV historically made.\nThe challenge for Apple and Amazon will be persuading somewhat skeptical sports leagues that they can produce high-quality broadcasts, flawlessly stream games for millions of concurrent viewers, and maintain sports fans accustomed to flipping between games with a remote \u2014 not navigating to a new app.\nTheir interest marks a departure for the streaming industry. For years, many executives agreed with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, who said that his company was not interested in sports or news because it was watched just once, live, and never watched again.\nBut many streaming companies are reconsidering as competition for subscribers intensifies, stock prices have tumbled and profitability \u2014 for many \u2014 remains out of reach.\nTheir newfound interest in sports was on display last Monday during M.L.B.\u2019s Home Run Derby at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles where executives from Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook socialized with sports leaders, crashing a party historically monopolized by the television industry.\nTech\u2019s dominance of live sports is not a foregone conclusion. Many of the most sought after rights are under contract to broadcasters for a decade or more. Leagues have favored selling tertiary packages to streamers, wary of entrusting them with marquee properties like \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d because traditional television still offers the biggest audiences.\nReaching large audiences is crucial for leagues, which look to court the broadest possible fan base to ensure the long-term viability of their sports.\n\u201cThe death knell of the cable bundle is largely exaggerated,\u201d said Gerry Cardinale, the founder and managing partner of Redbird Capital, which has made many sports-media investments. \u201cIt\u2019s the best place to get a one-stop-shop offering of as many sports as are available.\u201d\nApple started its $4.99 streaming service, Apple TV+, in 2019 and has an estimated 16.3 million paid subscribers in the United States, according to Antenna, an analytics firm for video on-demand services. Amazon claims more than 200 million subscribers to Amazon Prime, which began in 2006 as primarily a faster shipping service and later added on-demand movies. Today, some customers pay $8.99 a month for access to Prime Video only.\nThe tech companies have been willing to pay a premium to add sports to their services. Over the past year, Apple agreed to more than double Major League Soccer\u2019s annual rights payments with a 10-year, $2.5 billion deal for the global rights to 1,000 games. It also committed about $85 million annually for a new package of two weekly Friday night M.L.B. games.\nAmazon agreed to pay $1 billion a year for Thursday night N.F.L. games, a 50 percent increase from the previous deal with Fox. It also bid more than $100 million a year for rights to Formula One racing in the United States in a negotiation it lost to ESPN, which renewed the rights for $75 million, a 15-fold increase from the prior contract, according toSportsBusiness Journal.\nFor all their disruptive potential, though, Apple and Amazon have yet to win a marquee rights package in the United States. That is reminiscent of 20 years ago, when sports leagues feared they would lose viewers by shifting games from network television to cable. But the change gradually became standard.\nTraditional television companies are trying to stave off Apple and Amazon by starting their own streaming-subscription services. Last year Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal,shuttered NBC Sports Networkto bolster its USA channel and to encourage people to pay for Peacock, where it exclusively aired some English Premier League soccer games. Similarly, ESPNstruck a deal with the National Hockey Leagueto televise some games on its ESPN+ service, and CBS has shown marquee soccer games on Paramount+.\nBut those services have a fraction of the more than 100 million cable subscribers the media companies once reached. As a result, the bulk of sports programming goes on traditional pay-TV channels where they can guarantee leagues and advertisers larger audiences.\nThe National Basketball Association will be the first major test of the new competitive landscape. Its agreements with ESPN and Turner run through the 2024-25 season. Most sports and media executives predict that the league will stick with traditional broadcasters for most of its games, while carving out some small portion of rights for a tech company.\n\u201cIt hedges them for the future and exposes the product to new audiences,\u201d said George Pyne, founder of the sports private equity firm, Bruin Capital, and the former chief operating officer of NASCAR. \u201cThey can still have a long-term relationship with network partners but dip their toe in with new media.\u201d\nUntil then, the best opportunities for Apple and Amazon may be overseas \u2014 where Amazon has been active for years \u2014 becauseEuropean soccer leagues resell their rights every two to three years. Amazon recently scooped up rights to Europe\u2019s top tournament, the UEFA Champions League, in Britain, Germany and Italy. It also has rights to France\u2019s Ligue 1, which it offers to Prime Video subscribers for annual fee of about $90, and the English Premier League.\nMedia companies will be pressured to expand geographically to compete, said Daniel Cohen, who leads global media rights consulting for Octagon, a sports agency. Television broadcasters could also team up to pool their financial firepower, or buy each other outright, to compete with tech giants willing to pay billions for rights like N.F.L. Sunday Ticket.\n\u201cIt comes down to a Silicon Valley ego thing,\u201d Mr. Cohen said of the high-dollar N.F.L. deal. \u201cI don\u2019t see a road to profitability. I see a road to victory.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s influential design leader, exited the company in 2019, Tim Cook, its chief executive, reassured customers that Mr. Ive, the man who gave the world candy-colored computers, would work exclusively with the company for many years.\nNot anymore.\nMr. Ive and Apple have agreed tostop working together, according to two people with knowledge of their contractual agreement, ending a three-decade run during which the designer helped define every rounded corner of an iPhone and guided development of its only new product category in recent years, the Apple Watch.\nWhen Mr. Ive left Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveFrom, the iPhone maker signed a multiyear contract with him valued at more than $100 million. That made Apple his firm\u2019s primary client, people with knowledge of the agreement said.\nThe deal restricted Mr. Ive from taking on work that Apple found competitive and ensured that the designer would inform the development of future products, such asan augmented-reality headset that it is expected to ship next year, the people said.\nIn recent weeks, with the contract coming up for renewal, the parties agreed not to extend it. Some Apple executives had questioned how much the company was paying Mr. Ive and had grown frustrated after several of its designers left to join Mr. Ive\u2019s firm. And Mr. Ive wanted the freedom to take on clients without needing Apple\u2019s clearance, these people said.\nThrough a spokeswoman, Mr. Ive, 55, declined to comment. Apple also declined to comment.\nBefore leaving Apple in June 2019, Mr. Ive had grown disillusioned as Mr. Cook made the increasingly enormous company focused more on operations than on big design leaps, according to more than a dozen people who worked closely with Mr. Ive. The designer shifted to a part-time role as Mr. Cook focused on selling more software and services.\nIn July 2019, Mr. Cook called news coverage of Mr. Ive\u2019s frustrations at Apple \u201cabsurd\u201d and said it \u201cdistorts relationships, decisions and events.\u201d\nMr. Cook\u2019s strategy has been validated by investors who have added $1.5 trillion to Apple\u2019s market valuation in just over two years, even as some analysts have chided it for the lull in its introduction of revolutionary devices.\nJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, will continue to oversee the company\u2019s design teams, with industrial design being led by Evans Hankey and software design being led by Alan Dye. Apple\u2019s product marketing team, led by Greg Joswiak, the senior vice president of marketing, has assumed a central role in product choices.\nMr. Ive\u2019s firm, LoveFrom, will continue to work with clients including Airbnb and Ferrari, and Mr. Ive will continue his personal work with Sustainable Markets Initiative, the nonprofit run by Prince Charles that focuses on climate change.\nBorn and raised outside London, Mr. Ive joined Apple in 1992 and rose to lead its design team. The company was on the brink of bankruptcy in 1997 when Steve Jobs tasked Mr. Ive\u2019s team withdesigning the iMac. The bulbous, translucent computer became, at the time, the fastest-selling desktop in history. It restored Apple\u2019s business and turned Mr. Ive into Mr. Jobs\u2019s closest collaborator.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just a designer,\u201d Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. \u201cHe has more operational power than anyone at Apple, except me.\u201d\nMr. Ive also developed theiPod\u2019s white earbuds, which inspired Apple\u2019s dancing silhouette advertising campaign, and he supported the creation of the iPhone\u2019s touch-screen technology.\nAfter Mr. Jobs\u2019s death from cancer in 2011, Mr. Ive spearheaded the development of the Apple Watch. The product failed to fulfill initial sales expectations, but it created a wearables business that last year generated $38 billion in revenue.\nIn 2015, Mr. Ive approached Mr. Cook about leaving Apple, according to four people familiar with the conversation. The designer was exhausted from building the consensus required to produce the Apple Watch, these people said. Mr. Cook agreed to let Mr. Ive work part time.\nFour years later, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook announced the designer would leave Apple to create LoveFrom. In a statement at the time, Mr. Cook said, \u201cI\u2019m happy that our relationship continues to evolve, and I look forward to working with Jony long into the future.\u201d"

        "title": "Who Will Make Apple Fashionable Now?",
        "fulltext": "So Jony Ive, the former Apple chief design officer and consultant, and the man most responsible for the visual allure of Apple products \u2014 the man who helped transform computers and phones into objects of desire, who made them more than mere vectors of functionality, but rather badges of identity \u2014 and his erstwhile employer havereportedly agreedto sever their last ties.\nWhat does this mean for the \u201cmixed reality\u201d headset, that doorway to the metaverse worn over the eyes that, rumor has it, Apple could release in the second quarter of next year? What does it mean, in other words, for those of us whose willingness to engage with alternate reality could be transformed by such a device?\nAfter all, if ever a company could solve the problem of how to design a piece of equipment that would make you want to put a contraption on your face that would allow you entry to another world while your body existed in this one, it would be Apple.\nIf ever a company could surmount the precedent of Google Glass and even Oculus to make a wearable computer that didn\u2019t look like a computer, it would be the company that had done it with laptops, music, earphones and, above all, the smartphone. If ever a brand could solve the challenge of making entry to the metaverse fashionable \u2014 a different problem, after all, then making fashion for the metaverse but one that is just as crucial to making the metaverse meaningful (and accessible) \u2014 odds were, it would be Apple.\nExcept maybe not anymore.\nWithout Mr. Ive, is the time of Apple as the bridge between hard and soft wear finally, truly, coming to an end? Are we at a tipping point between old Apple and new \u2014 between Apple as it was and a different Apple as it could be \u2014 like Phoebe\u2019s C\u00e9line vs. Hedi\u2019s Celine?\nEither way, it heralds a paradigm shift of another kind.\nFor most technology companies, a designer\u2019s departure wouldn\u2019t cause a blip in the public eye, but part of Apple\u2019s brilliance lay in the way the company borrowed from the fashion world to drive consumption.\nIt was Steve Jobs\u2019s understanding that the strategies of fashion could be co-opted and applied to previously dull and boring consumer electronics, so that they became tactile and visually seductive \u2014 thinner, sleeker, chicer \u2014 and helped the company transcend its industry. It was Mr. Jobs who embraced the value of a new model for each season; who understood how planned obsolescence, an essential premise of fashion, could be applied to function; and how a value system could be embedded in the aerodynamic lines of a device so that it became more than the mechanical sum of its parts.\nAnd it was Mr. Jobs who formed a partnership with a young designer named Jony Ive, a Briton from London who joined the company in 1992 and defined the look of Apple for decades, inspiring an entire fashion week\u2019s worth of brands to create accessories (iPad covers, iPhone covers) for the offerings.\nIt is not insignificant that afterMr. Jobs\u2019s deathin 2011, Mr. Ive stepped out of the shadows, along with Tim Cook, the chief executive, to become the face of the company. If Mr. Cook was the unassuming technocrat, Mr. Ive was the visionary: friend of Marc Newson (designer of the Lockheed lounge) and the designer Azzedine Ala\u00efa, proponent of the merging of tech and fashion that took place around the Apple watch\u2019s debut in 2014.\nFirst came a hiring binge \u2014 Paul Deneve, the former chief executive of YSL, to be the vice president for special projects in 2013; Patrick Pruniaux, formerly of Tag Heuer, as senior director, special projects, the following year; and, also in 2014, Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief executive, as senior vice president for retail \u2014 and then the rollout.\nThere was an unveiling just before New York Fashion Week;a dinner party in Parisat Mr. Ala\u00efa\u2019s and a reveal at the concept store Colette; a starring role on the cover of China Vogue; and, ultimately, an appearance by Mr. Ive as a host of the Met Gala with Anna Wintour in 2016.\nYet ultimately (and despite acollaboration with Herm\u00e8s), the watch becamenot so much a fashiondisrupter as a health and wellness gadget. Mr. Deneve left in 2016; Ms. Ahrendts and Mr. Pruniaux in 2019, the same year Mr. Ive became a consultant.\nSince then, Apple has had no chief design officer, and there has been no design voice among the chorus ofupper echelon of Apple executives; no single, presiding visual point of view. Instead, Mr. Ive\u2019s remit was divided between Evans Hankey, the vice president for industrial design, and Alan Dye, the vice president for user interface design.\nFashion itself has largelydropped its forayinto connected this and wired that (smart garments never really got mainstreamed) in favor of metaverse everything. Reports were that thelook of a thing was less and less a priorityin Appleland.\nStill, Ms. Hankey and Mr. Dye worked alongside Mr. Ive for years on such products as the MacBook Air and the watch, and it seemed as if at least nominally Mr. Ive had maintained his ties as keeper of the flame and the aesthetics.\nUntil now. Which is why the coming headset and how it will look matters so much. Perhaps, given the potential timing, it will be the last product to have Mr. Ive\u2019s fingerprints on its design. But perhaps it could be a sign of something more.\nBoth Apple and Mr. Ive declined to comment on their relationship for this article. But if Apple is to prove that this may be the beginning of a new era, and not the beginning of the end of its commitment to style as a signifier \u2014 not the beginning of watered-down versions of what came before, with the almost clich\u00e9d rounded edges and a sleek silver case \u2014 this will be the first real test. It is an opportunity to redesign not just a product, but to examine how we think about the product, and Apple itself. And though Mr. Ive reportedly had been noodling on the headset over the last few years of his contract, it may be preferable to not iterate as much as redefine.\nIndeed, the fact that the watch did not prove a game changer or industry mover means there is opportunity for Ms. Hankey (or someone else, who knows?) to assert herself by creating something new, the way designers do when they take over a brand.\nThink of it this way: Gucci and Celine or MaxMara? Upend everything we think we know and remake it for a new reality or just go through the motions reliably, if uninspiringly, again and again? All the signs point to the MaxMara model, but if there\u2019s anything fashion teaches us, it\u2019s that brands can survive a change in designer, as long as the company actually cares about, and empowers, that designer.\nOnce upon a time Apple learned some valuable lessons from fashion. We\u2019ll see if it can do it again."

        "fulltext": "A former senior lawyer at Apple who enforced its insider-trading policies pleaded guilty on Thursday to perpetrating an insider-trading scheme, which prosecutors said had involved making stock transactions before the company announced it fell short of iPhone sales expectations.\nIn 2019,the Justice Department charged Gene Levoff, who was senior director of corporate law at Apple until he was fired in late 2018, with using nonpublic information about Apple\u2019s financial results that helped him avoid losses and collect profits while illegally making trades ahead of the company\u2019s earnings reports.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, Mr. Levoff avoided losses of $377,000 before Apple released bad news regarding its iPhone business and collected profits of more than $220,000 before it released good news, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Newark. The transactions violated quarterly \u201cblackout periods,\u201d which prohibit trading by individuals with access to material nonpublic information.\nIn a 2015 example, Mr. Levoff sold $10 million of Apple stock before the company reported it would miss analysts\u2019 unit sales estimates for the iPhone, helping him avoid losses when shares fell 4 percent on the disappointing quarterly results.\nOn several occasions, Mr. Levoff made the trades after sending an email to employees at Apple saying such trades are restricted, according to the initial complaint. Apple\u2019s insider-trading policy said any individual with material, nonpublic information about the company was not allowed to trade until 60 hours after that information had been announced.\n\u201cThis defendant exploited his position within a company strictly for financial gain that he would not have otherwise realized,\u201d said Terence Reilly, the F.B.I.\u2019s acting special agent for the Newark office, which led the investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s called \u2018gaming the system.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Levoff\u2019s lawyer declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn 2020, Mr. Levoff\u2019s legal team filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the complaint was unconstitutional because no law existed against insider trading. But Judge William Martini rejected the motion, saying that the argument was \u201cincorrect\u201d and that Congress passed laws to ensure \u201cfair and honest markets.\u201d\nBefore he was fired, Mr. Levoff reported to Apple\u2019s general counsel. He was part of the company\u2019s disclosure committee, a group that helped prepare Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Luca Maestri, its chief financial officer, before quarterly disclosures to investors.\nThe counts of securities fraud in Mr. Levoff\u2019s plea carry a maximum penalty of 20 years and a $5 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10.\nA separate suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission is still pending. The agency was seeking a judgment that would require Mr. Levoff to repay his gains from the trades."
