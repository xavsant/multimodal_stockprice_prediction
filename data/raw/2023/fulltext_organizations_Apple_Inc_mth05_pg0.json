        "title": "Apple\u2019s Slowdown Eases, but Sluggish Demand Hurts Results",
        "fulltext": "Apple on Thursday provided more evidence for optimists who believe that the worst of the tech industry\u2019s slump may be over while reminding investors that there are still plenty of reasons for concern.\nAlthough the company said that its revenue shrank 3 percent in its most recent quarter compared to the same period a year ago, the $94.8 billion total well outpaced investor expectations of $92.9 billion.\nIt was something of a rebound from theprevious quarter, when Apple revenue and profit fell more substantially because of economic challenges and a Covid-19 outbreak in China that forced the company\u2019s largest iPhone factory to close temporarily.\nApple reported a profit of $24.1 billion, down 3 percent from the same period a year earlier but above the $22.6 billion expected by Wall Street. The company\u2019s sales in its second fiscal quarter were driven by record revenue for its services division and strong demand for iPhones, its flagship product.\n\u201cApple\u2019s results suggest to us that the company is navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment well,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson. Still, he said, Big Tech\u2019s collective financial results served as a reminder that the economy is not yet out of the woods.\nApple made $51.3 billion from iPhone sales, up 1.5 percent from a year ago. Demand for iPhones and other products in China was down slightly from a year earlier, but revenue of $17.8 billion outpaced investor expectations as China continued its rebound from long pandemic lockdowns. Emerging markets like South Asia, India, Latin America and the Middle East powered iPhone demand, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with investors.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the call that the company\u2019s supply of iPhones had recovered after various issues, many related to the pandemic.\n\u201cIf you step back and look at how we performed over the last three years on supply chain, despite this parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic factors, the supply chain has been incredibly resilient,\u201d he said.\nCustomers\u2019 interest in Apple products other than the iPhone slumped in the quarter. Revenue from iPads fell nearly 13 percent and Mac revenue dropped 31 percent. Mr. Cook said the slowdowns came from economic challenges and difficult comparisons with a high-demand quarter last year.\nStill, Apple\u2019s services division, which includes subscriptions to Apple Fitness+ and Apple Music, as well as sales from its App Store, had nearly $21 billion in sales, a slight increase from a year ago that buoyed the company overall. Revenue from the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple\u2019s payment services surged, in particular, while digital advertising and mobile gaming struggled, the company said on the call.\nApple also said it had authorized a $90 billion stock buyback, helping to drive the price of the company\u2019s shares up more than 1 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nThe company has not conducted mass layoffs like other technology companies, because it didn\u2019t hire as aggressively in the early days of the pandemic. Applehas taken a hard line in its return-to-office policies, requiring most employees to work in the office three days a week."

        "title": "TikTok Users Sue Montana, Calling State Ban Unconstitutional",
        "fulltext": "A court battle over First Amendment rights kicked off in Montana on Thursday after a group of TikTok users challenged the state\u2019s new TikTok ban, which is set to take effect Jan. 1 and is the first of its kind in the nation.\nThe TikTok users saidin a lawsuitthat the law violated their First Amendment rights and claimed that the ban, which Gov. Greg Gianforte signed on Wednesday, far outstripped Montana\u2019s legal authority as a state. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court but was added to a public court records system on Thursday.\nThe ban has also set off an outcry from TikTok and civil liberty and digital rights groups. Montana lawmakers and Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, say the ban is necessary to prevent Americans\u2019 personal information from falling into the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.\nUnder the law, TikTok will be fined for operating the app within the state, and app store providers like Google and Apple will be fined if TikTok is available for download in Montana.\nNo plans for a lawsuit were announced on Thursday by TikTok itself or leading civil liberty groups. Brooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, declined to comment on the likelihood of the company\u2019s filing a suit.\nBut Ms. Oberwetter said on Wednesday, after the law was signed, that the ban infringed on the First Amendment rights of people in Montana and that the company would keep \u201cworking to defend the rights of our users.\u201d She said on Thursday that a federal ban in 2020 did not hold up to legal scrutiny and that Montana did not have a workable plan for enacting the ban.\nMs. Oberwetter also pointed to statements from civil and digital rights groups raising similar concerns. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.\nRamya Krishnan, a lawyer at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the U.S. Constitution protected Americans\u2019 access rights to the social media platforms of their choosing. To justify a ban, Ms. Krishnan said, Montana would have to show that its privacy and security concerns were real and that they could not be addressed in narrower ways.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think TikTok has yet committed to suing, but I think it\u2019s likely that it will,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this is such a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion into the First Amendment rights of Americans, we are certainly thinking through the possibility of getting involved in some way.\u201d\nNetChoice, a trade group that counts TikTok as a member and has sued in the past to block state laws targeting tech companies, also said in a statement that the ban violated the Constitution. Krista Chavez, a spokeswoman for the group, said NetChoice did not \u201ccurrently have plans to sue\u201d to challenge the law.\nThe Montana plaintiffs are five residents who \u201ccreate, publish, view, interact with and share videos on TikTok,\u201d their lawsuit said. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit said Montana \u201ccan no more ban its residents from viewing or posting to TikTok than it could ban The Wall Street Journal because of who owns it or the ideas it publishes.\u201d The users also argued that the law violated provisions of the Constitution that give the federal government exclusive power over foreign affairs and prohibit states from regulating interstate commerce.\nTikTok users have been successful in blocking a ban of the app before. In 2020, a judge sided with a group of creators who challenged an attempt to ban the app by President Donald J. Trump. TikTok and ByteDance also separately sued to stop the president\u2019s actions.\nMontana passed its law after the federal government and more than two dozen states banned TikTok from government devices in recent months. Lawmakers and intelligence officialshave said TikTok, because of its ownership, could put sensitive user data into the hands of the Chinese government. They have also argued that the app could be used to spread propaganda.\nTikTok says it has never been asked to provide, nor has it provided, any U.S. user data to the Chinese government.\n\u201cMany have hypothesized that China might demand that ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, turn over Americans\u2019 data or use TikTok to push disinformation in some way, but neither Montana nor the U.S. government has pointed to any evidence that China is actually doing this,\u201d Ms. Krishnan said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem because speculative harms can\u2019t justify a total ban on a communications platform, particularly one that\u2019s used by hundreds of thousands of Montanans daily.\u201d\nIn addition to the legal fight, many experts raised questions about whether the law could be enforced. Internet users can use virtual private network software to disguise their location. Individuals who live in Montana border towns could have access to TikTok and other mobile apps through cellular towers in neighboring states.\nIn an email, Emilee Cantrell, a spokeswoman for the state\u2019s attorney general, Austin Knudsen, said there was existing technology for restricting app use within a specific location. The technique, known as geofencing, is \u201calready in use across the gaming industry,\u201d which the state\u2019s Justice Department also regulates, Ms. Cantrell said.\n\u201cA basic internet search will show you companies that provide geolocation compliance,\u201d she said. If companies do not comply with the ban, she continued, the agency \u201cwill investigate and hold offending entities accountable in accordance with the law.\u201d\nAsked about the lawsuit filed by TikTok users, a second spokeswoman for Mr. Knudsen, who is named the defendant in the lawsuit, said later on Thursday that his office \u201cexpected a legal challenge\u201d and was \u201cfully prepared to defend the law.\u201d\nThe legislation puts the onus for enforcing the ban on TikTok, Apple and Google. Under the law, TikTok could be fined $10,000 for each individual violation of the ban and an additional $10,000 every day a violation continues. Apple and Google would face the same fines if they allowed the app to be downloaded in the state.\nWhile the State Legislature was considering the ban, a trade group representing Apple and Google said it would be impossible for the companies to restrict access to an app inside a single state.\n\u201cThe responsibility should be on an app to determine where it can operate, not an app store,\u201d David Edmonson, a vice president for TechNet, the trade group, said in a statement on Thursday.\nGoogle and Apple declined to comment."

        "title": "PacWest\u2019s Stock Plunge Reignites Banking Sector Fears",
        "fulltext": "The regional banking sector is teetering again, with PacWest\u2019s stock plummeting more than 35 percent in premarket trading, despite the Fed chair Jay Powell\u2019s assessment that the worst is over.\nThe Los Angeles-based lender confirmed that it wastalking to potential investorsfollowing reports that it was exploring a sale. Investors may be feeling some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu after witnessing two big bank failures, and billions in market value wiped out, since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.\nIt\u2019s not just PacWest in free-fall. Shares in Western Alliance, Comerica and Zions Bancorp were down sharply too, even as S&P 500 futures were down only slightly after the Fed signaled itmay be doneraising interest rates.\nNews of a potential PacWest sale,first reported by Bloomberg\u2014 and confirmed by DealBook \u2014 came just hours after Mr. Powell declared that the banking system was \u201csound and resilient.\u201d\nDespite Mr. Powell\u2019s reassurances, big questions remain.Among them:Can regional banks like PacWest find a private-sector solution? Or will regulators again need to step in?\nThe fix is tricky, as was made clear by First Republic\u2019s monthlong search for a rescuer. JPMorgan Chase bought the lender onlyafterit had been seized by the F.D.I.C. PacWest appears healthy, with deposits \u2014 75 percent of which are insured \u2014 ticking up since the end of March. But it needs to raise capital, and fast.\nSelling its depressed stock would be costly for PacWest.That could further spook depositors and investors, and play into the hands of the short sellerstargeting the sector. Meanwhile, a fire sale of assets, including loans (the bank\u2019s $2.7 billion lender finance loan portfolio is on the block) and securities pegged at low interest rates, may not fetch much. Finally, selling itself could be tough, and not only because the pool of potential buyers has narrowed significantly since the JPMorgan-First Republic deal.\nCriticism of the Fed and calls for regulatory action are growing.Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and an adviser at Allianz, accused Powell of confusing the markets by saying the sector\u2019s problems had largely been contained with the sale of First Republic. AndBill Ackman, the billionaire investor, called on regulators to modernize the deposit insurance system to restore the public\u2019s faith in regional lenders. (He added that his hedge fund was neither long nor short the banking sector.)\nUp next for the markets:The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday, but it\u2019s an open question as to whether it will do so by a quarter- or half-point.\nOil prices whipsaw in volatile trading.Benchmarks for cruderose on Thursday, but not enough to compensate for yesterday\u2019s plunge, which was driven by investor concerns about slowing global demand. Meanwhile,Shell reportedbetter-than-expected earnings, as lower costs and strong trading results offset lower oil and gas prices.\nJamie Dimon reportedly may testify about Jeffrey Epstein later this month.Adeposition of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s C.E.O., as part of two lawsuits over the bank\u2019s ties to the convicted sex offender, is set for May 26 and 27, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr. Epstein hadpreviously unreported meetingswith Larry Summers and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Mr. Epstein\u2019s private islands weresold for $60 million.\nGoldman Sachs reportedly seeks to settle a discrimination lawsuit.The Wall Street bank has held discussions about payingseveral hundred million dollarsto resolve accusations that it systematically discriminated against female employees, The Wall Street Journal reports. A trial in the case is set for next month.\nThe U.A.W. withholds an endorsement of President Biden.The United Auto Workers, one of America\u2019s most powerful unions, said it wasconcerned about the White House\u2019s plansfor an \u201celectric vehicle transition,\u201d though it hasn\u2019t ruled out backing him later in the 2024 race. It\u2019s a sign of how Mr. Biden\u2019s climate change policies may cost him support from a key constituency.\nMeta and the F.T.C. have escalated their fight over how the social media giant handles its users\u2019 data. Meta accused the agency and its chair, Lina Khan, of pulling a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d after it moved to impose \u201ca blanket prohibition\u201d on the company\u2019s collection of personal data from young people.\nThe agency has come down hard on Meta before for its handling of users\u2019 data.In 2020, it imposed a $5 billion consent order and forced Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to overhaul its privacy practices. The F.T.C. said yesterday that the company had failed to do so, accusing it of \u201crecklessness\u201d and of putting \u201cyoung users at risk.\u201d\nThe potential penalties are stiff.Meta would be barred from profiting off any data it collects from users under 18, and regulators want that to be extended to 18-year-olds \u2014 a move that would limit how the company targets ads to young people.\nMeta vowed to fight.\u201cDespite three years of continual engagement with the F.T.C. around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that Ms. Khan\u2019s \u201cinsistence on using any measure \u2014 however baseless \u2014 to antagonize American business has reached a new low.\u201d The company has 30 days to appeal.\nCongress is also targeting social networks.Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, yesterday reintroduced a bill to update the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. The lawmakers said in astatementthat they were seeking to ban \u201ctargeted ads to kids, and stop all online platforms \u2014 not just Meta and other companies under F.T.C. consent decrees \u2014 from raking in profits through the exploitation of an entire generation.\u201d\nTech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have beaten expectations this earnings season. Apple is up next and will report after the closing bell on Thursday. Here are some of the biggest things to watch for.\nStock buybacks:Investors expect Apple, which has spent more money repurchasing shares than any other company, to keep that up. The consensus number this quarter is$90 billion.\nChina:Nearly 25 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue comes from China, and supply-chain disruptions there led tocostly shortages. As the Chinese economy reopens after Covid, the iPhone maker\u2019s sales should continue to recover, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief, has said that production problems have subsided. But some analysts worry that the company remainsoverly dependent on China.\nArtificial intelligence:Tech leaders have spent a lot of time on their earnings calls touting their progress in adding ChatGPT-like features to their products. Apple has been criticized forfailing to keep upwith the latest advances. Investors will be anxious to hear whether Cook lays out an expansive vision for the tech.\nLeaders of companies working on artificial intelligence, including Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI, willmeet with Vice President Kamala Harrison Thursday, after the White House announced new initiatives to rein in the fast-growing technology.\nIt\u2019s the latest sign that governments are seeking to tame A.I. as the tech world races to harness the power of products like ChatGPT \u2014 and critics warn that the technology threatens to reshape society in potentially negative ways.\nWhite House officials pledged to release draft guidelines for A.I. use in government,to safeguard \u201cthe American people\u2019s rights and safety.\u201d The announcement comes a day afterLina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., called for tighter regulation of the technology.\nInternational regulators are also making moves.The head of Britain\u2019s competition overseer told The Financial Times that the agencywould review the A.I. market, with an eye on potential guardrails to protect consumers and smaller companies. That follows plans by the European Union for some of the world\u2019smost sweeping legislationto regulate A.I.\nIn other A.I. news:\nSecurity engineers at Meta warned ofpotentially dangerous ChatGPT impostors.\nA start-up let users interact with ChatGPT via a female avatar. Perhaps unsurprisingly,that didn\u2019t go well.\nA.I. can do many things; can it also be anemotional support companion?\nAt HSBC\u2019s annual meeting on Friday in Birmingham, England, the focus will be on one topic: whether to break up the bank, which is Europe\u2019s biggest. HSBC management argues that the lender benefits from its integrated global operation. But the firm\u2019s largest shareholder, the Chinese insurer Ping An, wants HSBC to spin out its main Asian operations.\nThough a shareholder initiative to force HSBC to regularly review its structure may fail on Friday, thepressure on the bankto rethink its future won\u2019t let up anytime soon.\nHSBC\u2019s China-facing business accounts for nearly half of its revenue\u2014 but Ping An says the division has been held back by having to subsidize its slower-growing Western operations. Asian investors were also angered by a 2020 edict by the Bank of England that British banks stop paying quarterly dividends. (HSBC said this week that it would restart those payouts.)\nLast month, Ping An responded to management\u2019s objections by suggesting the less drastic step of giving the Asian business, which is based in Hong Kong, its own stock listing.\nHSBC remains unconvinced.Executives have said a breakup risks disrupting what is a well-performing business, and pointed to their efforts to shed nonessential operations like retail banking in North America. Abetter-than-expected earnings reporton Tuesday helped buttress their arguments.\nThe fight will likely extend beyond Friday.Though HSBC is expected to win the vote on the shareholder proposal, analysts concede that HSBC will face increasing pressure from worsening tensions between Beijing and the West.\nGiven that Ping An hasn\u2019t shown any desire to walk away, expect the fight over HSBC\u2019s future to continue.\nDeals\nKenvue, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s consumer health care spin-off, wasvalued at $41 billion in its I.P.O., the largest U.S. stock offering of the year to date.

        "title": "Katie Cotton, Who Helped Raise Apple\u2019s Profile, Dies at 57",
        "fulltext": "Katie Cotton, who as Apple\u2019s longtime communications chief guarded the media\u2019s access to Steve Jobs, the company\u2019s visionary co-founder, and helped organize the introduction of many of his products, died on April 6 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 57.\nHer death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Michael Mimeles, her former husband. He did not give a cause but said that she had experienced complications from heart surgery she underwent a few years ago.\nMs. Cotton, who built a culture of mystery by saying relatively little, if anything, to reporters, joined Apple in 1996 and began working with Mr. Jobs the next year, soon after he returned to the company after 12 years away. Apple was in poor financial shape at the time, but Ms. Cotton worked with him to engineer a striking turnaround.\nTogether they crafted a tightly controlled public relations strategy as the company recovered from steep losses and turned out one successful product after another, including the iMac desktop computer and innovative digital devices like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad.\n\u201cShe was formidable and tough and very protective of both Apple\u2019s brand and Steve, particularly when he got sick,\u201dWalt Mossberg, a former technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal, said in a phone interview, referring to Mr. Jobs\u2019s diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 2004. He added: \u201cShe was one of the few people he trusted implicitly. He listened to her. She could pull him back from something he intended to do or say.\u201dMr. Jobs diedin 2011 at 56.\nMs. Cotton spoke tersely, if at all, when reporters questioned her, but she could be helpful when speaking off the record or on background.\n\u201cShe was accessible, she was a point of contact,\u201d said John Markoff, a former technology reporter for The New York Times, \u201cbut sometimes it was hand-to-hand combat if they wanted to convey a story to the world and it wasn\u2019t the story I wanted to tell.\u201d\nMs. Cotton also chose which reporters could speak to Mr. Jobs (even though he would occasionally speak, on his own, to journalists he knew well). In 1997, she invited a Newsweek reporter, Katie Hafner, to watch, along with Mr. Jobs, the first commercial in Apple\u2019s new\u201cThink Different\u201dadvertising campaign.\nA tribute to \u201cthe crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers,\u201d a narrator intoned as the commercial opened with a still picture of Mr. Jobs holding an apple in his left hand; it continued with clips of people who changed the world, among them Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, John Lennon, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Edison and Muhammad Ali.\n\u201cI looked over and Steve was crying,\u201dMs. Hafner, who wrote about Apple for Newsweek and later for The Times, said in a phone interview. \u201cI looked at Katie, and I couldn\u2019t tell if she was moved or feeling triumphant \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 but I was filled with admiration for her, because she knew how to play this and to give me access.\u201d\nRichard Stengel, a former managing editor of Time magazine, said in an email that Mr. Jobs \u201cwould call me five or six times in a day to tell me I should do a story or not,\u201d and that Ms. Cotton would \u201cfrequently call right after and gently apologize or pull back something he had said.\u201d He added, \u201cShe was very loyal, but she saw him in an unvarnished way.\u201d\nKathryn Elizabeth Cotton was born on Oct. 30, 1965, in Washington, N.J. Her father, Philip, worked for a telecommunications company. Her mother, Marie (Cuvo) Cotton, held various jobs, including caterer.\nAfter graduating from the University of Arizona in 1988 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism, Ms. Cotton worked at Dav-El Limousine in Los Angeles in sales, marketing and public relations before moving to the public relations agency Allison Thomas Associates. The company\u2019s technology clients included Mr. Jobs, who was then running the technology company NeXT. But Ms. Thomas and Mr. Jobs had a falling-out before Ms. Cotton was hired in about 1994.\n\u201cShe was great at what she did,\u201d Ms. Thomas said in a phone interview, \u201cbut it took a while for her obsessive work habits to become clear.\u201d\nIn mid-1996, when Gilbert Amelio was Apple\u2019s chief executive, the struggling company hired Ms. Cotton to help with its public relations. \u201cKatie did tech P.R. before it was hip and cool to do, and Apple needed someone with her experience,\u201d said Mr. Mimeles, her ex-husband, who also worked at Apple.\nIn late 1996,Apple acquired NeXT Software, which brought Mr. Jobs back to Apple as an adviser. He would become the company\u2019s interim chief executive in 1997 and chief executive three years later. That same year he elevated Ms. Cotton to run Apple\u2019s public relations and communications. He eventually named her vice president of worldwide communications, a title she held for many years.\n\u201cWhen Steve came back, he didn\u2019t just put key engineers in place,\u201d Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of marketing, said. \u201cHe put the right people in place to lead us around the company, and Katie was a big part of that.\u201d\nShe continued to work for Mr. Jobs until his death, all the while saying little publicly about his health problems. She then worked for Tim Cook, his successor, until she retired in 2014.\nOne measure of her influence was a headline in Macworld magazine:\u201cApple PR\u2019s Cotton departs:What it could mean for the press.\u201d\nMs. Cotton never held another corporate job. She did some corporate consulting and mentored young people at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, Calif., which her children attended, and at the Riekes Center, a nonprofit educational organization in Menlo Park, Calif.\nShe is survived by her mother; a daughter, Isabelle Mimeles; a son, Ethan Mimeles; her partner, Jim Wells; her sisters, Lori Ann David and Patty Stewart; and her brother, Richard Cotton.\nAfter Mr. Jobs died, the advertising agency TBWA/Media Arts Lab screened a proposed commercial for Ms. Cotton and two other Apple executives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad when a founder dies,\u201d the commercial began, as recounted by the journalist Tripp Mickle (who now covers the tech industry for The Times) in \u201cAfter Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul\u201d (2022). \u201cYou wonder if you can make it without him. Should you put your brave face on for the world, or just be honest?\u201d\nWhen it finished, Ms. Cotton was weeping.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t run this,\u201d she said. They never did."

        "title": "Google\u2019s Photo App Still Can\u2019t Find Gorillas. And Neither Can Apple\u2019s.",
        "fulltext": "Eight years after a controversy over Black people being mislabeled as gorillas by image analysis software \u2014 and despite big advances in computer vision \u2014 tech giants still fear repeating the mistake.\nByNico GrantandKashmir Hill\nWhen Google released its stand-alone Photos app in May 2015, people were wowed by what it could do: analyze images to label the people, places and things in them, an astounding consumer offering at the time. But a couple of months after the release, a software developer, Jacky Alcin\u00e9, discovered that Google had labeled photos of him and a friend, who are both Black, as \u201cgorillas,\u201d a term that is particularly offensive because it echoes centuries of racist tropes.\nIn the ensuing controversy, Google prevented its software from categorizing anything in Photos as gorillas, and it vowed to fix the problem. Eight years later, with significant advances in artificial intelligence, we tested whether Google had resolved the issue, and we looked at comparable tools from its competitors: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\nPhoto apps made by Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft rely on artificial intelligence to allow us to search for particular items, and pinpoint specific memories, in our increasingly large photo collections. Want to find your day at the zoo out of 8,000 images? Ask the app. So to test the search function, we curated44 imagesfeaturing people, animals and everyday objects.\nWe started with Google Photos. When we searched our collection forcatsandkangaroos,we got images that matched our queries. The app performed well in recognizing most other animals.\nBut when we looked forgorillas,Google Photos failed to find any images. We widened our search tobaboons, chimpanzees, orangutansandmonkeys,and it still failed even though there were images of all of these primates in our collection.\nWe then looked at Google\u2019s competitors. We discovered Apple Photos had the same issue: It could accurately find photos of particular animals, except for most primates. We did get results forgorilla,but only when the text appeared in a photo, such as an image of Gorilla Tape.\nThe photo search in Microsoft OneDrive drew a blank for every animal we tried. Amazon Photos showed results for all searches, but it was over-inclusive. When we searched forgorillas,the app showed a menagerie of primates, and repeated that pattern for other animals.\nundefined\nThere was one member of the primate family that Google and Apple were able to recognize \u2014 lemurs, the permanently startled-looking, long-tailed animals that share opposable thumbs with humans, but are more distantly related than are apes.\nGoogle\u2019s and Apple\u2019s tools were clearly the most sophisticated when it came to image analysis.\nYet Google, whose Android software underpins most of the world\u2019s smartphones, has made the decision to turn off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of making an offensive mistake and labeling a person as an animal. And Apple, with technology that performed similarly to Google\u2019s in our test, appeared to disable the ability to look for monkeys and apes as well.\nConsumers may not need to frequently perform such a search \u2014 though in 2019, an iPhone user complained on Apple\u2019s customer support forum that the software \u201ccan\u2019t find monkeys in photos on my device.\u201d But the issue raises larger questions about other unfixed, or unfixable, flaws lurking in services that rely on computer vision \u2014 a technology that interprets visual images \u2014 as well as other products powered by A.I.\nMr. Alcin\u00e9 was dismayed to learn that Google has still not fully solved the problem and said society puts too much trust in technology.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to forever have no faith in this A.I.,\u201d he said.\nComputer vision products are now used for tasks as mundane as sending an alert when there is a package on the doorstep, and as weighty as navigating cars and finding perpetrators in law enforcement investigations.\nErrors can reflect racist attitudes among those encoding the data. In the gorilla incident, two former Google employees who worked on this technology said the problem was that the company had not put enough photos of Black people in the image collection that it used to train its A.I. system. As a result, the technology was not familiar enough with darker-skinned people and confused them for gorillas.\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in our lives, it is eliciting fears of unintended consequences. Although computer vision products and A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT are different, both depend on underlying reams of data that train the software, and both can misfire because of flaws in the data or biases incorporated into their code.\nMicrosoft recentlylimited users\u2019 abilityto interact with a chatbot built into its search engine, Bing, after it instigatedinappropriate conversations.\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision, like Google\u2019s choice to prevent its algorithm from identifying gorillas altogether, illustrates a common industry approach \u2014 to wall off technology features that malfunction rather than fixing them.\n\u201cSolving these issues is important,\u201d said Vicente Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a professor at Rice University who studies computer vision. \u201cHow can we trust this software for other scenarios?\u201d\nMichael Marconi, a Google spokesman, said Google had prevented its photo app from labeling anything as a monkey or ape because it decided the benefit \u201cdoes not outweigh the risk of harm.\u201d\nApple declined to comment on users\u2019 inability to search for most primates on its app.\nRepresentatives from Amazon and Microsoft said the companies were always seeking to improve their products.\nWhen Google was developing its photo app, which was released eight years ago, it collected a large amount of images to train the A.I. system to identify people, animals and objects.\nIts significant oversight \u2014 that there were not enough photos of Black people in its training data \u2014 caused the app to later malfunction, two former Google employees said. The company failed to uncover the \u201cgorilla\u201d problem back then because it had not asked enough employees to test the feature before its public debut, the former employees said.\nGoogle profusely apologized for the gorillas incident, but it was one of a number of episodes in the wider tech industry that have led to accusations of bias.\nOther products that have been criticized includeHP\u2019s facial-tracking webcams, which could not detect some people with dark skin, and theApple Watch,which, accordingto a lawsuit, failed to accurately read blood oxygen levels across skin colors. The lapses suggested that tech products were not being designed for people with darker skin. (Apple pointedto a paperfrom 2022 that detailed its efforts to test its blood oxygen app on a \u201cwide range of skin types and tones.\u201d)\nYears after the Google Photos error, the company encountered a similar problem with its Nest home-security camera during internal testing, according to a person familiar with the incident who worked at Google at the time. The Nest camera, which used A.I. to determine whether someone on a property was familiar or unfamiliar, mistook some Black people for animals. Google rushed to fix the problem before users had access to the product, the person said.\nHowever, Nest customers continue to complain on the company\u2019s forums about other flaws. In 2021, a customer received alerts that his mother was ringing the doorbell but found his mother-in-law instead on the other side of the door. When users complained that the system was mixing up faces they had marked as \u201cfamiliar,\u201d a customer support representative in the forum advised them to delete all of their labels and start over.\nMr. Marconi, the Google spokesman, said that \u201cour goal is to prevent these types of mistakes from ever happening.\u201d He added that the company had improved its technology \u201cby partnering with experts and diversifying our image datasets.\u201d\nIn 2019, Google tried to improve a facial-recognition feature for Android smartphones by increasing the number of people with dark skin in its data set. But the contractors whom Google had hired to collect facial scansreportedlyresorted to a troubling tactic to compensate for that dearth of diverse data: They targeted homeless people and students. Google executives called the incident \u201cvery disturbing\u201d at the time.\nWhile Google worked behind the scenes to improve the technology, it never allowed users to judge those efforts.\nMargaret Mitchell, a researcher and co-founder of Google\u2019s Ethical AI group, joined the company after the gorilla incident and collaborated with the Photos team. She said in a recent interview that she was a proponent of Google\u2019s decision to remove \u201cthe gorillas label, at least for a while.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to think about how often someone needs to label a gorilla versus perpetuating harmful stereotypes,\u201d Dr. Mitchell said. \u201cThe benefits don\u2019t outweigh the potential harms of doing it wrong.\u201d\nDr. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, the professor, speculated that Google and Apple could now be capable of distinguishing primates from humans, but that they didn\u2019t want to enable the feature given the possible reputational risk if it misfired again.\nGoogle has since released a more powerful image analysis product, Google Lens, a tool to search the web with photos rather than text.Wireddiscovered in 2018 that the tool was also unable to identify a gorilla.\nWhen we showed Lens a photo of a dog, it was able to suggest its likely breed.\nBut when we showed it a gorilla, a chimpanzee, a baboon, and an orangutan, Lens seemed to be stumped, refusing to label what was in the image and surfacing only \u201cvisual matches\u201d \u2014 photos it deemed similar to the original picture.\nFor gorillas, it showed photos of other gorillas, suggesting that the technology recognizes the animal but that the\ncompany is afraid of labeling it.\nWhen we showed Lens a photo of a dog, it was able to suggest its likely breed.\nBut when we showed it a gorilla, a chimpanzee, a baboon, and an orangutan, Lens seemed to be stumped, refusing to label what was in the image and surfacing only \u201cvisual matches\u201d \u2014 photos it deemed similar to the original picture.\n\nFor gorillas, it showed photos of other gorillas, suggesting that the technology recognizes the animal but that the company is afraid of labeling it.\nundefined\nThese systems are never foolproof, said Dr. Mitchell, who is no longer working at Google. Because billions of people use Google\u2019s services, even rare glitches that happen to only one person out of a billion users will surface.\n\u201cIt only takes one mistake to have massive social ramifications,\u201d she said, referring to it as \u201cthe poisoned needle in a haystack.\u201d"

        "title": "Companies Are Taking a Harder Line on Union Organizers, Workers Say",
        "fulltext": "After working for more than seven years at an Apple store in Kansas City, Mo., Gemma Wyatt ran into trouble.\nLast year, she said, managers disciplined her for clocking in late a few times over the previous several weeks. Then, in February, Apple fired her after she missed a store meeting because she was sick but failed to notify managers soon enough, according to Ms. Wyatt.\nShe was at least the fifth Apple employee the store had fired since this fall, all of whom had been active in union organizing there. The terminations came after two other Apple stores voted to unionize.\n\u201cIt took us time to realize they weren\u2019t firing us just because of time and attendance,\u201d said Ms. Wyatt, who is part of a charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board in March accusing Apple of unfair labor practices.\nApple said it had not disciplined or fired any workers in retaliation for union activity. \u201cWe strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the N.L.R.B.,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nA pattern of similar worker accusations \u2014 and corporate denials \u2014 has arisen at Starbucks, Trader Joe\u2019s and REI as retail workers have sought to form unions in the past two years.\nInitially, the employers countered the organizing campaigns with criticism of unions and other means of dissuasion. At Starbucks, there werestaffing and management changes at the local level, and top executiveswere dispatched. But workers say that in each case, after unionization efforts succeeded at one or two stores, the companies became more aggressive.\nSome labor relations experts say the companies\u2019 progressive public profiles may help explain why they chose to hold back at the outset.\n\u201cYou\u2019re espousing these values but saying this other organization claiming the same values\u201d \u2014 the union \u2014 \u201cisn\u2019t good for your work force,\u201d said David Pryzbylski, a labor lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers. \u201cIt puts you in a little bit of corner.\u201d\nOnce the union wins a few elections, however, \u201cyou pull out all the stops,\u201d Mr. Pryzbylski said.\nIn some cases, the apparent escalation of company pushback has coincided with a slowing down of the union campaigns. At Starbucks, filings for union elections fell below 10 in August, from about 70 five months earlier, and no Apple store has filed for a union election since November.\nAt Starbucks, the company unlawfully dismissed seven Buffalo-area employees last year, not long after the union won two elections there, according toa rulingby a federal administrative judge.\nA Trader Joe\u2019s store in Louisville, Ky., which was the third at the company to unionize, fired two employees who were supportive of the union campaign and has formally disciplined several more, said Connor Hovey, a worker involved in the organizing. Documents shared by Mr. Hovey show the company citing a variety of issues, such as dress-code violations, tardiness and excessively long breaks.\nAnd in advance of a recent union election at an REI near Cleveland, management sought to exclude certain categories of workers from voting,according to the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. It said the chain, a co-op that sells recreational gear, had made no such challenge in two previous elections, in which workers voted to unionize. (The union said the company had backed down after workers at the Cleveland-area store walked out, and the storevoted to unionizein March.)\nJess Raimundo, a spokeswoman for the United Food and Commercial Workers, which is also seeking to unionize REI stores, said the co-op had formally disciplined one employee in Durham, N.C., and put another on leave and later fired him over a workplace action that took place after the workers filed for a union electionlast month.\nStarbucks, which is appealing the ruling involving the Buffalo-area employees, has said the firings and discipline were unrelated to union organizing. A Trader Joe\u2019s spokeswoman said that the company had never disciplined an employee for seeking to unionize but that unionizing efforts didn\u2019t exempt an employee from job responsibilities.\nAn REI spokeswoman said that the co-op sought to exclude certain categories of workers near Cleveland because it believed their duties made them ineligible to join a union, and that it had reached an agreement on the issue independent of the walkout. The spokeswoman said the two Durham employees had been disciplined for violations of company policies, not union activity.\nAcross the companies, the shift is such that some organizers look back on their union campaigns\u2019 early days with an odd measure of nostalgia.\n\u201cThinking about it, I wondered why they didn\u2019t fight harder at our store,\u201d said Maeg Yosef, a worker and an organizer at a Trader Joe\u2019s in Massachusetts thatbecame the company\u2019s first storeto unionize last year. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oops, you won\u2019 and certified us. It was really hard, but relatively easy compared to the things they could have done.\u201d\nThe fight at Apple followed a similar trajectory. The company did not hide its suspicion of unions when workers at a U.S. storefirst filedfor an election in April 2022, in Atlanta. Managersemphasizedthat employees could receive fewer promotions and less flexible hours if they unionized, and the companycirculated a video of its head of retailquestioning the wisdom of putting \u201canother organization in the middle of our relationship.\u201d\nApple\u2019s response was similar in two other union campaigns. But although the unionwithdrew its election filingin Atlanta, unions won elections in both subsequent cases \u2014 first inTowson, Md., in Juneand then inOklahoma City in October.\nAccording to workers, the company became more aggressive once union organizers made inroads. Around the time that employees in Oklahoma City filed for a union election in September, managers at the Kansas City store disciplined several who supported unionizing for issues related to tardiness or absences that other workers typically have not been punished for, union backers said.\nTerminations began before the end of the year. D\u2019lite Xiong, a union supporter who started at the Kansas City store in 2021 and uses gender-neutral pronouns, said they were told they were being fired just before Halloween. Mx. Xiong went on leave to buy time to appeal the decision, but was officially let go upon returning in January.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me \u2014 I had recently gotten promoted,\u201d said Mx. Xiong, who speculated that the company discovered their role in union organizing after they sought to enlist co-workers. \u201cI was praised for doing a great job.\u201d\nThe Communications Workers of America, which represents Apple workers in Oklahoma and has supported workers seeking to unionize the Kansas City store, filed the unfair labor practice charge against the company over the firings in March.\nJohn Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who is an expert on anti-union campaigns, said companies often considered the potential dissatisfaction of customers, investors and even white-collar corporate employees when calibrating their response to a union campaign.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something deeply threatening about the idea that you might be on the verge of losing them,\u201d Mr. Logan said of corporate employees.\nBut even these considerations, he said, tend to fade once a campaign gains traction: \u201cThe overriding priority is, \u2018We have to crush this.\u2019\u201d\nThis year, more than 70 Starbucks corporate employees placed their names ona petitioncalling on the company to stay neutral in union elections and to \u201crespect federal labor laws.\u201d The National Labor Relations Board has issued dozens of complaints against the company accusing it of illegal behavior, which the company denies.\nHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks chief executive, was quick to push back against such accusations whiletestifyingbefore the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in March, telling one senator, \u201cI take offense with you categorizing me or Starbucks as a union-buster.\u201d\nIn late April, the labor board issued a complaint accusing the company of failing to bargain in good faithat more than 100 stores.\nA company spokesman attributed the delay to the union, including its insistence on broadcasting sessions using video-chat software, which could make it difficult to discuss sensitive topics.\nApple, too, appears intent on signaling that it is not hostile to labor. The companyagreedthis year to assess its U.S. labor practices for consistency with itshuman rights policy. And the company has reached tentative agreements with the union at its Towson store on a handful of issues, such as a commitment that workers at the store will receive any improvement in 401(k) benefits that nonunion retail workers at the company might receive.\nYet despite these gestures, there has been little progress on most of the union\u2019s top noneconomic priorities, such as grievance procedures, and the company has sought broad contract provisions that could substantially weaken the union. For example, under a proposed a management-rights clause obtained by The New York Times, Apple would have wide latitude to use nonunion workers and contractors to do work performed by union members, which could shrink union membership. Labor negotiations typically start with noneconomic issues before moving to matters like wages and paid time off.\nApple did not comment on the contract negotiations, but the workers in Oklahoma Cityhave characterizedtheir initial bargaining sessions as \u201cvery productive.\u201d\nMr. Pryzbylski, the lawyer who represents employers, said Apple\u2019s preferred management-rights clause was \u201cabout as robust and aggressive as you can make it,\u201d though he said it was not unusual for companies to seek such broad rights in their first contract.\nWorkers expressed frustration at the breadth of the management proposal. \u201cEveryone from the union at the table had never seen one so long,\u201d said Kevin Gallagher, who serves on the bargaining committee in Towson. \u201cThey basically wanted to maintain all the rights of not having a union.\u201d\nAudio produced byAdrienne Hurst."

        "fulltext": "The U.S. labor market appears to be slowing. But is the economy still strong enough to avoid recession,as the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, contends? That\u2019s the big question hanging over today\u2019s payroll numbers, which are due for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.\nEmployers added roughly 180,000 jobs last month, economistshave forecast. If correct, those figures would come in well below the 345,000-per-month average over the first quarter.\nForecasters have repeatedly underestimated the strength of the post-pandemic labor market.They have undershot the payroll number 12 straight times, assuming companies would pull back on hiring as the Fed raised borrowing rates to tame inflation. Instead, employers have added roughly 4.5 million jobs since the central bank started increasing interest rates in March 2022. That comes despite waves of layoffs in the tech and retailing sectors, and a banking crisis that has led to the collapse of three regional lenders since March.\nAnother hot jobs number could still influence the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy.The Fed signaled that Wednesday\u2019s rate increase would be its last for a while, but the central bank is determined to lower inflation to its 2 percent target. It has resolved to bring prices under control, \u201ceven at the expense of broader macro conditions, specifically calling out the still tight labor market,\u201d Joe Davis, chief global economist at Vanguard, wrote in a note ahead of today\u2019s report.\nKeep an eye on wages.The Labor Department\u2019s employment cost index recently showed wages growing above expectations last quarter, a factor that could be driving up inflation. So far, Davis said, the Fed has been unable to \u201cmanufacture a wage slowdown.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs is under investigation over its work for Silicon Valley Bank. The Wall Street giantdisclosed in a regulatory filingthat the authorities are looking into it for, in part, the advice it gave the lender to sell a large portfolio of securities at a loss. Within days, SVB had collapsed, touching off a larger crisis for regional banks.\nEd Sheeran wins a big copyright infringement suit.The British musician\u2019s chart-topping hit, \u201cThinking Out Loud,\u201dwas not a rip-offof Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d a New York federal court ruled. The verdict is seen as a victory for songwriters fearing a rash of copycat copyright lawsuits.\nNew York and California investigate the N.F.L.

Separately, The Washington Postreportedthat a conservative judicial activist arranged to pay Mr. Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni Thomas, for consulting work, but left her name off the paperwork.\nShares in a group of closely watched regional lenders are rebounding this morning in premarket trading, led by PacWest and Western Alliance, after getting clobbered on Thursday. But analysts warn the upheaval is far from over, especially as short sellers continue to circle.\nShares in PacWest and Western Alliance plungedeven as the lenders opened up their books to show that their deposit bases were relatively sound. Their finances are not the worry, analysts say. It\u2019s that a crisis of confidence has swept through the sector since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in March, compounding the risk that falling share prices will set off another round of bank runs.\nFrom Wall Street to Washington, short sellers are under scrutiny.These investors, who profit from the falling share price of companies they target, have made roughly $7 billion in 2023 betting against regional banks,according to data from S3 Partners. \u201cThe other scary thing is that the attacks are increasingly looking speculative, but risk becoming self fulfilling,\u201d wrote Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank, in an investor note on Friday.\nThe White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters on Thursday that the Biden administration was closely monitoring \u201cthe short-selling pressures on healthy banks.\u201d\nWall Street wants more.Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, a prominent law firm that hasrepresented businesses facing short-seller attackssuch as the Adani Group, urged the S.E.C. to reinstate a 2008 emergency rule that placed a 15-day short-selling ban on banks. The firm also suggested bringing backthe uptick rule, a trading restriction designed to limit volatile share price drops.\u201cThe country needs a prompt, tailored response by the S.E.C. to coordinated short attacks that are putting our economy at great risk,\u201d the firm wrote in a statement. And,in a letter to the S.E.C. chairman, Gary Gensler, the American Bankers Association urged the regulator \u201cto consider all its existing tools\u201d to protect banks from short sellers.\nMr. Gensler has vowed to keep a close eye on any market misconduct.But an agency spokesman said the S.E.C. was not contemplating measures that would place limits on short selling.\nThe F.D.I.C. reportedly wants big banks to pay up.The agency will introduce in the coming days anew set of feesmeant to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund that was depleted by the bank runs at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, according to Bloomberg. Banks with under $10 billion in assets would be exempt from paying.\nNelson Peltz, the activist investor and C.E.O. of Trian Fund Management, has another idea for how to top up the fund: Customers with more than $250,000 in deposits should pay an insurance premium,he told The Financial Times.\n\u2014Peter Thiel, the tech mogul and prominent Republican donor, advising Gov.

Executives mentioned India 20 times on a conference call with analysts, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O.,called it a priority. \u201cThere are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cook had little to say about artificial intelligence.Thetech earnings season has been dominated by questions about how A.I. fits into companies\u2019 growth plans.

        "fulltext": "iPhone users trying to plan what to wear around the weather on Tuesday might have had some difficulty if they were relying solely on Apple\u2019s weather app.\nApple Weather temporarily went down in the morning, displaying only a city\u2019s name without any forecast \u2014 an apparent repeat of other outages over the past month.\nThe glitch was especially frustrating to iPhone users who previously used Dark Sky, a once-popular weather app that was shut down and folded into theApple Weather appthat comes with iPhones.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but the app appeared to have resumed functioning by midmorning. The company\u2019s support page said inits system status updatesthat some users \u201cwould have experienced issues\u201d with the weather app from 7 a.m. to 11:49 a.m. and marked it as a \u201cresolved issue.\u201d\nNeedless to say, you have other options besides the phone in your hand or pocket.\nRather than relying on an app that provides forecasts for all over the world, you can find one that centers on where you live. Many local news stations have their own weather apps or news apps with weather functions. The local meteorologists behind those apps are likely to know your area well and can provide accurate forecasts.\nIf you\u2019re looking for forecasts from all over the world, consider the Weather Channel or AccuWeather apps. Both go beyond detailed forecasts, providing a look at allergens in forecast areas.\nIf you live in a region that sees severe weather often, and you\u2019re into tracking storms,RadarScopefeatures detailed radars that reflect the intensity of an incoming storm as well as its path. Those detailed radars come with a one-time price of $9.99. Third-party apps such asCarrot WeatherandWeather Underground, which bring their own flavor of meteorology to their subscribers, also offer paid options.\nCarrot Weather, for instance,allows for some customizationto access radar and hour-by-hour temperature predictions. Weather Underground boasts of accessto more than 250,000 weather stationsfor hyperlocal information and an easy-to-navigate design.\nBeyond the basic weather figures, if you live in a city where air quality can be a concern,IQAir AirVisual | Air Quality, which is available on both iOS andAndroid, can keep you updated on measures of air pollution, with what its developers say are data points from more than 10,000 locations in over 100 countries. Want to see a 3-D world pollution map? You can.\nClime, an app found in iOS and Android, provides air quality updates and can bring weather radar images right to your phone, along with other mapped details on wildfires and a built-in hurricane tracker.\nMany TV station meteorologists regularly consult with the National Weather Service, so you might as well go straight to the source.

        "fulltext": "Attention, parents with \u201cscreenagers\u201d: The U.S. government hasissued a public warningthat scrolling through apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat may pose serious risks to your child\u2019s mental health.\nIn a19-page report,Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said on Tuesday that while social media offered some benefits to younger people, including the ability to connect with communities, it also exposed them to potential harms, such as cyberbullying and content that promotes eating disorders, self-harm and other destructive behavior. Social media also hurts exercise,sleepand other activities, he said.\nWhat can parents do? One is to explore potential options to limit children\u2019s screen time. Let\u2019s go through them.\nGoogle\u2019s and Apple\u2019s mobile operating systems offer free tools that can be effective for restricting screen time on smartphones and tablets. These tools allow parents to monitor and set limits on their children\u2019s devices.\nFor Android devices, there\u2019s Family Link, an app that must be downloaded through the Google Play Store. From there, parents can set up a child\u2019s Google account to be monitored with the software. For parents who use iPhones and want to manage their children\u2019s Android phones, there is also a Family Link app for iOS.\nFor iPhones, Apple\u2019s iOS includes a tool called Screen Time, which can also limit the time that someone spends on the device. It can be activated inside the iPhone\u2019s settings app byfollowing Apple\u2019s instructions.\nBoth have pros and cons.\nGoogle\u2019sFamily Linkhas useful features, including the option to reject apps that a child is trying to download and the ability to lock down a device at specific times \u2014 between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., for example, when the child is in bed.\nBut Family Link has a major limitation: When children turn 13, they can choose to \u201cgraduate,\u201d as Google calls it, or lift the restrictions. At that age, the child reaches the minimum age requirement in the United States to create a Google account without parental consent.\nOne workaround for parents who want to continue using the restrictions is to go into the child\u2019s Google account and modify the age to under 13.\nWe also testedApple\u2019s Screen Time featurein a weekslong experiment when the tool was introduced. The feature lets parents create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games, on their children\u2019s iPhones. When the child runs out of time with an app, it locks the child out. The parent can then have a conversation with the child and decide whether to allow additional time on an app.\nThe downside is that parents who are also using the tools to monitor their own phone use can easily bypass the restrictions using their passcode \u2014 and they may realize they are even more addicted to their screens than their children.\nYes.\nThere are also third-party Android and iOS apps that allow parents to manage screen time, though they should be used with caution. Some apps from unknown brands that are marketed as parental control apps have been used by stalkers to track the users\u2019 locations and even eavesdrop on them through their microphones \u2014 a type of malicious software that security researchers call \u201cstalkerware.\u201d\nParents have plenty of resources to find reputable tools that can also work on personal computers, as well as on phones and tablets. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews products for families, found thatQustodioandNetNannygave parents deep control of their children\u2019s devices.\nSocial media companies also offer some features to remind people to stop scrolling. Instagram, for example, has a\u201cTake a Break\u201d reminderthat can be turned on, andTikTok this year introduced its own toolfor limiting time spent inside its app.\nBut the effectiveness of these features has been questioned. Many people, including teenagers, have found that these tools can beeasily overridden."
