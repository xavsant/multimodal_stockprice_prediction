        "title": "Apple Postpones Release of HomePod Speaker",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is putting the brakes on the arrival this year ofHomePod, its much-ballyhooed rival to Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker.\nOn Friday, the company said it would postpone the release of HomePod to early 2018. Apple introduced the speaker this year and was originally set to ship it next month, but the company said it was still working on the product.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple\u2019s breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it\u2019s ready for our customers,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nThe postponement deals a setback to Apple in several ways. The company is already behind rivals like Amazon, which pioneered the market for speakers that can be controlled with voice commands and artificial intelligence with the release of the original Echo in 2015. The Echo, along with the virtual assistant Alexa, became a surprise hit.\nNow Apple will also miss out on selling HomePod during the holiday shopping season, the most lucrative time of year for electronics makers. That may enable rivals to gain even more traction with their products.\nAmazon recentlyreleaseda family of new Echo products with lower prices. The standard-size Echo speaker costs $100, significantly less than its $180 predecessor.\nThat makes the price for Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 $349 \u2014 look especially steep. Apple has said HomePod will deliver superior audio quality. Customers will be able to summon Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, to play music and controlsmart homeaccessories. In addition, people will be able to link multiple HomePods to listen to music throughout the home, similar to products from Sonos."

        "title": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence",
        "fulltext": "The pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.\nNoam Cohen, a former New York Times columnist, opens his polemic,\u201cThe Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball\u201d(New Press), with a quote from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d For Mr. Cohen, \u201cthe self-proclaimed geniuses claiming to serve mankind\u201d who dominate the digital economy are far more dangerous than the benevolent Wizard because of the overwhelming \u201ccollateral damage\u201d wrought as \u201cthese leaders pursue their dreams by centralizing our relationships \u2014 personal, economic, political.\u201d As an antidote to this clear and present danger, above all \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d seeks to \u201cdemystify the origins of the harsh market-based values being pumped out by Silicon Valley, which can seem irresistible.\u201d In Mr. Cohen\u2019s telling, the historic ground zero for the pernicious ideology that has fueled the undue influence of the tech elite is Stanford University.\nAnother former New York Times columnist, Leslie Berlin, has become the project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford. Her book,\u201cTroublemakers: Silicon Valley\u2019s Coming of Age\u201d(Simon & Schuster) opens with the advertising copy from the iconic 1997 Apple commercial that perfectly captures Silicon Valley\u2019s conception of itself. \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers,\u201d it begins before concluding, \u201cBecause the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d\nTo be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201d\nOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.\nNuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.\nIt is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201d\nThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.\nAlthough Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201d\nWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.\nThe tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.\nGiven the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.\nWhen the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.\nSimilarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long."

        "title": "Paradise Papers Show How Misguided the G.O.P. Is on Taxes",
        "fulltext": "A treasure trove of documentsgiven the name of the Paradise Papers was unveiled last week, giving us a clearer idea of how rich people and powerful companies keep their money from the prying eyes of the Internal Revenue Service.\nApple, for example,went huntingfor a new tax haven when Ireland, its former shelter, began cracking down. It got help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters to park its $128 billion stash on the English Channel island of Jersey instead. For years, Nikeheld intellectual property rightsin a subsidiary on tax-free Bermuda, and that subsidiary charged fees to its other headquarters, thus shifting the profits to the island and avoiding taxes on them. Now it does the same with a subsidiary that technically resides nowhere at all. Allergan, Facebook and Uber have all been caught doing the same.\nAppleby, the law firm at the heart of the documents leak, has31,000 American clients, most of whom are what are known as \u201cultra-high-net-worth individuals.\u201d The firm, which has offices in most of the world\u2019s tax havens, helps clients establish trusts and other vehicles for their wealth headquartered on Bermuda to keep the money out of the I.R.S.\u2019s reach.\nAs those named in the papers contend, many of these maneuvers are perfectly legal. But it isn\u2019t a victimless act when companies and the wealthy shield their money from our government.\nThe economistGabriel Zucmanand his colleagues have spent years estimating how much wealth is stashed in low-tax havens and what that means for government coffers. He\u2019s found that63 percentof foreign profits made by American multinational corporations are stuffed in these subsidiaries and accounts, depriving the country of about $70 billion in tax revenue each year.\nWe worry a lot about the cost of social programs in this country, saying we simply can\u2019t afford many things that we know could bring big rewards. But that missing $70 billion from corporate offshore tax avoidance would go a long way. A mere$140 millioncould replace the lead water pipes poisoning children in Flint, Mich. It would cost just anestimated$22.5 billion to end homelessness by providing all needy families with rental assistance. President Barack Obama asked Congress for$75 billionfor his initial universal preschool plan; universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost$98.4 billionover 10 years.\nSenator Bernie Sanders\u2019sCollege for All Actdoesn\u2019t even require the federal government to cover the entire $70 billion cost of public college tuition, but it could if this money were available to the government. Divvying up $70 billion a year to each parent in the country would be a huge steptowardending childhood poverty. And the available pot of money, were offshore tax avoidance not an option, would be even larger if rich individuals were taxed at the rates we all face here at home.\nYet even in the face of the Paradise Papers revelations, Republicans want to lower taxes on big corporations and rich individuals even further.\nBusinesses and the wealthy, the Republicans\u2019 argument goes, will bring their money back to our shores and pay taxes on it if rates are lower. But there are few mechanisms included in their tax package that would actually push either group to do so, rather than keep it abroad and away from taxation.\nThe House package included a new tax on intellectual property royalties multinational corporations pay to offshore affiliates in an effort, the writers say, to keep them from moving money to tax shelters. But, after an outcry from those multinationals,an amendment was addedon Monday that weakens its impact such that it\u2019s worth95 percent less. Senate Republicans, meanwhile,haven\u2019t includedit in their version of the legislation.\nThe House package alsocalls fora one-time tax of 7 percent and 14 percent on offshore earnings that have been stockpiled abroad, and an effective 10 percent rate on \u201chigh returns\u201d to a parent company headquartered in this country from foreign subsidiaries, both efforts to supposedly keep multinationals from avoiding taxes. The Senate versionproposeseven lower rates on offshore earnings. Those rates are far lower than the 20 percent rate Republicans want to levy on corporate profits \u2014 and a huge drop from the current rate of 35 percent \u2014 leaving an incentive to keep money elsewhere.\nThe House plan shifts the country to a territorial tax system, in which companies wouldowetaxes only on money they make here. Money generated abroad in foreign subsidiaries would be subject to the taxes of that country, so they\u2019d have even more incentive to keep it in the low-tax places the Paradise Papers show they\u2019ve already been using.\nNone of these provisions go after wealthy individuals who keep their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes. Instead, the House package hands these same people a variety of giveaways: an enormousloopholevia a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses; the elimination of the alternative minimum tax that ensures they have to pay at least something; and the eradication of the tax on the wealthiest estates.\nThe groups that are already dodging taxes through offshore accounting are the ones that make out with the biggest benefits. According toan analysisby the conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, $1 trillion of the overall $1.5 trillion cost is from cuts for businesses.According to the Tax Policy Center, the highest-income families can expect the biggest reward. The richest 0.1 percent of Americans will get an average $278,370 reduction in their tax bill by 2027, while the poorest two-fifths of the country get around $25.\nThe Republican tax plan would shift more of the tax burden onto those who can least afford to shoulder it and relieve those who are already starving the government of tax revenue. The Paradise Papers shine yet another spotlight on how the rich and powerful game the system to avoid paying what they would otherwise owe. The rest of us suffer for it. Why hand them even more favors?"

        "fulltext": "It happens every year: Apple releases new iPhones, and then hordes of people groan about their older iPhones slowing to a crawl.\nJust look at the recent data. Between September and early November \u2014 when Apple made theiPhone 8available, followed by theiPhone X\u2014 Google searches for the keywords \u201ciPhone slow\u201d jumped about 50 percent.\nThe phenomenon of perceived slowdowns is so widespread that many believe tech companies intentionally cripple smartphones and computers to ensure that people buy new ones every few years. Conspiracy theorists call it planned obsolescence.\nThat\u2019s a myth. While slowdowns happen, they take place for a far less nefarious reason. That reason is a software upgrade.\n[READ NEXT: The iPhone 8 Reviews: What the Critics Say]\n\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for operating system companies to create planned obsolescence,\u201d said Greg Raiz, a former program manager for Microsoft who worked on Windows XP. \u201cIt\u2019s software, and software has various degrees of production bugs and unintended things that happen.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what happens: When tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Google introduce new hardware, they often release upgrades for their operating systems. For example, a few days before the iPhone 8 shipped in September, Apple releasediOS 11as a free software update for iPhones, including the four-year-old iPhone 5S.\nThe technical process of upgrading from an old operating system to a new one \u2014 migrating your files, apps and settings along the way \u2014 is extremely complicated. So when you install a brand-new operating system on an older device, problems may occur that make everything from opening the camera to browsing the web feel sluggish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like changing the plumbing of the house without changing anything else,\u201d saidScott Berkun, an author and a former manager for Microsoft who oversaw engineers that worked on Windows operating systems and web browsers.\nThe good news is that because tech companies are not intentionally neutering your devices, there are remedies for when you think your three-year-old iPhone or your seven-year-old Windows computer has become slow or short-lived. Here\u2019s a guide to speeding up your troubled gadgets, based on interviews with information technology professionals and operating system experts.\nTech companies make it simple to upgrade to a new operating system by pressing an \u201cupdate\u201d button, which seamlessly migrates all your apps and data over. While that\u2019s convenient, it isn\u2019t the best way to ensure that things will continue running smoothly.\nA better practice is backing up all your data and purging everything from the device before installing the new operating system. This \u201cclean install\u201d works more reliably because the engineers developing operating systems were able to test this condition more easily, Mr. Raiz said.\n[READ NEXT: What You Need to Know About The iPhone X]\nLet\u2019s say, for example, you have an iPhone 6 with 100 apps installed, four email accounts and 2,000 photos. It is more likely that a quality-assurance engineer tested installing a new operating system on a blank iPhone 6, rather than an iPhone 6 with the same setup as yours.\nSo if you want to minimize the chances of something going awry, resist the easy update path and opt for a clean install. For smartphones, I recommend backing up your data to your computer. For computers, you couldback up your data to an online serviceor a portable drive. After the operating system installation is complete, you can then safely restore your data and apps to the device from the backup.\nSometimes you can do some light maintenance to speed up your device. Over the long term, an operating system accumulates system files, settings, logs and other data; I.T. experts call this \u201ccruft.\u201d This can bog down your device.\nFor computers, there are some apps for cleaning up your system. Mac users can download a free app calledOnyx, and Windows users can run acleanup utilityincluded in the system. For iPhones and Android devices, you can open the settings app and selectreset settings. (Just make sure you back up first in case there are important settings you may lose.)\n[READ NEXT:The iPhone X is Cool. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Ready for It]\nHere\u2019s something many people don\u2019t realize: Just because your iPhone or Samsung phone has 64 gigabytes of storage doesn\u2019t mean you should fill it all the way up. The device will generally run faster if more of its storage is available.\nThat\u2019s partly because your device needs space to move data around and download software updates. But it\u2019s also related to how the storage technology works inside smartphones and modern laptops.\nSmartphones and newer laptops rely on flash storage, which stores data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When data is stored on a flash drive, it is scattered across the drive. So when you are pulling data to open an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.\n\u201cIf you fill these things up, it doesn\u2019t get to operate as well,\u201d said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. Mr. Denslow said a good rule of thumb is to buy more storage than you think you will use. If you think you are going to use 64 gigabytes on an iPad, for example, buy the 256-gigabyte model.\nI also recommend freeing up a huge amount of space by managing your photo library in the cloud. You can upload all your albums to a service likeGoogle Photosand periodically purge all the images from the device itself. I did this recently on my iPhone 7 that was nearly full and seemed to be slowing down; purging the photos freed up about 50 gigabytes of data, and the iPhone feels as good as new.\nYour device may seem slower for reasons unrelated to the device. Mr. Denslow, the technician, said many apps relied on an internet connection, so a shoddy Wi-Fi router might be the real bottleneck.\nTo get a nice boost, invest in a modern Wi-Fi system. I recommend products like Google WiFi and Eero, which are so-calledmesh networking systemsthat help you seamlessly set up multiple Wi-Fi stations to get a strong signal throughout the home. They are pricey, but upgrading your infrastructure will do more than buying a new phone.\n\u201cInstead of spending $1,000 on a phone every year, spend $500 on networking,\u201d Mr. Denslow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it provides more benefits over a long period of time.\u201d\n[READ NEXT:The iPhone 8: A Worthy Refinement Before The Next Generation]\nAt the end of the day, there are many reasons your device may feel slow. New operating systems carry more powerful features that were designed to work better on new devices. In addition, developers of third-party apps typically prioritize making software for newer handsets, and sometimes they even discontinue support for old gadgets. If there are important tasks that your older device cannot do proficiently, consider an upgrade.\nMr. Raiz, the former Microsoft program manager, said he had recently encountered problems after updating his iPhone 6S to iOS 11. Some functions, like the ability to search for an app, no longer worked. Resetting the device\u2019s settings fixed the problem, but he said he would most likely buy a new iPhone soon anyway to keep up with the latest technologies.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do if your device is multiple release cycles behind,\u201d he said.\n[Want more advice and tips on the technology changing how you live?

        "title": "Can You Draw the Starbucks Logo Without Cheating? Probably Not.",
        "fulltext": "The Apple logo was green. The symbol for Foot Locker was a sneaker. And Starbucks? The famous siren on every frappuccino and chai latte was not exactly the friendliest-looking sea dweller.\nWhen 156 people were recently asked if they could draw some of the world\u2019s most iconic brand logos from memory, some of their recreations were laughably off the mark. But something wasn\u2019t so funny for the companies that have tried to sear their brands into the minds of consumers everywhere: For 10 iconic brands including Wal-Mart, Burger King, and Ikea, the overall percentage of near-perfect drawings was just 16 percent.\nThat means fewer than one-fifth of the participants could remember the correct positioning of the familiar blue-and-red rectangle of Domino\u2019s, or the three black stripes of Adidas. Even Target \u2014 whose emblem involves a simple red bull\u2019s-eye above the brand name \u2014 confused people: 41 percent forgot the number of circles.\n\u201cPeople spend so much on marketing to get people to recognize and remember their brand,\u201d said Nelson James, co-founder and chief operating officer of the e-commerce site Signs.com, which led the study. \u201cWe just wanted to know \u2014 does it work?\u201d\nThe answer is that being able to recognize a logo and being able to recreate it appear to be vastly different things. Although participants thought they had a good grasp on the designs, expressing confidence that they could redraw them without seeing them, their actual reproductions proved otherwise.\nLogos are what companies use to help customers identify the brand, and choices like design, color and font are \u201ccritical,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cHaving these logos where you can\u2019t correctly recall details means something.\u201d\nIn an age of digital saturation, perhaps many of these carefully constructed logos are not as memorable as we think. A study conducted in 2014 by psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles similarly asked 85 participants if they could draw the familiar Apple logo from memory. More than half the subjects even identified themselves as strictly Apple users. Yet only one could draw the icon perfectly, as scored by a 14-point rubric.\nShould Apple be worried? Not necessarily. Dr. Alan Castel, a psychology professor who was one of the authors of the study, said that the inability to accurately recall such daily ephemera as a brand logo really might be a beneficial quirk of our memory system.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t burden our memory with things we don\u2019t need to know,\u201d Dr. Castel said. He referred to a famous study in 1979 by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Jager Adams, in which participants were asked to draw the face of a penny. Most struggled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you really need to recall something from memory,\u201d Dr. Castel said. \u201cYou simply recognize it, you see it on an item or a computer. You like it, you buy it.\u201d\nStill, in recent years, brands like Uber, YouTube, and Dropbox have redesigned their logos, trying to make them more simple, more intuitive or more easily recognizable. In 2014, Airbnb announced its new logo, which it calls the B\u00e9lo, in a video that noted that the design was easy for customers to draw.\nPaul Stafford, co-founder of DesignStudio, the agency that led the rebranding effort, said that Airbnb envisioned people renting out their homes and putting their own spin on the B\u00e9lo \u2014 on everything from magazines to bathrobes and shampoo bottles, like a hotel.\n\u201cWe had to create something that was so simple that everybody could draw it and interpret it themselves,\u201d Mr. Stafford said. \u201cThey also wanted people to be sharing it. Right down to the people tattooing the mark on their arms.\u201d\nMr. Stafford, however, said that he did not think that being able to draw a logo necessarily indicates how well it resonates.\nPeople often see logos so much that they feel like they know it. But they rarely critique it or study it enough to reproduce fine details \u2014 a phenomenon that psychologists like Dr. Castel call \u201cinattentional amnesia.\u201d When something is seen frequently, the information ends up being more easily ignored or forgotten. For instance, Dr. Castel said he would be curious how accurately people could recall the fine details of a stop sign.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s red, but the more subtle features \u2014 the exact shape of it, whether there\u2019s a white border around it \u2014 these are things we often miss, even though we\u2019ve seen it millions of times,\u201d he said.\nPerhaps the most surprising result of the Signs.com study was the company that fared best: Ikea. The Swedish furniture maker with the distinctive blue-and-yellow logo plastered across its giant retail stores was redrawn near-perfectly by 30 percent of the participants.\nAsa Nordin, who is a senior coordinator of Ikea trademarks at Inter Ikea Systems, said the unique shape, colors, and longevity of the logo \u2014 it has been around since 1983 \u2014 most likely contributed to its memorability.\n\u201cThe logo is merely the symbol for what the Ikea brand promises and delivers,\u201d Ms. Nordin said in an email. \u201cThe logo shall mirror that \u2018promise\u2019 as near as possible, as well as stand out from its surroundings. To be consistent and unique is clearly a strength of a logo.\u201d\nThe hardest logo to draw was Starbucks, which was redesigned in 2011. It is also arguably the most complex.\n\u201cSimplicity is key,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a new concept. But this definitely corroborates that idea.\u201d\nBut is any logo overwhelmingly memorable? Mr. James is now curious. Initially, he resisted putting an overly straightforward and ubiquitous symbol in his study, like those of McDonald\u2019s or Nike.\n\u201cWe thought it was too simple,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cBut, I wonder.\u201d"

        "title": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "The tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?\nFor a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.\nBecause these companies control the world\u2019s most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations. That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter,testified before Congressabout how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election.\nYet ever since I started writing about what I call theFrightful Five, some have said my very premise is off base. I have argued that the companies\u2019 size and influence pose a danger. But another argument suggests the opposite \u2014 that it\u2019s better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure. In other words, wouldn\u2019t you rather deal with five horse-size Zucks than 100 duck-size technoforces?\nThe insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today. Given all the ways that tech can go wrong \u2014 as we are seeing in theRussia influence scandal\u2014 isn\u2019t it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire?\nThat\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.\nTech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.\nOne benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.\nConsider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.\nToday, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.\nThis does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\n\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201d\nOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?\nIt was an odd line. As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed tocontrol the fortunes of innovative start-ups. But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group \u2014 each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.\nThis dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201d\nYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.\nAt the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\n\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201d\nThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.\nBut it wasn\u2019t inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States. And it\u2019s not obvious that will remain the case \u2014 the top tech companies of tomorrowmight easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European. But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values.\nYes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helpedpush regulators internationally to try to limit their power. But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy. At least it\u2019s our own giants that we have to fear.\nI don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.\nAs I said, tech is messy."

        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Facebook Under Fire in Washington",
        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nFarhad: Good morning, Mike! Are you having a good time in our nation\u2019s capital? I saw on Instagram that you got to ride the Senate subway. That sounds fun, but it really makes me doubt the wisdom of the Capitol Police.\nMike:I picked the perfect time of year to come here. Leaves are changing colors, the air is brisk but not cold, and the smell of pumpkin spice abounds. I think I love D.C.\nAlso, you jest, but I was stopped by Capitol Police multiple times trying to get into the Senate Press gallery. I don\u2019t look that suspicious, do I?\nFarhad:Hmm, no comment. O.K., let\u2019s get to tech.\nFarhad: The big news happened there in D.C. Executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter appeared before lawmakers looking into claims that the Russian government used their platforms to influence the 2016 election. Among other things, the lawmakers released details on the scores of ads purchased by Russian operatives.\nTheads are wild. The Russians\u2019 primary political goal seems to have been to create discord in American society; they took just about every side of every issue, promoting protests over religion, politics and other issues.\nBeyond the ads, though, did we learn anything new from the hearings?\nMike:First, let me say attending House and Senate hearings is surreal. Members of Congress love to have aides blow up tweets and Facebook posts 1,000 percent, plaster them on big pieces of poster board, and then use them as visual aids in the hearing. I spent an hour looking at anadvertisement of Satan fighting Jesusin a hearing this week.\nAnyway, my takeaway: The whole ordeal was mostly orchestrated pageantry \u2014 a way for lawmakers to give tech execs a very public, rather embarrassing dressing down \u2014 with a few new facts and insights scattered throughout. For one, all three companies said the reach of Russia-backed ads stretched much further than they had originally known. Facebook estimated some 150 million people were served the ads across Facebook and Instagram. That\u2019s a lot!\nBut more than that, I found it fruitful that some members of Congress seemed to recognize the more pervasive issue of so-called organic content. That is, the posts that you and I and anyone else can create and post to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Those are much more difficult to track, and we still don\u2019t know the extent to which Russia-linked organic content spread across all of these platforms.\nFarhad:I do wonder where this leads. The tech execs were all contrite and vowed to police themselves better. I noticed that even in Facebook\u2019s earnings statement on Wednesday \u2014 in which thecompany boasted record profits, suggesting that the scandal hasn\u2019t hurt its bottom line \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the business and instead focused on the political climate: \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.\nI wonder if this contrition will be enough to head off any strong regulation. I suspect it will.\nMike: Probably. And note that in the hearings this week, none of the tech companies said theywould back the Honest Ads Act, the bill senators are proposing that could impose stricter regulations on digital advertising. So we\u2019ll see how far the bill goes after this week.\nFarhad:Mike, how excited are you for the new iPhone? Did you stay up late to order one?\nMike:The only things I stay up late for are Radiohead concert ticket sales and New Year\u2019s Eve. So, my answer is no.\nFarhad:I didn\u2019t either, so mine is likely to ship in a month\u2019s time \u2014 long after the first ones hit the shelves this weekend. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be so left out. In previous years, Apple has given tech journalists a week to look over its latest iPhone. But it completely changed the plan with the coveted X, causing a lot of heartache for us whiny writers.\nApple gave some outlets \u2014 including TechCrunch, Buzzfeed and Backchannel, which is part of Wired \u2014 a week with the device. But many others, including The Times, were given just a day with the new phones. Meanwhile, Apple also offered review devices to several YouTube stars and some out-of-left-field choices, like the political journalist Mike Allen.\nMike:Don\u2019t tell the others, butMike Allen\u2019s reviewwas my favorite. He gave the phone to his nephew, who is more tech savvy than him, and relayed what the kid loved about it. I\u2019m totally asking a cousin to write my next Facebook story.\nFarhad:Ordinarily the question of who gets to review the iPhone would be too inside baseball for us. But asJake Swearingen at New York points out, Apple\u2019s shifting review policies are a good way to document how much the media business has changed since the original iPhone came out in 2007.\nThat year, Apple provided early review units to big print outlets \u2014 the Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Newsweek. In 2017, Apple has the pick of any outlet it wants; it knows that a review will get a lot of traffic on virtually any site, so it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it chooses an established media brand or some YouTuber with a fan base.\nMike: I loved Jake\u2019s piece! Aside from chuckling at the angry posts from reviewers who felt slighted, it was a clear insight into how Apple believes people buy things these days, and how the older model of going to a select few reviewers perhaps isn\u2019t the only way to drive purchasing decisions.\nFrankly, I agree! I don\u2019t really read traditional consumer reviews anymore, and I suspect the crowd for deep tech and gadgety reviews is growing smaller over time.\nFarhad:I guess we should talk about the actual substance of these reviews. They were mostly positive. After two days of using it, our colleagueBrian X. Chen foundthat the phone was \u201cincredibly fast and took exceptional photos,\u201d and that the face-detection unlock system mostly worked very well. But like several other reviewers, Brian said the X is not a must for most people. You\u2019ll probably get by just fine with a cheaper phone.\nMike: I\u2019m not going to buy one because my phone is only a year old. Also, I think if I try to unlock a device with my face I\u2019ll break the entire phone.\nFarhad: O.K., have fun in D.C. Say hi to the president for me!\nMike:Adi\u00f3s!\nFarhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column calledState of the Art. Mike Isaac covers Facebook, Uber and Twitter.

        "title": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Incoherent Stance on Competition",
        "fulltext": "Peter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.\nIf only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.\nOn the one hand,the F.C.C. has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can\u2019t pay the fees.\nOn the other hand, just a day before the F.C.C. announcement, the Justice Department communicated starkly different values. Announcing its opposition to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it used an argument based on the very kind of thinking that\u2019s often used todefendnet neutrality: The department made the case that if the merger were allowed to go through, AT&T might favor the Time Warner content it would own post-merger, to the disadvantage of rivals.\nThe incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.\nFor instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.\nIt could be that the notion of net neutrality that the F.C.C. seems determined to jettison should also be applied to media monopolies. Whenthe European Union fined Google $2.7 billionin June for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals, it was essentially for a violation of neutrality: The union noted that Google was both a service provider (that users could use to conduct searches) and a content provider (that provided its own restaurant, hotel and other product recommendations) and was favoring its own content in search results over that of rivals that also provided recommendations, like Yelp.\nOf course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.\nMr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.\nBut that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?\nThe answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.\nFor the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.\nThe administration can\u2019t have it both ways."

        "title": "Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From \u2018Social\u2019 Label",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover.\nMembers of Congress grilledthe executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter this week in a trio of hearings focused on the role that social media played in advancing a Russian disinformation campaign before the 2016 election. Google\u2019s representative at two of the hearings, Kent Walker, the company\u2019s general counsel, made a point of distinguishing the search giant from its internet brethren. Repeatedly and unequivocally, he answered questions at the hearings by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not a social network.\u201d\nTech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week\u2019s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry\u2019s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling.\n\u201cWithout sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. \u201cThe people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they\u2019ve designed.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry\u2019s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don\u2019t blame us.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company\u2019s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.\n\u201cThe bigger issue is that some of these tools are used to divide people, to manipulate people, to get fake news to people in broad numbers, and so to influence their thinking,\u201d said Mr. Cookin an interview with NBC News.\nFrank Shaw, head of communications at Apple\u2019s longtime rival, Microsoft, praised Mr. Cook\u2019s commentsin a Twitter post,saying that Mr. Cook had framed the issue \u201cperfectly.\u201d Last year, Microsoft did purchase LinkedIn, a career-oriented social network, for $26.2 billion, but that site appears to have played little role in Russia\u2019s influence efforts.\nWith the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, \u201csocial\u201d became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.\nBut as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.\n\u201cThe mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bayer.\nGoogle, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate \u2014 largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.\nThe company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the \u201csocial spine\u201d of Google in public statements at the time.\nThere also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut \u2014 popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.\nGoogle+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.\nGoogle has often tried to fashion YouTube, its sprawling video service, into something more like a social network in hopes of keeping visitors interested. Last year, YouTube addedwhat it called its \u201cCommunity\u201d product, essentially features intended to inspire users to interact more with one another.\nGoogle said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were \u201cfrequently posted to other social media platforms,\u201d Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.\nFacebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.\nTwitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they\u2019re the linchpin\u201d of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.\nIn his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company\u2019s services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.\nHe also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.\n\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat differently positioned because we\u2019re not primarily a social network,\u201d Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. \u201cMany users are not logged in when they access content, so it\u2019s difficult to know who sees what.\u201d\nStill, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.\nTake the example of Facebook. Despite having been assailed for weeks about the role it played in the 2016 election,Facebook reported another blockbuster financial quarteron Wednesday, shattering analysts\u2019 expectations with more than $4.7 billion in profit in the third quarter. That was a 79 percent increase from the same period one year ago.\n\u201cIf you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mr. Dawson. \u201cI think it would still like to have one.\u201d"
