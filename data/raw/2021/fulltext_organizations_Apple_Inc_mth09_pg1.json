        "title": "Stocks decline for a second week as September\u2019s slow retreat continues.",
        "fulltext": "Stocks on Wall Street tumbled again on Friday, with the S&P 500 marking a second consecutive weekly drop and extending a slow decline that has been weighing on the stock market all month.\nThe index fell 0.9 percent, for its eighth daily drop since it hit a record on Sept. 2. The Nasdaq composite also fell 0.9 percent, while stocks in Europe were also broadly lower.\nMining, chemical and resources companies led the declines, and oil prices also slipped, moves that usually reflect concerns about global growth. Also lower on Friday were the largest technology stocks \u2014 Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. Along with Amazon, they make up more than 20 percent of the market value of the S&P 500 and have an extraordinary amount of pull over the direction of the stock market. All four were down by nearly 2 percent or more, and Amazon was also lower.\nThe decline of S&P 500 since its record, about 2.3 percent in total over two weeks, hasn\u2019t been dramatic, but it marks a clear shift in the market\u2019s tone. Before this month, Wall Street had been enjoying a seven-month run thathad lifted stocks more than 20 percent, as investors seemed to shrug off any bad news.\nAnalysts have struggled point to any single reason for the September funk, but they do point to several factors that could be worrying investors as they consider what to do next. Here are a few.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision on bond buying:The central bank is holding its next policy meeting next week, and it is expected to send a clear signal on when it plans to start winding down its purchases of government bonds. That program, an emergency response to the pandemic, is meant to keep cash flowing through the economy.\nChanging expectations about the economy:Even if the U.S. economy seems to be weathering the resurgence of Covid, the latest data has fallen short of analysts\u2019 expectations. One measure of whether reported economic numbers are better or worse than analysts expected, theCitigroupU.S. Economic Surprise Index, is at its most-negative level since the start of the pandemic last year.\nSupply chain trouble:The outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus was particularly serious in Asia, and it delayed the rebuilding of supply lines from manufacturers to American companies. In some cases it made the snarls worse.\nChina\u2019s changing regulations:Investors have grown wary of a wave of new restrictions from Beijing on subjects like online gaming and data sharing by tech companies. The latest blow came to American casino operators that count on Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers, for their profits. After the local government there signaled that it would begin to tighten restrictions, shares of companies like Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands plunged.\nA plan to tax buybacks:Senate Democrats seem to be coalescing around a new tax on stock buybacks by companies, something that could potentially weaken a key source of demand for stocks.\nThe debt ceiling:Not raising the U.S. debt limit would effectively amount to a default on the U.S. government\u2019s debts, and yet wrangling and rhetoric around it are likely to worsen in coming weeks. Almost no one expects that the government will actually default, but past debt-ceiling fights, such as a particularly noisy one in 2011, have proved unsettling to investors sending stocks sharply lower. Analysts say that until the ceiling is raised, investor exuberance could be hard to find."

        "title": "A Sept. 11 Conundrum",
        "fulltext": "A lot of important words are being written about the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on America, marking that major and tragic turning point in history.\nFor those of us who lived through the harrowing time in 2001, it is an event that\u2019s indelibly seared into our memories, having taken in so many devastating images and videos \u2014 and raw feelings.\n\u201cNever forget\u201d became a rallying cry to counter the heinous terrorist attacks. And we never have. Yet, today, it\u2019s so easy to forget what\u2019s most important to us.\nSocial media has a lot to do with that. As hard as it may be to imagine, social networks weren\u2019t around in 2001. Now they seem to govern every news event we experience \u2014 from elections to troop withdrawals to how we think about thatsuitcase scene in \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d News flies by on social media, we obsess over it, then we move on.\nSocial media records, chronicles, broadcasts. It forms, and then warps, our reactions and, more important, our memories. For example, the links between services like Twitter and Facebook and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol seem impossible to unwind. It\u2019s a fetid chicken-and-egg relationship that we will be sorting out for years.\nToday, when a tweet drops in the digital forest, is there anyone whodoes nothear it?\nThe early social media companies, now gone, came along in the years after Sept. 11. Friendster was founded in 2002, MySpace in 2003. They were followed by Facebook in 2004 and YouTube and Reddit in 2005. Twitter arrived in 2006. Snapchat did not exist until 2011. Nor, in 2001, did we have our mobile video cameras that allow us to feed the hungry internet beast.\nWhich is to say, social media had zero influence on the events of Sept. 11.\nI brought up these issues with the former Times columnist Jen Senior on my weekly Twitter Spaces social audio hour a few days ago. She recently publishedan articlein The Atlantic about a family friend, Bobby McIlvaine, who died at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 that explores the longtime repercussions that his last analog journal had on his loved ones.\nMcIlvaine\u2019s private words written on paper turned out to be the final thoughts of a young man before he dashed out of his apartment. They are a stark contrast to the highly performative nature of self-expression that seeps into everything today.\nIs there a thought in 2021 that is not made public? Is there an idea that remains unrevealed? Is there any utterance that can escape being chewed over by the masses?\nThe answers to those questions are a definite no, but it\u2019s worth remembering that it was not always like that.\nWhat I did not expect in reading Senior\u2019s narrative was that the internet reared its ugly head in the aftermath of McIlvaine\u2019s death. His father, Bob Sr., coped with the tragedy of his son\u2019s demise at 26 years old by diving headlong into the toxic pool of conspiracy theories.\nSept. 11 is perhaps the first major event that morphed into the kind of massive and intractable online conspiracy theory that has become so common today. While there were certainly others before \u2014 the moon landing, the Kennedy assassination, alligators in the sewer, and more \u2014 9/11 came right as social tech tools became popularized. Like many others, Bob McIlvaine Sr. was sucked into the conspiracy morass during his journey of grief, as he tried to figure out what happened to his son.\nSenior writes about how the ever more radicalized father became quickly enmeshed in all kinds of online discussion groups and forums.\n\u201cMy whole thesis \u2014 everything I jump into now \u2014 is based upon his injuries,\u201d McIlvaine told Senior, referring to his son. \u201cLooking at the body, I came to the conclusion that he was walking in and bombs went off.\u201d\nSenior then writes: \u201cA controlled demolition, he means. That is how he thinks Bobby died that day, and how the towers eventually fell: from a controlled demolition. It was an inside job, planned by the U.S. government, not to justify the war in Iraq \u2014 that was a bonus \u2014 but really, ultimately, to destroy the 23rd floor, because that\u2019s where the F.B.I. was investigating the use of gold that the United States had unlawfully requisitioned from the Japanese during World War II, which it then leveraged to bankrupt the Soviet Union. The planes were merely for show.\u201d\nOh. No. No. No, sir. But it sounds familiar, right?\nVaccines that include chips embedded by Bill Gates? Election fraud allegations that span from China to Brazil to Rudy Giuliani? All of these are digitized rabbit holes that got their practice runs with Sept. 11 conspiracy theories.\nThese are not, of course, the kind of memories we should be holding on to. Instead, we should think of promising lives of endless possibility, like Bobby McIlvaine\u2019s, cut tragically short. And that is the only thing we should honor as we move forward.\nRight now, according to numerous sources, the Federal Trade Commission is twisting itself into knots over whether it should block Amazon\u2019s acquisition of MGM. The e-commerce juggernaut\u2019s $8.45 billion planned purchase of the Hollywood studio that owns the James Bond franchise was certainly an aggressive move, and many think Amazon should not be allowed to suck up the property at all.\nWell, they\u2019re dead wrong. While I am usually in the regulate-them-all group when it comes to tech, it\u2019s really a mistake to try to make a case about too much power when it is a weak one.\nThe entertainment space has never been more competitive, as media and tech giants pour huge resources and attention into the sector. So, it\u2019s natural for Amazon to want to grab some stuff, too, which is why it is paying \u2014 overpaying, many think \u2014 for MGM.\nThat, of course, is a lot different from the retail space where the growing power of Amazon is most definitely problematic.\nFor a long time, whenever anyone made this obvious observation, the company insisted that it controlled only a small portion of the overall retail marketplace. A few years back, I got regular calls from Amazon\u2019s PR folks whenever I made even the slightest comment in public that the company sure was getting big, so much so that I thought they had a tracker on me that went off every time I said the word \u201cBezos.\u201d\nNot so much anymore. The numbers are in and there\u2019s zero question that Amazon sits atop the retail universe like the commerce Godzilla that we all know it has become.\nFueled by the pandemic, theSeattle-based company this week surpassedWalmart in worldwide sales outside China for the 12 months that ended in June, according to FactSet. Amazon\u2019s revenue topped out at $610 billion, while Walmart garnered sales of $566 billion for the year ending in July. And after hiring 500,000 new workers since the beginning of last year, it is likely to soon become the biggest private employer in the United States, too, passing Walmart\u2019s 1.6 million workers.\nWhile Alibaba holds its crown as the top retailer worldwide, largely because neither Walmart nor Amazon truly competes in China, it\u2019s clear that U.S. regulators just got some nice numbers to use in their ongoing scrutiny of the company. Because while online shopping represents only about one-seventh of U.S. retail sales, it\u2019s growing like crazy, a trend that has exploded during the pandemic.\nNow Amazon is coming for the analog, too, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal that it\u2019s moving intophysical retail in a bigger way. That\u2019s perhaps not surprising considering its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017, which has been followed by a bunch of other analog experiments, like Amazon Books, Amazon 4-Star gadget shops, Amazon Go convenience stores and now the larger Amazon Fresh.\nIn fact, a new Amazon Fresh opened in my neighborhood of Logan Circle in Washington, D.C., recently, only a few blocks from a Whole Foods. Unlike the older store, it is using its arguably cool \u201cjust walk out\u201d tech, where you can skip checkout by scanning a QR code on Amazon\u2019s app.\nIn the same way it\u2019s creeped forward from books to other products since its founding, Amazon is next going to try some department stores to sell clothing, housewares, electronics and other goods. It\u2019s perfect vulture timing since so many department stores, already on the steep decline, have been further kneecapped by the pandemic. There is a lot of commercial space for the taking, at low rates, and a slow but steady return of customers to the physical stores.\nMost of all, reimagining bricks and mortar, while also figuring out ways to glean even more tasty data from shoppers, presents great opportunities for Amazon. This strategy also gives it entree to many more important brands, especially in high-end fashion, which have been loath to sell online next to, say, Amazon batteries.\nA long time ago, I did an interview with the Walmart chief executive, Doug McMillon, who told me that he could envision big-box retailers like his \u2014 a Walmart supercenter clocks in at about 180,000 square feet \u2014 as 10,000 square-foot spaces where people could look at stuff and then order goods to be delivered to their homes instantly.\nIt was a great vision, for sure. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s probably going to be Amazon that pulls it off.\nBut the movie business \u2014 especially the streaming space that includes NBC\u2019s Peacock, Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix, Apple TV+ and Paramount+ and more \u2014 is another beast altogether. Thus, efforts by progressives to shove Amazon in a one-monopolist-fits-all suit is going to hurt the more salient efforts to rein it in.\nAmazon certainly does not dominate the video content space, and regulating as if it might someday would be a big unforced error by the newly installed chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Kahn, who made her bones making a case against Amazon as a retail and marketplace monopolist as a law student.\nAnd if she does move against Amazon in the entertainment arena, courts will \u2014 quite correctly \u2014 smack the F.T.C. back, as they did in its initial filings about Facebook.\nLet me be explicit: If you\u2019re going to try to regulate giant tech companies \u2014 an admirable goal \u2014 you best not shoot and miss. The MGM deal is not anticompetitive. It\u2019s just not.\nFacebookannounced Thursday that it was doing its version of Snapchat Spectacles\u2014 proving my theory once again that the Snap chief executive, Evan Spiegel, is the chief product officer of Facebook.\nFacebook, the shoplifting social media company, has partnered with the sunglass legend Ray-Ban on a \u201cnew line of eyewear, called Ray-Ban Stories. They can take photos, record video, answer phone calls and play music and podcasts.\u201d\nSnapchat and Google have long trudged down this road with mixed results. I am not against the effort, but I am not thrilled that Facebook is using a brand that I have made my own for 30 years now.\nWhile the new Facebook-whatever is using Ray-Ban\u2019s Wayfarer model, and not my beloved aviators, the fact that I never got offered a test pair feels like I\u2019m being trolled. In any case, let me say, having been there at the dawn of Google Glass, this won\u2019t work this time, either.\nThe why is complex \u2014 I will relate my theories on this in a future newsletter \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that the idea of Facebook selling what is essentially a surveillance device might be an issue of concern in 2021.\nI noted in my article on Tuesday that Apple was likely to have a\u201cmodified win\u201din its case against Epic Games. The verdict is in. While Apple was not declared a monopolist, and won on all but one count, including on the point that Epic, the maker of Fortnite, was in breach of contract, what Apple lost on was also significant.\nAccording to the ruling by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the company can no longer force developers to use only in-app purchasing. Apple has already been moving to this inevitability with the settlement of a class-action lawsuit recently, so it seems unlikely that the company will appeal further. This seems like a perfect ruling, cutting the app baby in a way that seems fair to all.\nFor those who missed this little announcement in my Tuesday newsletter: I\u2019m hosting a virtual event on Tues., Sept. 14, for Times subscribers. I\u2019m planning to chat with the Times reporter Maggie Haberman and Representative Cori Bush of Missouri. You can RSVPhere.\nHave feedback? Send a note toswisher-newsletter@nytimes.com."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s new iPhone 13 is better, but not by much.",
        "fulltext": "It is a story that now happens just about every September: Apple introduced new iPhones that have slightly bigger screens, faster speeds and better cameras \u2014 but no new major advances.\nIn a prerecorded infomercial,Appleexecutives framed the improvements in the new iPhone 13 as significant innovations, but they result in a device that looks and performs much like the iPhones that Apple touted last year.\nApple said the new iPhones have a brighter screen, longer battery life and more powerful cameras and computer processors. Having already pushed the screen nearly to the edge of the device, Apple slightly increased its size by reducing the small notch at the top of the screen. Apple kept the same flat-edge design of the phone that it has used in other recent models.\nApple is hoping that by adding new features and making slight design improvements, customers will keep shelling out more money. It is a strategy that has worked for a long time. The iPhone, now in its 14th year, remains one of the world\u2019s best-selling products and the centerpiece of Apple\u2019s business. Over the first half of the year, the latest period available, Apple said iPhone sales rose 58 percent to $87.5 billion over the same period a year earlier.\nThat success is partly because Apple has built an intensely loyal customer base, and also because it has designed its products in a way that makes it difficult for customers to switch to the competition, like Samsung and Google. The iPhone also remains among the best smartphones on the market in several areas, including camera technology and screen resolution.\nApple spent much of its advertisement showing off the iPhone\u2019s new \u201ccinematic mode,\u201d a camera technology that can automatically follow and focus on a subject, resulting in videos that more closely resemble professional movies.\nApple\u2019s emphasis on advanced camera technology in its iPhones is a reflection of its hefty investment in artificial intelligence to compete with Google.\nA few years ago, Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones used the search giant\u2019s prowess in artificial intelligence to leapfrog the iPhone\u2019s camera capabilities. But over the last few years, Apple made several aggressive moves to catch up, acquiring several A.I. start-ups and hiring a top A.I. executive from Google, John Giannandrea. Partly as a result, its newer iPhone cameras have received higher ratings than the Pixel.\nAs in past years, Apple unveiled two separate versions of the new iPhone: the entry-level iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and the more expensive and advanced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple largely kept prices flat from last year\u2019s models.\nThe dominance of the iPhone has also brought Apple increased scrutiny and criticism from app developers, regulators and lawmakers. Having an iPhone app has become a necessity for many companies, which has enabled Apple to build an enormous business by charging a commission of up to 30 percent on some app sales.\nBut that practice has been at the center of legal and regulatory challenges in recent years. Last week,a federal judge ordered Appleto let app developers direct customers to other payment methods in their apps, which could enable them to avoid Apple\u2019s commission. Regulators in the United States, Europe and India are also investigating Apple\u2019s App Store practices.\nBrian X. Chencontributed reporting."

        "title": "Voice Assistants Don\u2019t Understand Us. They Should.",
        "fulltext": "Time after time, I\u2019ve tried to use Apple\u2019s Siri or its speech-to-text function, only for it to fail to understand my stutter.\nFor people like me, the voice technology that is a part of so many people\u2019s everyday lives can feel all but useless. Telling Alexa to play a song or asking Siri for directions can be almost impossible whenever prolonged (\u201cAaaaaaaaa-lexa\u201d) or chopped (\u201cHey \u2026 Si \u2026 ri!\u201d) sounds cause the devices to misunderstand my commands or stop listening altogether.\nAccording to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, about7.5 million peoplein the United Statesalso \u201chave trouble using their voices\u201d because of disorders likestutteringor speech-altering conditions caused bycerebral palsy.\nVoice assistants could radically improve our lives. Their inaccessibility could even be dangerous for those with mobile disabilities, who could rely on voice assistants to call for help. Instead, they often fail to understand us.\n\u201cMy speech is slow, and I slur some words,\u201d said Dagmar Munn, a retired wellness instructor who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. She uses a walker with wheels and has dysarthria, in which weakened muscles lead to impaired speech. She said she had trouble using Alexa and Google Assistant, technologies that, as her condition progresses, she may rely on even more for help with tasks like adjusting the temperature in her home and turning on the lights.\n\u201cAlthough I am careful to enunciate and carefully pronounce a command, the device stops listening by my second word. I just can\u2019t speak fast enough to satisfy the preset listening time,\u201d Ms. Munn said. \u201cThe novelty quickly wore off when I really needed the device to respond.\u201d\nCompanies have usually engineered voice technology to cater to uninterrupted speech from \u201cthe average North American English voice,\u201d said Frank Rudzicz, an associate professor at the University of Toronto who studies speech, language and artificial intelligence. As a result, diverse speech patterns sometimes sound foreign to voice-enabled devices.\nTo interpret speech, voice assistants typicallyconvert voice commands into textand compare that text to recognizable words in a database. Many databases historically have not contained reference data collected from those with different speech patterns like slurred sounds and word repetitions. Mr. Rudzicz said that many companies have tried to \u201creach 80 percent of people with 20 percent of the effort,\u201d using a \u201cdefault voice.\u201d\nIn other words, companies have rarely prioritized those of us whose speech doesn\u2019t match what engineers assume to be the norm.\nAs the national conversation aboutdisability rights and accessibilityhas grown, some of those companies \u2014 including Google, Apple and Amazon \u2014 have finally begunto re-engineer existing productsto try to make them work for people like me.\nApplehas collectedmore than 28,000 audio clips of stutterers in hopes of improving Siri\u2019s voice recognition systems. Amazonhas collaborated with Voiceitt, an app that learns individual speech patterns, to make Alexa more accessible. Microsoft has put$25 million towardinclusive technology. And Google has worked with speech engineers, speech language pathologists and a pair of A.L.S. organizationsto start a projectto train its existing software to recognize diverse speech patterns.\nJulie Cattiau, a product manager in Google\u2019s artificial intelligence team, told me that ultimately, the company hopes to equip Google Assistant to tailor itself to an individual\u2019s speech. \u201cFor example, people who have A.L.S. often have speech impairments and mobility impairments as the disease progresses,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it would be helpful for them to be able to use the technology to turn the lights on and off or change the temperature without having to move around the house.\u201d\nMuratcan Cicek, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with cerebral palsy, has a severe speech disorder, cannot walk and has limited control of his arms and hands. He said he tried for years to use Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant, but they couldn\u2019t understand his speech. After joining Google\u2019s project, he said he was able to use a prototype of the improved Google Assistant.\nDespite Mr. Cicek\u2019s success, Ms. Cattiau said that Google\u2019s improved voice technology still has a long way to go until it is ready to be released to the public.\nThese unfinished efforts \u2014 announced in 2019, three years after Google Assistant debuted \u2014 demonstrate voice technology\u2019s most pressing problem: Accessibility is rarely part of its original design.\nMr. Rudzicz said that it\u2019s more difficult to alter software after its creation than to develop it with differing abilities in mind in the first place. When companies don\u2019t prioritize accessibility from the outset, they neglect possible customers and undermine the potential of their diversity efforts.\n\u201cWe represent a customer base with buying power, a segment that these companies are ignoring,\u201d Ms. Munn said. \u201cI don\u2019t need special handicap tracking devices. I just want the normal devices to understand me better.\u201d\nCompanies should ensure that voice technology accounts for diverse speech patterns from the moment it meets the market. And disabled communities must be a part of the development process from conception to engineering to devices\u2019 release.\nAt the very least, all companies must provide the option to extend the listening time of voice assistants \u2014 as some have done \u2014 so people with speech impediments can speak as slowly or quickly as needed to issue a clear command.\nWith the right changes, \u201ceverything can be voice-enabled,\u201d said Sara Smolley, one of the founders of Voiceitt. \u201cThat\u2019s where the power is and where the voice revolution and voice technology is going.\u201d\nDisabled communities must be included in that voice revolution.

        "title": "A Nick to Apple\u2019s Profits Could Be a Windfall for App Developers",
        "fulltext": "Apple has taken to calling its iPhone App Store an \u201ceconomic miracle,\u201d and it has pointed to developers like Zach Shakked as proof.\nMr. Shakked created aniPhoneapp that helps companiesfind trending hashtagson social media. Over the past 12 months, his sales have topped $5 million.\nBut one of Mr. Shakked\u2019s largest expenses is paying a cut to the world\u2019s richest company. In his case, Apple took nearly $1.5 million \u2014 its fee for letting him run his app on its devices.\nNow, Mr. Shakked has hope that he could soon keep at least some of that money. On Friday,a federal judge ordered Apple to allow developers to steer their customersoff their iPhone apps to pay for their goods or services, which Apple had banned. That is big news for developers like Mr. Shakked because sales completed outside Apple\u2019s payment systems are not subject to its commission of up to 30 percent.\n\u201cIt finally feels like the small guys got a win,\u201d Mr. Shakked, 25, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of justice.\u201d\nThe ruling, in Apple\u2019s yearlong legal fight with Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, set off celebrations among app developers. From one-person start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, they have long complained about paying hefty cuts of their businesses to Apple.\nThe impact of the decision will be most felt by the smallest developers like Mr. Shakked. He said the change could save him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, which would allow him to hire more employees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d said Denys Zhadanov, a board member at Readdle, which makes five productivity apps for tasks like email that together have been downloaded roughly 175 million times. The change could save his company millions of dollars each year, he said.\nThe court fight has often been framed as a battle between industry heavyweights: Apple, which is worth $2.5 trillion, versus Epic, a far smaller company but still one of the few app makers capable of taking on the Silicon Valley titan.\nFriday\u2019s verdict is not expected to be a big hit to Apple\u2019s bottom line. In fact, the company declared victory, since Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, ruled that Epic had failed to prove that Apple had a monopoly in the mobile gaming market \u2014 which would have had a much more serious consequence.\nThe decision appeared to disappoint Epic. Tim Sweeney, its chief executive, said the ruling wasn\u2019t a \u201cwin for developers or for consumers.\u201d He vowed to continue his company\u2019s fight.\nThere could be a number of barriers to the mandated App Store changes. Apple could ask another judge to temporarily block the order, which is set to take effect in 90 days. Epic on Sundayappealed the decision, a process that could take several years.\nApple could also restrict how developers direct customers off their apps to complete transactions, including by making them list Apple\u2019s payment system as an option and barring them from offering discounts for customers who don\u2019t pay via Apple. Such discounts may be necessary to persuade customers to take the extra steps to open a web browser and enter their credit card information, versus simply tapping a button and paying via Apple.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure app developers will benefit somewhat, but it\u2019s unclear to me to what extent consumers will actually use this,\u201d said Sumit Sharma, a senior researcher for tech competition at Consumer Reports.\nNevertheless, the tide may be starting to turn against Apple\u2019s tight control over its App Store. Regulators in Japan and South Korea have forced Apple to tweak how it manages the store, and regulators and lawmakers around the world are also considering measures to curb the company\u2019s influence.\nDan Burkhart, the chief executive of Recurly, a subscription management and billing platform that works with more than 2,000 companies, said many of the app developers he communicates with regularly were buzzing with enthusiasm on Friday afternoon. Larger companies with \u201cestablished momentum and notoriety\u201d are likely to benefit from being able to direct their loyal customers elsewhere, he said.\nMatch Group, the maker of the dating apps Tinder and Hinge, is on track to pay Apple and Google \u2014 which controls a similar app store for phones that run its Android software \u2014 more than $500 million in commissions this year, the company\u2019s single largest expense, said Gary Swidler, Match\u2019s finance chief. The company was already considering ways to use Friday\u2019s ruling to cut down that bill as much as possible, including by charging less for subscriptions that are paid on one of its websites, he said.\nOne analyst estimated that the change could save Match $80 million a year, but Mr. Swidler said there were too many questions to make such a forecast.\n\u201cDepending on what the take rate would be, it will help us from a bottom-line perspective, and it will allow us to invest more in our business, and will also allow us to pass on the benefits to consumers,\u201d he said.\nMichael Love, the founder and chief executive of a Chinese dictionary app called Pleco, said the prospect of avoiding a commission \u2014 he pays Apple 15 percent \u2014 was good news. Even better? The possibility that he could interact directly with customers in ways that App Store rules prevented, like sending promotional emails, issuing refunds and looking up old orders.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for the possibilities for payments without Apple getting in the way,\u201d he said.\nMr. Love, 39, said he had not been able to strike many deals with other dictionary publishers because those publishers did not want to pay commissions to both Apple and him and lose out on a lot of money.\nNow, by avoiding the Apple fees and working directly with publishers, he could potentially transform his business and become a \u201cboutique e-book retailer,\u201d Mr. Love said. That could increase his revenue from about $500,000 a year to $5 million or $10 million, he said.\n\u201cIt makes it possible for little guys to compete,\u201d he said."

        "title": "The Medium of the Moment",
        "fulltext": "This is a preview of the Kara Swisher newsletter, which is reserved for Times subscribers.Sign up to get it in your inboxtwice a week.\nFolks who have followed me for a while know that I have a proclivity to change things up and move forward (just like the tech sector, which I\u2019ve covered for the past 30 years). I\u2019m always on to the next thing that interests me. I\u2019m now going to channel my tech self in the medium du jour: a newsletter.\nNewsletters have taken off over the past year or so, as many journalists departed the safer harbors of more traditional news outlets to try their hand at this format. It\u2019s an exciting development, but also sometimes leaves us thinking: Good God, notanotherone.\nEveryone loves newsletters because they offer writers a fresh, intimate way to connect with readers. The goal is to ride the wave of this other clear trend sweeping media: fandom.\nThe fan economy is increasingly important, as players from a range of sectors \u2014 sports, Hollywood and, yes, journalism \u2014 try to remove every middleman possible and connect directly with their audiences. The boom in tech tools, from Twitter to Instagram to TikTok, has empowered creators to do this, and newsletters are a natural evolution of these creator-fan relationships, freeing the voice and personality of the writer (in my case) from the strictures of old media.\nAt least that\u2019s the trope, since a newsletter is not exactly a new idea, despite a breathless series of articles about the unbundling of content and the dire implications for the news media.\nDeconstruct newspapers! Pull apart magazines! The writer gets all the dough! To channel Herman Mankiewicz to Ben Hecht in 1925 about Tinseltown: \u201cMillions are to be grabbed out here, and your only competition is idiots. Don\u2019t let this get around.\u201d\nBut like many such declarations about innovation, the truth is that some people will be good at it, and some will not. My goal, you might guess, is to be one of the former.\nI have, in fact, been doing more or less this since 2007, when I founded, with the tech reviewer Walt Mossberg, All Things Digital, a skunk works blog inside The Wall Street Journal. We aimed to deliver analysis, scoops and a whole lot of voice to readers who wanted more than the anodyne omniscience that prevailed at the time.\nSo in a way, I am traveling back to the past to create something for the future. Which is an apt metaphor for tech: to reinvent and reinvent again. I hope to provide you with insight, news and perhaps even a few laughs.\nWithin the next week, a U.S. District Court judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is expected to rule on a case between Apple and Epic Games. For those unfamiliar with the story: Apple is asserting that its complete control of its App Store is critical for safety and quality, while Epic, the maker of Fortnite \u2014 as well as many other third-party app developers \u2014 wants more freedom from the tech giant\u2019s hegemony, specifically when it comes to payments and customer contact.\nWhatever the short-term result \u2014 and the over-under from legal sources I have talked with is that Apple is expected to garner a modified win, despite the somewhattesty exchangebetween Rogers and Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 it\u2019s going to be appealed by whoever loses, and the case will move up the legal stack, perhaps even to the Supremes.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Apple is making an unusual number of missteps (for it) as we move into tech\u2019s postpandemic era. And while Apple has benefited from the pandemic (like other major tech companies), with its share price and revenue up, there many thorny challenges on the horizon for the company.\nApple faces regulatory tests all over the world, and it appears inevitable that the company (along with Google, which operates the Google Play store) will be forced to change its lucrative model of collecting 15 to 30 percent of app sales on its platform. South Korea, for example, is moving aggressively to force Apple and Google to allow app developers to choose their own payment systems. (As TheTimes recently reported, the Biden administration is not exactly bending over backward to help Apple\u2019s lobbying efforts there.)\nApple came to a$100 million settlementin a class-action suit with developers that assuages some of the developers\u2019 gripes. (Developers now get to have contact with customers, for example.) But most people I have spoken with think the settlement is weak sauce and definitely not enough to ease concerns over fairness in the App Store. Apple\u2019s reputation is suffering a bit as a result.\nThat golden glow \u2014 and, let\u2019s be clear, the company remains a consumer favorite \u2014 has always been part of its appeal, and it has largely avoided the evil empire image that has plagued Facebook and others. Apple will never sink that low, but the App Store issue (and others) is not a good look.\nThe company also faces questions about its recent rollout of safety measures to protect children and stamp out the pernicious and repulsive use of tech to perpetrate child sexual abuse material, called C.S.A.M. Apple\u2019s method involves monitoring users\u2019 personal devices, rather than information in the cloud, which has raised privacy concerns, a surprise from a company that has staked its rep on protecting consumer privacy.\nTwo prominent computer scientists outlined their worries, especially misuse by governments, in a recentop-ed in The Washington Post:\nA foreign government could, for example, compel a service to out people sharing disfavored political speech. That\u2019s no hypothetical: WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app, already uses content matching to identify dissident material. India enacted rules this year that could require pre-screening content critical of government policy. Russia recently fined Google, Facebook and Twitter for not removing pro-democracy protest materials.\nI did a \u201cSway\u201dpodcast last weekwith Thorn\u2019s co-founder Ashton Kutcher and chief executive, Julie Cordua, about this and related issues. The nonprofit is focused on eradicating child sexual exploitation using tech.\nAs we noted in the opening of the episode, Apple\u2019s \u201csoftware reduces images to a kind of digital fingerprint called a hash and only flags things to review if there are numerous concerning images. Nonetheless, Apple\u2019s move has sparked a debate between ending child exploitation, which I think we can all agree is worth doing, and protecting privacy, which is the trade-off here.\u201d\nKutcher and Cordua defended Apple\u2019s plans as important to stop the endless flow of this illegal and toxic content. \u201cIs this the gold standard solution?\u201d Kutcher said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I\u2019ve never been involved with a tech company that its first product was its final product.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fair point, but even Apple knows it has a problem. It\u2019s no surprise that the company has delayed the rollout from later this year to an unspecified time. In a statement the company said, \u201cBased on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.\u201d\nA breather here is the right move, but it\u2019s an unforced error from a company that seldom makes them, especially when it comes to communicating.\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Problems between the United States and China are sure to get worse, which will affect Apple, given its exposure there. And oh, yeah,employee unrest, which Apple had long managed to keep a lid on. Blabby workers are nothing new to tech, but blabbyAppleones? A new twist, for sure.\nWhich is to say, while most of the anger toward Silicon Valley is typically aimed at Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 deservedly so \u2014 it might be the perceived white hats of Apple whose future looks a little grayer. As it probably should be.\nStill, the Apple jam goes on. The company announceda new product event for next week. More on that to come.\nI talked to Jon Kelly, a founder ofPuck News, which describes itself as \u201ca new media company covering power, money and ego.\u201d That is just my cup of kombucha.\n1.Anothernewsletter company? Are you kidding me? Give me the pitch on why you\u2019ll be different.\nKara, so glad you asked. Puck is not a newsletter company. We\u2019re actually an omni-channel media brand built on the shoulders of elite journalists who cover the nexus of the power corridors of our culture \u2014 the intersection of Hollywood, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Washington and the media.\nTo answer your question slightly more cogently and eloquently, however, we believe that journalists are the ultimate creators, and what makes our company different is that we want to arm them with every type of modern storytelling platform possible. And in 2021, that means allowing them to communicate beyond the page, so to speak, and to break down the fourth wall between themselves and their audiences.\n2. How did you pick your writers, and what was the most attractive aspect of the platform to them? Did you give them equity?\nI wanted to hire the best journalists, people\u2019s whose work I admired and whose articles I salivated about reading when I saw them fresh off the presses on Twitter. And in certain cases, like Matt Belloni and Baratunde Thurston, who had spent years editing The Hollywood Reporter and working as a podcaster and public speaker, respectively, I had a deep suspicion their own singular voices would be both iconic and remarkably insightful. I also wanted to work with people like Julia Ioffe and Tina Nguyen, who wanted to make I.P. for new platforms. That was valuable to us creatively and financially.\nWhat persuaded them to join us? I suppose you\u2019d have to ask them, but I would surmise the answer is twofold. We raised our series A capital and began recruiting during Covid, a time when I think many of us wanted to break out of the collective ennui and try something new. We offered that option. It also helped that many elite journalists, encouraged by the fuel of the creator economy, were becoming more aware that they could start something from scratch and that their audiences would follow them. Furthermore, I believe that we offered top-notch journalists a happy medium: a lot of creative freedom but also a lot of editorial chops and business discipline that they wanted at this stage of their careers.\nSecond, I believe that our founding team \u2014 myself, Joe Purzycki, Max Tcheyan and Liz Gough \u2014 approached the writers with an innovative business model that included equity and bonus compensation based on the number of subscribers they could drive. I very much believe that business-model innovation really does lead to creative innovation. I think the upside has been enormously motivating.\n3. You\u2019ve worked at a lot of places, starting as an assistant at Vanity Fair. What did you learn there that stays with you?\nI\u2019m very proud of how I started my career. I was hired as an assistant to two different assistantsat Vanity Fair, smack dabin the heyday of the magazine business. And then I worked for years under Graydon Carter, its legendary editor in chief. This was back before the iPhone and in the early days of Facebook, when 22-year-olds had to behave and dress like mini adults. I ironed the same pair of khakis every morning for years.\nThe discipline of the job was significant. I may have made editorial assistant money, but I worked long hours. Nowadays, they call these jobs chief of staff or other more highfalutin titles, but the reality was that I was the kid who did everything, and all the time \u2014 I slept with my phone, fielded calls from writers and staff members around the clock and made sure Graydon had everything he needed at his fingertips to run the joint. That level of accountability grew me up fast.\nHere\u2019s the biggest takeaway, and I think it\u2019s the key to being successful in every creative enterprise: mastering the simultaneous ability to keep your eye on the big-picture vision while ensuring that you are responsive to everyone on the team, even when they disagree. Graydon was a masterful communicator. He knew when to change his mind, was usually the first to realize if he was wrong and was open to being overruled at times. But he also never lost sight of the culture product that he was making. He had the courage to go with his gut when it mattered. Back then, that was the winning algorithm.\n4. Who is the best newsletter writer not on your platform?\nThere\u2019s so much talent out there, and I love the masters of the art like Mike Allen. I also love the narrative newsletter talents like your homie Casey Newton. But right before Covid, I got addicted to this business news newsletter called Snacks, which has since been bought by Robinhood. It\u2019s a little shlocky, maybe a lot shlocky, but it breaks down three major investing and markets stories in totally unique and digestible ways. And the authors, both former Wall Street analysts, actually understand business. They\u2019re not just aggregating Barron\u2019s or the Journal. First thing I read every morning.\nThisJessica Bennett story on Monica Lewinskyis terrific. I will be having Lewinsky on my \u201cSway\u201d podcast soon to talk about the new show she is a producer on, \u201cImpeachment: American Crime Story,\u201d but this is a really good profile of her, and the photos are striking. Key quote: \u201cSpend more than a few minutes with Lewinsky and you quickly realize she is far smarter, and funnier \u2014 often at her own expense \u2014 than she often got credit for.\u201d\nWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Really: It stays.\nTech continues leading the way with vaccine passport rules, despite a slap-back on them by pols. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, its annual huge show in Nevada in January \u201cwill require all in-person attendees to provide proof of Covid-19 vaccination.\u201d C.E.S. 2022, it added, \u201cwill follow state and local guidelines and recommendations by the C.D.C. for masking and other protocols. Masks are currently required in all public indoor spacesin Las Vegas.\u201d\nI\u2019m still not heading out to Vegas for the annual slog \u2014 after 15 years of the morass of noise and crowds and pointless product demos \u2014 but I applaud C.E.A. for its Covid policies.\nWhen you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution \u2026 Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.\n\u2014Paul Virilio\nI\u2019m hosting a virtual event on Tues., Sept. 14, for Times subscribers.

So it was surprising to see privacy groups complain last month when itannounced new featuresmeant to combat child sexual abuse.\nThe updates were intended to make a dent in the rapid proliferation of child sexual abuse material online \u2014 the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children logged 21.7 million reports of such material in 2020 alone.

        "title": "Apple iPhone 13 Review: The Most Incremental Upgrade Ever",
        "fulltext": "The truth is that smartphonespeakeda few years ago.\nAfter so many advances, the miniature computers have reached incredible speeds, their screens have become bigger and brighter, and their cameras produce images that make amateur photographers look like wizards.\nThe problem with so much great innovation is that upgrades are now so iterative that it has become difficult to know what to write about them each year. That\u2019s especially the case withApple\u2019s iPhone 13, which may be the most incremental update ever to the iPhone.\nThe newest iPhone is just 10 percent faster than last year\u2019s models. (For context, in 2015, the iPhone 6S was more than 70 percent faster than its predecessor, the iPhone 6.) Its flashiest new feature, a higher screen \u201crefresh rate\u201d on the $1,000-plus models, makes motion look smoother when opening apps and scrolling through text \u2014 hardly a game changer.\nInnovations on smartphone cameras also appear to be slowing. Apple executives described the iPhone 13 cameras as \u201cdramatically more powerful\u201d and the iPhone\u2019s \u201cmost advanced\u201d ever, largely because they can capture more light and reduce noise. But in my tests, the improvements were marginal.\nThis is all to say the annual phone upgrade, which companies like Apple and Samsung tout with enormous marketing events and ad campaigns to gin up sales for the holiday shopping season, has become a mirage of tech innovation. In reality, the upgrades are now acelebration of capitalismin the form of ruthless incrementalism.\nWhat better way to illustrate that slow march than with smartphone photos? To put the iPhone 13 cameras to the test, I bought a special tripod to hold two phones side by side so I could snap roughly the same photos of my dogs at the same time. I compared shots taken with the new iPhones, last year\u2019s iPhone 12 and a three-year-old iPhone XS.\nWhen I got the results, I was genuinely surprised by how well the iPhone XS camera stood up against the newest models. And the iPhone 13\u2019s camera was just barely better than the iPhone 12\u2019s.\nEnough words. Let my dog photos guide you on the latest iPhone.\nTo compare photos shot in daylight, I took all the phones and my dogs, Max (he\u2019s the smaller corgi) and Mochi (she\u2019s the brown Labrador), to a park in Richmond, Calif. In one test shot of them sitting next to each other in the shade, the iPhone 13 and 12 photos were hardly distinguishable. The iPhone 13 did a somewhat better job capturing shadows.\nIn a test comparing the $1,000 iPhone 13 Pro with the iPhone XS, the $1,000 model released in 2018, both photos of the dogs in bright sunlight looked clear and detailed. I will grant you that the iPhone 13 Pro produced images with more vibrant colors.\nBut in one test on a shaded path in the middle of the woods, the photo taken with the iPhone 13 Pro made Mochi look blown out by the sunlight; the shadows and lighting captured by the three-year-old iPhone looked more natural. Apple disagreed with my assessment. (You be the judge.)\nThe improvements in the new iPhone cameras were most visible in lowlight photos taken with night mode, which captures multiple pictures and then fuses them together while making adjustments for colors and contrast. Low-light shots of Max perched on a balcony just after sunset looked clearer when taken with the iPhone 13 Pro than with the iPhone 12.\nLow light was an area where the three-year-old iPhone XS couldn\u2019t compete because its camera lacks a night mode. In the same test, Max was cloaked in darkness, except for his handsome white mane.\nThe iPhone 13 cameras also have a new video feature called cinematic mode, which uses algorithms to automatically focus on faces \u2014 even those of my dogs \u2014 as they move around. I\u2019d be hard pressed to imagine why a person with no ambitions to become a filmmaker would use this mode, but I can think of a fewTikTokerswho might like it.\nSo in summary, the iPhone 13 cameras are slightly better than those of last year\u2019s iPhones. Even compared with iPhones from three years ago, the cameras are much better only if you care about taking nice photos in the dark.\nJust how important is night photography? I posed the question to Jim Wilson, alongtime staff photographer for The New York Times, as he was taking pictures of the new iPhones for this review. He said it would be a crucial feature for people like him, but not as important for casual shooters.\n\u201cSometimes I wait until the night to make an ordinary scene look different and exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for most people who aren\u2019t professional photographers, this is of no consequence.\u201d\nThe fact that the smartphone has plateaued is not a bad thing. It means you can enjoy the one you have for years to come without missing out on anything major. And when it feels right to upgrade, you are in for a piece of mature technology that is incrementally \u2014 though not dramatically \u2014 better."

        "title": "The Battle for Digital Privacy Is Reshaping the Internet",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Appleintroduced a pop-up windowfor iPhones in April that asks people for their permission to be tracked by different apps.\nGoogle recently outlined plans todisable a tracking technologyin its Chrome web browser.\nAnd Facebook said last month thathundreds of its engineers were workingon a new method of showing ads without relying on people\u2019s personal data.\nThe developments may seem like technical tinkering, but they were connected to something bigger: an intensifying battle over the future of the internet. The struggle has entangled tech titans, upended Madison Avenue and disrupted small businesses. And it heralds a profound shift in how people\u2019s personal information may be used online, with sweeping implications for the ways that businesses make money digitally.\nAt the center of the tussle is what has been the internet\u2019s lifeblood:advertising.\nMore than 20 years ago, the internet drove an upheaval in the advertising industry. It eviscerated newspapers and magazines that had relied on selling classified and print ads, and threatened to dethrone television advertising as the prime way for marketers to reach large audiences.\nInstead, brands splashed their ads across websites, with their promotions often tailored to people\u2019s specific interests. Those digital ads powered the growth of Facebook, Google and Twitter, which offered their search and social networking services to people without charge. But in exchange, people were tracked from site to site by technologies such as \u201ccookies,\u201d and their personal data was used to target them with relevant marketing.\nNow that system, which ballooned into a $350 billion digital ad industry, is being dismantled. Driven by online privacy fears, Apple and Google have started revamping the rules around online data collection. Apple, citing the mantra of privacy, has rolled out tools that block marketers from tracking people. Google, which depends on digital ads, is trying to have it both ways by reinventing the system so it can continue aiming ads at people without exploiting access to their personal data.\nIf personal information is no longer the currency that people give for online content and services, something else must take its place. Media publishers, app makers and e-commerce shops are now exploring different paths to surviving a privacy-conscious internet, in some cases overturning their business models. Many are choosing to make people pay for what they get online by levying subscription fees and other charges instead of using their personal data.\nJeff Green, the chief executive of the Trade Desk, an ad-technology company in Ventura, Calif., that works with major ad agencies, said the behind-the-scenes fight was fundamental to the nature of the web.\n\u201cThe internet is answering a question that it\u2019s been wrestling with for decades, which is: How is the internet going to pay for itself?\u201d he said.\nThe fallout may hurt brands that relied on targeted ads to get people to buy their goods. It may also initially hurt tech giants like Facebook \u2014 but not for long. Instead, businesses that can no longer track people but still need to advertise are likely to spend more with the largest tech platforms, which still have the most data on consumers.\nDavid Cohen, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group, said the changes would continue to \u201cdrive money and attention to Google, Facebook, Twitter.\u201d\nThe shifts are complicated by Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s opposing views on how much ad tracking should be dialed back. Apple wants its customers, who pay a premium for its iPhones, to have the right to block tracking entirely. But Google executives have suggested that Apple hasturned privacy into a privilegefor those who can afford its products.\nFor many people, that means the internet may start looking different depending on the products they use. On Apple gadgets, ads may be only somewhat relevant to a person\u2019s interests, compared with highly targeted promotions inside Google\u2019s web. Website creators may eventually choose sides, so some sites that work well in Google\u2019s browser might not even load in Apple\u2019s browser, said Brendan Eich, a founder of Brave, the private web browser.\n\u201cIt will be a tale of two internets,\u201d he said.\nBusinesses that do not keep up with the changes risk getting run over. Increasingly, media publishers and even apps that show the weather are charging subscription fees, in the same way that Netflix levies a monthly fee for video streaming. Some e-commerce sites are considering raising product prices to keep their revenues up.\nConsider Seven Sisters Scones, a mail-order pastry shop in Johns Creek, Ga., which relies on Facebook ads to promote its items. Nate Martin, who leads the bakery\u2019s digital marketing, said that after Apple blocked some ad tracking, its digital marketing campaigns on Facebook became less effective. Because Facebook could no longer get as much data on which customers like baked goods, it was harder for the store to find interested buyers online.\n\u201cEverything came to a screeching halt,\u201d Mr. Martin said. In June, the bakery\u2019s revenue dropped to $16,000 from $40,000 in May.\nSales have since remained flat, he said. To offset the declines, Seven Sisters Scones has discussed increasing prices on sampler boxes to $36 from $29.\nApple declined to comment, but its executives have said advertisers will adapt. Google said it was working on an approach that would protect people\u2019s data but also let advertisers continue targeting users with ads.\nSince the 1990s, much of the web has been rooted in digital advertising. In that decade, a piece of code planted in web browsers \u2014 the \u201ccookie\u201d \u2014 began tracking people\u2019s browsing activities from site to site. Marketers used the information to aim ads at individuals, so someone interested in makeup or bicycles saw ads about those topics and products.\nAfter the iPhone and Android app stores were introduced in 2008, advertisers also collected data about what people did inside apps by planting invisible trackers. That information was linked with cookie data and shared withdata brokersfor even more specific ad targeting.\nThe result was a vast advertising ecosystem that underpinned free websites and online services. Sites and apps like BuzzFeed and TikTok flourished using this model. Even e-commerce sites rely partly on advertising to expand their businesses.\nBut distrust of these practices began building. In 2018, Facebook became embroiled in theCambridge Analyticascandal, where people\u2019s Facebook data was improperly harvested without their consent. That same year, European regulators enacted theGeneral Data Protection Regulation, laws to safeguard people\u2019s information. In 2019,GoogleandFacebookagreed to pay record fines to the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations of privacy violations.\nIn Silicon Valley, Apple reconsidered its advertising approach. In 2017, Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s head of software engineering, announced that the Safari web browser would block cookies from following people from site to site.\n\u201cIt kind of feels like you\u2019re being tracked, and that\u2019s because you are,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cNo longer.\u201d\nLast year, Apple announced thepop-up window in iPhone appsthat asks people if they want to be followed for marketing purposes. If the user says no, the app must stop monitoring and sharing data with third parties.\nThat prompted anoutcry from Facebook, which was one of the apps affected. In December, the social network took out full-page newspaper ads declaring that it was \u201cstanding up to Apple\u201d on behalf of small businesses that would get hurt once their ads could no longer find specific audiences.\n\u201cThe situation is going to be challenging for them to navigate,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said.\nFacebook isnow developing ways to target people with adsusing insights gathered on their devices, without allowing personal data to be shared with third parties. If people who click on ads for deodorant also buy sneakers, Facebook can share that pattern with advertisers so they can show sneaker ads to that group. That would be less intrusive than sharing personal information like email addresses with advertisers.\n\u201cWe support giving people more control over how their data is used, but Apple\u2019s far-reaching changes occurred without input from the industry and those who are most impacted,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.\nSince Apple released the pop-up window, more than 80 percent of iPhone users have opted out of tracking worldwide, according to ad tech firms. Last month, Peter Farago, an executive at Flurry, a mobile analytics firm owned by Verizon Media, published apost on LinkedIncalling the \u201ctime of death\u201d for ad tracking on iPhones.\nAt Google, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, and his lieutenants began discussing in 2019how to provide more privacywithout killing the company\u2019s $135 billion online ad business. In studies, Google researchers found that the cookie eroded people\u2019s trust. Google said its Chrome and ad teams concluded that the Chrome web browser should stop supporting cookies.\nBut Google also said it would not disable cookies until it had a different way for marketers to keep serving people targeted ads. In March, the company tried a method that uses its data troves to place people into groups based on their interests, so marketers can aim ads at those cohorts rather than at individuals. The approach is known as Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLOC.\nPlans remain in flux. Google will not block trackers in Chromeuntil 2023.\nEven so, advertisers said they were alarmed.\nIn an article this year, Sheri Bachstein, the head of IBM Watson Advertising, warned that the privacy shifts meant that relying solely onadvertising for revenuewas at risk. Businesses must adapt, she said, including by charging subscription fees and using artificial intelligence to help serve ads.\n\u201cThe big tech companies have put a clock on us,\u201d she said in an interview.\nKate Congercontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "The Apple Watch has posted steady growth for Apple in recent years, which the company wants to grow further.\nOn Tuesday at its annual product event, Apple unveiled new versions of the Apple Watch \u2014 called the Apple Watch Series 7 \u2014 with slightly larger screens. The new watches, which come in two sizes, are roughly the same size aslast year\u2019s models, but their screens have been stretched to the edges of the glass to make the display areas 20 percent larger. They also have a new design to make them more durable, with stronger dust resistance.\nThe company left the prices of the devices unchanged from last year\u2019s models, with a starting cost of $400.\nWhile Apple Watch is one of the company\u2019s smallest product segments, it would be an enormous stand-alone business for other companies. Apple\u2019s so-called wearables business, which also includes its AirPods wireless headphones, grew 28 percent to $37.5 billion in the year ending June 30 over the same period a year earlier.\nApple Watch is the No. 1 smart watch, with 36 percent of the worldwide market, according to Canalys, a research firm. Apple has consistently emphasized the Watch\u2019s health benefits, including incorporating the ability to measure your blood\u2019s oxygen saturation.\nThis year, Apple announced some new features of itsFitness Plus subscription, a digital fitness service with workouts. The company said it was introducing five-minute workouts, winter sports and Pilates workouts and a group option that allows up to 32 people to exercise simultaneously and interact.\nIt also created a \u201ctime to walk\u201d mode that gets people outdoors while listening to Camila Cabello, Dolly Parton and others. Apple said it would roll out Fitness Plus, which costs $10 per month, to an additional 15 countries this fall.\nTo compete with the Apple Watch,Google acquired the wearables company Fitbitthis year for $2.1 billion. Last year, Amazonintroduced the Halo, a fitness band that tracks movements and uses a microphone to detect people\u2019s moods.\nJack NicasandKellen Browningcontributed reporting."
