        "title": "Amazon Halo Review: The Fitness Gadget We Don\u2019t Deserve or Need",
        "fulltext": "Many of us are in the same boat these days. With the coronavirus killing more people by the day, we are increasinglystress-eatinganddrinking more alcohol. At the same time, with gyms shut down, we are sitting around more and glued to screens.\nSo you may be wondering what I\u2019m wondering: How is the pandemic affecting my body? Because we can\u2019t easily leave the house to see doctors for nonemergencies, we are largely left to figure this out on our own.\nEnter the Halo, a new fitness-tracking bracelet from Amazon with a novel twist: It claims that by using a smartphone app to scan images of your body, it can tell you how much body fat you have much more precisely than past technologies. The bracelet also has a microphone to listen to your tone of voice and tell you how your mood sounds to other people. (The masochist inside me said, \u201cSign me up!\u201d)\nThe Halo is Amazon\u2019s foray into so-called wearable computers that keep an eye on our health, following in the footsteps of Apple and Fitbit. Amazon is selling the Halo for $65 on an invitation-only basis, meaning you have to get on a waiting list to buy it. I volunteered to be a guinea pig and received mine in October.\nWhen the Halo arrived, I installed the app, removed my T-shirt and propped up my phone camera. Here\u2019s what happened next: The Halo said I was fatter than I thought \u2014 with 25 percent body fat, which the app said was \u201ctoo high.\u201d\nI was skeptical. I\u2019m a relatively slim person who has put on two pounds since last year. I usually cook healthy meals and do light exercises outdoors. My clothes still fit.\nI felt body-shamed and confused by the Halo. So I sent my Halo data and body scans to Dr. Lawrence Cheskin, a professor of nutrition and food studies at George Mason University and founder of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center.\nAfter reviewing my results, Dr. Cheskin jotted down my height and weight to calculate my body mass index, which is a metric used to estimate obesity. A man my age (36) with my body mass index, he said, is highly unlikely to have 25 percent body fat.\n\u201cUnless you were a couch potato and ate a very poor diet, I have my doubts about the Halo\u2019s diagnosis,\u201d he said.\nDr. Cheskin encouraged me to gather more data by measuring my body fat with other devices, and to do the same with at least one other person. So I did and found that the Halo\u2019s body fat readings consistently skewed higher than other tools for myself and my test subject.\nI concluded that the Halo\u2019s body analysis was questionable. More important, it felt like a negative experience that failed to motivate me to get fit. I\u2019ve had much more uplifting experiences with other products like the Apple Watch and Fitbit bands, as laid out below.\nBody fat measurement can be complicated because the traditional methods available to consumers are not always accurate.\nSmart bathroom scales that measure body fat usebioelectrical impedance analysis, which sends a small current through your bare feet. Skin calipers, a more dated method, are essentially rulers that pinch down on skin folds to measure thickness.\nThese techniques are not perfectly reliable. If people step on smart scales at different times of day or with different levels of hydration, their results may vary. Calipers can measure skin folds incorrectly if you pinch in the wrong areas.\nAmazon said the Halo\u2019s technology was much more precise. To scan your body, you use the smartphone\u2019s front-facing camera to take photos of your body from the front, sides and rear. Then Amazon stitches the images together into a 3-D model to analyze your body composition and calculate the percentage of fat.\nI decided to record consistent body fat measurements for myself and a friend using the Halo, a Fitbit bathroom scale and a highly rated skin caliper. In November and December, I took early-morning measurements with the Halo and bathroom scale; my wife pinched my skin folds in four areas with the caliper. I measured my test subject\u2019s body fat once with each device.\nOur results were remarkably similar for two men with very different body compositions:\nThe Amazon product estimated that my friend, a 6-foot-3 man weighing 198 pounds, had 24 percent body fat, the Fitbit scale read 19 percent, and the skin-fold measurements added up to 20 percent.\nFor myself \u2014 5-foot-6 and about 140 pounds \u2014 the Halo said in November that I had 25 percent body fat, the Fitbit scale said 19 percent, and the skin-fold measurements added up to 20 percent. In December, the Halo said I had 26 percent body fat (alas, I had more Thanksgiving leftovers than usual), the Fitbit scale said 20 percent, and the skin-fold measurements added up to 21 percent.\nDr. Cheskin speculated that the Halo might have an overestimating bias in its algorithm because underestimating body fat for an obese person would be more problematic.\nDr. Maulik Majmudar, Amazon\u2019s medical officer, who worked on the Halo, said people should expect the device\u2019s results to be different because the method was more accurate than body fat scales and calipers.\nAmazon developed its body-measuring algorithm from a sample set of tens of thousands of images of people\u2019s bodies from across a wide range of demographics, he said. Amazon then did internal tests measuring people\u2019s body fat using the Halo scanner, smart bathroom scales and DEXA, a technique that uses X-rays toscan for bone density, which studies have found to be a reliable measure for body fat. It found that the Halo method was twice as accurate as bathroom scales.\nStill, Dr. Cheskin was unconvinced by Amazon\u2019s accuracy claims. He said a valid study would involve a clinical trial measuring body fat of many human subjects with each method \u2014 the Halo, DEXA, bioelectrical impedance scales and calipers \u2014 and comparing the results side by side.\nAccurate or not, the most disappointing part of Amazon\u2019s body fat analysis was that it lacked important context. Even though the app asked for my ethnicity, age and sex, it said my 25 percent body fat level was too high and well outside the \u201cHealthy\u201d zone (roughly 12 to 18 percent). It also said healthy results were associated with longer life and lower risks of heart disease.\nDr. Cheskin offered a more nuanced analysis. Body fat levels may have different health implications depending on your age, ethnicity, sex, cholesterol levels and family history. Waist circumference matters, too, because severe abdominal fat can be associated with health problems.\nFor an Asian man my age with a 34-inch waistline, whose family has not had a history of diabetes or heart problems, and whose blood tests recently showed normal cholesterol levels, even a 25 percent body fat reading would probably not be alarming, he said.\nThat context, combined with my body mass index along with the measurements taken with a body fat scale and caliper, led Dr. Cheskin to doubt Halo\u2019s analysis.\nHe worried about the technology\u2019s potential consequences.\n\u201cDoes it potentially create eating disorders?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a bunch of people with normal weight and B.M.I. and telling them they\u2019re too fatty. What are they going to do with that? Some of them are going to be more compulsive and start doing things that are going to be inappropriate.\u201d\nThis experiment raised another question: What in the world was Amazon thinking releasing a product like this now? It has been impossible for us to move around as much as we used to this year. If anything, we should accept that our bodies will be imperfect during this time.\nDr. Majmudar said he felt the opposite. As a clinician, he said, he would encourage patients to mitigate the health risks of gaining weight and being more sedentary in the pandemic. The goal of the Halo was to drive behavioral change with education and awareness, he said.\n\u201cThe desire or intention was never to body-shame people,\u201d he added.\nIn my experience, there are better fitness-tracking products that offer more positive motivation.\nTheApple Watch, for one, lets you set goals for how much you want to move or exercise each day, and those goals are symbolized by colorful rings that are shown on the watch face. Once a ring is completed, you have met your goal. Fitbit devices send notifications to your phone, egging you on when you are nearing your step goal. Neither device comes anywhere close to giving you body dysmorphia.\nAnother of Halo\u2019s unique features is Tone, which uses the bracelet\u2019s microphone to periodically listen in on your conversations to tell you what your mood sounds like. I turned the feature off after two days because it felt like a creepy invasion of privacy. But I left it on long enough to complain to my wife about what a bad idea it was.\nAfter analyzing the conversation, the Halo app said I sounded irritated and disgusted. That, at least, was accurate."

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Circular Firing Squad",
        "fulltext": "When Big Tech\u2019s C.E.O.s are hauled before Congress and accused of amassing excessive power, the leaders from Apple, Facebook, Google and others have often tried to present a united front. But these companies are also competitors, and have recently taken to calling on regulators to go after each other.\nFacebook and Apple are now feuding openly, after years of low-level tension. Facebook haslaunched a website and ad campaignthat accuse Apple of threatening \u201cthe free internet\u201d through new policies on personal data tracking. Apple says it\u2019s just \u201cstanding up for our users.\u201d\nFacebook says Apple will hurt small businesses. \u201cApple\u2019s latest update threatens the personalized ads that millions of small businesses rely on to find and reach customers,\u201d Facebook notedon a websiteit created to give \u201csmall business owners a place to speak their mind.\u201d Facebook\u2019s business model relies on its ability to deliver targeted ads around the internet.\n\u201cWhat could be at stake is some future business that Facebook thinks is the next big thing that they can\u2019t get without this data,\u201d Ben Bajarin, an analyst in Silicon Valley, told The Times.\nApple says Facebook should get users\u2019 approval before tracking them.Its update will prompt users to decide whether to allow Facebook to track their activities in other companies\u2019 apps \u2014 \u201cthey should have the choice,\u201d Apple said in a statement (accompanied bya snarky graphic). But the change also adds hurdles to apps from Facebook (and others) that compete with Apple\u2019s own.\n\u201cA lot of the privacy moves that Apple has made over the past few years, in terms of allowing people to understand what\u2019s happening to them in the background, a lot of it has to do with Facebook,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin.\nHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting.To add heft to its fight, Facebook said it would provide information about \u201cthe unfair policies that Apple imposes\u201d for an antitrust suit filed by Epic Games. (For the gory details of that case,see our interviewwith Epic\u2019s chief Tim Sweeney at our Online Summit last month.) And in Europe, Facebook said yesterday itsupports new curbs on tech giants\u2019 market powerprovided they \u201cwill also set boundaries for Apple.\u201d\nTrying to set regulators against rivals isn\u2019t new for Big Tech \u2014 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerbergraised public and private alarmswith U.S. officials about TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership. These battles, though, are closer to home, between companies also engaged in a common antitrust war.\nMeanwhile, a new lawsuit accuses Google of illegal control of the online ad market.Ten states said itovercharged publishers and clamped down on rivals. \u201cIf the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the pitcher, the batter and the umpire,\u201d Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019s attorney general, said. (Other states are expected to file a separate lawsuitas soon as today.)\nA major focus of the suit is an accusation that Google made a deal with Facebook to divvy up ad marketplaces.\nLawmakers say they\u2019rethisclose to a stimulus deal.Congressional leaders signaled they hadagreed on the main points, including direct payments, additional unemployment benefits and small-business aid. But economists say the roughly $900 billion package isn\u2019t nearly enough to buttress the economy.\nThe Fed sticks with near-zero rates and monetary easing.The central bank\u2019s chair, Jay Powell, said thatits game planwould last \u201csome time\u201d and that \u201cthe next few months are likely to be very challenging.\u201d He called again for more stimulus from Congress.\nRetailers hit trouble before the holidays.U.S. retail sales fell 1.1 percent last month, with restaurants and department stores especially troubled. The consulting firm AlixPartners warned that retailers\u2019 free cash flow hasdropped off a cliffas they invest in sanitization and e-commerce.\nRoku and WarnerMedia finally strike a deal.After an eight-month standoff over how to split subscriber fees, the video-streaming device makerwill carry HBO Max. The agreement comes as WarnerMedia plans to boost subscribers for HBO Max by releasing its top movies on the service simultaneously with theaters.\nNew York lawmakers consider raising taxes on the wealthy.Democratic leaders in the state are consideringa higher ratefor those who earn at least $1 million, to avoid billions of dollars in cuts to social services. Critics say that might prompt high earners to leave, as some have in California.\nThe Supreme Court said yesterday it will review whether some of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s limits on paying college athletesviolate antitrust law, as lower courts have ruled, with a decision expected before the court term ends in June. The N.C.A.A. may regret pursuing the case if the justices issue an \u201ceconomically earnest\u201d decision, said Marc Edelman, a sports law professor at the Zicklin School of Business.\n\u201cThe N.C.A.A., whether they know it or not, had it good,\u201dMr. Edelman told DealBook. The lower court decision at issue ruled that colleges\u2019 limits on education-related benefits \u2014 computers, tutoring and the like \u2014 violated antitrust law. The bigger question is whether these athletes should be directly paid to play sports, but the N.C.A.A. says that limits on education-related compensation are also crucial to the \u201cpro-competitive\u201d nature of amateur athletics.\nWhen a coalition of more than 1,000 schools that arguably control a market agree on limiting pay, \u201cit\u2019s classic wage-fixing,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. The justices \u201cshould\u201d go even further and \u201csimply overturn pay restraint rules,\u201d he added, presenting the N.C.A.A. with a much bigger issue than whether football players should be given laptops.\nOther balls are in the air.Last year, California passed a law thatbars schools from applyingthe N.C.A.A.\u2019s pay restrictions, and would allow players to hire agents and make money from endorsements beginning in 2023. The N.C.A.A. had threatened to exclude the state\u2019s universities from showcase tournaments, which didn\u2019t stop California lawmakers but did interest the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim. He called amateurism a \u201claudable goal\u201d but warned that it \u201cdoes not grant antitrust immunity.\u201d\nAs other states consider similar moves, the N.C.A.A. is asking Congress for a federal antitrust exemptionin exchange for adopting rulesthat would let athletes sign limited endorsement deals.\nThe cryptocurrency blew through previous records, at one point today approaching $24,000 per coin. As Bitcoin soared, Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments told Bloomberg that the Fed\u2019s money printing, the relative value of similar assets like gold and other factors led him to conclude that Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfundamental\u201d value is $400,000 per coin \u2014 to which his interviewerresponded, \u201cWhoa.\u201d\nAs the stock trading app Robinhood surges in popularity, it has drawn the attention of securities regulators, with officials in Massachusettsfiling a complaintthat accuses the company of manipulating inexperienced investors.\nThe app was accused of keeping young traders hooked.Robinhood used aggressive marketing techniques, like offering free shares, and \u201cgamification\u201d features to encourage frequent trading, according to a complaint by Massachusetts\u2019 secretary of the commonwealth. That helps the company\u2019s \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d business model, where Wall Street firms pay it to execute customers\u2019 trades.\nRobinhood defended its policies, saying in a statement that it did not make investment recommendations: \u201cWe disagree with the allegations in the complaint by the Massachusetts Securities Division and intend to defend the company vigorously.\u201d\nThe timing is inauspicious.Robinhood is preparing to go public, hiring the likes of Goldman Sachs to advise on an I.P.O. The prospect of other regulators following suit presents an unwelcome headache in an otherwise bumper year.\nIn a year of unrest and upheaval, police reform has become a matter of popular debate, with one phrase in particular inflaming passions. Thelatest debatein our DealBook D.C. Policy Project convened activists, academics, police chiefs and politicians to discuss public safety, racism and what people mean when they say \u201cdefund the police.\u201d It was moderated by The Times\u2019s John Eligon.\nThe former deputy attorney generalRod Rosensteinsuggested \u201crefunding\u201d was a more useful term than \u201cdefunding,\u201d emphasizing a shift in \u201cwhere the money is spent and how it\u2019s spent.\u201d MayorQuinton Lucasof Kansas City, Mo., said the \u201cdefund\u201d discussion erred by centering debate around the police, instead of prioritizing investments in mental health and other services. ButCarmen Best, Seattle\u2019s former police chief, had limited patience with the fixation on words: \u201cWhether it\u2019s \u2018defund\u2019 or \u2018divest\u2019 or \u2018reinvest\u2019 or \u2018refund\u2019 or whatever the terminology is \u2014 those things are all very fine. Those are part of the discussion.

        "title": "Google\u2019s Legal Peril Grows in Face of Third Antitrust Suit",
        "fulltext": "More than 30 states added toGoogle\u2019smushrooming legal woes on Thursday, accusing the Silicon Valley titan of illegally arranging its search results to push out smaller rivals.\nOne day after 10 other states accused Google ofabusing its dominance in advertisingand overcharging publishers, and two months after the Justice Department said the company\u2019sdeals with other tech giants throttled competition, the bipartisan group of state prosecutors said in a lawsuit on Thursday that Google downplayed websites that let users search for information in specialized areas like home repair services and travel reviews. The prosecutors also accused the company of using exclusive deals with phone makers like Apple to prioritize Google\u2019s search service over rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo.\nThat suppression, the states said in their lawsuit, has locked in Google\u2019s nearly 90 percent market dominance in search and has made it impossible for the smaller companies to grow into formidable competitors. Google has sought to extend that dominance to new venues like home voice assistants, said the prosecutors, from states including Colorado, Nebraska, New York and Utah.\nThe cascade of lawsuits against Google, which the company says it will fight in court, are indicative of the growing backlash against the largest tech companies, a movement that increasingly looks like it will usher in major changes for some of the world\u2019s most popular digital services.\nCritics have argued for years that Google, Apple, Facebook andAmazonbuilt sprawling empires over commerce, communications and culture, and then abused their growing power. But only recently have federal or state regulators brought major cases against them.\nThe Federal Trade Commission and 40 state attorneys general last weekaccused Facebookof buying smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain its dominance, in a case that threatens to break the company apart. Regulators in Washington and around the country are also investigating Amazon and Apple.\nIn addition, Democratic and Republican political leaders have assumeda far more aggressive stanceagainst the industry, including pushing changes toa once-sacrosanct lawthat protects sites from liability for the content posted by their users.\n\u201cOur economy is more concentrated than ever, and consumers are squeezed when they are deprived of choices in valued products and services,\u201d said Phil Weiser, Colorado\u2019s attorney general. \u201cGoogle\u2019s anticompetitive actions have protected its general search monopolies and excluded rivals, depriving consumers of the benefits of competitive choices, forestalling innovation and undermining new entry or expansion.\u201d\nLawsuits and investigations could eventually lead to the breakup of some companies and to new laws that alter the balance of corporate power.\nThe prosecutors filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia and asked the court to combine it with one filed by the Justice Department in October, which includes similar accusations. If the court combines the suits, it will expand the scope of the federal case to include a much wider array of accusations about Google\u2019s search business. The multiple cases could take years to resolve.\nAdam Cohen, a director of economic policy at Google,said in a blog postthat the lawsuit \u201cseeks to redesign search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses\u2019 ability to connect directly with customers.\u201d\n\u201cWe look forward to making that case in court, while remaining focused on delivering a high-quality search experience for our users,\u201d he said.\nThe company has long denied accusations of antitrust violations, and is expected to use its global network of lawyers, economists and lobbyists to fight the multiple accusations against it. The company has a market value of $1.18 trillion and cash reserves of over $120 billion.\nTaken together, the three lawsuits paint Google as a ruthless corporate behemoth choking off the competition in a wide range of businesses. It is a far cry from how Google has portrayed itself in the past (famously in a company-sanctioned movie, \u201cThe Internship\u201d): a good-natured and conscientious organization full of playful nerds.\nGoogle has grown from a start-up in a garage to tech conglomerate with 130,000 employees. The company, which once declared that \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d was its corporate motto and was seen as the counterweight to Microsoft and other industry bullies of the past, is now viewed as the domineering force of Silicon Valley and one of the companies carving up the tech landscape.\n\u201cCollectively, this will be a comprehensive examination of Google\u2019s ascent to power over the last 25 years,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThese are formidable threats to the company.\u201d\nThe Justice Department and state attorneys general have looked askance at how Google has preserved its dominance in search and advertising technology by striking deals with other tech heavyweights such as Apple and Facebook to close off markets to competition.\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday focuses on how Google maintained its hold on online search. While Google\u2019s ambition has long been to create a directory for the entire web, over the years, other companies have developed search engines that specialize in a specific area. Yelp provides reviews for local businesses. Tripadvisor offers hotel reviews. Angie\u2019s List points users to reliable home repair services.\nProsecutors said that Google had methodically downplayed these sites in its own search results while often prominently displaying its own competing reviews or services. That prevented any company from creating a broader grouping of specialized services that could have challenged Google\u2019s search engine.\nMore recently, the company has used illegal tactics to extend its dominance to new vehicles for online search, including connected cars and home voice assistants, the prosecutors said.\nMr. Weiser said in an interview that they aren\u2019t intimidated by Google\u2019s expected army of litigators and lobbying around its defense.\n\u201cWe have done a thorough investigation and we feel confident about our case,\u201d he said. At a news conference earlier in the day, he said that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to discuss specific outcomes for the case, such as ways in which the company could be broken up.\nThe states began their search investigation in late summer 2019, part of a tidal wave of new scrutiny over the power of big tech unseen since the antitrust case against Microsoft two decades ago.\nThe Google investigations moved faster than the other inquiries into Amazon and Apple because of yearslong accusations of Google\u2019s anticompetitive practices by rivals like Microsoft and Yelp, and publishers like News Corp. European cases against Google and an investigation by the F.T.C. into Google\u2019s search practices that ended in 2013 have created volumes of records and theories of harms. The agency\u2019s inquiry closed without action.\nThe states said they worked closely with the Justice Department in their investigation. They interviewed hundreds of witnesses from Google and rival companies and collected more than 45,000 private documents as evidence.\nThursday\u2019s announcement reflects the deep interest among regulators around the world in Google\u2019s signature search product.\nIn Europe, regulators fined Google roughly $2.7 billion for privileging its own comparison shopping tool over those produced by independent websites. European Union authorities also fined Google for bundling its services with its Android mobile operating system, and Google agreed to let rival search engines bid for the default spot on some devices.\nGene Munster, a longtime technology analyst and a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, said he doesn\u2019t expect consumers to abandon Google products, but that the brand of Google as a company has taken a hit.\n\u201cFor the public perception of Google, it\u2019s a black eye. They\u2019re no longer able to portray themselves as the \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 company,\u201d said Mr. Munster. \u201cI think they are squarely in the camp of a tech company that consumers are more suspicious about today than they were five years ago.\u201d\nTom Miller, the Democratic attorney general of Iowa, who signed unto Thursday\u2019s suit, reflected on the case\u2019s similarities with the federal and state lawsuits against Microsoft. Mr. Miller was a state attorney leading the states\u2019 charge against Microsoft.\nHe said that although Microsoft settled charges, years of litigation from the late 1980s to the early 1990s clearly forced the company to correct its anticompetitive business practices. He said antitrust action, which could stretch on for years in courts, can help encourage more competition no matter the results of litigation.\n\u201cSome people argue that if we had not brought the case\u201d against Microsoft, Mr. Miller said, \u201cthere would not have been a Google.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The show was called \u201cScraper,\u201d but it was clearly aboutGawkerMedia, the network of aggressive, transgressive blogs that created mischief and headaches for America\u2019s powerful until its targets sued the company into oblivion in 2016.\nTwo Gawker veterans sold the idea to Apple TV+, the new streaming service: Cord Jefferson, who left the site for a career writing for TV, and Max Read, Gawker\u2019s former editor in chief. Apple hired two more former Gawker editors, Emma Carmichael and Leah Beckmann, as writers, and they had completed several episodes, people close to the production said.\nThen, an Apple executive got an email from the company\u2019s chief executive,Tim Cook.\nMr. Cook, according to two people briefed on the email, was surprised to learn that his company was making a show about Gawker, which hadhumiliatedthe company at various times and famouslyoutedhim, back in 2008, as gay. He expressed a distinctly negative view toward Gawker, the people said. Apple proceeded to kill the project. And now, the show\u00a0is back on the market and the executive who brought it in, Layne Eskridge, has left the company. Gawker, it seems, is making trouble again.\nGawker was always a canary in the cultural coal mine, mostly because of its mission of heading farther along the coal face than others wanted or dared to. It crossed lines that needed to be crossed \u2014\u00a0pushing stories about sexually abusive figures like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby \u2014 and ones that didn\u2019t, exposing the personal lives and frailties of minor figures. And its ethos put the company, which published the tech blog Gizmodo and the pioneering feminist blog Jezebel, among others, into America\u2019s new culture wars. It became a target of Gamergate in 2014, when the backlash to calls for diversity in gaming offered an early glimpse of what would become the new online right wing. It ignited intense debates over privacy, with its gleeful publishing of sex tapes and explicit photographs. And when it was reported in 2016 that the tech mogul Peter Thielhad secretly financedthe lawsuit that brought down the company, it seemed the final truth Gawker had exposed was the power and determination of Silicon Valley to bring the media to heel.\nBut now, from beyond the grave, Gawker is revealing another reality in this era of media consolidation: that the chief executive of one of the biggest companies in the world, who testifies before Congress and negotiates with China, also decides what television shows get made. A spokesman for Apple, Tom Neumayr, declined to comment on the show\u2019s demise.\nBut Hollywood is now firmly in the grip of giant companies with singular leaders \u2014 Mr. Cook and Apple; Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos; the Netflix C.E.O. Reed Hastings; and AT&T\u2019s top executive, John Stankey \u2014 with big consumer brands and other pressing priorities, like their lucrative other businesses and their access to international markets.\nSo far, Apple TV+ is the only streaming studio to bluntly explain its corporate red lines to creators \u2014 though Disney, with its giant theme park business in China, shares Apple\u2019s allergy to antagonizing China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping.\nEddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services, who has been at the company since 1989, has told partners that \u201cthe two things we will never do are hard-core nudity and China,\u201d one creative figure who has worked with Apple told me. (BuzzFeed News firstreportedlast year that Mr. Cue had instructed creators to \u201cavoid portraying China in a poor light.\u201d)\nThe Wall Street Journal also reportedin 2018 that Mr. Cook personally killed a Dr. Dre biopic because there was too much violence and nudity, and that the company had asked the director M. Night Shyamalan to keep crucifixes off the walls in his thriller \u201cServant.\u201d\nAnd then, there are the phones: A person involved in another recent Apple show recalled instructions to avoid a scene in which a phone would be damaged.\nThe logic of these rules is obvious: Apple TV+ is a minor sideline in a sprawling, deliberate, top-down company that uses a pristine brand to sell some 200 million iPhones a year. Creative executives aren\u2019t alone in tiptoeing around anything that could dent the brand.\nAnd you can understand why Mr. Cook was surprised to learn that his company was making a show about Gawker. The site represented a particular irritant to Apple. The most famous incident came in 2010, when Gizmodogot its handson a prototype of the iPhone 4. Steve Jobs pleaded to get it back, police close to the companyraided an editor\u2019s house, and Gawker reveled in the chaos.\nBut Mr. Cook also has a personal grievance with the site, which in 2008respondedto a glowing article about the low-profile executive by floating the rumor that he was gay. (Other coverage had used euphemistic expressions like \u201cintensely private\u201d lifelong bachelor.) When Apple named Mr. Cook to lead the company in 2011, it made no mention of his sexual orientation, but Gawker\u2019s Ryan Tateintroducedhim as \u201cThe Most Powerful Gay Man in America.\u201d\nMr. Cook laterwroteproudly of his identity, and said he\u2019d long been open with people in his personal life. But Mr. Tate said he thought frequently about the story afterward, and even wondered whether Mr. Cook\u2019s parents had known about his identity before the report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that gave me pause and that I thought about, but I would do it the same way again,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a broader good in knowing more about the private lives of the people who run this society. If writing about the C.E.O. of Apple isn\u2019t within bounds \u2014 then who would be?\u201d (An Apple spokesman didn\u2019t answer any questions about how Mr. Cook felt about the coverage at the time.)\nApple, a company whose corporate culture is firmly controlled by the same small group of men who have run it for two decades, and whose value to consumers is focused on protecting their privacy, doesn\u2019t quite see the world the same way. So now \u201cScraper\u201d is heading back to the market, and could still see daylight with a different producer.\nApple TV+, which started a year ago, has struggled to find its feet in a climate in which its top creative executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, appear to be constantly trying to guess what Mr. Cook and Mr. Cue might like, or might object to. That has mostly ruled out the sort of prestige drama that defined other breakout streaming services. The service is currently experiencing modest success with a show that would be at home on broadcast TV, the sweetly funny \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d (The branding can be a little conspicuous: There are as many as three Apple devices in some \u201cTed Lasso\u201d scenes, and Siri makes a cameo.)\nThe company is in no hurry, though, and its strategy with other media projects has been to edge them from failure to, if not blowout success, a strong enough position that you\u2019ll sign up if the thing is preinstalled on your phone \u2014 Apple\u2019s true commercial advantage in the media business. That\u2019s true of Apple Music, now the world\u2019s second-largest streaming service; and of Apple News, a well-curated, if unexciting, app that is reportedly where President-elect Joe Biden gets his information. Apple\u2019s greatest streaming coup of the pandemic was to pick up the film \u201cGreyhound,\u201d the World War II drama starring \u2014 who else? \u2014 Tom Hanks.\nAnd Apple\u2019s willingness to sacrifice creative freedom for corporate risk management is still an outlier. None of my reporting suggests that Mr. Bezos is reaching into Amazon\u2019s studio (or The Washington Post) to kill negative depictions of either e-commerce or the police, or that Mr. Stankey is ostentatiously slipping AT&T routers into \u201cLovecraft Country.\u201d The question, of course, is how long, even at those companies, the old law will be suspended \u2014\u00a0that he who pays the piper calls the tune.\nFortunately for aficionados of Gawker, there\u2019s another version out there: The well-regarded production company Anonymous Content bought the option to develop a 2016 article on Gawker\u2019s fall by Jeffrey Toobin, a frequent target of the site, according to a person familiar with the deal.\nBut perhaps unfortunately for its prospects, Anonymous Content is partly controlled by yet another person close to Apple, Steve Jobs\u2019s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs."

        "title": "Coronavirus Apps Show Promise but Prove a Tough Sell",
        "fulltext": "Last spring, Apple and Googlelaunchedan ambitious effort to harness technology in the fight against Covid-19, building a powerful smartphone tool that would alert people of possible exposure to the coronavirus.\nThe software could play an important role in helping curb outbreaks, new data shows, but asthe pandemic\u2019s winter wave engulfs the United States, the technology remains largely unused. It is available only in about a third of states, stymied by privacy concerns, a lack of public awareness and interest, poor access to fast testing, and a patchwork system of government health authorities.\n\u201cIt turns out that it is very, very challenging to get people to use a Covid app,\u201d said James Larus, a computer scientist and dean of the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at the Swiss university EPFL, who has worked on the effort with Apple, Google and public health officials. \u201cWe went into it thinking that of course people would want to use this, and we have been very surprised.\u201d\nEngineers at the companies built a system that respected people\u2019s privacy, reasoning that without such safeguards, no one would sign on. The technology, called \u201cexposure notifications,\u201d doesn\u2019t track users\u2019 locations, instead relying on Bluetooth to detect which phones have been within several feet of one another for more than a few minutes. When a user receives a positive test result, the local health system provides a code by email, text message or phone call to enter into the app. That will alert anyone who was in proximity while the person was infectious.\nAfter some states balked at the effort required to make an app, the tech companies this fall tried to make the process easier, allowing states to roll out the technology without creating a stand-alone application.\nThis week California will launch its version of the tool, called Exposure Notifications Express, joining four other states and the District of Columbia in using the simplified program. It is an important test for the country\u2019s most populous state, as Gov. Gavin Newsom orders parts of itto shut down amid surging cases. Because of its size and prominence, the tech giants\u2019 home state could provide momentum for the technology, but it remains to be seen how many people will sign up and whether California has enough fast testing capacity for the tool to be helpful.\nAreas using Express have an advantage in marketing because Apple and Google send push alerts to people\u2019s phones when it becomes available in their state. The District of Columbia has seen the highest participation rate: more than60 percentof its population. About 20 percent of residents in Colorado, Connecticut and Maryland \u2014 which are all using Express \u2014 have joined; Washington State has had about 13 percent participation since introducing the tool earlier this month.\nIn most of the other 12 states using exposure notifications, rates are in the single digits.\nEarly on, epidemiologists at Oxford suggested ina paperthat if 60 percent of people in an area used a digital contact-tracing app, the pandemic could be brought under control without a lockdown.Later epidemiological modelsindicated that apps could help reduce viral spread even if just 15 percent of a population used them.\nIn Switzerland, about 22 percent of the population is using the technology. In a study of contact tracing in Zurich, researchers calculated that for every 100 people who tested positive, the app correctly notified 24 contacts who had caught the virus \u2014 a success rate similar to what is seen in human contact tracing.\nPublic officials have cited the importance of contact tracing in battling the pandemic, but U.S. health workershave had troublekeeping up with high infection rates and persuading people to cooperate.\nA pilot program at the University of Arizona provided what may be the first example of an app slowing the viral spread in the United States. During an outbreak there this fall, it sent alerts for as many as 12 percent of transmissions, researchers estimated.\n\u201cWe believe that the outbreak on campus had a flatter curve because of the app,\u201d said Joanna Masel, a mathematical biology professor who has helped supervise the rollout of the program, called Covid Watch.\nAnna Giudici, a junior at the university, said the alert she received in mid-September led her to stay away from other people, even though her only symptom was a mild headache.\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten a notification, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it,\u201d she said, adding that she had not been alerted by a traditional contact tracer. She got a rapid test and went into isolation when it came back positive. To her knowledge, she did not infect anyone else; even her roommates tested negative.\nSeveral other students and staff members said they appreciated having the app, even as they acknowledged that it didn\u2019t work perfectly, especially at first. In an early version, iOS users received notifications of \u201cpossible exposures\u201d when they were unlikely to have been infected but had briefly been in range of someone with the virus \u2014 messaging that some found jarring and confusing.\nIn at least some cases, the early app appeared to notify users about someone who was nearby \u2014 but on the other side of a wall. Nathalie Riddell, a senior, said she had received several alerts of \u201csignificant exposure\u201d when her roommate had the virus and was isolating in another part of their apartment.\nBut the project worked in part because it targeted a specific population that included many young people who were tech-savvy and trusted the app provided by their university. The school also had easily accessible rapid tests, Dr. Masel said. The lack of a fast testing system off campus meant the pilot study could not be extended to the entire state earlier this fall, she added.\n\u201cThe app doesn\u2019t stand on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires available rapid testing to work.\u201d\nAs with much of the U.S. coronavirus strategy, decisions about the implementation of exposure-notification apps have been left to the states. North Dakota and Virginia embraced the technology quickly, for instance, but officials elsewhere said they had concerns about efficacy and privacy. Some preferred to focus resources on human contact tracing.\n\u201cWe had evaluated the risk of being early adopters of untested technology and felt like that would be more problematic than beneficial,\u201d said Sarah Tuneberg, senior adviser to Colorado\u2019s governor for Covid-19 testing containment and technology. But by this fall, she said, state health officials decided that \u201cwaiting any longer puts public safety in jeopardy.\u201d\nThe state introduced the technology in October, using Exposure Notifications Express. Under that option, Colorado didn\u2019t have to create its own app; Google had made one for Android users, and iPhone owners could turn on technology built into the operating system. Ms. Tuneberg said the push notifications from the companies helped the state reach its 20 percent adoption rate.\nIn states that have their own apps, without the benefit of push notifications, the numbers are far lower: about 5 percent in New York, less than 3 percent in Alabama and about 1 percent in Wyoming. Virginia has had the most success, at nearly 10 percent, having devoted about $1.5 million to public awareness campaigns.\nJeff Stover, the executive adviser to the state\u2019s health commissioner, said that public health departments have for months been encouraging testing and mask-wearing, and that marketing coronavirus exposure apps is also essential. Virginia has \u201cdone a good job of continually increasing the proportion of the population who is buying into this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had to market to different segments of society that might have different reasons not to trust the government.\u201d\nA pilot study in California suggested that traditional advertising might not be the most effective way to get people to use the technology. \u201cFar and away the most effective messaging was a text to your phone,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Longhurst, chief information officer at the University of California San Diego Health. The best text message, he said, told people that the app could help them protect their family and friends.\nFrom the beginning, one of the main concerns among the public has been privacy. After years of surveillance scandals, people are reasonably skeptical of technology companies and the government, said Elissa Redmiles, a computer scientist who has studied attitudes toward Covid apps.\n\u201cThey have this sense that everyone is taking their data constantly, and they don\u2019t want to give up any more data,\u201d she said, or they worry about authoritarianism and think, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be surveilled by the government.\u201d\nThe focus on privacy has led to something of a Catch-22. Dr. Redmiles\u2019s research shows that people want assurances not only of privacy but also of the technology\u2019s effectiveness before agreeing to use the apps in large numbers. But privacy protections make it harder to collect the very data that can show how well the apps work.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t see whether it\u2019s effective, it\u2019s not very compelling,\u201d said Marc Zissman, a computer security researcher at M.I.T.\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tapped Dr. Zissman\u2019s lab this fall to help figure out how effective the exposure-notification system is.\nThe C.D.C. hopes the new research will answer some key questions: \u201cHow many more contacts can be notified of their exposure via these apps than traditional contact tracing alone? How much faster are individuals notified? And is the added speed and comprehensiveness worth the investment of states\u2019 resources?\u201d a spokeswoman for the agency said.\nBut even with assurances of privacy and evidence that the apps can work, many Americans still show little interest in using the technology.\nOne studyindicated that less than half the population supported using exposure-notification apps, even with privacy-protecting features.\nIn another survey, conducted by Dr. Redmiles, nearly a quarter of people said they would never install such a tool, even if it were completely private and 100 percent effective. More than half would agree to use an app only if it reduced viral spread by 50 percent.\nThe New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\nThose who may need the notifications most, because they are engaging in risky behavior, may be less likely to download the apps, said Dr. Masel, the Arizona biologist.\nOn the university campus, fewer than half of people who tested positive for the virus were using the app. And of the users who tested positive, only about half shared their codes through the app to alert others. Drop-offs have also occurred in the Swiss study and in other states.\n\u201cPeople load the app to know if they were around someone else who tested positive, but don\u2019t want to notify others if they are positive,\u201d either because they are concerned about their privacy or because they have a \u201cselfish mind-set,\u201d said Tim Brookins, one of the developers of the app used in North Dakota."

        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in theEuropean Unionand Britain built momentum on Tuesday for tougher oversight of the technology industry, as they introduced new regulations to pressure the world\u2019s biggest tech companies to take down harmful content and open themselves up to more competition.\nIn Brussels, European Union leaders unveiled proposals to crimp the power of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which policymakers argue deserve more oversight given their outsize influence. The proposed E.U. laws would require the companies to do more to prevent the spread of hate speech and sale of counterfeit merchandise, and disclose more information about how services like targeted advertising work.\nIn Britain, which is preparing to exit the bloc, the government proposed banning some harmful internet content like terrorism material, suicide videos and child abuse, which could result in billions of dollars in fines. Separately, Irish regulators announced a fine of 450,000 euros (about $547,000) against Twitter for violating E.U. data protection laws, one of the first penalties of its kind.\nThe string of announcements helped reinforce Europe as home to some the world\u2019s toughest policies toward the technology industry.\n\u201cThe European Union wants to be the leader in the tech regulation,\u201d said Christoph Schmon, the international policy director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nBut the region is no longer alone in its efforts to limit the power of Big Tech. In the United States,regulators sued Facebooklast week for illegally squashing competition, andGoogle was hit with an antitrust lawsuitin October. In China, the government has begun to clamp down on local tech giants like Alibaba. Australia, India and Brazil are among others debating new regulations.\nGovernments are increasingly scrutinizing tech companies that have become critical infrastructure for billions of people and businesses to communicate, shop, learn about the world and be entertained. The result could be that the technology sector becomes more like banking, telecommunications and health care \u2014 industries of such size and importance that they are subject to more government supervision.\n\u201c2021 will be the year of regulation for the tech giants \u2014 they are a mature industry now, not shiny young start-ups,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe used to say too big to fail for banks, but banks are highly regulated and these guys are moving in this direction too.\u201d\nThe European Union proposals introduced in Brussels on Tuesday present the greatest risk to the tech industry, as the 27-nation bloc is home to roughly 450 million people and its regulations often become a model for others in the world. The rules do not single out any company by name, though the targets were clear.\nOne measure, called the Digital Services Act, proposed large fines for internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube if they do not restrict the spread of certain illegal content like hate speech. Along with the similar proposal made earlier in the day in Britain, the debate will be closely watched. Large internet companies have faced years of criticism for not doing more to crack down on user-generated content, but governments have been reluctant to impose laws banning specific material for fear of restricting speech and self-expression.\nBritish officials outlined a \u201clegal duty of care\u201d to force companies to remove content considered \u201charmful,\u201d a definition that some critics have said is overly vague. Ofcom, the British regulator for broadcasters in charge of enforcing the proposed law, would have the power to block services that violate the rules from access in Britain. The announcement came after British officials last week proposed creating aregulatorto oversee other areas of the digital economy.\nBoth measures still must be debated by Parliament.\nIn Brussels, leaders also proposed new transparency rules that require companies to disclose more about their services, including why people are targeted with advertisements and other content online. Internet retailers like Amazon could face new requirements to prevent the sale of counterfeit goods.\nAnother measure aimed at fostering competition would prevent the largest platforms from giving their products better treatment over rivals, potentially affecting how Google displays search results or what products Amazon promotes.\nRegulators would have a path for breaking up companies that repeatedly violate E.U. antitrust laws.\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees digital policy and antitrust enforcement, said the global tech policy debate is a \u201cdifferent world\u201d compared to five years ago when she was criticized for taking action against Google and other American firms.\nNow, she said, there is broad agreement that \u201cwith size comes responsibility.\u201d\nMany in Brussels expect a drawn out fight, as thetech industry spends more than ever on lobbying. And while there is strong political momentum for new regulations, the policies may not be approved for years, with many stages of negotiations where the debate could snag.\nMr. Lewis said the debate will be a test for the relationship between the United States and European Union, which was strained during the Trump administration on issues like digital taxes. A trade group representing big American tech companies, called the Internet Association, has already complained to officials in Washington about the new European rules.\nVeterans of past European debates said the challenge will be translating the law\u2019s lofty ambitions into strong enforcement, an area where previous E.U. policies have fallen short.\nEurope\u2019s landmark 2018 online privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, has been criticized for notfulfilling its promisebecause of lack of enforcement. Despite a limited budget, Ireland is responsible for regulating all tech companies with a European headquarters within its borders \u2014 including Facebook, Apple and Google \u2014 and issued only its first fine of a major tech platform on Tuesday with the penalty against Twitter, more than two years after the law was enacted.\n\u201cFor the E.U., it is important to get its priorities right in practice and not just talk about them,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a former member of the European Parliament who now teaches at Stanford University.\nThe European debate is already turning some companies against one another. On Monday, Facebook issued a statement urging European regulators to act against Apple, part of an ongoing feud between the two companies over Apple\u2019s App Store policies, which Facebook said \u201charm developers and consumers.\u201d\nRaegan MacDonald, head of public policy in Brussels for the Mozilla Foundation, which operates the Firefox browser, called the efforts in Europe a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity, particularly the transparency rules that would provide important insights about how the companies operate.\n\u201cWhat this is really about at its core is how people experience the web \u2014 the misinformation in our feeds, the recommendations that are being pushed toward us, or the creepy ads we\u2019re seeing and don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this is done well, this could be game changing regulation for platform accountability.\u201d"

        "title": "Amazon and Apple Are Powering a Shift Away From Intel\u2019s Chips",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For close to a decade, supporters of the chip technology that powers mobile phones vowed to shake up the market for computers. For the most part, they made little headway.\nNow that finally seems to be changing, in a potential power shift over the direction of the computer industry.\nThe change is being driven by Apple and Amazon, two tech behemoths that are cutting their dependence on theIntel chip technologythat has long controlled most personal computers and larger server systems. Instead, the companies are increasingly leaning on homegrown chips that were designed using technology that Arm, a British company, licenses for smartphones and other consumer products.\nApple fired a salvo last month when itintroduced Mac computersthat for the first time used its own Arm-based chips. In June, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing business started marketing a new computing servicebased on its own Arm-based chips, telling customers that the service was both faster and cheaper by one-fifth than its Intel-based offerings.\nOn Tuesday, Amazon unveiled another computing service for businesses based on those same chips. It also discussed gains made by users of the service that was introduced in June, such as Snap, the maker of the Snapchat messaging app. Amazon added that Twitter planned to begin using the technology as part of a broadened relationship between the companies.\n\u201cThe larger the customer, the more excited they are,\u201d said Peter DeSantis, who oversees computing infrastructure for Amazon Web Services.\nThe actions by Apple and Amazon are causing ripple effects across the $400 billion semiconductor industry. Their moves suggest that key decisions in chips may increasingly shift from silicon suppliers, where the power had long resided, to chip users with the resources to make their own components. For computer users, the moves may result in more technology choices, snappier computing speeds and lower costs.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s like, wow, Apple\u2019s totally in, Amazon and others are in,\u201d said Keith Kressin, a senior vice president at Qualcomm, a large supplier of Arm-based chips. \u201cThis is going to happen for real.\u201d\nIntel became a dominant force in computing in the 1990s, emerging as the biggest supplier of processors for PCs and later exploiting its high-volume manufacturing to make lower-priced chips for servers. But the company did not make chips for smartphones, which became hugely popular starting in 2007.\nEnter Arm. The 30-year-old company, whichNvidia recently agreed to buy from SoftBank for $40 billion, delivered chips that used less power than Intel processors. That difference \u2014 which meant that mobile phones might run all day on a battery charge, rather than just a few hours \u2014 attracted makers of chips for mobile phones, such as Qualcomm.\nLast decade, some backers of Arm technology also began saying such chips could be used beyond mobile phones. Companies such as Broadcom and Qualcomm started designing Arm-based chips for data centers to cut down on rising power bills for Intel processors. They later gave up the costly efforts, partly because customers demanded greater computing speed.\nIn PCs, Microsoft has also talked up Arm, with little success. While the software giant has worked with Qualcomm to market an Arm-based version of Windows and laptops that use the operating system, sales have been minimal, largely because of a lack of programs created for the laptops, market researchers said.\nThen came Apple\u2019s move. The company, which had previously designed Arm-based chips for phones and tablets,said in June that it would gradually shift from the Intel processorsit has used in its Mac computers since 2005. Apple said its first chip designed for the Mac, the M1, delivered twice the performance of a comparable Intel chip while using a quarter of the power.\n\u201cEvery Mac with M1 will be transformed into a completely different class of product,\u201d Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies, said at last month\u2019s online event to introduce the new Macs.\nIntel said it should not be counted out. It continues producing faster versions of its x86 chips, and many customers don\u2019t want to rewrite software that runs on them.\n\u201cIntel is building on more than 20 years of x86-based ecosystem work,\u201d said Lisa Spelman, an Intel corporate vice president. \u201cWe ensure software compatibility and high performance, important requirements for both consumers and data center customers.\u201d\nAmazon also continues to expand its use of Intel chips for some jobs. It announced a plan on Tuesday to run Intel-powered Mac mini computers in its data centers to help programmers develop software for Apple systems without using Apple hardware.\nBut Arm is increasingly competitive in computing, said Rene Haas, president of Arm\u2019s main products group. He said Arm had made key changes to improve the computing performance of each processor core, or the individual calculating engines laid out on each piece of silicon.\nCloud-style computing chores also can better exploit lots of relatively simple cores and special-purpose circuitry, said Amazon\u2019s Mr. DeSantis. Its Arm-based chip, the Graviton2, has 64 such cores compared with up to 24 more powerful cores on Intel server chips, he said. That helps it perform computing tasks that are done simultaneously, like serving up web pages to different people.\nAmpere, a chip start-up in Santa Clara, Calif., has developed an 80-core Arm server chip and expects to release a 128-core version next year. Ren\u00e9e James, Ampere\u2019s chief executive, said its customers and investors included the software giant Oracle, which plans to offer a cloud computing service based on Ampere\u2019s chips.\nArm \u201cis real with Amazon,\u201d Ms. James said. \u201cTheir competitors will follow suit.\u201d\nGerard Williams III, chief executive of Nuvia, another start-up promoting Arm-based chips, said Arm backers had also benefited asIntel lost the lead in driving manufacturing innovationsthat make chips do more at a lower cost. Chip producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics can now pack more functions on each slice of silicon, which means Arm chip designers that use them can achieve speed advantages.\nThe change is showing up in many forms of computing. In laptop computers, Gartner, the research firm, predicted that Apple\u2019s new Macs and rivals\u2019 responses would push Arm-based PCs to 13.5 percent of the market by 2024, up from 1.1 percent this year.\nChromebooks, the simple andless-expensive portable laptops tailored for web use, are also increasingly adopting Arm-based chips. Arm-based laptops and related systems based on Google\u2019s Chrome software accounted for about 11 percent of sales in the third quarter, up from about 4 percent a year earlier, according to IDC.\nSoftware remains a question mark, since most popular programs were designed for Intel-based systems. But even that is starting to change, with software makers like Adobe moving to support Arm-based Macs and Windows laptops. For now, both Apple and Microsoft have created technology to help run existing programs on Arm-based systems.\nSome customers of Amazon\u2019s Arm-based computing service said they had found it was speedier and cheaper than using a similar service based on Intel\u2019s chips. Don MacAskill, chief executive of SmugMug, which operates its own photo site and the better-known Flickr, said computing jobs like searching through billions of images ran 10 percent to 20 percent faster than Amazon services using Intel or compatible chips. He also said SmugMug had saved 38 percent in computing costs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s big,\u201d he said, \u201cand I see it right on my bottom line.\u201d"

        "title": "Facebook\u2019s Tone-Deaf Attack on Apple",
        "fulltext": "If there\u2019s anything that Facebook has learned from its many years of cozying up to the Trump administration, it\u2019s figuring out that shamelessness works.\nThat is the only explanation I can come up with after seeing the social networking giant\u2019srighteous ad campaignthis week against Apple.\nCasting itself as the protector of small businesses in full-page ads in \u2014 irony alert \u2014 big newspapers, Facebook is criticizing Apple for planning to give users of its popular devices like the iPhone more control over the data they share with third-party apps.\nStarting next year,Apple will ask mobile usersto \u201copt in\u201d to accept third-party tracking of their digital activity (right now, the system defaults to tracking and requires users to \u201copt out\u201d if they don\u2019t want to be followed). Facebook relies on tracking to target ads at customers.\nFacebook declared in the newspaper ads that it was \u201cstanding up to Apple\u201d and warned that such a change will be the ruin of small businesses.\nMore like the ruin of Facebook. The company is terrified that giving users single-click power to control their own information will force people to realize just how loud is the data-sucking sound coming from Facebook\u2019s app.\nLet\u2019s be clear: Apple is no saint. While looking and acting like a defender of user privacy has long been a core tenet of the company, its bottom line does not depend on advertising, and ridding the world of intrusive marketing by kneecapping Facebook is good for its business.\nIn fact, Apple has its own sins to answer for. Many people claim it has too much control over the third-party developers that are dependent on Apple\u2019s mobile app ecosystem, an issue that has gained a lot of regulatory and legal attention of late. Apple takesa 30 percent cutof many of the transactions that take place in the App Store, and many companies say that fee is unreasonably high; some say it is predatory.\nThe regulatory and legal questions around Apple\u2019s practices are behind Facebook\u2019s strategy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In its attack ads on Apple, Facebook added that it would help antitrust regulators and others \u2014 like the Fortnite parent company Epic Games \u2014 on the App Store issue.\nThe fight is deliciously entertaining, but it is not the first time the companies have clashed. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, can barely suppress a sneer when he talks about the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive. Facebook executives have long derided what they consider Apple management\u2019s highhanded and sanctimonious tone.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a prig,\u201d a top Facebook executive said to me about Mr. Cook several years ago. This followed an interview I did with Mr. Cook in which he dissed Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a menace,\u201d an Apple executive said to me about Mr. Zuckerberg after the Facebook chief executive tried to take aim at Apple for being elitist and too pricey at a congressional hearing.\nWhatever, boys. But the cracks we are seeing this week are the most significant \u2014 and could spell trouble for both companies. Apple, pointing out Facebook\u2019s data gluttony, and Facebook, in turn, noting Apple\u2019s hegemony over mobile, make one thing clear: These tech companies have too much power. And no matter how you slice it, they are all in dire need of government regulation.\nAt least Apple can read the room. It\u2019s beginning to change the rules of the App Store and loosen its grip over developers. I would not be surprised if Apple found a way to make more concessions, hoping to fend off moredangerous antitrust action, by subjecting the App Store to some sort of scheme to level the playing field around fees and more.\nFacebook, on the other hand, knows only one move: Exert power through money and influence, a strategy that\u2019s undergirded by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarkable streak of stubbornness in the face of persistent criticism. It seems impossible for him or the team around him to reflect on why so many people have come to dread the company\u2019s leadership.\nFacebook is the master of the slow roll, dragging its feet to take corrective action when it makes mistakes. It delayed for years before finally tackling disinformation on its platform. The company continued untoward cozying up to the Trump administration. I am almost never surprised to see Facebook take the hard line when taking a softer one might do.\nThis approach most likely has a lot to do with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s enormous success at a very young age and the confidence that came with pushing ahead when others doubted him. It does not take a psychologist to understand that he believes might makes right.\nAnd mighty he is. Mr. Zuckerberg has built quite an empire, which rules great stretches of our digital lives \u2014 and it seems impregnable. Except, of course, when the world\u2019s most powerful maker of mobile devices decides to add a pop-up to its repertoire, which could change the equation for Facebook instantly.\nSeveral years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg saw such a threat and tried his hardest to introduce his own mobile software interface in 2013, called Facebook Home. It was a flop, one of the few in his career, which might now have bigger reverberations no matter how many indignant newspaper ads Facebook buys.\nThis brings to mind a famous quote from a different leader laid low, which might now be applied to Mr. Zuckerberg: His kingdom for a phone.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
