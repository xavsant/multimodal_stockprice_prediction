        "title": "Music Publishing Deal Driven by Shift From Sales to Streaming",
        "fulltext": "In the latest change to the rapidly evolving business of music publishing, Sesac, a boutique rights group backed by private equity, has agreed to buy the Harry Fox Agency, a major clearinghouse of songwriting rights, the two groups plan to announce on Tuesday.\nThe deal, made with the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association \u2014 a trade group that has owned Harry Fox since its creation in 1927 \u2014 would allow Sesac to combine two kinds of licensing that have long been separate in the fragmented world of music publishing, which centers on the copyrights for songwriting.\nSesac, known as a performing rights organization, collects royalties whenever the 400,000 songs in its catalog \u2014 including works written by Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond and Kurt Cobain \u2014 are played on the radio, streamed online or even piped into shopping malls. TheHarry Fox Agencyhandles the so-called mechanical licenses from song publishers that record companies need to sell CDs and downloads.\nGaining the ability to issue both kinds of licenses would enable Sesac to handle digital rights more efficiently, said John Josephson, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive. It would also give Sesac control of the valuable data that is generated from digital outlets like Apple, Spotify and Pandora, giving it an advantage over Ascap and BMI, its much bigger rivals in the American performing-rights business.\n\u201cThere are so many overlapping kinds of licenses required for digital platforms that it is very hard for a composer or publisher to really understand how much value they are getting,\u201d Mr. Josephson said on Monday. \u201cImagine a future where the licensing regime is simpler and more straightforward.\u201d\nTerms of Sesac\u2019s purchase, which still requires the approval of members of the publishers\u2019 association, were not disclosed.\nThe deal comes as the once rigidly defined roles in music publishing are beginning to shift with the rise of digital music.\nIn the days when publishers\u2019 income was dominated by record sales, the mechanical licenses handled by Harry Fox Agency were a lucrative business that largely financed the operations of the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, said that group\u2019s chief executive, David Israelite. But with the decline in record sales and the rise of streaming services, performing rights have become dominant.\nAscap and BMI, which handle only performing rights, have both asked the Justice Department for changes to their federal regulatory agreements that would, among other mitigations, let them also handle mechanical rights. (Sesac is not subject to the same regulation.)\nRecently, other publishing groups likeGlobal Music RightsandKobalthave also posed challenges to the traditional model of royalty collection from online services.\nLarry Miller, an associate professor of music business at the Steinhardt School at N.Y.U., said that the deal might set off more changes in the publishing business, particularly if Ascap and BMI gain the ability to license mechanical rights.\n\u201cIf the Sesac-H.F.A. deal goes through, it may signal the start of a new cycle of competition, consolidation and deal-making in the global music rights industry,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\nSesac, based in Nashville, was established in 1930 as the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers. It has long been a boutique alternative to Ascap and BMI, which together represent about 90 percent of the commercially available songs in the United States. But in recent years Sesac has grown more aggressive in building its catalog and expanding its services. Last year, it bought Rumblefish, a company that specializes in small licensing deals for YouTube videos and other digital outlets.\nIn late 2012, the private equity firm Rizvi Traverse took control of 75 percent of Sesac in a deal that valued the company at about $600 million. Unlike Ascap and BMI, which operate as nonprofits, Sesac does not report its finances publicly, but recently Moody\u2019s Investors Serviceestimatedthat the company had about $182 million in revenue last year."

        "title": "Addicted to Your Smartphone? The Company That Made It Would Like You to Think So.",
        "fulltext": "Who is making the most noise about smartphone overuse? It seems that it might be smartphone companies themselves.\nAsurveyreleased this week by Motorola tried to illustrate that people around the world are obsessed with smartphones. A recentreportfrom Ericsson also emphasized the amount of time certain users are spending on their phones.\nEven the company that popularized the smartphone is expressing concern for its customers. In aninterview with Wiredearlier this year, Kevin Lynch, the man responsible for developing the software for the Apple Watch, seemed concerned about our inability to detach:\n\u201cWe\u2019re so connected, kind of ever-presently, with technology now,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cPeople are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much.\u201d\nWe askedBrian X. Chen, The Times\u2019s consumer technology expert and the author of a book about constant connectivity, \u201cAlways On,\u201d to explain why smartphone companies are so interested in what their products are doing to us. He said that because consumer anxiety about overusing smartphones has lessened, companies feel more comfortable using that line of thinking as a way to market new products.\nWhy are all these studies coming out about smartphone addiction? Do you think it\u2019s something that people are worried about?\nI think Microsoft and Nokia tried to do this in 2010. They had all these ads come out that said the Windows phone is better than iPhone because it helps you get away from your phone more. We made this more streamlined, more efficient and easier to use, so therefore, you\u2019re going to spend less time on your smartphone. Which, you know, just didn\u2019t turn out to be true. It was just a marketing twist, and we\u2019re seeing more of that now.\nBut there are definitely people who are anxious about using their smartphones too much. Do you think those people are addicted? Are there legitimate worries about using our phones too much?\nIt\u2019s a case-by-case basis, but there are legitimate concerns for people and their everyday interactions. It\u2019s generally rude to keep looking at your smartphone when you\u2019re at dinner with your friends, for example. When you\u2019re in a relationship, and you\u2019re spending more time with your smartphone than you are with your partner, then you probably have a problem. So I think those are some of the concerns when it comes to our social relationships.\nHave you ever had anyone complain to you that you\u2019re on your phone too much?\nI get more of the criticism for video games. But yes, there are technology issues that come up in my life. I\u2019m addicted to email probably, working at The New York Times where our bosses are just emailing us all day. I kind of have to tell myself to get away from that on the weekend and set my own limitations and restrictions.\nHow would you suggest people stay away from their phones?\nThe way that I\u2019ve set it up is I only get sound for emails when I get emails from my bosses, and I use the V.I.P. alerts on the iPhone. I pretty much ignore everything else, unless it\u2019s friends. I turn on \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d every day from midnight to 6 a.m. just so I\u2019m not getting crazy email noises while we\u2019re sleeping.\nAn argument I make in the book is, simply, if it\u2019s really becoming a problem, you can start setting restrictions around yourself. For example, at dinner turn on airplane mode on the iPhone. And stop looking at your phone; pay attention to your partner and your friends and so on. You can do these things!\nTheMIT Technology Reviewhad a report a couple of years ago that claimed that smartphones had spread with \u201cunprecedented speed.\u201d Do you think the speed of adoption has contributed to the anxiety?\nI kind of feel like the opposite: The fact that smartphone adoption is spreading so quickly is kind of proof that people are getting past that anxiety. Back when the smartphone was still becoming a mainstream thing, that\u2019s when anxiety was at its peak. But there have been very few studies suggesting anything severely negative about using smartphones.\nThere has always been fear of new technology. The classic example is that Aristotle warned that using the pen to write would make us stop memorizing things, and that certainly turned out not to be true. And then there\u2019s the television. The television is funny in that we\u2019ve all moved on, but that\u2019s one piece of technology that we should actually be more concerned about because it involves a lot of sitting around. And sitting is really, really bad for you.\n"

        "title": "Apple Music Is Strong on Design, Weak on Social Networking",
        "fulltext": "WHEN I visited Microsoft many years ago, an employee cheekily compared designing Microsoft Office to \u201cmaking a pizza that feeds a billion people.\u201d At Apple, the company has a differentsaying: \u201cThere are a thousand \u2018no\u2019s\u2019 for every \u2018yes.\u2019\u00a0\u201d In other words, they vigorously debate a feature before it shows up in a product.\nBut Apple Music, the company\u2019s reboot of iTunesreleased Tuesdayfor Apple devices and personal computers (including Windows), sounds like a pizza straight out of Microsoft\u2019s kitchen. Apple said \u201cyes\u201d to cramming every popular method of consuming music into one app: a streaming service similar to Spotify; radio features that compete with Internet and satellite services like Pandora and Sirius XM; and its old music player for listening to downloaded songs.\nAdd to that list the playlists curated by Apple employees and content partners like Rolling Stone, along with Connect, a social network for musicians to interact with fans, and you have a complex bundle of software and services.\nAfter a day with Apple Music, I found it to be a multifaceted package that was confusing in some ways, but intuitive where it mattered most. Its approach to design is generally friendlier to users than similar streaming services, and choosing a song to listen to is quick and easy. But Apple dropped the ball with social networking, an area it has long misunderstood.\ntranscript\niTunes is a giant in the digital music game, but hasn\u2019t really offered good streaming music services yet. That all may change next week, when Apple\u2019s expected to launch a new streaming effort based on Beats Music. But there are plenty of great streaming music services that you can already try, often for free, and now is a great time to experiment.\n\nSpotify is a name you\u2019ll probably know. It\u2019s the biggest name in streaming music, and it\u2019s app is very good. Like most streaming music services the idea is that instead of having just a few music files stored on your phone, you can instead listen to Spotify\u2019s music tracks streamed over the airwaves to your device. Through Spotify you can access any one of roughly 20 million songs, by artists ranging from indie bands through to well known names. There\u2019s classical music too. \n\nThe app is free to download on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, and is similar on all three. You can search for a particular track or artist, and stream music for free. If you want you can build a playlist of lots of different tracks like a mix tape, perfect for parties, or just play a single track or album. There\u2019s also a social media feature where you can see what music your friends have been listening to, and share your own music choices. \n\nSpotify also has a radio station-like system where it will play a sequence of music tracks from a particular artist, a genre like \u201cpop\u201d or even moods like \u201cchill\u201c. But these may be the weakest parts of the app, and you\u2019ll probably find yourself frequently pressing skip due to poor track choices. \n\nOn Spotify\u2019s free service you cannot play a single track at a time, and have to shuffle play a particular artist or playlist, with only six skips an hour. You\u2019ll also have adverts embedded in the audio stream, that get increasingly annoying. This is deliberate, to tempt you into buying the premium ad-free service costing $10 a month. \n\nRdio rivals Spotify, and in many ways it\u2019s similar. The music catalog of around 35 million tracks is bigger than Spotify\u2019s which means that Rdio may have some music that you can\u2019t find elsewhere. \n\nThe app works as you may expect: You can search for particular tracks, albums or artists and take advantage of Rdio\u2019s recommendations to find new music based on genres or moods. The \u201cYou FM\u201d radio-like streaming service is particularly good. It\u2019s based on your musical taste and this type of playlist could be ideal while you\u2019re concentrating on work, or some other task.\n\nRdio also has some social media features based on Twitter and Facebook, so you can see other user\u2019s listening habits and share your own. And, like Spotify, it has an offline mode so if you know you\u2019re going to be off the grid for a while you can pre-download music tracks you want to listen to.\n\nThe interface is lighter than Spotify\u2019s, in color and complexity\u2014it feels pleasant to use Rdio, and its easy to know where you are as you navigate the various options. The app offers good audio quality as part of its free ad-supported subscription level, but if you pay for premium level you can choose higher quality. The premium levels start at $5 a month, without ads when you listen on your phone but with limited offline downloads, and a $10 a month \u201cunlimited\u201d level without restrictions. Rdio is free to download on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, and it\u2019s an easy to use and very likeable app.\n\nGoogle has its own music streaming system, Google Play Music All Access. The system has about the same amount of music in its catalog as Spotify, with similar audio quality. The app works best on Android devices, as you may expect, and if you\u2019re already someone who purchases music from Google Play, All Access is a great companion service. There is a limited iOS version of the app. \nBut while All Access does have a free listening subscription level, but you do have to enter your credit card details into your account even for this free level. The app is also less attractive to look at and clumsier than its rivals. \n\nTidal is a strange new streaming music app. The idea behind Tidal is that it has high audio quality and is pays the artists more than its rivals. Tidal has over 20 million songs in its catalog as well as thousands of music videos and interesting articles. Tidal\u2019s interface is nothing special, however, and it may remind you of some of its rivals. Plus there is no free listening tier for Tidal, with subscriptions starting at $13 a month. Very high audio quality music costs $25 a month. The app itself is free on iOS and Android.\n\nLastly Noon Pacific is an unusual streaming service, different to the rest. This app delivers a new streaming playlist of ten songs every Monday at Noon, Pacific time. The tracks are hand curated by a team who scans top music blogs to discover the most interesting new music. The app updates weekly but you can also access over 100 previously-curated streaming playlists and discover more new sounds. Best of all, Noon Pacific is absolutely free on iOS, and Android (though reviewers complain about flaws in Android\u2019s app).\n\nQuick Call\n\nProductivity app experts Readdle have a new email app out for iOS called Spark. Using clever algorithms the idea is to take the strain out of managing your different email accounts, all from inside one app. Spark also has Apple Watch integration, where you can actually respond to mails from your watch. Try it for free. \n\n\nAPP LIST\n\nSpotify iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8\nSpotify Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en\nSpotify WinPhone https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/spotify/10f2995d-1f82-4203-b7fa-46ddbd07a6e6\n\nRdio iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rdio-music/id335060889?mt=8\nRdio Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdio.android.ui&hl=en\nRdio Windows Phone https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/rdio/aab4252d-a0e0-df11-a844-00237de2db9e\n\nGoogle Play Music Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music&hl=en\nGoogle Play Music iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-music/id691797987?mt=8\n\nTidal iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tidal/id913943275?mt=8\nTidal Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspiro.tidal&hl=en\n\nNoon Pacific iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noon-pacific/id803563983?mt=8\nNoon Pacific Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.np.noonpacific&hl=en\n\nReaddle Spark iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-fast-smart-email-for/id997102246?mt=8\nWhen you open Apple Music, Apple tells you about the focus of the new service: playlists made for you. The first screen has a neighborhood of magenta bubbles inviting you to touch your favorite genres and choose some of your favorite artists. From there, the app ushers you to For You, a section of playlists it generated based on your selections.\nSo-called human curation is the heart and soul of Apple Music. When Apple introduced the app in June, executives like Jimmy Iovine boasted about the novelty of Apple playlists that were curated by people, \u201cnot just algorithms.\u201d (One thing he neglected to mention: So are the playlists of its main competitors, Pandora or Spotify.)\nApple\u2019s picks for me brought up playlists like \u201cThe Smiths: Ballads\u201d and Wilco\u2019s album \u201cBeing There.\u201d Not bad for a first swab of my stuck-in-the-past music palette. The playlists are easy to choose from, with big, immersive graphics of album art, labeled with clean captions describing the year when each album was released. You can add favorite playlists to the My Music section for easy access later, and you can also save songs or playlists to be playable without an Internet connection.\nJust as important as the design of the app is the time it takes to pick and play a song. In this way, Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, plays an important role. Siri understands commands like \u201cPlay songs by Feist\u201d or \u201cPlay instrumentals,\u201d and is set to get smarter in iOS 9, the next version of Apple\u2019s software system for iPhones and iPads coming this fall. Voice controlling is ideal for picking music while on the go, especially when driving.\nThe radio section, on the other hand, can be confusing. Featured prominently on top of the radio section is Beats 1, Apple\u2019s new live radio station hosted by in-house producers, likeZane Lowe, Britain\u2019s influential radio D.J. It lacks Apple branding to communicate that it is a station led by Apple staff; it also doesn\u2019t adhere to a specific genre. The channel shows a list of \u201cupcoming shows\u201d with vague descriptions, so it will be tough to predict when Apple\u2019s D.J.s will play music that suits your tastes.\nAdding to the confusion, below the Beats 1 station are channels for other online radio stations that are not from Apple staff, like country music and NPR news.\nThe weakness of Apple Music is Connect, the social network for musicians, which allows artists to upload media, like postings about their concert dates or album releases. Fans can follow artists and \u201clove\u201d or comment on these posts.\nBut the artists I followed, like Kings of Leon, Belle and Sebastian and Sonic Youth, used Connect as a portal to upload seemingly arbitrary photos and link to places where people could buy their iTunes albums. And they didn\u2019t appear to be socializing with fans. That\u2019s not a social network; it\u2019s a broadcasting platform. Within hours of Apple Music\u2019s release, users of the social news site Redditposted instructionson removing Connect from the app.\nConnect also does not allow consumers to connect with one another and listen to other playlists, the modern equivalent of sharing a mixtape with your friend, which was popularized by Spotify.\nTo use the pizza metaphor again, Apple\u2019s streaming music simply looks more appetizing than Spotify\u2019s. Both companies\u2019 services are complex in terms of features, and both have access to roughly 30 million songs \u2014 but Apple does a better job arranging the \u201ctoppings.\u201d\nDifferent music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.\nWhen opening Spotify\u2019s app, for example, a user is directed to a drab, black-and-white list of options, like Search, for looking up songs and artists to stream, and Browse, for navigating new content and different genres. You wouldn\u2019t be the first person to wonder what the difference is between \u201csearch\u201d and \u201cbrowse.\u201d\nApple Music\u2019s big advantage is that it will work better on Apple devices. Spotify and others can\u2019t take advantage of Siri to find songs to play, for one. Apple Music is also a better buying experience for Apple customers: Apple\u2019s hundreds of millions of customers with registered iTunes accounts can use the one-tap payment system to sign up for a three-month trial and eventually pay $10 a month for Apple Music.\nSpotify normally costs $1 for the first three months and thereafter $10 a month when you sign up through its website, but it charges $13 a month inside Apple\u2019s in-app payments service to make up for the 30 percent cut it gives up to Apple.\nA true test for Apple Music will be whether consumers understand how it works and whether they will stick with it long enough to pay for it after the free trial.\nI suspect that given the perks of the service for Apple users, customers who are on a strict Apple diet will be hooked on Apple Music. (A version of Apple Music for Android devices will be out later this fall.) And people who use products made by companies like Microsoft, Samsung, Panasonic and Sony will opt for alternatives like Spotify and Pandora, because they can run on a range of devices, from game consoles to television sets."

        "fulltext": "For some emoji enthusiasts, there\u2019s always room for a new icon on the keyboard.\nTaco Bell is helping lead the charge to add a taco. Several publications havesuggested their own additions. And more than 15,000 supporters of the redheaded community arecampaigning for representation on Change.org.\nNow, Jeremy Burge, emoji afficianado and founder of a website calledEmojipedia, has created a social media campaign calledWorld Emoji Day, which he set for July 17 based on the calendar shown on iPhones.

Contenders on Reddit so far include strips of bacon, a rainbow flag and, yes, a taco.\nBut an Internet campaign doesn\u2019t mean those suggestions will be added.

Some never make it to that point. For example, last year, Unicode approved more than 230 emojis, but Apple has made only one available to iPhone users, Mr. Burge said.\n\u201cSome emojis may never see the light of day,\u201d he said.\nEarlier this year, Unicode worked with Apple to addmore than 300 emojis, many focused on diversity aftercriticismover a perceived lack of black emojis.

        "title": "Apple Waits as App Developers Study Who\u2019s Buying Its Watch",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the months surrounding the much-ballyhooed release of theAppleWatch, Apple managers courtedFacebookin the hopes that the social networking giant would make a software application for the new gadget.\nFacebook was not persuaded. Three months afterthe watch\u2019s release, there is no Facebook app tailored for it. Adam Mosseri, who oversees Facebook\u2019s news feed, said the social network had been studying the Apple Watch but had not figured out how to deliver a good Facebook experience \u2014 including the news feed\u2019s stream of posts, photos and videos \u2014 on such a small screen.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we could get it all in there in a way that feels good and works well,\u201d Mr. Mosseri said in a recent interview. \u201cYou\u2019d just want to get your phone out at that point.\u201d\nFacebook, which built versions of its Messenger and WhatsApp messaging services for Google\u2019s older Android watch software system, said it was continuing to evaluate the Apple Watch, just as it does all new platforms.\nThe lack of support from Facebook \u2014 and from other popular app makers like Snapchat and Google, which also have few if any apps for Apple Watch \u2014 underscores the skepticism that remains in the technology community about the wearable device. That puts the watch, Apple\u2019s first new product since theiPad in 2010, in something of a Catch-22: The companies whose apps would most likely prompt more people to buy the device are waiting to see who is buying it and how they use it.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Apple Watch lacks apps. Apple released the device in April with more than3,000 apps\u2014 far more than the 500 that were available for theiPhonewhen the App Store opened in 2008.\nYet only five of the 20 most popular free iPhone apps in the United States have versions for the Apple Watch, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. And the number ofapps for the watch, which now stands at about 7,400, is growing at a slower rate than the explosive uptick of apps that were produced for iPhones and iPads in their early days. While the number of apps for the watch jumped 142 percent in the first three months, that compared to 437 percent for the iPhone and 200 percent for theiPad, according to data provided by App Annie.\nApple declined to comment on the sales performance of the watch.\nJust how well the watch is selling \u2014 and whether the absence of prominent apps is affecting sales \u2014 may be signaled on Tuesday when Apple reports earnings for its fiscal third quarter. The company has said it did not intend to give specific sales data on the watch and instead would wrap it into a category that it called \u201cother.\u201d Investors and tech followers are expected to scrutinize that category to try to calculate whether the watch has been a hit or miss.\nAnalysts estimated that Apple sold three million to five million watches for the quarter. At five million, sales of the watch would surpass those of iPhones and iPads in the first quarters that they became available.\nWhatever the numbers are, \u201cit\u2019s significant because some people may be viewing it as a litmus test for Apple to launch products\u201d under Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.\nOf the prominent app makers that are missing from Apple Watch, several echo Facebook in saying they are still trying to determine how to make the most of their apps on the device\u2019s small screens, the largest of which is about 1.3 inches by 1.65 inches. For example, at a technology conference in May, Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s chief executive, said he did not find the watch compelling.\n\u201cWhy would you look at a small picture when you can look at a large one on your phone?\u201d Mr. Spiegel said, adding that he preferred to focus on improving Snapchat \u2014 an app made for sharing images and videos \u2014 for other platforms. A Snapchat spokeswoman said the company had no additional comment on the watch.\nGoogle, which has invested in its smartwatch platform called Android Wear, could use the Apple device as another hook to its services, like Gmail. Yet though Google offers a news and weather app for the watch, its more prominent mobile services, like Google Maps and Gmail, are missing from the catalog. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.\nAnother challenge with the Apple Watch software system is that apps have to process all the data on the iPhone and then beam it to the watch, limiting what the Apple Watch apps can do. The next version of the software, which will be released in the fall, will remedy this by letting developers write apps that run directly on the watch, relying on the iPhone mostly for the Internet connection.\nDespite the limitations, some app makers have been enthusiastic about the watch, including the Weather Channel, which introduced an app for the smartwatch in April.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there for every Apple product launch, so we felt we had to be there,\u201d said Chris Huff, who heads application development for the company. \u201cPeople want to get the weather wherever they\u2019re at.\u201d\nBut Mr. Huff added, \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring out how users want to use an app on their wrist.\u201d\nSo far, the Weather Channel has focused on delivering notifications \u2014 like lightning alerts \u2014 and tracking weather in real time by asking people to confirm with a tap on the wrist that it is raining or snowing where they are.\nMr. Huff said the Weather Channel expects to do more with the watch when Apple releases the new version of the watch software in the fall. \u201cWe\u2019re really bullish,\u201d he said.\nInstagram, which is owned by Facebook and produces a photo- and video-sharing app, was also an early adopter, after it concluded that browsing and liking photos were natural activities for those viewing the tiny screen.\n\u201cThe Apple Watch allows us to make the Instagram experience even more intimate and in the moment,\u201d Instagram said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the launch of this platform.\u201d\nTap Tap Tap, the app studio that makes the photography app Camera Plus, introduced a version of its software for the watch this year. The watch app acts as a remote control to let users use the iPhone camera from afar. John Casasanta, a founder of the company, said it made the watch app for experimental purposes \u2014 and he remained skeptical about the device.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a single thing that makes people say, \u2018I have to get this watch,\u2019 \u201d he said.\nApple is trying to make it easier for developers to make more powerful watch apps. The company has releaseda tool kit for developersthat gives them deeper access to the watch\u2019s heart-rate and motion sensors, among other components. The first batch of smarter watch apps will arrive this fall, according to Apple.\nEven without many of the most prominent apps, owners of the new device appear to like it. Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that based on responses from a panel of 1,000 Apple watch owners who were contacted in the last week, consumers reported high satisfaction with the product and few who had bought the watch had stopped using it.\n\u201cWe have constantly come up with the sentiment that people really, really like it,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said."
