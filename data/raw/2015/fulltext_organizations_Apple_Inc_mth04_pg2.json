        "fulltext": "\n\nThe Apple Watch promises to make users\u2019 lives better in a number of ways, from helping them stay on schedule to tracking their physical activity. But early reviews of the product suggest another possible improvement:\n                                        It might get us to quit staring at our phones.\nAt The Times, Farhad Manjoowritesthat the watch \u201ccould address some of the\n                                        social angst wrought by smartphones.\u201d It communicates with wearers in part via a system of taps, minimizing the amount of time they have to spend actually looking at the screen. The device, Mr. Manjoo writes,\n                                        \u201ccould usher in a transformation of social norms just as profound as those we saw with its brother, the smartphone \u2014 except, amazingly, in reverse.\u201d\nGeoffrey A. Fowler at The Wall Street Journalappreciatesthe tapping system. The watch, he writes, \u201chas\n                                        made me more present. I\u2019m less likely to absent-mindedly reach for my phone, or feel compelled to leave it on the table during supper.\u201d\nMr. Manjoo and Mr. Fowler both report looking at the watch screen for shorter stints than they\u2019d spend on their phones, but it\u2019s certainly possible to imagine users getting more glued to their watch screens\n                                        with time. And heavy users of photo- and video-sharing apps will likely remain tied to their phones for now, since the watch has no camera. Still, the device at least suggests an alternative to the status quo.\nIPhones are by now notorious as thieves of attention, but it\u2019s not at all clear that people actually want to be as attentive to them as they are. The sheer frequency of public pledges to put the phone down and\n                                        spend more time talking to friends and family suggests that while it\u2019s certainly easy to kill an hour scrolling through Twitter, it may not actually be all that pleasant. (Relatedly, Facebook use is ubiquitous,\n                                        but isassociated with depression.)\nThose who argue that smartphone use is destroying society are overstating the case. As Nathan Jurgenson hasargued, interactions that take place\n                                        via digital devices aren\u2019t necessarily evil, unhealthy, or fake. But it\u2019s worth asking if we actually enjoy all the time we spend with our phones, or if we might prefer to spend less. It\u2019s distinctly\n                                        possible that a less absorbing device might actually make us happier.\nWith the advent of the Apple Watch, some consumers \u2014 those able to drop at least $350, the price of the cheapest model \u2014 may have the opportunity to find out."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s method of releasing products like the iPhone is straightforward: On the day of release, you buy the phone at a retail store or it is delivered if you ordered online. The process is a lot less clear for\n                                        theApple Watch.\nApple first said in March that the Watch will beavailable starting April 24. Yet the company was vague\n                                        about whether that meant the device, which starts at $350, would be as obtainable as iPhones have been on their first day in stores. Apple instead said the gadget would be available online or by reservation in retail\n                                        stores.\nIn a memo this week, Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s head of retail operations and the former chief executive of Burberry, was more explicit. She said in the note to retail workers that the Apple Watch would not be\n                                        available for in-store purchases initially, reiterating that customers will have to order it online. Customers will begin receiving their Apple Watch orders on or after April 24, she added.\n\u201cMany of you have been getting questions asking if we will have the watch available in stores on April 24 for walk-in purchases,\u201d Ms. Ahrendts said in the letter, which was first reported by the blog9to5Mac. \u201cAs we announced last week, due to high global interest combined with our initial supply, we are only taking orders online\n                                        right now. I\u2019ll have more updates as we get closer to in-store availability, but we expect this to continue through the month of May.\u201d\nApple also this week dropped reference of the April 24 release date from its web page promoting the Watch, in a nod to how the smartwatch won\u2019t be available to consumers who just walk into a store. An Apple spokeswoman\n                                        declined to comment.\nApple has taken a radically different approach for releasing the Apple Watch. For the first time, the company invited consumers into stores totry on the Watchbefore the device\u2019s official release. In the past, consumers typically couldn\u2019t touch a new Apple device until it was publicly available.\nMs. Ahrendts said in the memo that\u00a0the company needed to come up with the preview approach for selling the Watch because \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything quite like it.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The era of online shopping made \u201cbuy before you try\u201d (and ship back if you don\u2019t like it) a typical consumer experience. TheApple Watch,\n                                        which comes out April 24, is probably something you should actually try before buying.\nThat\u2019s because the smartwatch, unlike past Apple products, is different from other gadgets that you\u2019ve ever owned. Sure, it\u2019s a wristwatch, but it\u2019s also a miniature computer packed with\n                                        features designed to augment the abilities of the iPhone. The watch cases and bands also come in different materials, sizes and colors. So you\u2019ll want to see how the watch\u00a0feels on your wrist and looks\n                                        with your outfit.\nApple is aware of the unique conditions of buying the Watch and has altered its retail operations accordingly. The company said that starting on Friday, customers could visit an Apple store to try on the Watch and see\n                                        the different bands \u2014 a full two weeks before they can actually obtain the gadget. With past Apple products, like the iPhone, consumers typically couldn\u2019t touch one until the device was already available\n                                        in stores.\nApple, in another break from the past, will allow people to buy the watch only online, for deliveries that will begin April 24.\n\u201cWe expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,\u201d said Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s head of retail operations, in amedia statement.\n                                        \u201cTo provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.\u201d\nShoppers can begin ordering the watch at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time on Friday. But if Apple is giving you a chance to try one in stores ahead of release, why not? The company encourages people to schedule an appointment\n                                        on its website, apple.com."
