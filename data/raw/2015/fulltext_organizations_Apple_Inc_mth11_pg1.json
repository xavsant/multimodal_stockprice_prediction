        "title": "Amazon\u2019s Streaming Music Aims for More Casual Listeners",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 The music industry\u2019s streaming wars are usually seen as having three major combatants: Spotify,AppleandPandora.\nOver the last year, however, another technology giant,Amazon, has been quietly building a competitor with a slightly different approach.Amazon Prime Music, available to subscribers of the company\u2019s $99-a-year Prime membership program, offers more than one million songs \u2014 a fraction of the catalogs available from services like Spotify and Apple Music, which each say they have more than 30 million tracks. And Prime Music lacks current hits by acts like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and the Weeknd.\nYet the company has begun to establish itself by focusing on what may be a vast part of the audience for streaming music: casual listeners and families. This part of the market, analysts say, may not mind the absence of a few current hits, especially considering that they can also receive the shipping discounts and streaming video offerings \u2014 like the Emmy-winning show \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 available to Prime members. And they may appreciate a surprise or two, like \u201cIndie for the Holidays,\u201d a playlist of 26 songs that Amazon commissioned from acts like Lisa Loeb, Rogue Wave, Robert Pollard and Langhorne Slim that will be available free for Prime members next week.\n\u201cThere are people on the cutting edge of music who really want to be deep into the catalog, and then there are a lot of mainstream music fans for whom just having some good music to listen to is sufficient,\u201d said Russ Crupnick of the consumer research firm MusicWatch. \u201cThat\u2019s where a service like Amazon works out just fine.\u201d\nAmazon has not disclosed how many people use Prime Music and estimates vary widely. Using surveys, MusicWatch said that about 8.5 million people listen for at least one hour a month; some music executives who have dealt with Amazon put the number closer to three million or four million. (According to a recent estimate by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the overall Amazon Prime program has 44 million subscribers in the United States.)\nThat is still well below the numbers for Spotify, which says it has 75 million users, including 20 million paid subscribers; and Apple, which has attracted 15 million users for its new Apple Music, 6.5 million of whom pay. Both cost $10 a month for a standard subscription.\nPandora has 78 million listeners, including 3.9 million who pay $5 a month for Pandora One, which eliminates advertising.\nBut analysts say that the growth of Amazon Prime Music since it began in June 2014 shows how quickly a major technology company can amass an audience large enough to challenge more established streaming services, especially when it bundles its music offerings with other services.\nSteve Boom, Amazon\u2019s vice president for digital music, said that the company began to develop its strategy for streaming music as the wider market for downloads began to tumble several years ago. \u201cAs customers have been shifting toward streaming, we knew we would ultimately have to get there,\u201d he said in an interview at Amazon\u2019s headquarters.\nThe company \u2014 which by some estimates is still the biggest retailer of CDs and vinyl records \u2014 found that its customers wanted to be able to stream music without ads, to skip songs as they pleased and to save songs on mobile devices to listen to when they were offline. And most customers, Mr. Boom said, did not need that full catalog that Spotify offered. (This reflects Amazon\u2019s broader strategy of emphasizing very low prices for its products to appeal to as wide a market as possible; the company recently began offering a Fire tablet for $50, for example.)\n\u201cWe went for a bit more of a mainstream listener,\u201d Mr. Boom said, \u201cfor whom access to everything at all times wasn\u2019t necessarily the main thing.\u201d\nThe resulting service is something of a cross between Pandora and Spotify. As an on-demand service, it lets users search for specific tracks to listen to, and is full of playlists and recommendations. But it also has radiolike feeds of songs organized by genre or artist.\nWhile other streaming services have had their greatest success withyounger-leaning genreslike hip-hop and electronic dance music, Amazon emphasized middle-of-the-road pop, indie rock and children\u2019s music.\n\u201cThe sweet spot of Prime is really the young family,\u201d Mr. Boom said, speaking near a conference room that was being used for a concert for Amazon employees and their children by the Pop Ups, a children\u2019s music duo that released an exclusive album with Amazon in September.\nDifferent music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.\nLast year, the company commissioned a playlist of holiday music, \u201cAll Is Bright,\u201d and this season it has doubled down on that strategy. Last month it released an exclusive album from Ms. Loeb, \u201cNursery Rhyme Parade,\u201d and on Friday it will begin streaming songs from \u201cChristmas in Tahoe,\u201d an exclusive album from the pop-rock group Train.\nMs. Loeb \u2014 best known for her 1994 song \u201cStay (I Missed You),\u201d and her signature cat-eye glasses \u2014 said that Amazon\u2019s ability to market her music to other mothers was unrivaled.\n\u201cFor me, as a mom, I know the power of Amazon,\u201d Ms. Loeb said in an interview. \u201cI go there multiple times a week, to buy diapers in the middle of the night or to pick up a birthday gift for a relative out of town. As a musician I am always interested in a new way to reach people who may be interested, and Amazon is in front of a lot of eyeballs every day.\u201d\nThe arrival of Prime Music last year was not fully welcomed in the music industry, as some record labels complained that the company was offering too little in licensing fees.Universal Music Group, the biggest label, held out for more than a year, before announcing a deal in September. Neither company would comment on the deal, but two people with knowledge of the negotiations said that Amazon eventually agreed to a higher royalty rate for Universal.\nArtists and managers who have been involved in exclusive content deals with Amazon said that the company offered generous terms and did not interfere with the recording process. Esm\u00e9 Patterson, a singer-songwriter whose song \u201cIf I\u201d is on \u201cIndie for the Holidays,\u201d said the only thing she was worried about was her anti-consumerist message.\n\u201cI said in the song that buying things wasn\u2019t the point of Christmas for me,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cI hoped that Amazon wouldn\u2019t be upset about that.\u201d There was no objection, she said.\nMr. Boom said that, despite the new collections, Amazon was not interested in acting as a record label in the same way that it had becomea television studio, with coming shows like \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d and a series written and directed by Woody Allen. But he said that the company would continue to experiment with music.\n\u201cThere\u2019s room in the market,\u201d Mr. Boom said, \u201cfor different types of services.\u201d"

        "title": "Weighing Benefits of Windows 10 Upgrade",
        "fulltext": "Q.Should I update to Windows 10 now that I\u2019ve gotten used to Windows 8.1? How big a change is it?\nA.Windows 8.1 has more in common with Windows 10 visually than does Windows 7, butthere are differences. For one, Windows 10 includes thevoice-activated Cortana assistantsoftware, which can respond to commands for web searches, making calendar appointments and more. A new browser calledMicrosoft Edgeis also part of the system. Windows 10 includesWindows Hello, biometric security software that unlocks your computer using facial recognition, iris scans or (if the PC has compatible hardware) your fingerprints.\nWindows 10 restores a variation of the Start menu, which was a popular desktop destination for many users before Windows 8 arrived. (If you miss having the full Windows 8.1 Start screen experience,you can adjust your Windows 10 settingsto make the Start menu behave more like the icon-filled screen in Windows 8.1.) Like Windows 8.1, the newer system includes easy access to Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive cloud storage service and the online Windows Store for downloading apps and games.\nMicrosoft issteadily promoting Windows 10as a free \u201coptional update\u201d to computers running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Thecompany has also statedthat early next year, it plans to switch Windows 10 from an optional update to a \u201crecommended update,\u201d which may cause computers configured toautomatically installrecommended updates to start the upgrade process themselves. You should see an alert before the upgrade proceeds and, asMicrosoft points out, you have a month to revert to your old system version if you absolutely hate Windows 10.\nAs with any operating system upgrade, plan to spend some time after you install the software getting used to the new features and tinkering with settings. If you want to see Windows 10 in action before you upgrade,visit Microsoft\u2019s websitefor videos and tutorials \u2014 and then check out the site\u2019ssupport forumsto read about the actual experiences from Windows 10 users.\nGetting the iMessage\nQ.I am missing a lot of text messages because they go to my iPad but not my iPhone. I thought Apple\u2019s message app sent everything to all your iOS devices, so why isn\u2019t this working?\nA.If you have previously set up andactivated iMessage without errorson your iPhone, open the Settings icon. Go to Messages andmake sure iMessage is enabled.\nApple\u2019sMessages service is separate from the SMS(Short Message Service) feature on your phone, so the text messages you actually got on the iPhone may have been sent through SMS if iMessage was turned off. The iPhone displays the standard SMS messages as green bubbles, while iMessage notes come in blue.\nTIP OF THE WEEK:Thanks to the built-inGuest Modein recent versions of Android, you do not have to worry about children or friends poking around in your personal photos and files if you temporarily lend out your phone or tablet. Before you pass over the device, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settings bar, tap it to expand the panel and tap your user account icon at the top of the screen.\nWhen the User box opens, tap Add Guest or Guest. The device pauses a moment to switch over from your user account to the Guest account \u2014 which can open basic Android apps (like the Chrome browser, YouTube and Google Maps) but none of your personal files. When the other person has finished using your phone or tablet, tap the user icon at the top of the screen and tap Remove Guest to switch back to your own user account and files."
