        "title": "Apple Gives Ground in a Strategic Retreat From Strict App Store Rules",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Apple opened its App Store in 2008, a year after it introduced the iPhone, the 30 percent fee it charged developers to sell their software in the store was an afterthought. But as apps went mainstream, the store turned into a $20 billion a year business, by some estimates.\nNow, under pressure from regulators and many of thosedevelopers, Apple is making a series of concessions that would appear to chip away at that giant business.\nOn Wednesday, prompted by an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission,Apple agreed to allow some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, to direct their users to payment methods outside its App Store when they sign up for subscriptions.\nThe tweak,coming after a similar change last week, was a strategic retreat of sorts, said analysts that track Apple\u2019s business. Apple \u2014 so far \u2014 is standing its ground on the App Store\u2019s cash cow: its share of the business from game makers.\nWhile Apple does not normally detail how its App Store business is divvied up, evidence presented in a recent court fight with Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite, provided some insight.\nIn 2016, 81 percent of Apple\u2019s App Store revenue came from games, compared to 3 percent for music and 4 percent for other forms of entertainment, according to a slide presented by Epic\u2019s lawyers. And on the witness stand in May, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the \u201cmajority\u201d of App Store revenue still comes from games.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something Apple will fight tooth-and-nail to defend,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Mr. Ives said any money Apple collects from so-called reader apps \u2014 the apps it gave ground to on Wednesday \u2014 was negligible at best.\nApple declined to comment.\nApple is facing growing pressure from regulators and politicians around the world. Its App Store is the target of an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Last month, the Senate also introducedantitrust legislation aimed at fostering competitionwith both Apple and Google\u2019s app stores.\nSouth Korea\u2019s parliament on Tuesdaypassed a billthat will ban app stores \u2014 namely Apple and Google \u2014 from forcing developers to use only their proprietary payment systems. There are also pending investigations into whether Apple is abusing its dominance in the App Store in Europe, Britain and, most recently,India.\nThe court fight with Epic, which played out in a federal court in Oakland, Calif., earlier this year, arguably presents the greater threat to Apple\u2019s App Store business. Epic wants to force the iPhone maker to allow app developers to avoid App Store commissions altogether, which would be a major financial hit to Apple. A federal judge is expected to soon issue a verdict in that case.\nWhile Apple has described the changes as a major concession to app developers, critics have argued that the moves are more for show than a substantive revamp of its business.\n\u201cA year ago, these concessions probably would have worked, and they still might, but legislators have built up momentum that could be hard to stop,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the investment bank Cowen.\nMore substantive reforms that Apple is likely hoping to avoid, critics said, would include drastically reducing or eliminating the 30 percent cut Apple receives from App Store purchases (like an item bought in a game), allowing other companies to install competing app stores on iPhones, or letting customers download apps directly from the internet.\nApple has not budged on its 30 percent cut over the years, with a few exceptions. In 2016, it lowered its commission for app users\u2019 subscriptions down to 15 percent after one year, and agreed last year to reduce its cut to 15 percent for small app developers.\nThe change announced on Wednesday allowed a set of so-called reader apps \u2014 which provide content for digital media like books, newspapers, music and video \u2014 to steer their customers to their own websites to purchase subscriptions.\nUntil then, under Apple\u2019s longstanding rules, apps like Netflix and Spotify were not allowed to advertise on their apps that users could purchase subscriptions on their websites. Spotify does, however, email new members a link to its website where it advertises its paid subscriptions, though it does not explicitly tell users to circumvent Apple.\nLast week, as part of a legal settlement with a group of app makers, Apple said companies could now email customers to tell them about ways to pay other than in their iPhone (or iPad) app. Apple also said it would create a $100 million fund for small app developers.\nDaniel Ek, the chief executive of Spotify, wrote in a tweet on Thursday morning that Apple\u2019s change was a \u201cstep in the right direction, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d He added that the goal was \u201cto restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time.\u201d\nTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive, said in a tweet that Apple had a great deal of leeway to determine which apps fall under the classification of reader apps and are now subject to different rules. And some critics noted that allowing companies to communicate with their own customers about payment methods was hardly a significant concession.\nWhen Apple first opened the App Store, Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, worried that bad apps from other companies would sully the experience for customers. It soon became clear that outside developers were creating apps for the smartphone that made it even more useful.\nNow those developers are trying to claw back what they gave up for access to the iPhone. But even in a worse case scenario for Apple \u2014 Epic wins and that victory survives inevitable court appeals \u2014 the iPhone maker is likely to continue to thrive.\n\u201cEven in the worst case scenario \u2014 and I don\u2019t think this will happen \u2014 where the commission goes to zero, the good news is Apple still makes a lot of money selling the device,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst at the financial firm D.A. Davidson."

        "fulltext": "It looked like a calculator app. But it was actually spyware recording my every keystroke \u2014 the type of data that would give a stalker unfettered access to my private life.\nThat\u2019s what I concluded after downloading the free app Flash Keylogger onto an Android smartphone this week. The app described itself as a tool to monitor the online activities of family members by logging what they type. Once it was installed from Google\u2019s official app store, its icon could be changed to that of a calculator or calendar app. In my tests, the app documented all of my typing, including web searches, text messages and emails.\nFlash Keylogger is part of arapidly expanding group of appsknown as \u201cstalkerware.\u201d While these appsnumbered in the hundredsa few years ago, they have since grown into the thousands. They are widely available on Google\u2019s Play Store and to alesser degree on Apple\u2019s App Store, often with innocuous names like MobileTool, Agent and Cerberus. And they have become such a tool for digital domestic abuse that Apple and Google have started in the last year acknowledging that the apps are an issue.\nFrom last September to May, the number of devices infected with stalkerware jumped 63 percent, according toa studyby the security firm NortonLifeLock. This month, the Federal Trade Commission said it hadbarred one app maker, Support King, from offering SpyFone, a piece of stalkerware that gains access to a victim\u2019s location, photos and messages. It was the first ban of its kind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely invasive, it\u2019s a very big deal and it\u2019s linked to some of the worst abuse I\u2019ve seen in intimate partner abuse,\u201d Eva Galperin, a cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights organization, said of the apps.\nStalkerware is a thorny issue because it lives in a gray area. There are legitimate uses for surveillance apps, like parental control software that monitors children online to protect them from predators. But this technology becomes stalkerware when it\u2019s stealthily installed on a partner\u2019s phone to spy on him or her without consent.\nSuch apps are more pervasive on phones running Android, researchers said, because the more open nature of Google\u2019s software system gives the programs deeper access to device data and lets people install whatever apps they want on their phones. Yetnew stalking software targeting iPhoneshas also emerged.\nGoogle said it banned apps that violated its policies, including the Flash Keylogger app after I contacted Google about it.\nAn Apple spokesman referred me to asafety guide that it published last yearin response to the threat of these apps. He added that the new stalkerware was not a vulnerability in the iPhone that could be fixed with technology if an abuser had access to a person\u2019s device and passcode.\nFighting stalkerware is tough. You may not suspect it\u2019s there. Even if you did, it can be difficult to detect since antivirus software only recently began flagging these apps as malicious.\nHere\u2019s a guide to how stalkerware works, what to look out for and what to do about it.\nSurveillance software has proliferated on computers for decades, but more recently spyware makers have shifted their focus to mobile devices. Because mobile devices have access to more intimate data, including photos, real-time location, phone conversations and messages, the apps became known as stalkerware.\nVarious stalkerware apps collect different types of information. Some record phone calls, some log keystrokes, and others track location or upload a person\u2019s photos to a remote server. But they all generally work the same way: An abuser with access to a victim\u2019s device installs the app on the phone and disguises the software as an ordinary piece of software, like a calendar app.\nFrom there, the app lurks in the background, and later, the abuser retrieves the data. Sometimes, the information gets sent to the abuser\u2019s email address or it can be downloaded from a website. In other scenarios, abusers who know their partner\u2019s passcode can simply unlock the device to open the stalkerware and review the recorded data.\nSo what to do? The Coalition Against Stalkerware, which was founded by Ms. Galperin and other groups, and many security firms offered these tips:\nLook for unusual behavior on your device, like a rapidly draining battery. That could be a giveaway that a stalker app has been constantly running in the background.\nScan your device. Some apps, like MalwareBytes, Certo, NortonLifeLock and Lookout, can detect stalkerware. But to be thorough, take a close look at your apps to see if anything is unfamiliar or suspicious. If you find a piece of stalkerware, pause before you delete it: It may be useful evidence if you decide to report the abuse to law enforcement.\nSeek help.In addition to reporting stalking behavior to law enforcement, you can seek advice fromresourceslike theNational Domestic Violence Hotlineor theSafety Net Projecthosted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\nAudit your online accountsto see which apps and devices are hooked into them. On Twitter, for example, you can click on the \u201csecurity and account access\u201d button inside the settings menu to see which devices and apps have access to your account. Log out of anything that looks shady.\nChange your passwords and passcode.It\u2019s always safer to change passwords for important online accounts and avoid reusing passwords across sites. Try creating long, complex passwords for each account. Similarly, make sure your passcode is difficult for someone to guess.\nEnable two-factor authentication.For any online account that offers it, usetwo-factor authentication, which basically requires two forms of verification of your identity before letting you log into an account. Say you enter your user name and password for your Facebook account. That\u2019s Step 1. Facebook then asks you to punch in a temporary code generated by an authentication app. That\u2019s Step 2. With this protection, even if an abuser figures out your password using a piece of stalkerware, he or she still can\u2019t log in without that code.\nOn iPhones, check your settings.A new stalker app, WebWatcher, uses a computer towirelessly download a backup copyof a victim\u2019s iPhone data, according to Certo, a mobile security firm. To defend yourself, open the Settings app and look at the General menu to see if \u201ciTunes Wi-Fi Sync\u201d is visible. If it shows up, disabling this will prevent WebWatcher from copying your data.\nApple said this was not considered an iPhone vulnerability because it required an attacker to be on the same Wi-Fi network and have physical access to a victim\u2019s unlocked iPhone.\nStart fresh.Buying a new phone or erasing all the data from your phone to begin anew is the most effective way to rid a device of stalkerware.\nUpdate your software.Apple and Google regularly issue software updates that include security fixes, which can remove stalkerware. Make sure you\u2019re running the latest software.\nIn the end, there\u2019s no true way to defeat stalkerware. Kevin Roundy, NortonLifeLock\u2019s lead researcher, said he had reported more than 800 pieces of stalkerware inside the Android app store. Google removed the apps andupdated its policy in Octoberto forbid developers to offer stalkerware.\nBut more have emerged to take their place.\n\u201cThere are definitely a lot of very dangerous, alarming possibilities,\u201d Mr. Roundy said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to be a concern.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Issues Emergency Security Updates to Close a Spyware Flaw",
        "fulltext": "Appleissued emergency software updates for a critical vulnerability in its products on Monday after security researchers uncovered a flaw that allows highly invasive spyware fromIsrael\u2019s NSO Groupto infect anyone\u2019siPhone,iPad, Apple Watch or Mac computer without so much as a click.\nApple\u2019s security team had worked around the clock to develop a fix since Tuesday, after researchers atCitizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog organization at the University of Toronto, discovered that a Saudiactivist\u2019s iPhone had been infected with an advanced form of spyware from NSO.\nThe spyware, called Pegasus, used a novel method to invisibly infectAppledevices without victims\u2019 knowledge. Known as a \u201czero click remote exploit,\u201d it is considered the Holy Grail of surveillance because it allows governments, mercenaries and criminals to secretly break into someone\u2019s device without tipping the victim off.\nUsing the zero-click infection method, Pegasus can turn on a user\u2019s camera and microphone, record messages, texts, emails, calls \u2014 even those sent via encrypted messaging and phone apps like Signal \u2014 and send them back to NSO\u2019s clients at governments around the world.\n\u201cThis spyware can do everything an iPhone user can do on their device and more,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, who teamed up with Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab, on the finding.\nThe discovery means that more than 1.65 billionAppleproducts in use worldwide have been vulnerable to NSO\u2019s spyware since at least March. It signals a serious escalation in the cybersecurity arms race, with governments willing to pay whatever it takes to spy on digital communications en masse, and with tech companies, human rightsactivistsand others racing to uncover and fix the latest vulnerabilities that enable such surveillance.\nApple issued a software update on Monday to fix a critical flaw in its products that had allowed governments to invisibly spy on Apple users without so much as a click.\nHere\u2019s how to update your iPhone with the software patch \u2192\nFirst, make sure your iPhone is plugged in or has at least 50 percent battery life.\nThen:\nGo to Settings.\nClick General.\nClick Software Update.\nClick Install Now to update to iOS 14.8.\nUpdating the software closes the flaw, which had let highly invasive spyware from Israel\u2019s NSO Group infect people\u2019s Apple devices.\nThe spyware was able to:\nTurn on a user\u2019s camera and microphone.\nRecord their messages, texts, emails and calls.\nTrack someone\u2019s location.\nSteal passwords.\nAccess encrypted messages.\nThe discovery of the spyware means that more than 1.65 billion Apple products in use worldwide have been vulnerable to NSO\u2019s spyware since at least March.\nBecause of how sophisticated the software was, it\u2019s hard to know whose devices had been compromised.It is critical to update your iPhone and other Apple devices\u2014 iPads, Mac computers and Apple Watch \u2014 with the new software as soon as possible.\nRead more onthe Apple software flaw that was patched.\nIn the past, victims learned their devices were infected by spyware only after receiving a suspicious link texted to their phone or email, and sharing the link with journalists or cybersecurity experts. But NSO\u2019s zero-click capability meant victims received no such prompt, and the flaw enabled full access to a person\u2019s digital life. Such abilities can fetch millions of dollars on the underground market for hacking tools, where governments are not regulators but are clients and are among the most lucrative spenders.\nOn Monday, Ivan Krsti\u0107, Apple\u2019s head of security engineering and architecture commended Citizen Lab for its findings and urged customers to run the latest software updates for the fixes to take effect, by installing iOS 14.8, MacOS 11.6 and WatchOS 7.6.2.\n\u201cAttacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life and are used to target specific individuals,\u201d Mr. Krsti\u0107 said.\nApplehas said it plans to introduce new security defenses for iMessage, Apple\u2019s texting application, in its next iOS 15 software update, expected later this year.\nNSO did not immediately respond to inquiries on Monday.\nNSO has long drawn controversy. The company has said that it sells its spyware only to governments that meet strict human rights standards and that it expressly requires customers to agree to use its spyware only to track terrorists or criminals.\nBut over the past six years, NSO\u2019s Pegasus spywarehas turned up on the phones of activists, dissidents, lawyers, doctors, nutritionists and even childrenin countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico.\nStarting in 2016,a series of New York Times investigationsrevealed the presence of NSO\u2019s spyware on the iPhones ofEmirati activists lobbying for expanded voting rights;Mexican nutritionists lobbying for a national soda tax; lawyers looking into the massdisappearance of 43 Mexican students; academics who helped write anti-corruption legislation; journalists in Mexico and England; and an American representing victims of sexual abuse by Mexico\u2019s police.\nIn July, NSO became the subject of further scrutiny after Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog, and Forbidden Stories, a group that focuses on free speech, teamed up with a consortium of media organizations on\u201cThe Pegasus Project\u201dto publish a list of 50,000 phone numbers, including some used by journalists, government leaders, dissidents and activists, that they said had been selected as targets by NSO\u2019s clients.\nThe consortium did not disclose how it had obtained the list, and it was unclear whether the list was aspirational or whether the people had actually been targeted with NSO spyware.\nAmong those listed were Azam Ahmed, who had been the Mexico City bureau chief for The Times and who has reported widely on corruption, violence and surveillance in Latin America,including on NSO itself; and Ben Hubbard, The Times\u2019s bureau chief in Beirut, Lebanon, who has investigated rights abuses and corruption in Saudi Arabia and wrote a recentbiographyof the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\nIt also included 14 heads of state, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly of Egypt, Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, Saad-Eddine El Othmani, who until recently was the prime minister of Morocco, and Charles Michel, the head of the European Council.\nShalev Hulio, a co-founder of NSO Group, vehemently denied the list\u2019s accuracy, telling The Times, \u201cThis is like opening up the white pages, choosing 50,000 numbers and drawing some conclusion from it.\u201d\nThis year marks a record for the discovery of so-called zero days, secret software flaws like the one that NSO used to install its spyware. This year, Chinese hackers were caught using zero days in Microsoft Exchange to steal emails and plant ransomware. In July, ransomware criminals used a zero day in software sold bythe tech company Kaseyato bring down the networks of some 1,000 companies.\nFor years, the spyware industry has been a black box. Sales of spyware are locked up in nondisclosure agreements and are frequently rolled into classified programs, with limited, if any, oversight.\nNSO\u2019s clients previously infected their targets using text messages that cajoled victims into clicking on links. Those links made it possible for journalists and researchers at organizations like Citizen Lab to investigate the possible presence of spyware. But NSO\u2019s new zero-click method makes the discovery of spyware by journalists and cybersecurity researchers much harder.\n\u201cThe commercial spyware industry is going darker,\u201d said Mr. Marczak, the Citizen Lab researcher. Mr. Marczak said he was first approached by the Saudi activist in March. But it was only last week that he was able to parse evidence from the activist\u2019s phone and uncover digital crumbs similar to those on the iPhones of other Pegasus targets.\nMr. Marczak said he found that the Saudi activist, who declined to be identified, had received an image. That image, which was invisible to the user, exploited a vulnerability in the way that Apple processes images and allowed the Pegasus spyware to be quietly downloaded onto Apple devices. With the victim none the wiser, his or her most sensitive communications, data and passwords were siphoned off to servers at intelligence and law-enforcement agencies around the globe.\nCitizen Lab said the scale and scope of the operation was unclear. Mr. Marczak said, based on the timing of his discovery of Pegasus on the Saudi activist\u2019s iPhone and other iPhones in March, it was safe to say the spyware had been siphoning data from Apple devices for at least six months.\nThe zero-click exploit, which Citizen Lab dubbed \u201cForcedentry,\u201d was among the most sophisticated exploits discovered by forensics researchers. In 2019, researchers uncovered that a similar NSO zero-click exploit had been deployed against 1,400 users of WhatsApp, the Facebook messaging service. Last year, Citizen Lab found a digital trail suggesting NSO may have a zero-click exploit to read Apple iMessages, but researchers never discovered the full exploit.\nNSO was long suspected of having a zero-click capability. A 2015 hack of one of NSO\u2019s chief competitors, Hacking Team, a Milan-based spyware outfit, revealed emails showing Hacking Team executives scrambling to match a remote, zero-click exploit that its customers claimed NSO had developed. That same year, a Times reporter obtained NSO marketing materials for prospective new clients that mentioned a remote, zero-click capability.\nProof of the capability never turned up.\n\u201cToday was the proof,\u201d Mr. Marczak said.\nForcedentry was the first time that researchers successfully recovered a full, zero-click exploit on the phones of activists and dissidents. When such discoveries are revealed, governments and cybercriminals typically try to exploit vulnerable systems before users have a chance to patch them, making timely patching critical.\nMr. Scott-Railton urged Apple customers to run their software updates immediately.\n\u201cDo you own an Apple product? Update it today,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "Apple said on Wednesday that it was adjusting itsApp Store policiesto allow certain kinds of applications to do business more directly with their customers.\nUnder the change, so-called reader apps, which include Netflix and Spotify, will be permitted to include a link within their apps to direct users to set up or manage their accounts on the individual company\u2019s website, rather than through the App Store.\nThat would let those companies avoid paying the traditional 30 percent fee that Apple charges when people make payments for things like subscriptions on the App Store. Apple had long prevented companies from steering their users to their own websites, which would have deprived it of that 30 percent cut. These reader apps \u201cprovide previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music and video,\u201d according to the company.\nApple said the change related to an agreement with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which had been investigating the tech giant\u2019s App Store policies.\nPhil Schiller, the Apple executive who oversees the App Store,said in a statementthat the change would \u201chelp developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and maintaining their trust.\u201d\nThe tweak will take effect early next year. Apple has been under increasing pressure for its App Store rules.\nLast week,the company announced a similar changeas part of a legal settlement with app makers, and said it would create a $100 million fund for small app developers. Last year,Apple halved the feethat the smallest app developers pay through the App Store.\nThe company is also waiting on a judge\u2019s decision in its antitrust legal battle against Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, whichtook Apple to court in Mayover claims that it abused its power over the App Store.

        "title": "Why Apple Didn\u2019t Lose in the Epic Games Ruling",
        "fulltext": "A federal judge\u2019ssplit decision on Fridayin the high-profile case betweenApple and Epic Games, which stopped short of declaring Apple a monopoly but said it was anticompetitive, allowed parties on both sides of the argument to claim victory. The ruling also set offcelebrations among developerswho said the ruling would allow them to avoid Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission on in-app purchases. Spotify, one of those developers, said it was pleased with the ruling.\nConversely, so didApple. That suggests that much of the coverage over the weekend about the ruling representing a meaningful setback to the tech giant, whose shares fell on the news, should be taken with a grain of salt. It\u2019s also telling that Epicfiled an appealagainst the decision yesterday.\nA quick recap:EpicsuedApplein August last year, after the iPhone maker removed Epic\u2019s popular game Fortnite from its app store. Apple said the developer had broken its rules by steering players to make purchases outside of Apple\u2019s app store, circumventing Apple\u2019s ability to collect a commission on in-app purchases. Epic, in its suit, said Apple violated antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment system and forbidding them from telling app users about alternative ways to pay.\nThe judge sided with Apple on questions of monopoly.\u201cWhile the Court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,\u201d Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote. \u201cSuccess is not illegal.\u201d But she said that Apple\u2019s policy against steering, by forcing developers to withhold information from consumers, was anticompetitive under California state law, and therefore should not be allowed, not just within the state, but anywhere.\nThe main strike against Apple is open to interpretation.There is plenty of room for interpretation in the judge\u2019s order on Apple\u2019s steering rules, which said that Apple cannot prohibit developers from \u201cincluding in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing,\u201d the judge\u2019s decision said.\nThere is debate about the difference betweenbuttons and links, which could make the effect of the ruling less significant than it seems. If a button, like a shopping cart icon or \u201cpay now\u201d call-out,isn\u2019tthe same as a link, then Apple could interpret the ruling as allowing things that look like buttons but don\u2019t take users to external sites when they tap them. This might set up more fights between Apple and developers.\nLegal experts said that the decision was not a road map for future antitrust litigation,but rather another dead end for those who want to rein in tech giants via the courts. It\u2019s more evidence of \u201chow narrow our federal antitrust laws are,\u201d Eleanor Fox, an antitrust law scholar at N.Y.U., told DealBook. \u201cSome people are saying it\u2019s a big win for Epic, but that may not be so.\u201d\nApple said that it needs to control the entire App Store ecosystem to ensure privacy and protect consumers from being ripped off, and the judge basically agreed. In fact, Judge Gonzalez Rogers argued that a world where Apple had no ability to protect its commissions would be unfair. \u201cThe ruling shows the gap between the popular perception of what is a monopoly and what the law says,\u201d Fox said. And that, in turn, \u201cgives those pushing to change the laws in Congress pretty good ammunition,\u201d she said.\nBeijing reportedly wants to break up Alipay.As part of the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on domestic tech giants,The Financial Times reportsthat regulatorsmay order the fintech company, which is part of Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group, to split off its lending business and turn over user data to a partly state-owned credit scoring joint venture. This follows recent rumblings that state-backed companies wouldtake a stake in Ant Group.\nThe stock market looks to rebound from a rough week.Futures are up today, after five days of losses marked thelongest consecutive stretch of down dayssince February.

The plan is less aggressive than President Biden had earlier proposed, with projected revenue falling short of fully funding the White House\u2019s $3.5 trillion spending plans.\nWhirlpool is offering employees $1,000 to be vaccinated,DealBook has learned. The incentive, announced to employees last week, came as Biden ordered OSHA to require companies with more than 100 employees to require that workers be vaccinated or face weekly testing.

Canadian National was the preferred suitor until its bid to create the first railroad to connect all of North America hit a regulatory snag, and if it loses out in the bidding war it will receive a $700 million breakup fee.\nAs companies put more focus on diversity, political engagement and working with a broader range of stakeholders, their consulting needs have changed in turn. Advisers are adapting to meet this demand. Today, Jon Henes, a former restructuring partner at Kirkland & Ellis, is launching C Street Advisory to offer C.E.O.s and boardrooms advice on issues that span business, politics and social justice.\nThe firm blends Henes\u2019s experience and relationships at Kirkland with his time as the national finance chair for Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign and a co-finance chair for Ray McGuire\u2019s New York mayoral campaign.\nC Street has four main functions:Corporate advisory, like the work Henes did at Kirkland; diversity, equity and inclusion (also known as D.E.I.); employee recruitment and retention; and communications. C Street will compete with advisory firms like Teneo, among others, that have turned their attention to helping clients navigate the complex social issues facing companies today. \u201cIt\u2019s not about just checking boxes, it\u2019s about really helping to build value in corporations,\u201d Henes told DealBook.\nThe firm has already hired about 15 people.They include Beth Kojima, a director of special events for McGuire\u2019s mayoral campaign; Melissa Prober, a former deputy general counsel at the Clinton Foundation; Al Tillery, a founding director for Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University; and Lisa Hernandez Gioia, who handled communications for Hudson Yards.

Some of the recent rises were in categories where prices dropped as lockdown orders took effect last year, such as airline tickets, or for items like cars that have been affected by shortages.

        "title": "Tim Cook Faces Surprising Employee Unrest at Apple",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Apple, known among its Silicon Valley peers for a secretive corporate culture in which workers are expected to be in lock step with management, is suddenly facing an issue that would have been unthinkable a few years ago: employee unrest.\nOn Friday, Tim Cook,Apple\u2019s chief executive, answered questions from workers in an all-staff meeting for the first time since the public surfacing of employee concerns over topics ranging from pay equity to whether the company should assert itself more on political matters like Texas\u2019 restrictive abortion law.\nMr. Cook answered only two of whatactivistemployees said were a number of questions they had wanted to ask in a meeting broadcast to employees around the world, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times. But his response was a notable acknowledgment that the workplace and social issues that have been roiling Silicon Valley for several years have taken root atApple.\nOver the past month, more than 500 people who said they were current and formerAppleemployees have submitted accounts of verbal abuse, sexual harassment,retaliationand discrimination at work, among other issues, toan employee-activist groupthat calls itself#AppleToo, said Cher Scarlett andJanneke Parrish, twoAppleemployees who help lead the group.\nThe group has begunposting some of the anonymous stories onlineand has been encouraging colleagues to contact state and federal labor officials with their complaints. Their issues, as well as those of eight current and former employees who spoke to The Times, vary; among them are workplace conditions, unequal pay and the company\u2019s business practices.\nA common theme is that Apple\u2019s secrecy has created a culture that discourages employees from speaking out about their workplace concerns \u2014 not with co-workers, not with the press and not on social media. Complaints about problematic managers or colleagues are frequently dismissed, and workers are afraid to criticize how the company does business, the employees who spoke to The Times said.\n\u201cApple has this culture of secrecy that is toxic,\u201d said Christine Dehus, who worked at Apple for five years and left in August. \u201cOn one hand, yes, I understand the secrecy piece is important for product security, to surprise and delight customers. But it bleeds into other areas of the culture where it is prohibitive and damaging.\u201d\nMr. Cook and Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s human resources chief, said in response to a question about pay equity on Friday that Apple regularly scrutinized its compensation practices to ensure it paid employees fairly.\n\u201cWhen we find any gaps at all, which sometimes we do, we close them,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien said.\nAsked what Apple was doing to protect its employees from Texas\u2019 abortion restrictions, Mr. Cook said that the company was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight against the new law and that its medical insurance would help pay for Apple workers in Texas if they needed to travel to other states for an abortion.\nMr. Cook\u2019s comments received a mixed reception from Apple employees on Slack, the workplace message board, Ms. Parrish said. Some employees cheered for Mr. Cook, while others, including her, were disappointed.\nMs. Parrish said she had submitted a question about what concrete steps Apple had taken to ensure that pay gaps were resolved and that more women and people of color were being promoted to leadership roles. \u201cWith the answers Tim gave today, we weren\u2019t heard,\u201d she said.\nApple has about 160,000 employees around the world, and it was unclear if the newly public complaints reflected systemic problems or isolated issues that happen at many larger corporations.\n\u201cWe are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.\u201d\nWhile the airing of Apple\u2019s workplace issues is remarkable to many people who have followed the company over the years, employee activism has become commonplace in Silicon Valley.\nThree years ago,Google employeesmarched out of their offices around the world to protest sexual harassment policies. Last year,Facebook employeesprotested their company\u2019s handling of posts by President Donald J. Trump. And some companies haveexplicitly banned discussionsthat aren\u2019t work-related.\nBut at Apple, the rank and file had until recently appeared to be doing their jobs with little fuss. Secrecy was a trait pushed by the company\u2019s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, who was obsessed with preventing leaks about Apple\u2019s new products to maximize the public\u2019s surprise when he unveiled them onstage. The employees who spoke to The Times said that, over time, that culture had extended to the broader workplace.\n\u201cNever have I met people more terrified to speak out against their employer,\u201d said Ms. Scarlett, who joined Apple as a software engineer in April and has worked at eight other companies.\nAn Apple spokesman pointed to acompany policythat said employees could \u201cspeak freely about your wages, hours or working conditions.\u201d\nSlack has been akey organizing tool for workers, several current and former employees told The Times. Apple\u2019s siloed culture keptdifferent teams of employees separatefrom one another, another result of efforts to prevent leaks. There was no wide-scale, popular internal message board for employees to communicate with one another, until Apple began using Slack in 2019.\nWhen employees were told to work from home at the beginning of the pandemic, Slack became particularly popular. \u201cFor a lot of us, this was the first chance to interact with people outside our own silo,\u201d Ms. Parrish said. Previously, \u201cnone of us were aware that anybody else was going through this.\u201d\nThe complaints seem to be making an impact. When Apple this year hired Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, a former Facebook manager, more than 2,000 employeessigned a protest letter to managementbecause of what they called \u201covertly racist and sexist remarks\u201d in a book he had written, based in part on his time at Facebook. Within days,Apple fired him. Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez declined to comment on the specifics of his case.\nIn May, hundreds of employees signed a letter urging Apple to publicly support Palestinians during a recent conflict with Israel. And a corporate Slack channel that was set up to organize efforts to push Apple to be more flexible about remote-work arrangements once the pandemic ended now has about 7,500 employees on it.\nBeyond the group activism, Apple is dealing with individual fights that are slipping into public view.\nAshley Gjovik, a former engineering program manager at Apple for six years, saidshe had complained to Applefor months about what she believed was inadequate testing for toxic chemicals at her office, as well as sexist comments from a manager.\nAfter taking her complaints public this year, Ms. Gjovik was placed on leave andlater fired. She saidApple had told herthat she was fired for leaking product information and not cooperating with its investigation. She has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Justice Department, she said.\nApple declined to comment on specific employees\u2019 cases.\nMs. Dehus, who worked at Apple to mitigate the impact of mining valuable minerals in conflict zones, said she had left Apple after spending several years fighting a decision to reassign her to a role that she said had involved more work for less pay. She said Apple had begun trying to reassign her after she complained that the company\u2019s work on the minerals was not, in some cases, leading to meaningful change in some war-torn countries.\nRichard Dahan, who is deaf, said he had struggled at his former job at an Apple Store in Maryland for six years because his manager refused to provide a sign-language interpreter for him to communicate with customers, which federal law requires under some circumstances. He said that he had communicated with customers by typing on an iPad, and that some customers had refused to work with him as a result. When he told his manager, the manager said it was the customers\u2019 right, he said.\n\u201cWould it be OK if they said they didn\u2019t want to work with a person of color?\u201d Mr. Dahan asked in an interview via a sign-language interpreter.\nHe was eventually assigned an interpreter. But by that time, he said, upper management viewed him as a complainer and refused to promote him.\n\u201cTheir culture is: Drink our Kool-Aid, buy into what we\u2019re telling you, and we\u2019ll promote you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re asking for anything or making noise, then they won\u2019t.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "A federal judge on Friday struck a serious blow to Apple\u2019s control of its App Store, giving companies a way to avoid handingApplea cut of their app sales and potentially upending a $100 billion online market.\nApplecounts on revenue from itsApp Storeto fuel its expansive profits, and the decision could eat away at that money. It was a damaging loss for the company, which is facing increasingly pointed questions from regulators and politicians around the world about its business.\nOver the last month, regulators in Japan and South Korea have forcedAppleto tweak how it manages the App Store. In the United States, the Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into the business. The Senate introduced antitrust legislation aimed at promoting app store competition after a House committee said last year that \u201cApple exerts monopoly power in the mobile app store market.\u201d And the European Union, Britain and India also are investigating Apple\u2019s App Store dominance.\nTogether, the legal setbacks and the tighter regulatory controls indicate that Apple\u2019s long run of calling all the shots on the App Store \u2014 one of the linchpins of the internet economy \u2014 may be ending. That could represent one of the tech industry\u2019s most substantial changes in years, as smaller companies keep more of their profits and Apple\u2019s ability to be an unavoidable toll collector slips away.\nApple \u201cwas enjoying a tremendous advantage because of the popularity of its platform, and that advantage has been whittled away now,\u201d said Jonathan Rubin, a partner at the antitrust law firm MoginRubin.\nThe order was part of the ruling in a prominent legalcase between Apple and Epic Games, which makes the popular game Fortnite and sued Apple last year over its App Store policies.\nThe judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said Apple violated California\u2019s laws against unfair competition by barring app developers from directing customers to other ways to pay for their services. She ordered Apple to start letting developers include links in their apps to other payment methods within 90 days.\nThat means when customers sign up for a subscription or buy a digital service or item in an iPhone app, companies can now steer those customers to outside websites to complete the transaction. That would allow those companies to avoid Apple\u2019s commission on the sale, which can be as high as 30 percent.\nBut Judge Gonzalez Rogers stopped short of declaring that Apple had a monopoly in the market of mobile games, which would have been a worst-case scenario for the company. She also saidEpichad breached its contract with Apple when it allowed Fortnite users to pay it directly, instead of via Apple, inside its iPhone app last year.\nApple is widely expected to ask a judge to keep the order from going into effect. Either company could also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In that court, a three-judge panel could review the decision, a process that could take a year or more. After a ruling there, Apple or Epic could appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe ruling allows both sides to claim a partial victory. Apple now has a court ruling that says it does not run a monopoly in an important digital marketplace, which undercuts its opponents\u2019 efforts to claim that it violates antitrust laws. ButEpic\u2019s lawsuitcould also force Apple to crack open its airtight iPhone software to create an avenue for developers to avoid its commission.\nApple\u2019s shares fell nearly 3 percent on the Nasdaq exchange after the ruling was announced.\n\u201cToday the court has affirmed what we\u2019ve known all along: The App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAs the court recognized, \u2018Success is not illegal.\u2019 Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world.\u201d\nThe ruling did uphold many of the principles of Apple\u2019s App Store business, including that it can prohibit third-party iPhone app marketplaces and can continue to charge a 30 percent commission on many transactions. Epic had challenged those practices.\n\u201cIt puts an economic question mark around the App Store, but at the same time, it affirms the principles\u201d of the business, said Adam Kovacevich, a former Google lobbyist who now runsa tech-policy groupthat is in part sponsored by Apple.\nTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive,said on Twitterthat he was not satisfied with the ruling because it did not go far enough in allowing companies to complete in-app transactions with their own payment systems, versus having to direct customers to outside websites. He said Fortnite would not return to the App Store until such rules were in place.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t a win for developers or for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will fight on.\u201d\nMr. Rubin, the antitrust lawyer, said that Apple would feel relieved to dodge being labeled a monopoly, but that the judge\u2019s verdict would most likely do little to strengthen its standing in other investigations because antitrust lawsuits can vary. He said Apple might also have to consider lowering its commission now that it will be easier for developers to send customers elsewhere to make purchases.\nEpic hassued Googlefor the same issues with app commissions on its Android operating system, and that case is expected to go to trial this year. Last month, 36 states and the District of Columbia alsosued Googlefor forcing companies to use its payment system in exchange for access to its app store. Google\u2019spublic responsesaid, in effect, that the states should instead be focused on Apple.\nThere are also other challenges ahead for Apple\u2019s App Store. Judge Gonzalez Rogers is set to hear anotherlawsuitfrom consumers that is seeking class-action status and claims that the App Store commission is illegal.\nThe App Store generatesroughly $20 billion a yearfor Apple, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. Apple has effectively forced companies to use its payment systems in exchange for access to the store, which is the only way to get an app on iPhones. That arrangement has allowed Apple to charge a commission on many transactions.\nLast month, South Korea passed a law that requires app stores to allow customers to pay through multiple payment systems. Apple alsosettled another lawsuitover its commission with a group of smaller developers. In that settlement, Apple paid $100 million and agreed to allow developers to tell customers in an email about other ways to pay for their services, outside Apple\u2019s payment systems.\nAnd last week, prompted by an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission, Apple said it would allow a subset of apps known as reader apps, like Netflix and Spotify, to include a link within their apps directing users to external payment methods.\nBut the order on Friday goes much further, because such reader apps account for very little of Apple\u2019s App Store revenue, analysts have said. The order applies to all apps, and Judge Gonzalez Rodgers said gaming apps accounted for 70 percent of the sales on iPhone apps.\nApple instituted its 30 percent commission on many app sales shortly after introducing its App Store in 2008. In recent years, as smartphones have become central to modern life and commerce, app makers began to balk at Apple\u2019s cut. An executive at Match Group, the maker of dating apps like Tinder, testified to Congress this year that app-store fees were Match\u2019s single largest expense and would soon exceed $500 million a year, or a fifth of total sales.\nIn response to complaints, Apple halved its commission on developers that brought in $1 million or less from their apps in the previous year, charging them 15 percent. That move affected about 98 percent of developers that pay the commission, but it hardly affected Apple\u2019s bottom line; those developers account for less than 5 percent of App Store revenue, according to estimates from Sensor Tower.\nA year ago, Epic began offering Fortnite players discounts if they used Epic\u2019s payment system instead of those from Apple and Google. The tech giants quickly pulled Fortnite from their app stores. Epic responded by suing both. Apple\u2019s efforts to dismiss the lawsuit failed. In the federal trial in Oakland, Calif., in May, Mr. Cook took the stand for the first time as Apple\u2019s chief executive.\nA main focus for lawyers in the trial was defining the market they were arguing over. Epic\u2019s lawyers said the market was iPhone apps, over which Apple has a monopoly. Apple countered that people played games and used digital services on a wide variety of devices, from smartphones to gaming consoles to laptops, and that Apple controlled a small slice of that big market.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers said that she sided with neither company and that the market in question was digital mobile gaming transactions. In that market, she said, Apple does not have a monopoly.\n\u201cWhile the court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55 percent and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cSuccess is not illegal.\u201d"
