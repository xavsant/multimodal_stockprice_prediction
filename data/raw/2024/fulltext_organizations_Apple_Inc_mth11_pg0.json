        "title": "The World\u2019s Pioneering Tech Cop Is Making Her Exit",
        "fulltext": "Margrethe Vestager, the European Union antitrust enforcer who has been the world\u2019s foremost critic of the tech industry, recently walked through her Brussels office wondering what to do with the stuff she had accumulated during a decade in that role, which ends late this month. At one point, she paused to lift a sculpture of a hand holding up its middle finger.\n\u201cWhat should I do with this?\u201d Ms. Vestager, 56, asked. The middle finger, she has said, was a reminder not to let critics get you down.\nMs. Vestager, a Danish politician who was the rare E.U. official to become known globally, has faced plenty of detractors over the years. When she was appointed to police antitrust in 2014, she becameone of the firstgovernment officials in the world to aggressively bring cases and fines againstGoogle,AppleandAmazonfor conducting illegal business practices and trying to block competition.\nAt the time, the U.S. digital titans were growing quickly and were highly popular for their innovations. Ms. Vestager grappled with backlash for her actions, with tech leaders saying she was stymieing Europe\u2019s economy by scaring off start-ups from building in the region. In 2018, President Donald J. Trump reportedlysaidshe \u201creally hates\u201d America.\nBut as Ms. Vestager closes out her era in Brussels, regulating the tech industry hasbecome more mainstream around the world. Thanks to her, Europe is now widely seen as the pioneer of the toughest laws against tech. U.S. regulators have in recent years followed Europe by bringing antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon. Regulators in South Korea, Australia, Brazil, Canada and elsewhere are also taking on the tech giants.\n\u201cIt is extremely satisfying,\u201d Ms. Vestager told The New York Times, adding that she cried when the European Union\u2019s highest court gave her an unexpected victory in August in a protracted tax-avoidance case against Apple. \u201cPeople thought that we were crazy because 10 years ago, Big Tech was untouchable. They were the most admired, the most innovative, the most promising companies that you could think of.\u201d\nEven in Washington, Ms. Vestager has gone from outcast to trailblazer. In September, when she made a final visit to her counterparts at the U.S. Justice Department, staff members there packed a room to hear her speak and gave her a standing ovation as she exited.\n\u201cShe is a transformational figure,\u201d saidJonathan Kanter, the head of the department\u2019s antitrust division, who has a framed picture in his office of a cartoon mouse giving the middle finger as a homage to Ms. Vestager. \u201cShe came into office at a time when not a lot of people were talking about the importance of strong oversight of digital gatekeepers.Because of her, it\u2019s an important and relevant topic of conversation.\u201d\nMs. Vestager is now preparing to take a role at a university in Denmark. Teresa Ribera Rodr\u00edguez, a Spanish official, is set to take over as the European Union\u2019s top antitrust regulator.\nMs. Vestager recently discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and its implications, her confidence that Europe will continue to lead in policing the tech industry and why restricting certain forms of speech online is totally acceptable \u2014 even if it draws the ire of Elon Musk. Here are excerpts.\nMs. Vestager said she was proud of her record, but acknowledged challenges.\nMany techies have criticized Ms. Vestager\u2019s tough approach, saying she harmed Europe\u2019s tech industry and enlarged its reputation as a creator of bureaucratic rules.\nBut some former colleagues said the region\u2019s regulations did not go far enough. Google, Apple, Amazon and others have grown even more powerful over the past decade.\n\u201cHave we moved the dial and changed the system? Only at the margins,\u201d said Tommaso Valletti, who was a top economist under Ms. Vestager and praised her commitment to the issue in the face of adversity. \u201cDid we change Big Tech? My answer is no.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said that she was proud of her tenure, but that it had been only \u201cpartly successful.\u201d She said that she wished her office could have moved faster and that she had pushed for companies to make tougher structural changes in addition to issuing fines. She urged regulators everywhere to be \u201cbolder.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said that collaboration was very strong with U.S. regulators, but that it could change under Mr. Trump.\nUntil recently, the United States was known for its hands-off oversight of the tech industry. Ms. Vestager praised the Biden administration\u2019s more aggressive approach, which has included overseeing antitrust trials against Google. In one case, the Justice Department is pushing fora breakup of the internet giant.\nFor a U.S. regulator to take such a major step would have ripple effects globally and could change industry behavior, Ms. Vestager said.\n\u201cWe are in the business of deterrence,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we do not once in a while use our most powerful tools, there\u2019s no deterrence.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said it was \u201cvery difficult to say\u201d how things would change under Mr. Trump, but she noted how quicklytech leaders had congratulated himon his election.\n\u201cWhen you saw how fast tech leaders congratulated President-elect Trump, you see that there was a strong hope that this will all change,\u201d she said.\nMs. Vestager discussed the online abuse she and other women faced.\nMs. Vestager said she avoided reading toxic comments online, which she added had a dangerous effect on democracy because people \u2014 particularly women \u2014 were being scared away from participating in politics.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one purpose for this: \u2018You, woman, shut up. Go home. Keep quiet. We don\u2019t want to know of you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so many young, talented, passionate, ambitious women say, \u2018I don\u2019t want that to be part of my life.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Vestager said oversight of social media platforms was more important than ever.\nMs. Vestager said a new European law,the Digital Services Act, gave European Union authorities critical new powers to regulate social media platforms. She said internet companies did not always appreciate that European laws differed from those in the United States over what constituted illegal speech, including racism, antisemitism and terrorist content.\n\u201cIf a platform is used to undermine democracy, well, then clearly it is not in compliance with the Digital Services Act,\u201d she said.\nShe said the new law was needed to take on companies, including X andTelegram, that didn\u2019t do enough to police their platforms for harmful and illicit material.\n\u201cI find it completely legitimate that, for instance, my home country, Denmark, passes a law that makes hate speech illegal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I find to be not legitimate is not wanting to respect those laws.\u201d Ms. Vestager said Mr. Musk\u2019s closeness to Mr. Trump must not influence regulation of his companies, including X, which is under investigation by the European Commission.\n\u201cOne of the fundamentals of the European model is rule of law and equal treatment, and that must be for everybody,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Before the Election, Tech C.E.O.s Were Quietly Courting Trump",
        "fulltext": "When Donald J. Trump first campaigned for president eight years ago, tech executives largely ignored him. They lateratoned for their disregardby making a televised walk through the lobby of Trump Tower in New York for a 90-minute meeting with the president-elect.\nThis election cycle, tech leaders have tried to avoid making the same mistake. Executives such as Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai started reaching out to Mr. Trump directly in the weeks and months before the first ballot was cast.\nThey flattered him. They shared their troubles. They criticized his opposition. They emphasized common enemies.\nThe change in strategy speaks to what business leaders learned during the first Trump presidency and illustrates how they have adapted their approach before Mr. Trump returns to the White House. Believing that his political positions are fluid and his actions are often transactional, they are forging direct relationships they hope will benefit their businesses.\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump criticized tech companies for manipulating coverage of him on their platforms and opposing his agenda. He was punitive with those he considered antagonists. In one instance, Amazon accused Mr. Trump ofpressuring the Pentagonto cancel a cloud computing contract with the company because its founder, Jeff Bezos, owned The Washington Post.\nBut Mr. Trump heaped praise on Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple. He liked that Mr. Cook called him directly todiscuss business and economic issues. Such direct engagement helpedApple avoid tariffson many of its products, even as the Trump administration cracked down on other companies that were manufacturing in China.\nThis time, tech chief executives have been following Mr. Cook\u2019s playbook. Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta,spoke to Mr. Trumpafter an attempted assassination in July. Mr. Pichai, Google\u2018s chief executive, told Mr. Trump that his campaign stop at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant wasone of the biggest things ever on Google. And Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon,introduced himself with a phone call, while Mr. Bezos, his predecessor, called Mr. Trump to praise his resilience after the July shooting.\nThe executives never offered a public endorsement, but after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on Tuesday, they feted him with congratulations on X. Mr. Cook, who was typically the last of his peers to weigh in on hot-button issues during the previous Trump administration, offered the final word, saying: \u201cCongratulations President Trump on your victory! We look forward to engaging with you and your administration.\u201d\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who has advised executives and Mr. Trump over the years, said the direct outreach and quiet wooing of Mr. Trump were \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do, noting the executives\u2019 responsibility to shareholders to have a relationship with whoever is in the White House.\n\u201cThey were building a rapport,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the right way to do it \u2014 establish personal eye contact and get a foundation for the future.\u201d\nMeta and Google declined to comment, while Amazon and Apple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Some of the details of their chief executives\u2019 outreach were shared by Mr. Trump during several podcasts and an interview withNew York magazine. Others were reported previously by The New York Times andThe Washington Post.\nThe tech titans\u2019 private outreach to Mr. Trump has contrasted with the public embrace by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and many of Silicon Valley\u2019s chatterbox venture capitalists. Mr. Musk hit the campaign trail for Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania and turned his personal feed on X into a Trump-advocacy channel, while venture capitalists donated generously to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in hopes his administration would be more friendly to their pet causes \u2014 crypto, antitrust and taxes \u2014 than President Biden\u2019s has been.\nThese prominent investors were ebullient on social media Wednesday morning. When Mr. Musk posted that America\u2019s \u201cnation of builders\u201d would soon be \u201cfree to build,\u201d Marc Andreessen, a prominent investor who donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign,respondedwith his catchphrase, \u201cIt\u2019s time to build,\u201d with an American flag emoji.\nIn reaching out to Mr. Trump, tech executives were doing more than hedging their bets ahead of a tossup election. They were also laying the groundwork for improved relations between Silicon Valley and Washington.\nThe relationship between some of the tech leaders and the president quickly deteriorated after that 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Just weeks into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, some of them criticized his executive order temporarily blocking immigration fromseven Muslim-majority countries. Sergey Brin, one of the co-founders of Google, was spotted at aprotest against the measureat San Francisco\u2019s airport.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s revolt sowed tension with the Trump administration. The fraught relations continued when Mr. Biden took office in 2021.\nThe Biden administration put tech on its heels with aggressive antitrust action and a crackdown on mergers and acquisitions. Over the past four years, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon, Apple, Meta and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The cases have threatened their businesses, especially Google, which was ruled a monopolist.\nThe F.T.C. has also cracked down on mergers and acquisitions and announced an inquiryinto investmentsby tech giants in artificial intelligence start-ups. The agency\u2019s scrutiny has been criticized by venture capitalists and others for slowing deals in Silicon Valley and stymieing traditional opportunities for big companies to grow.\nMr. Trump has said the leaders of those companies have expressed a readiness to turn the page on such regulatory headaches. He has been receptive to their appeals, listening sympathetically as Mr. Cook complained to him on a call last month about European regulators.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let them take advantage of our companies,\u201d Mr. Trump recalled telling Mr. Cook,during a podcast interview last month. \u201cThat won\u2019t be happening.\u201d\nMr. Trump has also voiced skepticism about the possibility that the government might break up Google,saying he considered it a bulwark against China\u2019s technology ambitions. Though the president-elect has criticized the company over the years for how its algorithm ranks news articles about him, he expressed concern that weakening the company could be dangerous at a time of international tech competition.\nThose softer regulatory positions have lifted hopes across Silicon Valley that Mr. Trump might replace Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who has sought to block mergers, and Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission chief, who has antagonized the crypto industry.\nMs. Khan\u2019s term has expired, and Mr. Trump will have to decide whether to keep her. Shehas won accoladesfrom Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has praised her for being willing to go after big tech companies. But his views will be only one of many entertained by Mr. Trump, who has a history of courting competing opinions on issues before making final decisions.\nBy directly engaging with Mr. Trump, tech executives are increasing their chances of convincing him what action to take and possibly influence Ms. Khan\u2019s replacement, said Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that is backed by companies including Amazon and Apple.\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s susceptible to the last person in his ear,\u201d Mr. Kovacevich said. \u201cHis style of management hasn\u2019t changed, but he may be more knowledgeable about what to prioritize.\u201d\nMr. Sonnenfeld said tech executives\u2019 approach in recent months shows that they understand the value of staying united on issues. In the past, Mr. Trump sought an advantage in negotiations by pitting competitors against each other, like General Motors and Ford Motor. But the way tech executives have reached out to him directly with similar messages suggests that they understand the value of consensus.\n\u201cTrump will bulldoze you if you are too sycophantic,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cCollective action is needed to avoid being victimized.\u201d\nErin Griffithcontributed reporting from San Francisco."
