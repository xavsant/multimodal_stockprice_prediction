        "title": "The Metamorphosis of Silicon Valley C.E.O.s: From Big to Boring",
        "fulltext": "When Joe Barton, a Republican congressman from Texas, greeted Jack Dorsey ata congressional hearing last week, he sounded flummoxed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what a Twitter C.E.O. should look like,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look like what a C.E.O. of Twitter should look like.\u201d\nThe congressman had a point. Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.\nFaced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.\nMr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.\nMr. Dorsey \u2014 who like the late Mr. Jobsreturned to a company he co-foundedin order to save it \u2014 has long drawn comparisons to Mr. Jobs. Yet the congressional testimony marked a surprising rhetorical shift. Instead of the black-turtlenecked Mr. Jobs, Mr. Dorsey sounded more like Tim Cook, the understated operations manager who replaced him (and who heldhis umpteenth iPhone eventon Wednesday).\nThat is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.\nWhen it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.\nMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief who was once the poster boy of breaking things and moving fast, is nowsitting with magazine writers for lengthy, nuanced disquisitions on his failings. Last year, Uber replaced itscontroversy-magnet founder, Travis Kalanick, with Dara Khosrowshahi, whom almost nobody outside the tech industry had heard of before \u2014 a fact that the company regarded as an asset, not a liability.\nGoogle once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.\nJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief and the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has been experimenting witha more daring fashion sense, but his leadership style has always been marked by patience and deliberate expansion \u2014 just the sort of boring, operator\u2019s sensibility now in vogue.\nOh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\nIt\u2019s no mystery why tech leaders are turning inward. \u201cTech is now such a huge and dominant industry,\u201d said Joshua Reeves, the proudly boring founder and chief executive of Gusto, a start-up that makes human resources software. \u201cThe fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants mind-set is just not viable when you have atrillion-dollar market capitalizationor if you have more influence than many governments around the world.\u201d\nMr. Reeves pointed out that it\u2019s not just the big companies whose chief executives are going beige. Some of the most successful start-ups \u2014 from Lyft to Airbnb to Stripe to Slack to Pinterest \u2014 are run byunderstated un-visionaries, people who aim for functional competence over hypey salesmanship. (What hasn\u2019t changed is gender; boring or no, just about everyone who runs a tech company is still a man.)\n\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.\nThe tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.\nThere is one obvious exception to my boring-is-in thesis: Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, whose string of unconsidered tweets, taunts and other recent scandals have beenanything but eye-glazing.\nMr. Musk\u2019s latest antics were typical. In an email that he considered off the record, Mr. Musktold BuzzFeed Newsthat a diver who had rescued boys trapped in a Thai cave was a \u201cchild rapist.\u201d (The diver had questioned Mr. Musk\u2019s off-the-cuff plan to free the boys; Mr. Musk had earlier apologized for calling the diver a pedophile.)\nLast week, during an interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan,Mr. Musk smoked marijuanaand extensively detailed what he sees as theapocalyptic possibilities of artificial intelligence. The interview \u2014 combined with news of further executive departures \u2014 helped sink Tesla\u2019s stock further.\nMr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.\nFor all his flaws, Mr. Musk has long possessed such a genius. All the way back in 2006, he posted a\u201cmaster plan\u201dfor Tesla that reads like a Wile E. Coyote caper: \u201c1) Build sports car. 2) Use that money to build an affordable car. 3) Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options. Don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\nThough he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.\nEvery few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.\nBut it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\nBack in Mr. Jobs\u2019s day, tech was relatively uncomplicated; when the great man came bearing a new music player, you didn\u2019t have to wonder whether it might help a foreign governmentsteal an election. Now, after everything we have seen recently, you do have to worry about what the future may hold. Even Mr. Musk is worried.\n\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201d\nThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.\nNo wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring."

        "title": "The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Big Screens That Are a Delight to Use",
        "fulltext": "For the past few years, I have been a naysayer on one feature of smartphones: their growing size.\nMy position was unusual given the increasing prevalence of larger screen devices. The world\u2019s top phone makers have all added more substantial glass screens to stretch from one edge of their smartphones to another, on the theory that people can better enjoy their apps and content on an ample display.\nApple helped seal the deal last week when it announced that itsnew phonesthis year \u2014 the iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 would have screens that measured between 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches diagonally, compared with 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches two years ago. In fact, the 6.5-inch screen on the iPhone XS Max is Apple\u2019s biggest ever. (The original iPhone in 2007 started with a 3.5-inch screen.)\nI have been troubled by this trend. These devices spend a lot of time in your pocket and your hand, and there are often compromises in portability and comfort when the screens balloon in size. For those reasons, I never liked the Plus phones, the line of iPhones that Apple introduced in 2014 with 5.5-inch screens. They felt impossible to use with one hand and far too bulky in a pocket.\nSo it\u2019s humbling to come to you now with another confession: The iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max may be making me a convert to bigger smartphones.\nLast week, I began testing both new iPhone models. I had predicted that the larger display on the XS Max would be unwieldy in my pocket and make the phone cumbersome to hold with one hand while typing and reaching for buttons inside apps.\nThere were other things I figured I would dislike. The prices of Apple\u2019s phones, for one, have shot up. The XS will start at $999 and the XS Max at $1,099 when both become available on Friday, compared with $699, $799 and $999 for new iPhones last year. The iPhone XR, which will be released on Oct. 19, is starting at $749.\nNone of the new phones were making huge technological leaps from last year, either. The iPhone XS and XS Max have a dual-lens camera, while the XR has a single-lens camera. All three iPhones include Face ID, the feature forunlocking the phone using face recognition.\nYet after running the 6.5-inch XS Max alongside the 5.8-inch XS through different situations and conditions for a week, I was surprised by my reaction. Far from being disappointed by the supersized devices, I was delighted.\nThe trade-offs of the new jumbo model felt minor. By eliminating the bezels, which are the screen\u2019s borders, Apple did a terrific job of increasing screen size without adding bulk or compromising the usability of the XS Max. I still think the smaller XS is a better fit for most people, but many would enjoy the XS Max.\nHere\u2019s how all the testing went down.\nI began by testing the iPhone XS Max because why not start with the biggest device? I moved my SIM card and all my data from an older iPhone to the new gadget and took it with me to dinner parties, bars, meetings and the gym.\nAfter three days, I was surprised by how good it felt to use the XS Max with one hand. A key factor was how Apple had managed to cram a bigger screen into a slightly smaller body. (The body of the Plus phones was 6.24 inches by 3.07 inches, while the XS Max\u2019s body is 6.2 inches by 3.05 inches.)\nThese changes amounted to meaningful improvements in ergonomics and overall convenience. I was able to hold the XS Max in one hand and type messages easily. In contrast, my thumb could not reach keys on the sides of the older iPhone 8 Plus, like the shift key or the backspace key, because of the space taken up by the bezel.\nAnd I found the jumbo-screen XS Max particularly beneficial in several instances. While driving, it was easier to read maps. The bigger screen made writing longer emails \u2014 a task that I usually do on a laptop \u2014 more pleasant. The display was also nice for reading recipes in the kitchen.\nWhile browsing Instagram next to my partner, I said to her: \u201cIf you can use this thing with one hand, who would want the smaller phone if you only have to pay $100 more for this huge screen?\u201d\n\u201cBut does it fit inside your pocket?\u201d she asked.\nThat brings me to the iPhone XS. After taking the larger XS Max everywhere with me for three days and feeling good about it, I switched to the iPhone XS \u2014 and immediately experienced a sense of relief.\nI found I simply preferred the XS\u2019s smaller body for the very basic task of moving around. Having the smaller phone in my pocket felt less obtrusive during dog walks, long hikes and gym sessions.\nI also found the XS easier to use as a camera. While the XS and XS Max share identical camera systems, which produce excellent, clear photos with natural-looking colors in normal and lowlight conditions, the smaller phone worked better in a pinch because it was easier to pull out of a pocket and quickly stabilize to take a clear shot.\nAs a self-diagnosed phone addict who is trying to cut down on screen time, I decided the XS also felt healthier for me. The XS Max screen was so good-looking that I wanted to keep reading articles and looking at photos on Instagram. When I used Apple\u2019snew Screen Time featureto monitor my use of each device, I discovered that I spent an average of roughly five and a half hours a day on the XS Max, two hours more than on the XS.\nSo where does that leave us? I concluded I no longer had any real objection to the bigger size of the iPhone XS Max, but felt that the smaller XS was still a better mobile phone because it was just as capable but more portable and pocketable.\nThat means if you are a more casual technology user who wants a superb smartphone that is comfortable to carry, I recommend you go for the XS. If you plan to treat your phone as a primary computer, go for the XS Max.\nOne flaw frustrated me in both iPhones: the poor design of Reachability, the software feature that was designed to make larger phone screens easier to use with one hand. On past iPhones, Reachability let people tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and reach for the buttons up there. Now there is no home button, so the new way to trigger Reachability is to swipe down from the bottom of the screen.\nThat\u2019s problematic because when you swipe from the bottom, it\u2019s easy to unintentionally hit a button on the bottom of an app, like the search tab inside Instagram or the video tab inside Facebook. There is a clear opportunity here for Apple to use the iPhone\u2019s pressure sensitivity, called 3D Touch, to let you press hard on the bottom of the screen to trigger Reachability. But for now, we are stuck with swiping down.\nApple said the Reachability swipe gesture was designed as a quick action to let people easily reach for the top of the screen.\nSo who should get theentry-level iPhone XR? Apple did not provide a review unit for the XR because it will be released next month, so I can\u2019t say with authority.\nBut I suspect it will largely come down to whether you can live with a single-lens camera, which doesn\u2019t do as good a job taking those D.S.L.R.-like photos with a blurred-out background and a sharpened foreground. The XS is about $250 more than the XR, but after shooting photos like the one below, I\u2019m sold on dual-lens cameras.\nFor years, Apple customers have gotten in the habit ofbuying a new iPhone sight unseen. But now that there are several sizes for different prices, I encourage you to try before you buy. It may not hurt to wait for the XR\u2019s release next month so you can test all three in a store. Play with the cameras and pay close attention to how each phone feels in one hand and inside your pocket.\nIt\u2019s important that you find the right fit: Since you have to pay so much for your next iPhone, you will probably live with it for a long time. And who knows? You might assume you will dislike a bigger screen and then change your mind \u2014 just as I did."

        "title": "How Apple Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals",
        "fulltext": "The business world has long been plagued by Apple catastrophists \u2014 investors, analysts, rival executives and journalists who look at the world\u2019s most valuable company andproclaim it to be imminently doomed.\nThe critics\u2019 worry for Apple is understandable, even if their repeated wrongness is a little hilarious. Apple\u2019s two-decade ascent from a near-bankrupt has-been of the personal computer erainto the first trillion-dollar corporationhas defied every apparent rule in tech.\nCompanies that make high-priced hardware productsaren\u2019t supposed to be as popular, as profitable or as permanent. To a lot of people in tech, Apple\u2019s success can seem like a fluke, and every new hurdle the company has faced \u2014 the rise of Android, the death of Steve Jobs, the saturation of the smartphone market, the ascendance of artificial intelligence and cloud software \u2014 has looked certain to do it in.\nBut this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry\u2019s impact on society, Apple\u2019s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage.\nBecause Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices.\nThough it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech\u2019s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.\nFor years, start-ups aiming for consumer audiences modeled themselves on Google and Facebook, offering innovations to the masses at rock-bottom prices, if not for free. But there are limits to the free-lunch model.\nIf Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.\n\u201cBecause of Apple\u2019s business model \u2014 because their money comes from their profitable hardware \u2014 it has been much easier for them to make certain choices and certain arguments about how to address problems in the industry,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a technology research firm.\nThe thrust of Apple\u2019s message is simple: Paying directly for technology is the best way to ensure your digital safety, and every fresh danger uncovered online is another reason to invest in the Apple way of life.\nThese aren\u2019t new arguments for Apple. While Google and Facebook pursued globe-spanning scale by offering free or cheap services supported by ads, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was warning of the risks of an internet advertising market run amok.\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,\u201d he toldan audience in 2015.\nTo many, includingyours truly, Mr. Cook\u2019s arguments sounded alarmist and self-serving. But after two years of scandal, he sounds farsighted.\nThough their businesses keep chugging along, Facebook and Google, the world\u2019s biggest internet ad companies, now face global scrutiny for the spread of disinformation, propaganda and what critics say is their products\u2019 destabilizing effects on politics and society.\nAmazon is beloved by customers, but its rapid growth has spurred economywide anxieties about the future of jobs. All three behemoths are considered growing targets for antitrust prosecution in the United States and elsewhere.\nApple\u2019s business model, by contrast, insulates it from most of the tech fears that have emerged in the last few years. Although it makes the vast majority of the profits in the global smartphone business, Apple\u2019s phones account for a minority of sales, blunting fears of monopoly.\nApple\u2019s high prices also set up an expectation of safety, giving it a freer hand to police online properties like its app store, podcast directory and news app. A decade ago, when Mr. Jobs imposed rules on the iOS App Store banning scammy and pornographic apps, he was called a prude. Now his rules seem prescient.\nApple is hiring actual human journaliststo build a subscription news service that could stand in contrast to the reckless news environment on social networks.\nIts commitment to curating online experiences has also turned Apple into something like a moral arbiter for tech. When Apple decided to bar the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones from its services this summer, it cut through much of the hand-wringing in the industry over Mr. Jones\u2019s antics. Many other tech companies immediately followed its move.\nApple has not entirely escaped criticism in the Trump era. Its reliance on China, where it makes its products and expects to see much of its growth, and where its products abide by government censors, looks to be a rising liability.\nYet so far, Mr. Cook has sailed through tricky political winds. He has somehow managed to offer criticism of President Trump\u2019s politics whilebenefiting mightily from his tax cuts. Apple has also so far escaped much of a negative impact from the trade war. Note that the Trump administrationremoved several product categoriesthat may have affected Apple from its most recent round of tariffs.\nEven when Apple\u2019s products have been directly implicated in tech worries, its business model has helped it weather the storm. Consider the rising fears of \u201ctech addiction,\u201d the idea that kids and adults are spending too much mindless time in the digital world, egged on by tech companies\u2019 insatiable need for our eyeballs.\nIn January, a pair of large Apple investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, wrote an open letter to Apple urging the company to address the issue. Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told me that the campaign had targeted Apple because the company had every reason to respond.\n\u201cThe biggest source of strength that Apple has is their ability to charge premium prices for their products,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir value depends on people feeling safe and supported within their ecosystem.\u201d\nAnd, in fact, Apple responded. The company told the investors that it believed the overuse of tech was a serious issue, and that it had been working on it. In the summer, it unveiled a series of widely praised features meant to allow adults to police their own and their kids\u2019 smartphone habits.\nGoogle, apparently spurred by the same campaign, offered similar features for its Android phones. Mr. Penner told me that he appreciated the companies\u2019 efforts, though he expects to keep pushing them to reduce their devices\u2019 addictiveness.\nApple\u2019s safety-first business model may become only more important as technology becomes even more intimate. The company\u2019s latest phones can be unlocked with your face, while its watch includes sophisticated sensors to monitor your movements and your health. In pushing these and other advances, the company can reasonably argue that only its ad-free business can protect such sensitive information.\nBut it is worth noting that Apple\u2019s model isn\u2019t available to everyone. In the spring, after Mr. Cook took a few swipes at Facebook\u2019s scandals, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, pointed out the inherent limits in Apple\u2019s model.\n\u201cThe reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay,\u201d Mr. Zuckerbergtold the journalist Ezra Klein.\nSince then, Apple has raised the prices of its top-end phones, and as the smartphone market slows, the company\u2019s pristine haven from the dangers of online life might get only more expensive.\nInequality is the story of our age, and it\u2019s no surprise that it could become the dominant story line of tech, too. As the digital world gets scarier, Apple\u2019s technology may come to resemble a high-priced oasis for the world\u2019s rich. Everyone else takes their chances on a free lunch."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Apple\u2019s Watch Steals the Show",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHello, readers! I\u2019m Farhad Manjoo, your technology columnist \u2014 and more important for our purposes today, I\u2019m a guy who has been to every Apple iPhone-unveiling event since the first one, all the way back in 2007. (If I were single, this would make a killer Tinder profile, right?)\nAs you might guess, then, I\u2019m sometimes a little jaded on iPhone day,which took place again this week. Apple showed off three new permutations of its smartphone at its newish spaceship headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. In its precise choreography \u2014 and after seeing it for the billionth time \u2014 Apple\u2019s rollout for its most important device can feel as formulaic as an episode of \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d Every year, the message is essentially the same: Amazingly, we\u2019ve somehow made an even better iPhone!\nBut I come to you today to praise rather than complain. Because this year, I did find myself getting a little out of my seat and my picture of the future expanded to include possibilities I hadn\u2019t considered viable before. For the first time in years, I was truly surprised.\nThere\u2019s just one catch: I felt this way about Apple\u2019s new watch, not its smartphone. The phones were fine. Apple\u2019s going to sell a lot of them and make a lot of money, as it does every year. But it\u2019s the watch that might change the future most arrestingly.\nThe big deal: The new Apple Watch packs a slew of sensors to make it a truly novel kind of wearable device \u2014 something like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d tricorder on your body. The new watch can administer a medically accurate electrocardiogram, a test of a person\u2019s heart rhythm that can help detect dangerous health conditions. It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.\nOne detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.\nBy themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.\nThey also suggest a new era in tech. For the last few years, \u201cwearables\u201d have been more of a gimmick than of any lasting utility. Apple itself has spent much time refining the watch to figure out its true purpose for people. At first, it thought of the device as a fashion accessory (the \u201cEdition\u201d version of the watch, which came in real precious metals and sold for $10,000 or more,was discontinued this week). But in the last few years, Apple has hit on a mission \u2014 health and fitness \u2014 and with these latest features, the company is setting itself on a path to create a device of lasting promise in people\u2019s daily lives.\nIt is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.\nThere was some other news in tech this week:\n\u25a0 The spotlight on Google grew harsher. Breitbart, the right-wing outlet,posted a leaked videoof a Google staff meeting that took place shortly after the 2016 presidential election. The contents aren\u2019t surprising: Google executives and employees were visibly shaken and horrified by Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory. Breitbart and many on the right took those political views as support for the notion that Google biases its search results against the right, a claim that President Trump has made repeatedly. The video added to political pressure on Google, which had escaped the scrutiny that fell on Facebook and Twitter after the election.\n\u25a0 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and his wife, MacKenzie,pledged $2 billionto fund initiatives for the homeless and for preschools. It\u2019s the first major foray into philanthropy for Mr. Bezos, who recently became the world\u2019s wealthiest man. It\u2019s hard to criticize someone who\u2019s giving money away, but it\u2019s worth noting that $2 billion isn\u2019t that much. Other billionaires have given away much more of their wealth \u2014 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has pledged $45 billion, which at the time was nearly all he was worth \u2014 and as Amazon\u2019s stock price keeps rising, Mr. Bezos, who is worth $164 billion, is likely to keep getting richer still.\nAnd that\u2019s it, folks! See you next week.\nFarhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column calledState of the Art. You can follow him on Twitter here:@fmanjoo."

        "title": "Apple Unveils Bigger iPhones at Higher Prices, and a Heart-Tracking Watch",
        "fulltext": "Apple has long had a playbook for iPhones, its most important product: Keep rolling out bigger, faster and more expensive models.\nOn Wednesday, it repeated that strategy by introducing another round of iPhones that are \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 bigger, faster and more expensive. The model with a 6.5-inch screen, the iPhone XS Max, is Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone ever and will start at $1,100. (And, yes, its name is a mouthful.) Last year when Apple debuted its iPhone X, the starting price was $1,000.\nMore notable, perhaps, was how much Apple is now evolving its smart watch into a clearly health-related device. The company showed off a new Apple Watch with an electronic heart sensor approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That could lead to new implications for health care \u2014 and prove to be a major selling point for a device that has played second fiddle to the iPhone.\nApple on Wednesday unveiled the iPhone XS, a premium model with a 5.8-inch screen, and the iPhone XS Max, with a 6.5-inch screen, its biggest-ever smartphone. The company also showed the iPhone XR, an entry-level model with a 6.1-inch screen.\nThe XS models are generally sped-up versions oflast year\u2019s iPhone X. Apple emphasized the phones\u2019 advanced processor, durable glass and so-called Super Retina OLED display with a wide color gamut.\nThe iPhone XR will come in white, black, red, blue and yellow, and is just as fast as the XS models. It has a single-lens camera, unlike the XS models, which have dual-lens camera systems. And it uses LCD, a less expensive screen technology than the OLED used for the XS, and the casing is made of aluminum, unlike the stainless steel that the premium phones are composed of.\nIt\u2019s obvious why Apple and other phone makers like Samsung keep enlarging their phones: Phones with bigger screens are selling well. When presented with the choice between a small phone and a bigger one, most people will go with the latter. That\u2019s similar to how just about everyone wants a big-screen TV.\nBut for mobile phones, there are trade-offs. For one, the larger phones are more difficult to use with one hand. With last year\u2019s 5.8-inch iPhone X, it was difficult to reach your thumb across the screen to type a keystroke or hit a button inside an app.\nThe larger screens raise an important question about design. Will Apple do much in the near future to improve one-handed use?\nWhen Apple\u2019s screen sizes started growing with the iPhone 6 in 2014, the company released a software shortcut, called Reachability, through which users can tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and make it easier to reach buttons up there. That feature still exists for the new iPhones, but the lack of a home button makes it more difficult to use \u2014 instead of double tapping the home button, now you swipe down from the bottom of the screen.\nAs Apple has made its phones larger and faster, it is also charging more for them. The company said the new iPhones would start at $750, $1,000 and $1,100. The starting prices last year were $700, $800 and $1,000.\nIt\u2019s atried-and-true strategyfor the company to milk a product line that has saturated the market; Apple said Wednesday that it had shipped nearly two billion iPhones and iPads.\nUnit sales of the iPhone were about flat in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier, but iPhone revenue rose 20 percent, to $29.9 billion. Something else that rose 20 percent? The average selling price of the iPhone.\nBy going bigger, Apple is trying to grow not just by raising prices but also by getting customers to use their devices even more. Research shows people with larger smartphones use them more, particularly to watch movies and play games.\nThat\u2019s good for Apple. A central part of its strategy is to get existing iPhone owners to pay for more services on their phones, like Netflix and HBO. For each subscription bought via its App Store, Apple takes a 30 percent cut for the first year and 15 percent for each subsequent year. That bet seems to be working: Apple\u2019s services revenue rose 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the latest quarter.\nThe iPhone is old enough now that figuring out what to call the new versions each year has become tricky. Last year, on the device\u2019s 10th anniversary, Apple skipped the iPhone 9 and went straight to the iPhone X. (But it pronounced the model \u201cten\u201d and not \u201cX.\u201d)\nThat X has now created an awkward situation for Apple. The company has typically appended an S to the name of the second iteration of each generation of phones, like the iPhone 5S, 6S and so on.\nBut this year, that meant calling it the iPhone XS. Never mind that XS is the abbreviation for extra small \u2014 not an adjective Apple wants for its $1,000 phones \u2014 but say \u201cXS\u201d out loud. In the age of smartphone addiction and devices that cost as much as some refrigerators, \u201ciPhone Excess\u201d may not be great for branding.\nInstead, the new iPhone XS is pronounced \u201ciPhone 10S,\u201d or as the audience at the Apple event quickly realized, \u201ciPhone Tennis.\u201d\nAdd the new iPhone XS Max to the mix and you\u2019ve got \u201ciPhone Tennis Match.\u201d\nApple introduced the Apple Watch Series 4, which it has designed to be more of a health aid.\nIt\u2019s the first redesign of the company\u2019s smart watch since it was introduced in 2015. The new watch is slightly thinner, but the black frame around the screen \u2014 what is known as the bezel \u2014 has been removed to create a larger display area.\nSignificantly, Apple said the new watch had a faster processor andbetter healthand motion sensors. For instance, the watch can detect when a wearer has fallen down, a leading cause of injuries. If you have fallen, the watch is designed to prompt you to alert emergency services; if it detects no motion by the wearer after a minute, it calls automatically. The watch can also perform a electrocardiogram, alerting you to worrisome heart rhythms.\nApple said that the new watch would be the first over-the-counter ECG device offered to consumers and that it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (Apple may want to check its claim of being first, as other companies said they had been ahead of it with the agency in this regard.)\nThe device\u2019s new health features are sure to increase Apple\u2019s dominance of the smart watch category \u2014 and they underscore the company\u2019s focus. When the watch was first released, critics and consumers were confused about its utility. Over time, Apple has refined the device to focus on its health and fitness capabilities. Now the narrative is clear: Get this watch, if you want to live.\nThe Apple Watch will be available in several colors and band styles; watchbands from older models will work on the new model. The Watch starts at $399. It will begin shipping on Sept. 21.\nThe new Apple Watch ushers Apple into the realm of selling bona fide medical devices, complete with ashout-out from the F.D.A.\n\u201cThe F.D.A. worked closely with the company as they developed and tested these software products, which may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement.\nApple\u2019s formal entrance into medical devices brings heft to the idea of tracking health with consumer wearables. Until now, they were largely limited to the casual counting of steps or watching heart rates climb at the gym. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Apple featured remarks from Dr. Ivor Benjamin, the president of the American Heart Association, who described the ability of wearable devices to measure heart rhythms as \u201cgame-changing, especially when evaluating atrial fibrillation \u2014 an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase a person\u2019s risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\u201d\nEven Vic Gundotra, the chief executive of AliveCor, which sells a wearable device with similar heart-testing capabilities, said Apple\u2019s decision to enter the market would make consumers\u2019 use of electrocardiograms take off.\nThe F.D.A. warned that the Apple Watchwas not meant as a substitute for traditional diagnosis, and it said the device was not intended for people under 22 or those with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nThe readings may not always be helpful, and doctors are advised not to use electrocardiograms as a screening tool for someone without symptoms, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\u201cPeople are going to start looking at their watch as if something is wrong,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and the Democratic Party: 5 Takeaways",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts positioned herself as an alternative to the standard-bearers of the Democratic Party, refusing to classify herself within the party during an hourlong interview on Thursday.\nIn a TimesTalks conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin, the editor at large of DealBook, Ms. Warren also took aim at Gary Cohn, Amazon and Facebook, and efforts to impeach President Trump, maintaining her signature critical stance on big banks and Wall Street while sparing Obama-era administration officials herprevious denunciations.\nAnd while she brushed off a question asking if she was running in 2020, she offered a glimpse into what such a platform could hold.\nHere are the takeaways.\nAs speculation mounts over whether Ms. Warren will enter the presidential race in 2020, she was asked where she sees herself within her own party.\nShe argued that her economic views \u2014 like raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security and regulating big banks \u2014 are ones that most Americans share. She places herself \u201cright in the middle of America,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow I see this is, this is a lot less about political parties and a lot more about where America is,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThere are issues on which we are divided. I understand that. But on these core economic set of issues, America is a progressive country.\u201d\nIs it unfair to argue that she has shifted her views compared with where she had initially established herself within the larger party?\n\u201cThis is who I\u2019ve been all along,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\nMs. Warren was withering in her criticism of Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser.\nPointing to the$285 million packagehe received from Goldman Sachs after he left as the company\u2019s president to work for Mr. Trump, she accused Mr. Cohn of working on behalf of the company instead of the American people.\n\u201cWhat he did was help Goldman Sachs,\u201d she said, adding that the tax overhaul that he helped push through last year saved corporations billions of dollars.\nWhat angered Ms. Warren the most, she said, was imagining the response of the American people.\n\u201cIs he working for us,\u201d she imagined someone thinking, \u201cOr is he working for Goldman, or is he just working for himself?\u201d\nMs. Warren said that she had spoken to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer \u2014 who is said to be considering a presidential bid in 2020 \u2014 and told him she did not support his efforts to impeach the president. Instead, she is intent on protecting the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\nThe investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election interference \u201chas resulted in more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas already,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI want protection for the special prosecutor,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time Donald Trump starts tweeting again or attacks someone else in government, I get very worried about the special prosecutor.\u201d\nWhat Congress could do, Ms. Warren said, is pass a law that says the special counsel cannot be fired by the president.\n\u201cOnce the investigation is completed,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll know what we have in front of us.\u201d\nAs tech giants like Facebook and Apple come under continued scrutiny by Congress, Ms. Warren weighed in on the subject, stating that the issue was more about their anti-competitive business models and less about \u201cbreaking up\u201d big companies.\nShe expressed concern that Amazon serves as both a marketplace for businesses and a competitor to those same businesses, noting that the company now sells itsown private-label brands, and can use the information it collects about its customers to help push those products.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick one business or the other,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you\u2019ve been scraping, then we no longer have competition going on.\u201d\nMs. Warren, who has been the target of the president\u2019s name-calling on Twitter, offered a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts.\n\u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t going to change. But he\u2019s not going to change me, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the fights I\u2019m in and I\u2019m going to stay in them. But I stay in them not because of him, I stay in them because of the people and the urgency I feel in this moment.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nThe pace at which companies are repurchasing their shares is gaining momentum.Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index bought back a record $189.1 billion of their shares during the second quarter, up nearly 60 percent from a year ago, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. The figure topped the previous high of $178 billion set during the first quarter. Through the first six months, corporate buybacks stand at $379.7 billion, a 50 percent increase from the same period in 2017. Technology companies were the busiest, accounting for nearly $37.5 percent of the activity.\nApple again led the way.The iPhone maker bought $21.9 billion of its shares back last quarter. Apple accounted for 11.5 percent of all buyback activity by S.& P. 500 companies.\nRates are rising, but that may not mean a bear market is around the corner.The Federal Reserve meets this week and is widely expected to raise rates for the third time this year. Among the biggest concerns of investors is whether the Fed would eventually push too far with its tightening and end the nearly decade-long bull market. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA, does not believe that a rise in interest rates in the near term will cause a bear market in stocks. In his analysis, he looked at the difference between the Fed funds rate and the yearly change in the Consumer Price Index. In the lead up to every bear markets since 1955, the Fed funds rate was, on average, 2.5 percentage points higher than the yearly change in inflation. Now, though, the target range for the Fed funds rate is below the change in inflation and will remain so even if the Fed raises rates this week, Mr. Stovall notes.\nBut can the Fed even slow the economy when the private sector is so strong?Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, explained that recessions in developed economies were caused by the unwinding of imbalances in the private sector \u2014 for instance, the level of debt held by households ahead of the financial crisis \u2014 set off by central bank tightening. Now, the level of debt held by households or corporations is not concerning. \u201cThe only domestic imbalance in the economy right now is in the public sector,\u201d writes Mr. Shepherdson. That means the Fed does not need to take drastic actions. That could change by the middle of 2019, when continued strength in the labor market and growing wages, along with the effects of the tax cuts could force the Fed to move faster than expected.\nThe price Brent crude oil climbs above $80 a barrel, its highest level since 2014.The movefollows the weekend decision by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers like Russia to hold prices production steady. Brent is now up roughly 25 percent this year, and some forecasters expect it to rise to $90. But could oil prices surge and crash as they did in 2008? Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that possibility had increased.\nHow long will it take Americans to forgive the financial crisis bailouts?Twenty-five years, according to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. Speaking at an event sponsored by the World Affairs Council in Philadelphia, Mr. Dimon said the government did the right thing,Bloomberg reports."
