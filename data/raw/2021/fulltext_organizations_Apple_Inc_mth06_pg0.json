        "title": "Tech Giants, Fearful of Proposals to Curb Them, Blitz Washington With Lobbying",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the days after lawmakersintroduced legislationthat could break the dominance of tech companies, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, called Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress to deliver a warning.\nTheantitrustbills were rushed, he said. They would crimp innovation. And they would hurt consumers by disrupting the services that power Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhone, Mr. Cook cautioned at various points, according to five people with knowledge of the conversations.\nThe calls by Mr. Cook are part of a forceful and wide-ranging pushback by the tech industry since the proposals were announced this month. Executives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law.\nThe bills, the most sweeping set of antitrust legislation in generations, take aim at Amazon, Apple,FacebookandGoogleby trying to undo their dominance in online commerce, advertising, media and entertainment. There are six bills in total, and if passed, they would empower regulators, make it harder for the tech giants to acquire start-ups and prevent the companies from using their strength in one area to form a grip in another.\nAmazon\u2019s top lobbyist, Brian Huseman, rarely speaks publicly about bills before there is a vote. But with the House Judiciary Committee expected to vote on the bills on Wednesday, he warned in a statement on Tuesday that the legislation \u201cwould have significant negative effects on the hundreds of thousands of American small- and medium-sized businesses that sell in our store and tens of millions of consumers who buy products from Amazon.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, has also made calls to lawmakers in recent days, and the company\u2019s top lobbyist, Mark Isakowitz, has weighed in on how the bills would alter how people use the internet. \u201cAmerican consumers and small businesses would be shocked at how these bills would break many of their favorite services,\u201d he said in a statement. A spokesman for Facebook, Christopher Sgro, said that antitrust laws \u201cshould promote competition and protect consumers, not punish successful American companies.\u201d\nThirteen nonprofits, most of which have received funding from the tech giants, wrote a letter to lawmakers decrying two of the bills. NetChoice, one of the groups, hosted a public panel on Tuesday featuring Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, to cast skepticism on the proposals. A prominent Republican lobbyist and fund-raiser, Jeff Miller, has been trying to stanch the support for the bills within his party, reaching out to members of Congress on behalf of his tech company clients.\n\u201cIn a way I\u2019ve never seen before, they are fighting tooth and nail,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Technology Law and Policy. \u201cThey consider these bills existential for them because they get at their business models.\u201d\nApple declined to comment on Mr. Cook\u2019s calls to lawmakers, including to Ms. Pelosi.\nThe companies, which have long faced accusations of holding too much power, are now scrambling to find their footing with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House. The administration has picked aggressive critics of Big Tech as top antitrust regulators, includingLina Khan, the new chair of the Federal Trade Commission whose work as a legal scholar laid the foundation for the current antitrust push.\nIn Congress, progressive Democrats focused on the market power of the companies have united with some Republicans accusing social media companies of political bias and censorship. Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, the ranking Republican of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, co-sponsored some of the bills being considered and has brought along other Republican members to support the legislation.\nBut the antitrust issue \u2014 even with some agreement between parties \u2014 has created new fault lines.\nWithin the Republican Party, there are deep divides on the antitrust bills. Tucker Carlson, the influential Fox News host, has praised the bills and has pushed for the breakup of Big Tech companies. But Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, and Mark Meadows, who was chief of staff to President Donald J. Trump, wrote in an opinion piece on Fox News\u2019s website that the bills would give the Democratic administration more control over the tech companies.\n\u201cDemocrats are weaponizing legitimate Republican anger about Big Tech\u2019s abuses to encourage Republicans to support these bills,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut Republicans should read the fine print.\u201d\nA similar argument is being made directly to Republican members of Congress by Mr. Miller, the Republican lobbyist, according to a person familiar with his efforts. Mr. Miller, whose firm has been paid a total of more than $1 million over the last two years by Amazon and Apple, has been a top fund-raiser for many Republicans, including Mr. Trump and Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, who has criticized the bills as empowering Biden appointees like Ms. Khan to crack down on companies.\nThe tech companies have tried to navigate the complicated new political landscape by focusing their lobbying efforts in part on the Democrats from California who have seats on the Judiciary Committee.\nThat group includes Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, a longtime member of Congress whose district includes parts of the tech hub of San Jose. She is concerned that some of the bills could expose the tech giants to unnecessary lawsuits and imperil the engine of the state\u2019s economy, said one Democratic congressional staff member, and is planning to propose amendments to the bills on Wednesday that could address some of those issues.\nMs. Pelosi pushed back on Mr. Cook\u2019s concerns about the bills, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations. When Mr. Cook asked for a delay in the Judiciary Committee\u2019s process of considering the bills, Ms. Pelosi pushed him to identify specific policy objections to the measures, said one of the people.\nMorgan Reed, the president of the App Association, a trade organization sponsored by Apple and other tech and telecom companies, said in a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday that breaking up platforms and \u201climiting the services they can provide for our member companies would harm your constituents.\u201d\nAnother outspoken critic is the Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning trade group formed in March by a former Google executive, Adam Kovacevich.\n\u201cTech had a very long political honeymoon,\u201d Mr. Kovacevich said. \u201cMany politicians and policymakers think that maybe they were too easy on tech for a long time, and now there is a countervailing desire to punish tech through either new laws or through regulatory action. And that is at odds with what consumers want.\u201d\nHe drafted and organized support for a letter that was sent this week urging members of the Judiciary Committee to oppose two of the bills. It warned that the bills would hurt consumers, resulting in Amazon without Prime, the iPhone without text or phone capabilities preinstalled, and Google without Maps. The letter was signed by Mr. Kovacevich\u2019s group and an unusual mix of 12 other organizations, including tech associations, free-market conservative outfits and consumer groups, most of which have received funding from Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google.\nEli Lehrer, the president of the fiscally conservative think tank the R Street Institute, which signed the letter, criticized Republican supporters of the bills for turning their backs on their free market principles by \u201ccalling on the government to use its power to intervene directly against some of the most successful companies in our country\u2019s history.\u201d\nThe institute has received funding from Google, but Mr. Lehrer said the funding did not affect its stance on the legislation, as did representatives from other signatory groups.\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington and a co-sponsor of the bills, said the lobbying is \u201cmaking our case that they have way too much power in terms of monopoly power and in terms of money and politics.\u201d\n\u201cSmall business and consumers have no hope of competing with this amount of money and power,\u201d she said.\nNicholas Fandoscontributed reporting."

        "title": "Boom Times for Lawyers as Washington Pursues Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, a top corporate law firm, were abuzz on Monday as they grappled witha federal judge\u2019s rulings about antitrust casesrelated to their client: Facebook.\nLast month, lawyers at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, one of the country\u2019s elite law firms, advised Amazon over its acquisition of MGM, which is facing antitrust scrutiny from regulators.\nAnd a slate of litigators for the prominent law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher gave closing arguments for Apple inan antitrust lawsuit brought by Epic Games.\nThe mounting legal and regulatory scrutiny facing Big Tech has led to a wave of lawsuits, investigations and proposed legislation aimed at ending the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Whether those efforts succeed may take years to sort out, but there is already one clear winner: the nation\u2019s legal industry.\nNot since the government sued to break up Microsoft in the late 1990s has there been greater demand for people who know the ins and outs of corporate competition law. That is only certain to increase after a federal judge dismissed a states\u2019 antitrust case against Facebook on Monday and said the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s complaint against the social network needed to be revised.\nThe rulings put the Facebook case back into the hands ofLina Khan, a fierce critic of the tech industry, who recently became chair of the F.T.C., an agency that regulates antitrust. Last week, bills aimed at weakening the companies\u2019 grip on the industry alsoadvanced in the House.\nThe clamor for talent extends to lobbying firms and economists, who can help the companies formulate counterarguments and provide expert testimony about the companies\u2019 market power. But it is particularly acute in the legal profession.\nThe tech giants are already flooding courtrooms with large teams of prominent lawyers to press their case.Google faces multiple antitrust lawsuits, one brought by the Justice Department, and two others from state attorneys general. Since those suits were filed, 16 lawyers from six law firms have appeared in courts to defend the company, according to public records.\nIn total, 51 lawyers from 21 law firms have appeared in court in the Google cases, including lawyers representing states like Texas and some of Google\u2019s competitors. Facebook, which faces its own antitrust case, has hired a team of lawyers in a similar way.\nAs a result, antitrust work \u2014 once a relatively sleepy area of the legal world \u2014 is now providing a windfall for the big firms. Top partners at a large firm often bill $1,000 to $2,000 an hour, and the scores of young associates who help them charge hundreds of dollars an hour.\nThe cost is minimal for the giant tech companies. But it has widened the divide in resources between regulators and the companies they police, making it harder for the government to recruit and keep talent to take on the industry. It has also raised fresh concerns about Washington\u2019s revolving door, since many of the lawyers used by the tech companies recently worked for the government.\nIn 2019, when the Justice Department searched for a lead investigator into Google and other tech giants, officials came up with a list of candidates from about 10 law firms, according to two people with knowledge of the search. But one by one, they said, potential candidates had to be crossed off the list because they already worked for Big Tech clients, leaving few options.\nMore recently, conflicts of interest have complicated the Biden administration\u2019s search for the head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. Several times, critics of the industry have criticized a potential candidate because of the person\u2019s ties to Big Tech.\n\u201cThese companies have the monetary resources to hire the best and the brightest,\u201d said William J. Baer, former head of antitrust at the Justice Department under President Barack Obama. \u201cBut it does emphasize the resource disparity between what the government can throw at these issues and the virtually unlimited resources of these companies.\u201d\nRebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the F.T.C., said antitrust cases were among their most expensive. The cost for one expert witness to speak on behalf of the agency exceeds the witness costs for all other cases pursued by the agency in any given year.\n\u201cThe demand for antitrust enforcement has gone up dramatically over the last decade and has really skyrocketed in the last year,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said. \u201cThe costs involved in bringing large and complex cases and reviewing the tsunami of proposed mergers are huge, especially for a small agency like ours.\u201d\nAmazon, Facebook and Google declined to comment. Apple and the law firms did not respond to requests for comment.\nFreshfields, the oldest global law firm in the world, shows the extent of the boom times for antitrust legal work.\nIn 2018, the firm hired Eric Mahr, a former lead litigator for the Justice Department, to expand the firm\u2019s antitrust practice in Washington. Mr. Mahr then brought on many former colleagues, including Julie Elmer, an experienced trial lawyer. The firm now has a dozen partners with antitrust expertise. Ms. Elmer and Mr. Mahr are leading Google\u2019s defense against an ad-tech lawsuit led by the Texas attorney general.\nThe firm has also expanded west, to be closer to its valuable tech clients. The firm, which is based in Britain, sent its lead European antitrust partner, Alan Ryan, to open an office in Menlo Park in Silicon Valley. He has since added six partners from other firms. In total, 25 people work in the firm\u2019s office on Sand Hill Road, the most expensive office real estate in the nation and home to venture capital firms including Kleiner Perkins.\nNext year, the company will move into two floors in a new office complex in Redwood City to accommodate more staff members, including four new antitrust partners Mr. Ryan is seeking to hire.\n\u201cCan we double it in the next year? I hope so.\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe plan to grow. The only question is how fast we can get there.\u201d\nThe tech firms are also bringing antitrust experts in house. Amazon, Facebook and Google each have dozens of in-house lawyers. In January 2020, Amazon hired a former F.T.C. lawyer, Amy Posner. In April 2020, Facebook hired numerous government officials, starting with another longtime Federal Trade Commission lawyer in the competition bureau.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s striking is the number of people going to work directly for tech companies from the agencies,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C. \u201cThat reflects a real change.\u201d\nThe opportunities to work for tech clients, or the tech companies themselves, drew a big audience at a recent mock trial held by the American Bar Association. The workshop centered on a fictional big search engine called Knowsmore, which was being sued by a smaller search engine that wanted to charge for more privacy features. The event was one of the best-attended workshops put on by the A.B.A. over the past few years, said David Reichenberg, a lawyer at Cozen O\u2019Connor and the association\u2019s litigation committee co-chair.\n\u201cEvery year there is more and more interest among the members to learn more about tech and antitrust,\u201d he said.\nThere is also more work for lawyers who want to take on the big companies, or represent the government itself. Two law firms reached an agreement last year to represent the State of Texas in its lawsuit against Google. And last month, another firm joined with the attorney general in the District of Columbia to sue Amazon.\nBut many of the biggest and most prestigious firms are working for the Silicon Valley giants.\nJonathan Kanter, a longtime antitrust lawyer who has been rumored as a possible nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, built his career largely around working for the rivals of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. His client list included both big companies like Microsoft and News Corporation and smaller firms like Yelp and Spotify.\nIn 2016, he moved to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a prominent corporate litigation firm. But last year,Mr. Kanter\u2019s work criticizing Big Tech started to present conflicts with other parts of the firm\u2019s sprawling portfolio, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Specifically, his practice was at odds with work being done by Bill Isaacson and Karen Dunn, two lawyers the firm had just hired who are known to represent Apple and Amazon, said another person with knowledge of the situation.\nMr. Kanter faced a choice: Drop some of his clients or leave the firm. He left.\n\u201cJonathan made this decision due to a complicated legal conflict that would have required him to discontinue important and longstanding client representations and relationships,\u201d the firm said in a note circulated at the time.\nMr. Kanter, Mr. Isaacson and Ms. Dunn did not reply to requests for comment, nor did a spokeswoman for Paul, Weiss.\nMr. Kanter has since founded his own firm, the Kanter Law Group, which advertises itself online as an \u201cantitrust advocacy boutique.\u201d According to court records, its lawyers have already been hired by critics of Apple and Google."

        "title": "House Lawmakers Are Considering 6 Bills Aimed at Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "House lawmakers on Wednesday began the process ofconsidering a legislative packagethat would overhaul the nation\u2019s antitrust laws in an attempt to rein in the power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\nOver the course of the day, members of the House Judiciary Committee are expected to vote on six bills that could block the tech giants from prioritizing their own products online, force them to break off parts of their businesses and generate more resources for the law enforcement agencies that police Silicon Valley. Skeptical lawmakers can propose amendments to the bills or oppose the measures outright.\nThe committee took its first vote in the early afternoon, voting in favor of a bill that would increase the amount of money companies pay government agencies when getting some mergers approved. That money could fund more aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws, its supporters say.\nThe bill passed out of the committee with 29 lawmakers in favor and 12 opposed. All Democrats who were present voted in favor of the bill, and five Republicans joined them. Even though it is considered one of the least contentious of the six measures, lawmakers still debated the legislation for hours and considered multiple proposed amendments.\nBy late afternoon, the committee advanced a second bill, which would give state attorneys general the power to keep antitrust cases in the courts of their choice. The bill \u2014 also among the least controversial proposals, supported by members of both parties and by all attorneys generals of states and territories \u2014 would prevent corporations from moving antitrust challenges to venues that they could view as more favorable to them. The vote was 34 to 7.\nWednesday\u2019s session is expected to continue for the whole day, potentially stretching into early Thursday.\nThe bills, which were introduced this month, reflect a growing concern about thepower of the largest tech companies. The proposals have drawn support from members of both parties, uniting Democrats concerned about out-of-control businesses with Republicans who fear the power of online platforms to police content online.\n\u201cThe digital marketplace suffers from a lack of competition,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the subcommittee focused on antitrust. \u201cAmazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are gatekeepers to the online economy.\u201d\nThe proposals also have their share of critics.\nRepresentative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to President Donald J. Trump, said in a Fox News opinion column on Tuesday that if \u201cyou think Big Tech is bad now, just wait until Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are working in collusion with Big Government.\u201d Some California Democrats have also grown concerned that the bills would slow the state\u2019s economic engine.\nThe tech giants have mounted an aggressive campaign to block the bills. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has been calling members of Congress to express his concerns. Executives at other companies have made statements in recent days opposing the bills. And scores of groups funded by the companies have urged lawmakers to oppose the proposals."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Encryption: A Race Between Criminals and the F.B.I.",
        "fulltext": "Whether it was gangsters a century ago speeding off in faster getaway cars, or terrorists and hackers in recent decades who shielded their communications through encrypted apps, criminals have perennially exploited technology to stay a step ahead of law enforcement.\nThe F.B.I. struck back in the past week with a pair of victories: a seizure ofmost of the $4 million ransom in Bitcointhat Russian hackers extorted from an American pipeline operator, and the announcement of a yearslong sting wherethousands of suspectswere duped into using a messaging app secretly controlled by the authorities. More than 800 people were arrested in more than a dozen countries.\nThe breakthroughs came in part because law enforcement officials learned how to leverage two rapidly advancing technologies \u2014 encryption and cryptocurrencies \u2014 that had previously been a boon for criminals.\nYet the events did little to fundamentally alter the challenges for the authorities in an increasingly digital world, according to former law enforcement officials, prosecutors, historians and technology experts. The global sting is highly unlikely to keep criminals from using encryption and could encourage them to go even further underground, former and experts officials said. And while the F.B.I. has shown that it can recover stolen cryptocurrencies, doing so requires resources beyond the reach of most law enforcement agencies.\nUltimately, the cases were the latest iteration in the decades-long back and forth between lawbreakers and the F.B.I. in which both sides have seized on technological advances, whether it is criminals hiding behind encryption or investigators exploitingfacial recognition,dronesand other mechanisms.\n\u201cYou get a sharper sword, they get a stronger shield \u2014 the greed of the bad guys is always stronger than the reach of the good guys,\u201d said Tim Weiner, the author of \u201cEnemies: A History of the F.B.I.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not just the story of the F.B.I. \u2014 it\u2019s been true throughout the history of warfare.\u201d\nNow, law enforcement agencies are seeking more access to digital devices, sometimes buying hacking tools from the private sector, and urging lawmakers to give them more power to track suspects.\n\u201cThis does not end the debate on encryption,\u201d said Joseph V. DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan who has spent years working on cybercrime. \u201cIt shows that law enforcement is willing to design flanking maneuvers to go around encryption obstacles. But the debate about whether or not those workarounds are adequate will continue.\u201d\nTechnology has not been all bad for the police. Beyond facial recognition and drones, the authorities in the United States usegunshot detectorsanddevices that simulate cell towersto surreptitiously connect to suspects\u2019 phones and determine their location.\nLaw enforcement also has an advantage when it gets ahold of digital devices. Despite claims from Apple, Google andeven the Justice Departmentthat smartphones are largely impenetrable,thousands of law enforcement agencieshave tools that can infiltrate the latest phones to extract data.\n\u201cPolice today are facing a situation of an explosion of data,\u201d said Yossi Carmil, the chief executive of Cellebrite, an Israeli company that has sold data extraction tools to more than 5,000 law enforcement agencies, including hundreds of small police departments across the United States. \u201cThe solutions are there. There is no real challenge to accessing the data.\u201d\nThe police also have an easier time getting to data stored in the cloud. Technology companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft regularly turn over customers\u2019 personal data, such as photographs, emails, contacts and text messages, to the authorities with a warrant.\nFrom January 2013 through June 2020, Apple said, it turned over the contents of tens of thousands of iCloud accounts to U.S. law enforcement in 13,371 cases.\nAnd on Friday, Apple said that in 2018, it hadunknowingly turned overto the Justice Departmentthe phone records of congressional staff members, their families and at least two members of Congress, including Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The subpoena was part of an investigation by the Trump administration into leaks of classified information.\nYet intercepting communications has remained a troublesome problem for the police. While criminals used to talk over channels that were relatively simple to tap \u2014 like phones, emails and basic text messages \u2014 most now use encrypted messengers, which are not.\nTwo of the world\u2019s most popular messaging services, Apple\u2019s iMessage and Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, use so-called end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender and receiver can see the messages. Not even the companies have access to their contents, allowing Apple and Facebook to argue that they cannot turn them over to law enforcement.\nThe authorities\u2019 frustration has prompted them to target smaller encrypted apps favored by criminals. In July, the police in Europe said theyhacked into one called EncroChat, leading to hundreds of arrests.\nThat pushed many criminals onto a new service, Anom. They had to buy specialized phones with few working features, aside from an app disguised as a calculator. With a code, it would turn into a messaging app, Anom, that claimed to be encrypted.\nIn fact, the F.B.I. created Anom. The bureau and the Australian police started the operation by persuading an informant to distribute the devices to criminal networks, after which they caught on by word of mouth. After three years, Anom had more than 12,000 users.\nCriminals felt so comfortable on the service that they stopped using coded language, sending photos of smuggled cocaine shipments and openly planning murders, the police said. And when the authorities obtained court approval to surveil any Anom users, they could easily monitor their messages.\nBut when the police carried out hundreds of arrests and detailed the scheme to news cameras this past week, the ruse was over. The authorities were once again in the dark.\nFor years, Bitcoin and other digital currencies were thecoin of choice for international criminal syndicates. The qualities that make cryptocurrencies attractive \u2014 decentralization and anonymity \u2014 make them great for theft, ransom and selling drugs.\nGetting paid used to be the hardest part of holding something or someone hostage, said Ross Anderson, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Cambridge who studies how the police and criminals use technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to grab the heiress or her dog, but the problem then is that when you threatened to cut her ear off, and asked Mr. Rockefeller to send you a large suitcase full of dollar bills, the police tagged along or they put a radio transmitter in it,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Bitcoin, you can get actually quite substantial extortion amounts, like seven- and eight-figure sums, which can be delivered instantaneously to Russia or North Korea or wherever.\u201d\nThat new model fueled a surge in ransomware attacks, where hackers take control of a person\u2019s or company\u2019s computers and demand a ransom. Recorded Future, a security company that tracks such attacks, estimated that last year, one attack occurredevery eight minutes.\nRansomware attacks have recently hit hospitals, meatpackers, minor league baseball teams and the ferries to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Many companies pay the ransoms because it is easier and faster than alternative solutions, despite also giving hackers more incentive.\nYet the Colonial Pipeline case showed that the police could also use cryptocurrencies to their advantage. Each transaction is recorded in a public ledger,making the money traceableeven as it travels from one anonymous account to the next. That means that law enforcement with enough money and know-how can typically hack into an account and snatch back the money.\nBut hacking can be expensive and time-consuming, leaving few agencies outside the F.B.I. with the ability to do it.\nThe history of the cat-and-mouse game between the police and criminals is long. In the 1920s, bandits realized that cars could allow them to rob a home or bank and quickly escape to the next county or state, where the police would be less interested in solving the crime.\n\u201cIt took something like 50 years for the police to catch up with regional crime squads and police national computers and eventually with automatic plate number recognition,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cBut for a while, the existence of the car meant that it was a fun time for the gangsters.\u201d\nToday, law enforcement\u2019s eagerness to keep up has spawned a rapidly growing industry dedicated to extracting suspects\u2019 communications data. Cellebrite, the Israeli company, said its sales increased 38 percent in the first quarter to $53 million as more police departments bought its tools to hack into suspects\u2019 phones.\nAt least 2,000 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states have such tools, including 49 of the 50 largest U.S. police departments,according to Upturn, a Washington nonprofit that investigates how the police use technology.\nStill, some of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officials have asked for more from tech companies and lawmakers. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, told Congress in 2019 that data extraction tools were expensive and unreliable. They can sometimes take weeks or even years to crack into a phone, he said.\n\u201cThere are many, many serious cases where we can\u2019t access the device in the time period where it is most important for us,\u201d Mr. Vance told lawmakers.\nApple said security researchers agreed that the iPhone is the most secure device on the market. Google declined to comment."

        "title": "Justice Dept. Will Toughen Rules for Seizing Lawmakers\u2019 Data, Garland Says",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 TheJustice Departmentwill tighten its rules for when law enforcement officials may seize information about members of Congress and their aides, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said on Monday amid a backlash to the disclosure of a 2018 subpoena that swept in data from the Apple accounts of Democratic lawmakers and staff.\nLater in the day, Mr. Garland also met with leaders ofThe New York Times,CNNandThe Washington Postafter the disclosure that the Trump Justice Department had secretly seized phone records of reporters at each outlet in search of their sources. President Biden and Mr. Garland have said thatprosecutors will no longer be permitted to use that tactic.\nThe two events underscored how recent revelations displaying the power of prosecutors to secretly seize records from phone and technology companies for leak investigations have become a major political headache for the Biden-era Justice Department, even as many questions remain about the context.\nDavid McCraw, a Times newsroom lawyer who attended the meeting with its publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, portrayed the discussion \u2014 about restricting the ability of leak hunters to go after reporters\u2019 data \u2014 as positive. Under an agreement, news executives were permitted to disclose what they said, but Mr. Garland\u2019s responses were off the record.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s meeting, we once again sought a full accounting of what happened and requested that the Department of Justice codify that it will no longer seize journalists\u2019 records during leak investigations,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said in a statement. \u201cWe were encouraged by Attorney General Garland\u2019s statements, but we will continue to push until our concerns are addressed.\u201d\nThe meeting came hours after Mr. Garland had addressed the political uproar over the subpoena for congressional information, which The Times reported last week. He said he had asked his deputy, Lisa O. Monaco, to review and toughen the department\u2019s existing policies \u201cfor obtaining records of the legislative branch,\u201d noting that she was \u201calready working on surfacing potentially problematic matters deserving high-level review.\u201d\nMr. Garland added: \u201cConsistent with our commitment to the rule of law, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separation-of-powers concerns moving forward.\u201d\nThat announcement came as John C. Demers, the Trump administration official who leads the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, which oversees leak investigations, told his staff that he wouldstep down at the end of next week.\nOn Sunday, Democratic lawmakers had called for Mr. Demers to testify about the subpoena that swept in congressional information, along with the former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein and the former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and William P. Barr.\nBut on Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, denounced those calls, saying that aninvestigation by the Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector generalwas sufficient. By calling for a congressional inquiry, he said, top Democrats \u201cgave in to the urge to pick at the scab of politically motivated investigations.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is empowered to investigate criminal conduct by members of Congress and their staff \u2014 necessarily, this sort of investigation is subject to strict procedural protections,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThe department\u2019s inspector general is fully equipped to determine whether these procedures were followed. I\u2019m confident that the existing inquiry will uncover the truth.\u201d\nHe also said that it was \u201cparticularly disappointing that our colleagues are attacking Bill Barr over investigative decisions that occurred when he wasn\u2019t there yet.\u201d\nThe grand jury subpoena that swept up congressional information was dated February 2018, when Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein were still the top two officials in the Justice Department.\nStill, after Mr. Barr was sworn in the following year,The Times has reported, he brought in a trusted prosecutor with little relevant experience to help reinvigorate several leak cases, including the one that involved congressional Democrats and their staff.\nEventually, it was closed without charges.\nSenator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat who has supported calling the former attorneys general to testify, pushed back at Mr. McConnell\u2019s suggestion that there was nothing amiss, asking, \u201cHow would he know that?\u201d\nMr. Durbin, who is also the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,sent a letter signed by the other 10 Democratson that panel to Mr. Garland on Monday asking for a copy of the subpoena and internal emails and other records related to it, and posing questions about its basis and purpose.\nThe subpoena appears to have been part of a leak investigation that centered on a Democratic aide on the House Intelligence Committee. The Times has previously reported that it listed 109 phone numbers and email addresses and sought account data linked to those numbers.\nTwo lawmakers \u2014 Representatives Adam B. Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both Democrats of California \u2014 were among those whoseaccount information Apple turned over, along with aides and a relative of Mr. Schiff\u2019s.\nThe broad subpoena appears to have been an example of a common technique investigators use when they obtain the communications records of a target. By subpoenaing electronic communications providers for any account information linked to those phone numbers or email addresses, they can identify the people with whom the target interacted.\nFor example, many people own a smartphone that uses either Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating systems and register their phone numbers with one of those companies when setting up their devices. Those accounts may also have their names, addresses, email addresses, data about the phone and computer hardware they used to access the account, and sometimes credit card numbers.\nWhile the controversies over secret Trump-era seizures of data about reporters and about lawmakers and their staff have partly merged, there is an important difference.\nThe phone data seized about reporters at The Times, The Post and CNN centered on a type of metadata \u2014 calling logs \u2014 that reveals whom people have spoken with. The Justice Department also carried out a related legal fight over a court order it obtained for logs of the reporters\u2019 emails \u2014 which can also reveal social contacts \u2014 that spilled into the Biden era and included gag orders imposed on executives at The Times and CNN.\nBy contrast, there is no sign that the subpoena to Apple could have provided investigators with the type of metadata that would offer a systematic look at the lawmakers\u2019 contacts with other people.\nAccording to law enforcement officials, prosecutors cannot use a grand jury subpoena to obtain email logs. Instead, they obtain court orders if they want to seize the information logging senders and recipients of emails and other types of electronic messages.\nApple, which is not a phone company and does not generate traditional calling logs, has said it turned over only \u201caccount subscriber information\u201d in response to the grand jury and that it \u201cdid not provide any content such as emails or pictures.\u201d\nThe law treats phone call logs differently. Prosecutors can seize them using a grand jury subpoena, without a judge\u2019s involvement. But Apple is more forthcoming than some other companies in disclosing to customers when it has turned over their data to the government \u2014 at least when there is no longer a gag order, as there was for years about the grand jury subpoena. It is not clear whether any similar subpoenas went to phone providers.\nOver the weekend,The Times reportedthat Apple last month told Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel to President Donald J. Trump, that it had secretly turned over to prosecutors information about his account in response to a grand jury subpoena and gag order in February 2018. It remains unclear what investigation generated that subpoena and whether Mr. McGahn was one of many people on a list of those who had been in contact with a person under scrutiny and whom investigators were seeking to identify.\nThe House Judiciary Committee will also conduct its own oversight inquiry, its chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, announced on Monday. He said that even if the cases \u2014 involving lawmakers, reporters and Mr. McGahn \u2014 turn out to be unrelated and isolated, \u201cthey raise serious constitutional and separation-of-powers concerns.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cCongress must make it extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, for the department to spy on the Congress or the news media. We should make it hard for prosecutors to hide behind secret gag orders for years at a time. We cannot rely on the department alone to make these changes.\u201d\nEmily CochraneandAdam Goldmancontributed reporting."

        "title": "In Leak Investigation, Tech Giants Are Caught Between Courts and Customers",
        "fulltext": "On Feb. 6, 2018, Apple received a grand jury subpoena for the names and phone records connected to 109 email addresses and phone numbers. It was one of the more than 250 data requests that the company received on average from U.S. law enforcement each week at the time. An Apple paralegal complied and provided the information.\nThis year, a gag order on the subpoena expired. Apple said it alerted the people who were the subjects of the subpoena, just as it does with dozens of customers each day.\nBut this request was out of the ordinary.\nWithout knowing it, Apple said, it hadhanded over the data of congressional staff members, their families and at least two members of Congress, including Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, then the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat and now its chairman. It turned out the subpoena was part of a wide-ranging investigation by the Trump administration into leaks of classified information.\nAround the same time, The Times reported on Sunday,Apple also turned over data on Donald F. McGahn II,the White House counsel to former President Donald J. Trump. It was unclear what the department was investigating.\nThe revelations have now plunged Apple into the middle of a firestorm over theTrump administration\u2019s efforts to find the sources of news stories, and the handling underscores the flood of law enforcement requests that tech companies increasingly contend with. The number of these requests has soared in recent years to thousands a week, putting Apple and other tech giants like Google and Microsoft in an uncomfortable position between law enforcement, the courts and the customers whose privacy they have promised to protect.\nThe companies regularly comply with the requests because they are legally required to do so. The subpoenas can be vague, so Apple, Google and others are often unclear on the nature or subject of an investigation. They can challenge some of the subpoenas if they are too broad or if they relate to a corporate client. In the first six months of 2020, Apple challenged 238 demands from the government for its customers\u2019 account data, or 4 percent of such requests.\nAs part of the same leak investigation by the Trump administration, Google fought a gag order this year on a subpoena to turn over data onthe emails of four New York Times reporters. Google argued that its contract as The Times\u2019s corporate email provider required it to inform the newspaper of any government requests for its emails, said Ted Boutrous, an outside lawyer for The Times.\nBut more frequently than not, the companies comply with law enforcement demands. And that underlines an awkward truth: As their products become more central to people\u2019s lives, the world\u2019s largest tech companies have become surveillance intermediaries and crucial partners to authorities, with the power to arbitrate which requests to honor and which to reject.\n\u201cThere is definitely tension,\u201d said Alan Z. Rozenshtein, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota\u2019s law school and a former Justice Department lawyer. He said given the \u201cinsane amount of data these companies have\u201d and how everyone has a smartphone, most law enforcement investigations \u201cat some point involve these companies.\u201d\nOn Friday, the Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector generalopened an investigationinto the decision by federal prosecutors to secretly seize the data of House Democrats and reporters. Top Senate Democrats also demanded that the former attorneys general William P. Barr and Jeff Sessions testify before Congress about the leak investigations, specifically about the subpoena issued to Apple and another to Microsoft.\nFred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said in a statement that the company regularly challenged government data requests and informed affected customers as soon as it legally could.\n\u201cIn this case, the subpoena, which was issued by a federal grand jury and included a nondisclosure order signed by a federal magistrate judge, provided no information on the nature of the investigation, and it would have been virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users\u2019 accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cConsistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to account subscriber information and did not provide any content such as emails or pictures.\u201d\nIn a statement, Microsoft said it received a subpoena in 2017 related to a personal email account. It said it notified the customer after the gag order expired and learned that the person was a congressional staff member. \u201cWe will continue to aggressively seek reform that imposes reasonable limits on government secrecy in cases like this,\u201d the company said.\nGoogle declined to comment on whether it received a subpoena related to theinvestigation on the House Intelligence Committee.\nThe Justice Department has not commented publicly on Apple\u2019s turning over House Intelligence Committee records. In congressional testimony this week, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland sidestepped criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s decisions and said the seizure of records was made \u201cunder a set of policies that have existed for decades.\u201d\nIn the Justice Department\u2019s leak investigation, Apple and Microsoft turned over so-called metadata of people who worked in Congress, including phone records, device information and addresses. It is not unusual for the Justice Department to subpoena such metadata, because the information can be used to establish whether someone had contact with a member of the media or whether the person\u2019s work or home accounts were tied to anonymous accounts that were used to disseminate classified information.\nUnder the gag orders that authorities placed on the subpoenas, Apple and Microsoft also agreed to not tell those people whose information was being demanded. In Apple\u2019s case, a yearlong gag order was renewed two separate times. That contrasted with Google, which resisted the gag order on a subpoena to turn over data on the four Times reporters.\nThe differing responses are largely explained by the different relationships the companies had with their customers in the case. Apple and Microsoft were ordered to hand over data related to individual accounts, while the subpoena to Google affected a corporate customer, which was governed by a contract. That contract gave Google a more specific basis on which to challenge the gag order, lawyers said.\nThe subpoena to Apple was also more opaque \u2014 it simply asked for information about a series of email addresses and phone numbers \u2014 and the company said it did not know it related to an investigation into Congress. For Google, it was clear that the Justice Department sought records from The Times because the email addresses were clearly those of Times reporters.\nGoogle said it generally did not handle requests for customer information differently for individual accounts and corporate customers. But the company has a strong argument to redirect requests for data of corporate customers based on the Justice Department\u2019s own recommendations.\nIn guidelines released in2017, the Justice Department urged prosecutors to \u201cseek data directly\u201d from companies instead of going through a technology provider, unless doing so was impractical or would compromise the investigation. By going to Google to seize information about the reporters, the Justice Department sought to circumvent The Times. Google declined to say whether it used the Justice Department guidelines to fight the gag order.\nGoogle saidit produced some datain 83 percent of the nearly 40,000 requests for information from U.S. government agencies it received in the first half of 2020. By comparison, it produced some data in 39 percent of requests for information on 398 paying corporate customers of Google Cloud, including its email and web-hosting offerings, during the same time period.\nLaw enforcement requests for data from American tech companies have more than doubled in recent years. Facebooksaid it received nearly 123,000 data requestsfrom the U.S. government last year, up from 37,000 in 2015.\nApple said that in the first half of 2020, it received an average of 400 requests a week for customer data from U.S. law enforcement, more than double the rate five years prior. The company\u2019s compliance rate has remained roughly between 80 percent and 85 percent for years.\nAuthorities are also demanding information about more accounts in each request. In the first half of 2020, each U.S. government subpoena or warrant to Apple requested data for 11 accounts or devices on average, up from less than three accounts or devices in the first half of 2015, the company said.\nApple said that after the government began including more than 100 accounts in some subpoenas, as it did in the leak investigation in 2018, it asked law enforcement to limit requests to 25 accounts each. Police did not always comply, the company said.\nApple has often challenged subpoenas that included so many accounts because they were too broad, said a former senior lawyer for the company, who spoke on the condition of confidentiality. This person said that it would not have been surprising for Apple to challenge the 2018 Justice Department subpoena but that whether a request was challenged often depended on whether a paralegal handling the subpoena elevated it to more senior lawyers.\nCharlie Savagecontributed reporting."

        "title": "The Debate Over Hacking Ransomware Hackers",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department said yesterday that it hadtraced and seizedmuch of the ransom that a major U.S. pipeline operator paid to a Russian hacking collective last month. The ransomware attack shut down the Colonial Pipeline for about a week, prompting fuel shortages and price spikes, until the company paid hackers more than $4 million worth ofBitcoin. But federal officials said that a new F.B.I. task force had recaptured most of the Bitcoins by, in essence, hacking the hackers.\nBitcoin transactions are anonymous but not untraceable.The hackers moved the ransom through dozens of anonymous accounts, which can be tracked on the blockchain, the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Eventually, the funds landed in an account that a federal judge allowed the F.B.I. to break into. According tocourt documents, the feds got the account\u2019s \u201cprivate key,\u201d a crucial password that gives the owner complete control over the funds inside.\nTom Robinson of the blockchain analytics company Elliptic, who has been tracking the ransom payments, wrotein a blog postthatthe account the feds took overappeared to hold the 85 percent share of the ransom that went to the client of DarkSide, the Russian \u201cransomware as a service\u201d hacking group whose software was behind the attack. The remaining 15 percent was funneled through accounts presumably controlled by DarkSide developers.\nIn a way, this could be good for cryptocurrency.A major criticism of crypto is that its anonymity and ease of use make it suitable for crime, like the ransomware attacks that, by some measures,strike every eight minutes. The Justice Department didn\u2019t divulge how it had seized the bulk of the Colonial ransom, but its success shows that it can comb the blockchain and crack into at least some accounts. That\u2019s good for the traceability of cryptocurrency used for crime \u2014 but also goes against the decentralized, privacy-focused, anti-establishment benefits that some see as crypto\u2019s greatest assets.\nFederal officials encouraged companies to work with the F.B.I. when attacked, as Colonial did, to help recoup ransom payments, which are thought to run into the billions of dollars (and are legal and even tax-deductible).\nToday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201dpodcast is about the recent ransomware attacks. In other crypto news, El Salvador\u2019s president wants to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country, and the software company MicroStrategy isborrowing $400 millionto buy more Bitcoin for its balance sheet.\nA deep dive into billionaires\u2019 tax-avoidance strategies.ProPublica obtained detailed I.R.S. data on thetax returns of thousands of wealthy Americans\u2014 including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and how they minimized their tax bills. Jeff Bezos, for instance, paid no income tax in 2007 through a bevy of investments and deductions.\nRegulators may crack down on corporate insiders\u2019 stock-trading plans.The S.E.C.\u2019s chairman, Gary Gensler, said the commission wouldrevise rules governing 10b5-1 arrangements, in which executives schedule future stock sales. The plans are often used as defenses against insider-trading charges but don\u2019t necessarily stop executives from trading on confidential information.\nG7 officials work to ensure that their new tax pact covers Amazon.To counter worries that Amazon could evade the bounds of the agreement to tax profits above a 10 percent margin \u2014 a level the tech giant often doesn\u2019t meet \u2014 negotiators may go afterthe company\u2019s individual businesses. Meanwhile, analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that the agreement\u2019s other pillar, a global minimum tax, would have \u201ca small aggregate impact\u201d on S&P 500 companies\u2019 earnings.\nThe London Metal Exchange\u2019s trading floor will reopen after all.Traders willreturn to the exchange\u2019s open-outcry floor,known as \u201cthe Ring,\u201d in September, after its plan to permanently close the pit drew a backlash. The exchange will instead use a hybrid process of people and electronic trading to establish opening and closing prices each day.\nA big Chinese port is the latest bottleneck for global trade.The partial closure of Yantian International Container Terminals in Shenzhen, amid a Covid-19 outbreak among dockworkers,is putting strainson already embattled supply chains. Vessels have spent as long as five days at port.\nThe F.D.A. yesterday approvedthe first new medicine in nearly two decades for Alzheimer\u2019s, a drug from Biogen called aducanumab. That has spurred a heated debate over whether the move was wise \u2014 and whether the billions of dollars that will gush from the decision are warranted.\nA new medical blockbuster?The drug\u2019s approval will almost surely lead tobillions in profitsfor Biogen \u2014 which plans to charge an average of $56,000 a year per patient, and whose shares jumped 38 percent yesterday \u2014 and the hundreds of clinics that will administer the drug. More than six million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s and would qualify for treatment.\nThat could lead to higher insurance premiums and drive up costs for some who already pay a lot to care for loved ones with Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThis is really what keeps me up at night: A therapy of this cost is going to have enormous implications for everyone,\u201d Dr. Joseph Ross, a pharmaceutical policy expert at Yale, told The Times.\nYet it\u2019s unclear whether the drug actually works.Aducanumab is the first drug to attack the biological underpinnings of Alzheimer\u2019s instead of merely treating its symptoms. But critics of the F.D.A.\u2019s decision say it\u2019s unclear whether the treatment really helps patients, while bearing potentially serious side effects. \u201cScience took a back seat,\u201d Max Nisen of Bloomberg Opinion writes.\n\u2014 Mark Dixon, the chief executive of IWG, a serviced-office company, on a call with analysts. The company has noted \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for flexible office space as businesses adopt hybrid work plans, but IWG held the call to delivera profit warning: The recovery in co-working interest has not translated into sales as quickly as expected, so the company\u2019s 2021 earnings could end up \u201cwell below\u201d the previous year\u2019s.\nApple\u2019s push for more privacy on its devices has struck someas surface-level, in part because it hasput Chinese customers\u2019 data at riskby aiding the government\u2019s censorship efforts there. Butnew privacy featuresannounced at Apple\u2019s annual developer conference yesterday show that it plans to use privacy as a key selling point for its products. They include:\nA report that tells people which data apps are collecting about them, such as information gleaned from the photo album, contacts list or microphone. Google announced a similar feature for Android devices last month.\nA feature in the Mail app that will block marketers\u2019 ability to track whether a person opens an email.\nA service that hides users\u2019 internet traffic from internet providers, similar to a virtual private network, or V.P.N. (This feature would not be available in China, Apple said,for regulatory reasons.)\nNot everyone is a fan of Apple\u2019s privacy policies.In response to a feature the company released in April that allows people to decidewhether they want to be tracked, Facebook, which relies on targeted ads, launched acampaign of its ownimplying that such a feature would hurt small businesses\u2019 ability to find customers.\nApple also announced features not directly related to privacy.It is working to move government identification cards like driver\u2019s licenses onto its devices and to replace physical keys with digital ones. It will also expand FaceTime to web browsers, meaning that people without an Apple device will be able to join FaceTime conversations.\nThe latest news about boardroom diversity is that there\u2019s almost nothing new: Despite mountingpublic pressureto increase the representation of women and people of color in directors\u2019 ranks, progress among Fortune 500 companies is slow. At the current rate of change, it would take decades for the makeup of big company boardrooms to match the demographics of the U.S. population, according toa new reportby the Alliance for Board Diversity and Deloitte.\nThe big picture isn\u2019t pretty, but there are a few bright spots,theIn Her Words Newsletterreports.

        "title": "Why All the Fury at Apple?",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nApple\u2019s annual conference for app makers, whichstarts on Monday, is usually a lovefest. This year it\u2019s going to be awkward.\nSome developers are angrier than ever at Apple\u2019s dictatorship over iPhone apps, accusing the tech giant of imposing unfair costs and complexities on them and iPhone users. Here\u2019s what you need to know about this dispute, whereAppleand the unhappy app makers have a point, and my suggestions for reaching app peace.\nWhy are app makers mad?\nIt boils down to what someappcompanies andlawmakerssay is Apple\u2019s domineering control of iPhone apps.\nSome are angry at what they see as high andcapriciously applied commissionsthat Apple takes when someone subscribes to an online dating service in an app or buys virtual gems in the Clash of Clans game. Apple takes a fee of up to 30 cents per dollar of each sale in an iPhone app. (It recentlycut its commissionto 15 cents per dollar for all but the top-selling apps, although that change affects a fraction of Apple\u2019s app revenue.)\nOther app makers believe Apple unfairlyblocks their appsor puts them ata disadvantageto Apple\u2019s competinginternet services. The complainers could be a vocal minority among the couple million iPhone apps, but it\u2019s an influential one \u2014 includingSpotify,Match Group,Airbnb,Tileand the maker of the Fortnite video game, Epic Games,whose trial against Apple concluded last month.\nDo the complainers have a point?\nYup. Apple has been running itsapp storeusing the same approach since it started it in 2008. That made sense at the time. It might not anymore.\nPeople\u2019s familiarity with apps makes itharder for Apple to justify its restrictions and commissionsas though people couldn\u2019t find apps without the company\u2019s help. Apple also makes increasingly Byzantine rules to keep control over the app store, and they don\u2019t always make sense. Why does Apple want an app to pay it a commission on the e-book edition of a cookbook but not the print version?\nThe big question for us is: What does Apple\u2019s grip on theiPhonecost us, in higher priced apps or newideas that never get off the groundbecause some developers don\u2019t think they can make money underApple\u2019s terms?\nBut Apple is a little right, too.\nApple says that it deserves to be compensated for its role in the app economy. It brings hundreds of millions of potential customers to app makers\u2019 doorsteps, makes it easy for people to buy stuff, and screens apps to make sure they\u2019re safe. (The company\u2019s vetting isdefinitely not foolproof, though.)\nAppleoverstates the value of what it does for app makersand the rest of us, but it is a meaningful contribution.\nWhat\u2019s the solution to app peace?\nI have two suggestions, one mild and another aggressive. I doubt that Apple would do either voluntarily.\nFirst, Apple shouldstop blocking app makers from telling peoplethat they don\u2019t have to buy stuff in the app. For example, YouTube Music\u2019s streaming subscription costs $12.99 a month if purchased in the iPhone app. The same membership costs $9.99 from YouTube Music\u2019s website. (YouTube pays a commission of $3 to Apple, and passes the cost on to us.)\nIf app makers were allowed to link to websites where people could buy subscriptions or digital goods for less, many people still wouldn\u2019t do it because it\u2019s a pain, my colleagueGreg Bensingertold me. But Greg, a New York Times editorial board member, said that it would win Apple a lot of good will. It also would conform more closely to how Google operates its Android app store.\nMy out-there option is to ditch app stores entirely. It is easier and arguably more secure to find, pay for and download apps from a single digital storefront. But I\u2019m no longer sure it\u2019s worth the higher costs and control by app store owners. What if we just downloaded a Tinder or YouTube Music app from the companies\u2019 websites? Or, as I have proposed before, what if there wereno apps at all?\nTip of the Week\nDo you own an Amazon gadget like a Ring camera or an Echo speaker?Brian X. Chen, The Times\u2019s personal technology columnist, has info and advice about a new shared internet network of Amazon device owners.\nStarting on Tuesday, many people who own Amazon devices will be automatically enrolled in a new program that Amazon callsSidewalk. Basically, it allows anyone who is part of this collective to share their internet connection with others nearby. If your neighbor\u2019s Ring internet-connected doorbell camera has a poor internet connection and yours has a strong one, you can share your bandwidth with your neighbor and vice versa.\nAmazon has a detailedexplanation of Sidewalk on its website. Devices that will join Sidewalk are generally newer products, like the third-generation Echo speaker, the Echo Spot smart alarm clock and some Ring cameras that were released in 2019.\nWhile Amazon\u2019s intentions with Sidewalk sound good, security experts have raised concerns because there are many unknowns. What if hackers infiltrate the network and hijack devices? (That has happened before with Ring devices.) Or what if sharing our internet connections violates the terms-of-service agreements we have with our internet providers?\nAmazon haspublished a white paperabout its security measures. Still, being part of Sidewalk makes you an early test subject, and it will be no fun if something goes wrong.\nI\u2019m also not a fan of being automatically enrolled in a data-sharing program, no matter the intent. If this bothers you, too, here are the steps to opt out:\nIf you use an Amazon Alexa product:\nIn the Amazon Alexa app, tap More in the lower right hand corner of the screen.\nTap Settings, then Account Settings, then Amazon Sidewalk.\nToggle Sidewalk to the off position.\nIf you use a Ring product:\nIn the Ring app, tap the three-lined icon in the upper left, and then tap Control Center.\nTap Amazon Sidewalk and slide the button to the off position.\n(If you do not see the Sidewalk options in your settings, it means your device is not compatible with the new program.)\nIndia is the world\u2019s most interesting technology battleground:The billionaire Mukesh Ambani is trying to buy an Indian grocery store chain, and Amazon is fighting to stop it. Aman Sethi writes for The Times that this is emblematic of giant companies\u2019 efforts to useIndia\u2019s stores to build loyalty in online shopping, and the Indian government\u2019s role in shaping that fight.\nHe tried to warn us:My colleague Nicole Perlroth talks to Leon Panetta, the former U.S. secretary of defense, who has been warning for years about America\u2019s vulnerabilities to digital hacking and laments that people, organizations and policymakersstill haven\u2019t changed their behaviordespite crippling cyberattacks. \u201cWhat will it take?\u201d Panetta asks.\nTrump\u2019s voice still carries online:My colleagues have aset of graphicsshowing how some of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s views continue to travel far and wide on social networks even though he has been kicked off Facebook and Twitter. One exception: His false claims about election fraud haven\u2019t spread far.\nFirefighters in Manhattan usedpaint and creativityto keep the fire house tradition of Dalmatian dogs alive.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nI\u2019m going to putAppleand other technology giants on the therapist\u2019s couch: To understand their motivations and actions, it\u2019s helpful to examine their vulnerabilities.\nI\u2019ve been surprised this year thatApplemostly hasn\u2019t budged as regulators and some app companiescomplain loudlyabout thedownsidesof the app system thatApplecreated more than a decade ago. The gripe essentially is thatAppleabuses its control over iPhone apps to impose unfair fees and complexities on app developers. That\u2019s the claim in alawsuitthat Epic Games, the maker of the Fortnite video game, has pending against Apple.\nApplesays that it is right to exercise control over apps and collect commissions for some things that we do on our phones. But there\u2019s also something else at work: fear.\nConnecting the dots between Apple\u2019s business predicaments and its choices helps us understand why the company does what it does \u2014 and by extension how those actions affect everyone, whether we own an Apple device or not. Apple\u2019s strategy bends the world.\nWhy should Apple be worried? It is wildly successful and has so much cash that \u2026 well, corporate employees sit indesk chairsthat might cost more than your sofa. Or your car.\nBut the reality is that sales of smartphones will probably never again have a growth spurt like the one in the 2010s that made Apple a superstar. Smartphones have become a necessity of modern life in many countries,like refrigerators, but there are fewer potential first-time smartphone buyers every year, and people are waiting longer to replace phones they already own.\n(I\u2019ll acknowledge that Applehas sold a bunch more iPhones and other devices recently. We\u2019ll see if that\u2019s lasting, or a pandemic-related blip.)\nApple and lots of people who keep tabs on the company don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem if Apple has a harder time selling more iPhones each year. Instead, the company has shifted its strategy to make more money from the gadgets that we have in our homes and pockets \u2014 in the form of app downloads, subscriptions like Apple Music, AirPods headphones and other Apple products or services connected to company devices.\nIt\u2019s a smart strategy that\u2019s working very well, but also one born of necessity now that the peak smartphone era seems to be over.\nThere\u2019s also a long shadow cast by Apple\u2019s need to become more than the iPhone company. Would Apple, for example, be more willing to reconsider aspects of the app store if it weren\u2019t so reliant on generating money from sources other than iPhone sales? And how much are Apple\u2019s tactics changing all of the technology that we use?\nThe Vox writer Peter Kafka recently wrote that Facebook decided tostart newslettersthat people readoutsideof Facebook\u2019s apps in part to avoid paying the fees that Apple demands from digital subscriptions sold inside its iPhone apps. The billions of people who use Facebook are affected by Apple\u2019s strategy to squeeze more cash from apps.\nCompanies have also said thatthey felt forced to charge people money in their iPhone appsbecause of Apple\u2019s rules. In short, those apps might be worse for users, because of Apple\u2019s strategy shift.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the world around us to beshaped by companies\u2019 business models and finances. And sometimes it works in our favor. Microsoft is giving Windows PCusers access to more kinds of appspartly because it \u2014 unlike Apple \u2014 doesn\u2019t need to make money from app fees, and Microsoft wants to thumb its nose at Apple.\nWe aren\u2019t completely at the whims of big companies\u2019 tactics to make money. But I find it useful to examine the ways that our technology choices are not accidents, nor are they purely driven by what we want.\nA win for Facebook in a likely long war:A federal judge said that a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that wants to break up Facebooklacked too many essential facts to move ahead. The judge told the government to try providing evidence that Facebook meets the legal definition of a monopoly, Cecilia Kang reported. DealBook has ananalysis of the opinionfrom the judge, who also said that more than 40 states had waited too long to bring their own antitrust case.\nRelated:All of the antitrust investigations and lawsuits against Big Tech companies areterrific for lawyers, Cecilia and David McCabe write. One example: 51 lawyers from 21 law firms have appeared in court related to antitrust cases against Google.\nLife is just fodder for online posts:Residents in a rural county in China dress up as old-style farmers and fishermento stage scenes of a bygone Chinafor local and foreign tourists to photograph and post online, my colleague Vivian Wang writes. The setups are elaborate, including burning straw to simulate mist.\nRobot pets are meh but also promising:\u201cThey could become sophisticated enough to become their own category of thing \u2014not a living pet necessarily, but not a glorified toaster either,\u201d says a writer for Gizmodo.\nThis is amesmerizing video of a herd of sheep, recorded from a drone over several months and sped up.
