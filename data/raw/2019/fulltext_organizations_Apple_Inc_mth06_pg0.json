        "title": "A Farewell for iTunes",
        "fulltext": "Dearly beloved,\nWe are gathered here today to say goodbye to our friend iTunes, who went to the great trash can in the sky on Monday.\nIt was a gentle, dignified passing. ITunes was surrounded by family and friends at Apple\u2019sannual developer conferencewhen Apple executives announced that it would be dismantled, and its features would be split among three apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.\nITunes entered this world18 years agoas a \u201cdigital jukebox\u201d that let users import their favorite CDs, organize their libraries and burn custom mixes. It then became a music store of its own \u2014 a magical, one-click emporium where 99 cents could get you almost any song under the sun. Steve Jobs heralded its birth as the dawn of a new age of media consumption, one in which consumers would own the digital rights to their own music.\n\u201cWe think people want to buy their music on the internet by buying downloads, just like they bought LPs, just like they bought cassettes, just like they bought CDs,\u201d hesaidin a 2003 talk.\n[Highlights from Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference: $6,000 Macs and more.]\nAt the time, iTunes represented an ambitious attempt to wrest control of digital music back from Napster and other bootleg file-sharing services, which were causing havoc in the music industry. Apple was betting that people would pay for music if it was legal, cheap and easy.\nThe fact that many popular Windows file-sharing apps were ridden with bugs and malware didn\u2019t hurt. Mr. Jobs joked that giving Windows users access to iTunes\u2019s clean interface was \u201clike giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell.\u201d\nI first met iTunes back in high school. I was a music nerd and a cheapskate, and I had amassed a library of tens of thousands of MP3s, most of them downloaded illegally from services like Napster and Limewire. I imported those songs into iTunes, and spent untold hundreds of hours naming, categorizing and arranging them into a pristine music collection that would have made the librarians of ancient Alexandria jealous.\nI swore I would never pay for music again, but a few years later, Apple won me over with its reliable file quality, speedy downloads and ability to sync music across devices. ITunes was simple and elegant, and it assuaged my fear of going to jail for music piracy. Within a few years, Napster had been sued out of existence, and I was getting most of my music from a company that, just a few years earlier, had been known for selling candy-colored computers.\nIn the commercial internet\u2019s early days, it was acommon refrainamong techies that \u201cinformation wants to be free,\u201d and many assumed that people would never buy content that they could get without paying, even if it required little effort.\nITunes and its 99-cent songs proved those people wrong, and created an entirely new business model for digital media. That breakthrough not only saved the music industry \u2014 it may have saved the film, TV and book publishing industries, too.\nI\u2019ve come to think of iTunes as a core piece of what I call the Middle Internet \u2014 the period between the Wild West days of Napster and the hyper-centralized era of Facebook and YouTube.\nIt was an era of clean, well-lit marketplaces where people could buy things to listen to, without worrying about buffering or corrupted files. It filled an important technological gap in the period when lots of people had internet access, but few people had smartphones with data plans capable of streaming high-quality media on demand.\nAnd it was a time when people actively curated their own online media, rather than having it algorithmically spoon-fed to them.\nBut nothing gold can stay. And in the early part of this decade, subscription music services like Spotify and Pandora, which offered an all-you-can-eat bacchanal of music for a monthly subscription fee, began to eat away at Apple\u2019s advantage.\nUltimately, Mr. Jobs\u2019s prophecy was wrong. People wanted to rent access to a centralized streaming library, not pay a small fee to own every song. As streaming services grew, sales of music downloads plummeted. According to theRecording Industry Association of America, downloads now make up a smaller percentage of recording sales than physical albums \u2014 a twist Mr. Jobs could never have seen coming.\nIn 2015, Apple tried to rescue iTunes by bolting on its own streaming service, Apple Music. But the idea was doomed from the outset. People couldn\u2019t figure out the new, Frankensteinian hybrid. Which of their songs were hosted in the cloud? Why did they need to re-enter their Apple ID every time they wanted to play an album? Where were their downloads going? Marco Arment, a longtime Apple blogger,callediTunes a \u201ctoxic hellstew.\u201d\nSince we\u2019re among friends, I can be candid: ITunes didn\u2019t age well. In recent years, it had become abloated, buggy nightmare. Apple crammed more and more into iTunes \u2014 movies, TV shows, podcasts \u2014 until the whole thing was slow and confusing.\nMy encounters with the program were increasingly maddening: I\u2019d open an audio file in iTunes by mistake, wait three minutes for it to load, and have to force-quit the app in frustration. (And don\u2019t even get me started onthe time iTunes forced a U2 album on millions of unsuspecting people\u2014 midlife crisis doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.)\nBut let\u2019s not remember iTunes as the mess it became. Instead, let\u2019s remember it as it once was: a revolutionary product that transformed the music industry, ushered in a new model of digital ownership and tamed a messy, chaotic part of the internet by building something simple and elegant to replace it.\nMy 15-year-old self, drunk on freedom and awash in pirated MP3s, might have cheered the demise of a corporate-controlled music clearinghouse. But my current self gets a little wistful watching an icon of the old internet pass into obsolescence, and knowing that the iTunes library I spent all those hours perfecting is collecting dust on a hard drive somewhere in my closet, another casualty of progress."

        "title": "Elizabeth Warren Sticks Her Message in Big Tech\u2019s Face",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A threat of government regulation is casting a shadow over the tech industry. Now there is a billboard to remind tech workers about it on their commutes.\nIn all capital letters, on a black background, the sign reads: \u201cBreak Up Big Tech.\u201d\nThe billboard, paid for by Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign, greets commuters as they walk toward the city\u2019s main Caltrain station, the transit hub that connects San Francisco to the big tech firms in Silicon Valley. The train stops in Menlo Park (home to Facebook), Mountain View (home to Google) and Sunnyvale (near Apple\u2019s headquarters).\nThe appetite among politicians and regulators to break up tech giants is growing. On Friday, news broke that the Justice Departmentis exploring opening an investigation into Google for potential antitrust violations. The Federal Trade Commission is taking a look at Amazon. And it\u2019s not just politicians thinking about this: In May, a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, wrote an essay titled \u201cIt\u2019s time to break up Facebook.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking for years about how Big Tech has too much power over our economy and our democracy,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in an email to The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep making the case for my plan to break up Big Tech and put power back in the hands of the American people \u2014 whether it\u2019s at SXSW, a town hall in Iowa or a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley.\u201d\nWhile San Francisco is not exactly the heart of Silicon Valley \u2014 that would be about 20 miles south on the Caltrain line \u2014 her billboard, which went up on Wednesday, is above a lot of tech workers. And many are not thrilled with it.\nA good portion of the people at that San Francisco intersection during the rush were drawn here by the tech industry. They are here to work for one of the big companies (most of the firms also have large offices in San Francisco), or for a start-up, or they are lawyers for tech, or doing market research for tech, or they run pizza shops for tech workers.\nThough the economic windfall has helped exacerbate what some residents and officials say is growing inequality, others who have found a niche in town are wary of messing with success.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single person here who doesn\u2019t benefit from these companies,\u201d said Tony Riviera, 61, who owns a few restaurants around San Francisco, including the nearby Slices Pizzeria. \u201cThese guys are out working hard, making good money and spending good money, and if it weren\u2019t for tech this city would be dead.\u201d\nHe said the senator had \u201cbought some bad placement.\u201d He added that he had some food-tech ideas.\nSome worried about the unintended consequences of cracking down on tech\u2019s biggest companies.\n\u201cAny damage to the big companies would damage the whole economy,\u201d said Yesh Devabhaktuni, 25, who works as a software engineer for Walmart Labs. \u201cThe small companies need the big companies.\u201d\nOthers moved here from around the world to work in the industry.\n\u201cTech giants are where innovation is happening, and they offer a lot of jobs,\u201d said Fred Ren, 27, a software engineer who immigrated from Canada. \u201cI came here for that.\u201d\nAnd some scoffed at the idea that start-ups could no longer compete.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always opportunities for more start-ups,\u201d said Edmund Park, 28, a data scientist for a market research firm.\nThe fire alarm technician walking by did not like it, either.\n\u201c\u2018Big Tech\u2019 is a big generalization,\u201d said Rick DeRushia, 58.\nEven a tech worker whose project was blocked by Google argued against breaking up the tech giants. Michael Plasmeier, 28, a product manager, had once worked on a home screen competitor that he says Google squeezed out.\n\u201cThat product ended up not going anywhere, and, yeah, it was frustrating,\u201d Mr. Plasmeier said, adding that he still did not want to see the companies broken up. He said that because big tech firms often bought struggling start-ups, they played a vital role keeping the region\u2019s innovation machine going.\nChuck Conlon, 44, who works as a sales and design consultant at HD Buttercup, the high-end furniture store the billboard is attached to, suggested the message might have more fans in a different part of the city. The Caltrain station is in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood, home to scores of tech start-ups.\n\u201cThis is an odd area to put it \u2014 the whole area\u2019s all tech,\u201d Mr. Conlon said. \u201cBut I guess she knew that?\u201d\nBut one of his colleagues, Megan Schmitz, 28, was enthusiastic about the message.\n\u201cWhat a badass,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it.\u201d\nWith the headlines seemingly always negative, some rank-and-file workers in the tech industry believe they are being unfairly demonized.\nLaura Grantham, 48, an engineering recruiter at the file-hosting service Dropbox, said that she was a fan of the senator but that the message was alienating.\n\u201cI know why she\u2019s saying that, but I feel like if you just only saw that billboard you\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, wow, Elizabeth Warren really hates us,\u2019\u201d Ms. Grantham said.\nBut others recognized points in American history when the federal government intervened to break up powerful companies.\n\u201cOut here, people write this rhetoric off as absurd, that it\u2019s never going to happen, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re ignoring history,\u201d said Collins Belton, 28, a lawyer at the tech law firm Atrium. \u201cThe oil barons did the same thing.\u201d\nThis is not Ms. Warren\u2019s first time going straight to tech people to say tech is too powerful. In March, she detailed her argument to the audience of South by Southwest, or SXSW, a technology and music festival in Texas.\n\u201cYou can be an umpire or you can own teams,\u201dMs. Warren said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game.\u201d\nOn Saturday, while she was in town for the state\u2019s Democratic convention, Ms. Warren visited the billboard. Shetook a selfie underneath it."

Her plan also calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace.\nHer plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, including Facebook\u2019s deals forWhatsAppandInstagram,Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, and Google\u2019s purchase of Waze.\nThe policy further cements Ms. Warren as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes in the name of equality.\nMs. Warren hastaken her fight directly to Silicon Valley. A billboard installed in San Francisco, paid for by her campaign, reads: \u201cBreak Up Big Tech.\u201d\nThe tech companies Ms. Warren has called out grew the way they did because, well, they wanted to. Officials at top tech companies have previously signaled that they believe they can police themselves, and they are highly unlikely to accept any sort of government regulation without a costly and bruising fight.\nIt is also unclear how popular Ms. Warren\u2019s antitrust proposal is with voters, many of whom have come to enjoy and rely on the services offered by big tech."

        "title": "Taiwan\u2019s iPhone Tycoon Walks a Fraught U.S.-China Line in His Presidential Run",
        "fulltext": "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Like other presidential hopefuls in Taiwan, Terry Gou has spent the past few weeks working on his public image bycarrying toddlers,wrapping dumplingsandhelping farmers.\nUnlike the other candidates, he is a billionaire, the chairman of Foxconn, a major Apple supplier that operates vast factories in China. He has also pressed the flesh with President Trump, who told him,Mr. Gou says, that being president is a \u201ctough job.\u201d\nShould Mr. Gou become Taiwan\u2019s president, Mr. Trump would have a lot of say over what might be the toughest part of his job: striking a delicate balance between the interests of the United States and China, especially as the two giants fight a bruising trade war.\nOn Friday, Mr. Gou handed over the reins of his sprawling electronics manufacturing empire to a new Foxconn operating committee to address potential conflicts of interest as he runs for president. He built Foxconn and amassed a personal fortune of $7 billion by skillfully straddling the gap between China and the United States. For years Foxconn has assembled the iPhone in China, helping to make Apple what it is today and becoming China\u2019s biggest private-sector employer at the same time.\nShould he become Taiwan\u2019s president, he will have to strike that balance on an even bigger scale.Mr. Gou has saidTaiwan must tread carefully to avoid being trampled in the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington, especially as the United States hasstepped up its support for Taiwanas a counterweight to China\u2019s growing dominance in the region.\n\u201cIf we are too optimistic and biased toward either side,\u201d Mr. Gou wrote in a recent Facebook post, \u201cit will push Taiwan to an unpredictable danger.\u201d\nWhat has been good for business might not be good for Mr. Gou\u2019s political prospects in Taiwan, which is wary of China\u2019s influence. Mr. Gou has cultivated good ties with Communist leaders for decades and has met Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, several times. His business\u2019s dependence on China is seen as offering Beijing leverage over him. Critics have questioned whether he would put Taiwan\u2019s interests first when handling cross-strait matters.\nMr. Gou has moved to try to address those concerns. In addition to handing over management of the company, he has suggested that Foxconn could move some of its production lines from the Chinese cities of Tianjin and Shenzhen to the city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan.\nEven if Foxconn does relocate parts of the company from China to Taiwan, it will not amount to a decoupling from the Chinese market, said Lauren Dickey, an expert on China-Taiwan relations at CNA, a research firm in Arlington, Va. \u201cThe question, then, is whether these linkages become political risks or liabilities,\u201d Ms. Dickey said.\nSome voters who seek a stronger economy might find an appealing candidate in a billionaire businessman who runs a company with hundreds of thousands of employees and has repeatedly won tax benefits and land grants in his negotiations with local Chinese officials. Mr. Gou founded the company in Taiwan in 1974, initially producing components for black-and-white televisions and Atari joysticks. He opened the company\u2019s first facility in China in 1988, in the southern city of Shenzhen, and later expanded its operations to central and northern China.\nBut Mr. Gou\u2019s business brought jobs to China, not Taiwan. While doing so, Foxconn has come underheavy scrutiny over its employment practices. In 2010 it was hit bya wave of employee suicides, and in 2012 it admitted to hiring workers as young as 14. And as one analyst sees it, despite having a reputation for being a shrewd businessman, Mr. Gou is not known for delivering value to shareholders.\n\u201cTerry Gou has been a ruthless exploiter of local labor, tax breaks, and repeatedly floated fresh stakes in new companies to create equity value,\u201d said Richard Kramer, a founder of the London-based technology research firm Arete. \u201cBut these stocks have consistently underperformed the market.\u201d Foxconn representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nBusiness aside, many other voters are concerned about the question of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and how the island\u2019s leadership should manage China\u2019s overtures and threats. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, but the majority of people in Taiwan want to retain de facto independence.\nMr. Gou is competing to be the presidential candidate for the opposition Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, which once ruled China and fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Chinese Communist Party. If he wins the primary, he will run against Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, who belongs to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and is seeking re-election in January\u2019s presidential vote.\nThe Kuomintang maintains that the government it installed in Taiwan is the rightful ruler of both China and Taiwan. Mr. Gou shares that view and has said he wants to improve Taiwan\u2019s relations with Beijing, which have deteriorated during Ms. Tsai\u2019s presidency. In recent months, however, Mr. Gou has struck a firmer tone with China, urging Beijing to recognize the existence of the island\u2019s government. (A Chinese government spokesmanpolitely rejectedMr. Gou\u2019s statements.)\nMs. Tsai, despite pressure from Beijing, has refused to state that Taiwan and China are both part of the same country. Ties between Ms. Tsai\u2019s administration and Beijing have been tense after the ruling Communist Party in China cut off communications with her over the issue. Beijing has used military, diplomatic and economic measures to intimidate Taiwan and isolate it from the global stage. Ms. Tsai has responded in part by building a closer relationship with the Trump administration.\nZhu Songling, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said that, if elected in January, Mr. Gou could re-energize ties across the Taiwan Strait.\nFor all his friendliness with Mr. Trump, Mr. Gou has also asserted that relying on Washington for the island\u2019s national defense is an unreliable strategy. In April he questioned the need for Taiwan to buy weapons from the United States. Taiwan\u2019s military is currently waiting for approval from Washington for two major arms purchase requests: a $13 billion order including 66 F-16 jets, and a$2 billion orderof tanks and other equipment.\nChina welcomes Mr. Gou\u2019s skepticism over the arms sales, Mr. Zhu said.\n\u201cIf Gou uses the businessman mind-set practice in politics,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, \u201che may bring changes to cross-strait relations and the U.S.-China-Taiwan trilateral relationship, and bring some new ideas.\u201d\nMr. Gou still must secure the Kuomintang nomination in July. His main competitors in the primary areHan Kuo-yu, the popular mayor of Kaohsiung, who is regarded as Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate, and Eric Chu, the former mayor of New Taipei City.\nMr. Gou\u2019s similarities with Mr. Trump \u2014 his fondness for baseball caps and his forceful and unpredictable style \u2014 might appeal to voters who appreciate the American leader\u2019s support for the island democracy.\nThe day that Mr. Gou met Mr. Trump at the White House in early May, he reassured Mr. Trump that a multibillion-dollar, taxpayer-subsidized factory in Wisconsin was on track. Yet the company is reportedly building a factory that isdifferent from the contractit signed with the state, and might not create as many jobs as he had promised. Wisconsin taxpayers have already footed the bill for hundreds of millions of dollars in land and infrastructure for the project. Foxconn has said it still plans to move forward with the project and will make a variety of products there.\nAfter his meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Gou posted photos of baseball caps he gave to Mr. Trump featuring the flags of the United States and Taiwan, and the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 The circular building housing Apple\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley is so big, it\u2019s nearly a mile in circumference. So it\u2019s hard to fathom that it is not actually attached to the ground.\nThe spaceship, as the building is often called, is a mammoth example of a technology that reduces earthquake shaking by as much as 80 percent.\nWhile other buildings in Silicon Valley are likely to suffer damage and be nonfunctional for days, if not months, after an earthquake, Apple\u2019s headquarters, which were completed early last year, are designed to be usable immediately after the Big One.\nThe building is one of a relatively small number in the United States that use so-called base-isolation technology.We explore the system in an article here.\nJim Wilson, the San Francisco bureau photographer, and I were the first journalists to descend into the basement and tour the building\u2019s protective seismic system.\nMore than 9,000 engineers and other Apple employees work in the building, which has its own electricity supply and a vast atrium with a variety of fruit trees, including, perhaps not surprisingly, many varieties of apple.\nTwo stories underground, beneath offices where engineers design iPhones and MacBooks, the building rests on 692 huge stainless steel saucers. When the ground shakes, the building can shift as much as four feet in any direction on the saucers. Picture an ice cube on a plate. If you shake the plate back and forth, the ice cube slides to stay nearly stationary.\nSteel saucers\nBUILDING FLOOR\nSection of a triple friction pendulum isolator\nFOUNDATION\nPart of\nbuilding\nshown\nGround motion\nBUILDING\nSection of a triple friction\npendulum isolator\nSteel saucers\nFOUNDATION\nPart of\nbuilding\nshown\nGround motion\nSection of a triple\nfriction pendulum isolator\nSteel saucers\nBUILDING FLOOR\nFOUNDATION\nPart of\nbuilding\nshown\nGround motion\nThe New York Times\nJony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said in an interview that he and Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who died in 2011, considered base isolation essential protection for the headquarters \u2014 and the brain trust that resides within. (Mr. Ive also spent four years renovating his house in San Francisco to make it more resilient to earthquakes.)\nMr. Jobs was greatly inspired by Japanese engineering, including the ways buildings were designed in Japan to prevent earthquake damage, Mr. Ive said.\nRoughly 9,000 buildings in Japan use a variant of base isolation. In the United States, the Apple building is one of only around 175 buildings that use the technology.\nParadoxically, the specific base-isolation system that Apple uses was designed and manufactured a short drive away \u2014 on the other side of the San Francisco Bay at a company called Earthquake Protection Systems. Most of what the company produces is exported to earthquake prone countries such as Turkey, Peru and Ecuador. Very few American companies use any earthquake mitigation technology for their buildings.\n[At Risk in a Big Quake: 39 of San Francisco\u2019s Top High Rises]\nApple\u2019s headquarters, purposefully nestled amid trees and meadows, stand in contrast to the unremarkable architecture that is the hallmark of Silicon Valley.\nAt stake is whether places like Silicon Valley, Seattle, Salt Lake City, San Francisco or Los Angeles might be forced to shut down after a direct hit.\nEvan Reis, a structural engineer who works in Silicon Valley, says the area has thousands of cheaply built structures known as \u201ctilt-ups\u201d that are known to be vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake. Both workers and executives are often unaware that their buildings are dangerous, he said.\n\u201cA lot of Silicon Valley companies, whether they are start-ups or established companies, are in buildings from the 1970s and 1980s that don\u2019t meet current code requirements,\u201d Mr. Reis said.\nMr. Reis is a co-founder of the U.S. Resiliency Council, a nonprofit organization founded to spread the message that even buildings constructed to code can be badly damaged in earthquakes.\nYet even if all companies in Silicon Valley had buildings as robust as Apple\u2019s, it would not make the region earthquake-proof. Roads, mass transit, electricity, water and telecommunications systems, not to mention the homes of employees, are all likely to be damaged by a big earthquake.\n[San Francisco\u2019s Big Seismic Gamble]\nAnd base-isolation devices have their limits, too. Thomas H. Heaton, the director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, warns that a big enough quake could theoretically throw a building off its steel saucers.\nThe technology has proved its effectiveness in earthquakes in Japan and Latin America, but engineers say a direct hit to a modern American city would be the ultimate determinant of resilience.\n\u201cWhen base isolation works well, it works very well,\u201d Dr. Heaton said. \u201cBut since we haven\u2019t had a real earthquake to test anything, someday we are going to have a giant experiment.\u201d"

        "title": "That Sleep Tracker Could Make Your Insomnia Worse",
        "fulltext": "Are you sabotaging your sleep in your quest to improve it?\nMany new tools are becoming available to monitor your sleep or help you achieve better sleep: wearable watches and bands; \u201cnearable\u201d devices that you can place on your bed or nightstand; and apps that work by monitoring biometric data, noise and movement. They can remind you to start winding down, or generate a report on your night\u2019s slumber.\nBut some sleep specialists caution that these apps and devices may provide inaccurate data and can even exacerbate symptoms of insomnia. Fiddling with your phone in bed, after all, is badsleep hygiene. And for some, worrying about sleep goals can make bedtime anxiety even worse.\nThere\u2019s a name for an unhealthy obsession with achieving perfect sleep: orthosomnia. It was coined by researchers from Rush University Medical School and Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine ina 2017 case study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\nDr. Kelly Baron, one of the paper\u2019s authors and the director of the University of Utah\u2019s behavioral sleep medicine program, said that sleep trackers can be helpful in identifying patterns. She herself tracks her bedtime with a Fitbit. But she said she had noticed a trend of patients complaining based on unverified scores, even for things like the amount of deep sleep, which varies by individual.\n\u201cPeople were putting a lot of stock in what it was telling them,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, \u2018I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not getting enough deep sleep. There\u2019s something wrong with me.\u2019\u201d\nThe flood of data and buzzwords can easily become confusing: sleep debt percentages, heart rate dips, sleep rhythms, graphs of sleep disruption and comparisons to other users.\n[Wirecutter tried four popular sleep tracking apps. Read the findings here.]\nDr. Seema Khosla, medical director of the North Dakota Center for Sleep and chairwoman of the technology committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, said she and other clinicians had scrambled to stay abreast of all the devices and apps on the market. She appreciates the greater awareness the new sleep tech promotes, but is wary of the pitfalls of inaccurate data and increased worrying.\n\u201cWe want to partner with our patients to improve their sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cThis means that we need to understand sleep technology \u2014 including its limitations \u2014 without dismissing this potentially valuable resource.\u201d\nIn the case study on orthosomnia, researchers found that patients had been spending excessive time in bed to try to increase their sleep numbers, which may have made their insomnia worse. And they found it difficult to persuade patients to stop relying on their sleep trackers, even if the numbers had been flawed.\nResearchers say that trackers can overestimate the amount of sleep that you get, particularly if they focus on tracking movement. If you are lying awake in bed, the tracker might think that you\u2019re asleep. While devices that track heart rate or breathing give a more complete picture, they are still only generating estimates.\nOne cautionary tale from the case study: A woman came in reporting that she had an average sleep efficiency of only 60 percent, according to her tracker. She was given medication for restless leg syndrome, tested negative for disordered breathing and underwent a formal sleep study. But after being told that she had slept deeply in the lab, she was not reassured.\n\u201cThen why does my Fitbit say I am sleeping poorly?\u201d she asked.\nThe makers of tracking devices and apps defend their use and accuracy. Dr. Conor Heneghan, a research director for Fitbit, said that few people experience extreme sleep anxiety.\nHe said tracking sleep can drive home the importance of a consistent bedtime and wake time. It also can underscore the effects that factors like alcohol and exercise can have on sleep patterns.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is give people a tool to understand their own sleep health,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the bands can provide reliable estimates based on algorithms that the company had developed using machine learning in sleep laboratories. The trackers can also recognize the heart rate and movement patterns associated with various stages of sleep, he said.\nHow do you become a more successful sleeper? Grab a pillow, curl up and keep reading to find out.\nA company-supported study in 2017 compared the sleep data of 60 people, using both Fitbits and medical-grade monitoring equipment in a sleep laboratory. It found that the data matched 70 percent of the time, he said. Dr. Heneghan said that when two human analysts are asked to score the same sleep study, they typically match about 90 percent of the time.\nUsers of devices like Apple\u2019s smart watch have noticed something similar, with different apps giving different scores on the same night. Apple says that its watch tracks heart rate and motion data. The app makers are responsible for the algorithms that interpret them. \u201cEach experience is unique to that app,\u201d the company said.\nDr. Eugene Spiritus, chief executive ofSleepWatch, an app that pairs with the Apple Watch, said that his company\u2019s focus was on getting users to pay attention to their behavior and change it. If you sleep poorly, the app will send a prompt asking what might have gone wrong. A late meal? Too much coffee? Too much to drink? Skipped the gym?\n\u201cCan some people become obsessed with this and have anxiety?\u201d he said. \u201cSure. But there are many, many people telling us it helps them.\u201d\nDr. Roy Raymann, vice president of sleep science and scientific affairs atSleepScoreLabs, said the company had focused on its apps and a \u201cnearable\u201d device because some people had found it uncomfortable to sleep with a gadget on their wrists. The products monitor breathing and movement using radio and sonar waves, and offer a \u201csmart alarm\u201d feature that avoids waking the user from deep sleep, which can feel more jarring.\nHe noted that there had been some discussion within the industry about the need to standardize accuracy ratings.\nBut no matter how accurate a sleep tracker is, he said, it is only a tracker. It cannot by itself improve sleep. He made an analogy to a bathroom scale: \u201cIf you stand on it every day, it will not make you lose weight.\u201d\nThe Food and Drug Administration does not regulate sleep trackers because they arelow-risk devicesthat only make general claims about improving health and well-being rather than diagnosing or treating particular conditions.\nHealth experts say that getting enough sleep on a regular basis is crucial: It can help you think clearly, avoid colds and other illnesses, and maintain a healthy weight, among other benefits. Chronic insomniahas been linkedto an increased risk of dying prematurely, having heart attacks, and developing hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, depression and anxiety.\nWhile sleep needs vary by individual, the National Sleep Foundationrecommendsthat adults up to age 64 get seven to nine hours a night; younger people need much more.\nDr. Khosla said that she had seen patients with trackers neglect the basics of sleep hygiene, like following a regular schedule and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n\u201cPeople will shell out 200 bucks for some sleep device, but we\u2019re not willing to just shut off our phones and go to bed,\u201d she said.\nSleep trackers have a low-tech predecessor: sleep diaries. Both can be helpful to reduce anxiety by reducing \u201ccatastrophic thinking,\u201d such as the notion that the day will definitely be ruined if you\u2019re only running on, say, six hours of sleep. Dr. Khosla said she counseled patients to let go of the unrealistic notion that they must strive for \u201cperfect\u201d sleep.\nDr. Hawley Montgomery-Downs, a professor of psychology at West Virginia University who has researched the limitations of sleep-tracking devices, believes the best way to assess your sleep quantity and quality is based on how your body feels.\nShe recommended avoiding sleep trackers altogether. Her advice? Find a week when you don\u2019t have to get up at a certain time \u2014 on vacation, perhaps \u2014 and turn off your alarm. You\u2019ll sleep a lot at first, but within a few days, she said, your body will adjust and let you know when to go to bed and wake, and how much nightly sleep you truly need.\n\u201cTrust that,\u201d she said, \u201cinstead of the device.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple to Manufacture New Mac Pro Computer in China Instead of U.S.",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple will manufacture a new version of its Mac Pro computer in China, shifting production of the only major product the company has assembled in the United States outside the country, a person familiar with the plans said on Friday.\nThe move, reported on Friday byThe Wall Street Journal, was revealed amid heightened trade tensions with China. The person familiar with Apple\u2019s plans was not authorized to discuss them publicly.\nThe Mac Pro, a high-end desktop computer that sells for $6,000, accounts for a small portion of Apple\u2019s sales, but it is a rare example of an American technology company\u2019s attempt to do more manufacturing in the United States.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook,went on prime-time televisionin 2012 to announce that the company would make a Mac computer in the United States, the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers. The top-of-the-line Mac Pro, built in a facility in Austin, Tex., would come with the inscription \u201cAssembled in USA,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nThe production of high-tech products is a key element of the current trade dispute between the United States and China. The fight has put Apple, in particular, in an awkward position because China is also one of the biggest markets for products like its iPhone.\nThe manufacturing shift away from Texas could anger President Trump, who has pressed Apple to move more of its production to the United States.\nMr. Trump, who was scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping of China on Saturday at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, said during the 2016 campaign, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201d\nApple said in a statement that assembly was just one step in a broad production process that created jobs in a number of countries. The company said it had worked with factories in 30 states and had spent $60 billion with over 9,000 suppliers across the United States last year.\n\u201cLike all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFinal assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.\u201d\nThe Mac Pro has been a slow seller, and Apple had not updated it since introducing it in 2013.\nIn December, Apple announced that it wouldadd up to 15,000 workers in Austin, just miles from the Mac Pro plant. None of the new jobs are expected to be in manufacturing.\nApple, like most big-name computer makers, typically designs its products in the United States, where some of its parts are made as well. In most cases, though, the final assembly is done in places like China, where manufacturing costs are significantly lower.\nAfter saying it would build the Mac Pro in the United States, Apple encountered a range of problems in trying to do so at the Texas plant. Among other issues, Apple struggled to find companies that could produce some of the parts needed for the computers.\nMr. Cook helped lead Apple\u2019s shift to foreign manufacturing before becoming chief executive. The move cut costs and helped provide the company the enormous scale it needed to produce some of the best-selling tech devices ever.\nMuch of the work was done under contract in enormous factories in China, someof them stretching for miles and employing hundreds of thousands of peopleto assemble, test and package Apple\u2019s products. The assembly includes parts made around the world.\nWhile facing pressure from the Trump administration to move manufacturing operations to the United States, Apple has also faced pressure from shareholders as its sales have slowed.\nIn January, Apple missed earnings expectations for the first time in 16 years, mostly because of sluggish iPhone sales in China. When the company announced its latest quarterly earnings in April, its profits were down 16.4 percent from a year earlier.\nIn May, the Trump administration threatened to impose a 25 percent import tax on almost all consumer goods imported from China if the two countries did not resolve their differences. Tariff concerns have prompted Apple to consider other countries, but not the United States, for its manufacturing."

        "title": "Facebook Under Oath: You Have No Expectation of Privacy",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of a limited-run newsletter. You cansign up here.\nIn a San Francisco courtroom a few weeks ago, Facebook\u2019s lawyers said the quiet part out loud: Users have no reasonable expectation of privacy.\nThe admission came from Orin Snyder, a lawyer representing Facebook in a litigation stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a court transcript, first surfaced byLaw360and later uploaded in full by Sam Biddle atThe Intercept, Snyder and U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria debate what has become an existential platform question: Does posting, even to a small group of friends, on social media mean that a user is forfeiting all expectation of privacy? Yes, Facebook argues:\nThere is no privacy interest, because by sharing with a hundred friends on a social media platform, which is an affirmative social act to publish, to disclose, to share ostensibly private information with a hundred people, you have just, under centuries of common law, under the judgment of Congress, under the SCA, negated any reasonable expectation of privacy.\nThe judge pushed back, suggesting that if a user had painstakingly tweaked her privacy settings so that only a tight-knit group could see her posts, it would be a privacy violation if \u201cFacebook actually disseminated the photographs and the likes and the posts to hundreds of companies.\u201d But Snyder didn\u2019t budge, suggesting that sharing any information with even one human being negates an expectation of privacy.\nTheentire transcript is worth a read, but this rebuttal from Judge Chhabria set up what I think might be one of the most revealing exchanges with a tech company representative in recent memory:\nChhabria:You seem to be treating [privacy] as a binary thing, like either you have a full expectation of privacy or you have no expectation of privacy at all. And I don\u2019t understand why we should think of it in that way.\nSnyder:Because, Your Honor, what the plaintiffs are doing here and what Your Honor\u2019s hypothetical suggests is a brand-new right of privacy that has never been recognized before.\nA generous reading of Synder\u2019s response is that Facebook\u2019s hands are tied by the legal understanding of privacy. But I\u2019d argue that Facebook is hiding behind an antiquated definition of the word. Other industry observers have noticed this recently, too. In a blog post last week,Maciej Ceglowski suggestedthat the reason companies like Google and Facebook have taken pro-privacy positions lately is they\u2019re not talking about the status quo but, instead, about this outdated definition of privacy. \u201cThat language, especially as it is codified in law, is not adequate for the new reality of ubiquitous, mechanized surveillance,\u201d Ceglowski wrote.\nCeglowski offered up a different definition, which he calls \u201cambient privacy.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s \u201cthe understanding that there is value in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered.\u201d\nThere is no such ambient privacy in Facebook\u2019s world, as evidenced by the transcript. And for good reason. The very notion of ambient privacy is anexistential threatto Big Tech\u2019s business model. Take away that which violates the ambient privacy and what\u2019s left is not Facebook.\nFacebook and the rest of Big Tech built their empires by prioritizing innovation and embracing a mind-set that enormous, systemic challenges (\u201csolving death,\u201ddriverless cars,bringing the world closer together) can be solved through processing power,codeand a reimagining of what\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a mentality that treats complex physical world issues as software; everything can be updated.\nAnd yet, Snyder and Facebook appear gobsmacked by the idea of Privacy 2.0 and creating a new definition that reflects the way the tech giants have altered its very meaning. It\u2019s yet another example of what has become thedismalreality of Silicon Valley: They\u2019re very excited to fix big problems, as long as they\u2019re not problems that they created.\nDo you think that posting personal content, even to a small group of friends, on social media means forfeiting all expectations of privacy? Send me your thoughts atprivacynewsletter@nytimes.com. Your responses may be shared in an upcoming edition of this newsletter.\nIn the spirit of expectations of privacy, this week\u2019s archive pick is aFebruary 1998 editorialon a decision to put cameras in New York\u2019s Washington Square Park. The similarities to today\u2019s debates on surveillance are striking.\nEven though there is generally no expectation of privacy in a public space, most people expect freedom from government monitoring when they eat lunch on a park bench or stroll down a street. The growing use of police video monitors in New York City may threaten the free and anonymous nature of public space \u2026\nBefore Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir expand video monitoring to cover more areas of the city, there needs to be significant public debate about the wisdom of 24-hour videotaping of lawful movement.\nSounds a bit like the arguments that led toSan Francisco\u2019s ban on facial recognitiontechnology, no?\nChaser: This piece 10 months later,in December 1998, about more cameras infiltrating New York.\nMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has endorsed the use of video surveillance to enhance public safety. His Police Commissioner, Howard Safir, said yesterday that such cameras had proven to be \u201cincredibly effective,\u201d cutting crime by 30 percent to 50 percent in public housing projects \u2026\n\u201cYou have no right to privacy in a public place,\u201d Commissioner Safir added, and \u201cno court order is required\u201d to use cameras.\nMakes for an interesting comparison with a2019 Op-Ed from New York\u2019s police commissionerarguing that facial recognitionmakes yousafer.\n[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information. We\u2019ll tell you what you can do about it.Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.]\nToday\u2019s tip comes from our Opinion graphics director, Stuart Thompson.\nIn anew piece for Sunday Review, Michael Kwet of Yale Law School writes how grocery stores, sports stadiums and other brick-and-mortar venues are using small Bluetooth-powered devices called beacons to monitor where you go.\nThe devices work by sending out constant wireless Bluetooth signals, which get picked up by your phone\u2019s Bluetooth receiver and can \u201cwake up\u201d apps on your phone \u2014 even when thoseapps are closed. The apps record your movements, monitoring whether you lingered by the low-fat ice cream, for example, and transmit your location to third-party companies for analysis.\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of Bluetooth snooping?\nFor iOS users, the solution might seem simple: Slide up from the bottom of your screen and press the Bluetooth icon to turn it off. Easy, right? Except that\u2019snot what those buttons do. In2017, Apple clarified that instead of turning Bluetooth off, the button only disconnects existing Bluetooth devices \u2014 and only for oneday. The same is true for the nearby button controlling Wi-Fi, which can also be used fortracking.\nApple gives one pop-up notice explaining how it works the first time you use the button. But afterward, you only see a small warning at the top of the screen. The Bluetooth antenna remains active on your phone, so any app with beacon technology installed could still monitor your location if you haven\u2019t configured your phone properly.\nApple users can turn off Bluetooth entirely by going to Settings > Bluetooth and sliding the big button at the top to the \u201coff\u201d position. (You can turn off Apple\u2019s own location tracking \u2014 as well as location tracking by specific apps \u2014 by toggling options in Settings > Location Services.) To turn off Bluetooth tracking entirely on Android phones, make sureyou shut offboth Bluetooth and Location History. But keep in mind turning these functions back on can reactivate Bluetooth tracking.\nThewildest privacy piece I read last weekis about how a Spanish soccer league\u2019s app is \u201cusing their microphones and location data to listen in and find bars that were pirating streams of soccer games.\u201d\nSome of the Hong Kong protesters are \u201cgoing dark\u201d to prevent being surveilled while demonstrating.Here\u2019s how they\u2019re doing it.\nAmazonis being sued overits Alexa recordings.\nLike other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

        "title": "House Opens Tech Antitrust Inquiry With Look at Threat to News Media",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A congressional investigation into the power of big tech companies began on Tuesday with bipartisan concern from lawmakers that the government\u2019s lax oversight of the industry may be doing more harm than good.\nIn its first hearing about the power held by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, lawmakers focused on the decline of the news industry. They said they were troubled that the online digital advertising market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook, had siphoned off too much revenue from news organizations.\n\u201cConcentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\nThe hearing was the start of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry into possible anticompetitive behavior by big tech companies, part of a rising wave of federal scrutiny of the industry.\nThe House committee plansseveral hearings, depositions and interviews with competitors over the next 18 months. In addition, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the two top antitrust agencies, recently divided antitrust oversight over Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.\nNumerous state attorneys general are alsopreparing inquiriesinto the biggest tech companies. Many of them are meeting with F.T.C. officials on Wednesday to talk about antitrust oversight.\nThe close reviews could lead to years of troubles for the companies, through lawsuits or new laws. European regulators have already taken a tough stance against the companies, investigating how they handle user data, police speech and limit competition.\nMr. Cicilline, who is leading the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, said he would explore a variety of issues. He said the committee would look into whether the dominant social network, Facebook, had harmed consumers with its handling of data, for example. He said it also planned to look into whether Amazon had hurt smaller retailers.\nThe House investigation will look into whether the Justice Department and F.T.C. have adequately enforced antitrust laws. Mr. Cicilline said Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of WhatsApp in 2014, for instance, now appeared anticompetitive, even though federal regulators had approved it.\n\u201cI have very serious concerns about the F.T.C.\u2019s commitment to these issues,\u201d Mr. Cicilline told reporters after the hearing.\nTuesday\u2019s hearing gave publishers a microphone after years of complaining about the big tech platforms. The News Media Alliance, a trade group representing 2,000 news organizations, including The New York Times, has long argued that Facebook and Google have become the biggest online advertising companies at the expense of publishers, which now rely on the platforms to find audiences.\nLeaders of the committee have pushed for passage of a bill that would give news organizations the ability to band together to negotiate greater compensation from online services that distribute their news. Lawmakers of both parties pointed out how some of their local newspapers had shut down in recent years.\n\u201cSmaller news organizations don\u2019t stand a fair negotiating chance when they try to negotiate deals with the platform giants,\u201d said Representative Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia and a co-author of the bill with Mr. Cicilline. \u201cThese giants stand as a bottleneck \u2014 a classic antitrust problem \u2014 between consumers and the producers of news content.\u201d\nDavid Pitofsky, the general counsel of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, said that \u201cthe marketplace for news is broken.\u201d Online platforms are \u201cfree riding\u201d by selling ads tied to News Corp\u2019s content without paying to create it, he said. Those ads take money away from publishers\u2019 individual sites, Mr. Pitofsky said, because advertisers now prefer services that aggregate news.\nNews Corp supports Mr. Cicilline and Mr. Collins\u2019s Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. The law would exempt the publishers from antitrust rules for four years, protecting them from charges of price collusion.\n\u201cWe are not losing business to an innovator who has found a better or more efficient way,\u201d Mr. Pitofsky said.\nMr. Cicilline said that 2,900 reporters and other news staff had lost their jobs this year, and that news ad revenue had dropped to $15.6 billion in 2017 from $49 billion in 2006.\nMatt Schruers, a vice president at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said at the hearing that his tech industry trade group accepted additional scrutiny because of the size of the companies being reviewed by Congress. And he said the industry wanted to encourage good journalism.\nBut Mr. Schruers said giving antitrust exemptions to publishers was risky and could ultimately harm consumers and the economy.\nGoogle, in a statement, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry as it works to adapt to the new economics of the internet.\u201d\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment.\nLawmakers also heard from David Chavern, the chief executive of the News Media Alliance. He encouraged lawmakers to support the proposed antitrust exemption for publishers.\nAnd Kevin Riley, the editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, testified that if the news industry continued on its current trajectory, many important local stories would not be adequately covered.\n\u201cSocial media and technology companies have enormous influence on the distribution and availability of news,\u201d Mr. Riley said in his prepared remarks. \u201cBut we should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Backs Off Crackdown on Parental-Control Apps",
        "fulltext": "SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Over the past year, Applepurged iPhone appsthat helped people limit the amount of time they and their children spent on Apple devices, drawing accusations of anticompetitive behavior.\nOn Monday,as news brokethat federal officials were stepping up antitrust scrutiny of Apple and its peers, the Silicon Valley giant abruptly reversed its policy and quietly disclosed that the apps\u2019 practices were allowed.\nAfter promoting its latest software updates in asplashy two-hour presentation on Monday morning, Apple articulated its new policy ina short blog poston a section of its website for developers.\nThe post said parental-control apps could now use two technologies that Apple had recently cited as grounds for their removal from iPhones.\nOne technology, mobile device management, or M.D.M., enables parents to take control of a child\u2019s phone. The other is a virtual private network, or V.P.N., which parents can use to block certain apps on a child\u2019s phone.\nIn the post, Apple said the apps could use the technologies if they didn\u2019t \u201csell, use or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose\u201d and included that promise in their privacy policies.\n\u201cThese apps were using an enterprise technology that provided them access to kids\u2019 highly sensitive personal data,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe do not think it is O.K. for any apps to help data companies track or optimize advertising of kids.\u201d\nShe did not say whether Apple had found evidence of the apps doing so. The app makers deny such activity. The spokeswoman declined to say why Apple had changed its mind.\nFred Stutzman, the chief executive of Freedom, an app that helped people track and limit their time on iPhones, said, \u201cMy reaction is: Why this last year of pain? And we end up exactly in the same place.\u201d\nApple removed Freedom from iPhones in August for using a V.P.N., without much explanation, Mr. Stutzman said. The move cost his business more than $1 million, he said.\nApple\u2019s move followed an April report by The New York Times that it had purged some apps. On Monday, The Times and other publications reported that House lawmakers said they wouldstep up their antitrust scrutinyof big tech companies and that the Justice Department would consider antitrust complaints against Apple.\nApple\u2019s tight control over its App Store is likely to be central to any antitrust investigation of the company. Spotify and two parental-control apps recently complained to European regulators that Apple was abusing its dominance of the digital marketplace, which has become one of the world\u2019s largest centers of commerce. Dutch regulators are also investigating the issue.\nAnd the Supreme Court recently allowed an antitrust class action to move forward, ruling that consumers can try to prove that Apple used the App Store to raise apps\u2019 prices.\nIn response, Apple publisheda new webpageaimed at explaining its App Store policies and defending its practices. Apple said it tried to make the App Store a safe place for consumers and a good business opportunity for developers. It said it welcomed competition.\nApple\u2019s reversal on Monday concluded a yearlong struggle for some app developers. At its annual developers conference in San Jose on June 4 last year, Apple unveiled a feature to help people limit the time that they and their children spend on the iPhone. Around that time, Apple quietly began removing or restricting apps in its App Store that offered similar services.\nIn April, The Timesreported on Apple\u2019s app removals. The makers of several banned apps told The Times that Apple was acting unfairly and had severely damaged their businesses. Appleresponded to the articleby saying it had removed the apps because they \u201cput users\u2019 privacy and security at risk.\u201d The company added: \u201cContrary to what The New York Times reported over the weekend, this isn\u2019t a matter of competition. It\u2019s a matter of security.\u201d\nAt the encouragement of Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive and one of the iPhone\u2019s creators, 17 of the affected app makers joined together andlast week proposed a technological solution, called an application programming interface, or A.P.I., that they said would enable them to continue to help parents limit their children\u2019s screen time without invading their privacy.\nWhile the companies could offer a road map for resolving the issue, it would be up to Apple to create the A.P.I. Apple often creates A.P.I.s so software made by other companies can work well with its popular products, like the iPhone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a hellish roller coaster,\u201d said Dustin Dailey, a senior product manager at OurPact, which had been the top parental-control iPhone app, with more than three million downloads, before Apple pulled it in February. OurPact, which had counted on its iPhone app for about 80 percent of its revenue, lost roughly $3 million from Apple\u2019s move, a spokeswoman said.\nIn response to Apple\u2019s stance that the apps could gain too much control over a child\u2019s phone, Mr. Dailey said, his team shared information with Apple about how it handled user data. \u201cWe\u2019d be open to an audit,\u201d he said.\nThe affected parental-control and screen-time apps are not yet back in the App Store. Several had appealed Apple\u2019s decision to remove them, while others will probably have to reapply for entry."
