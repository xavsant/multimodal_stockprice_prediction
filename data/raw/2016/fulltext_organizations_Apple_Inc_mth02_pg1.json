        "fulltext": "The tech industry\u2019s battle with the United States government over encryption has reached a fever pitch.\nEver since the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed in 2013 that the agency was hacking some tech companies and cozying up to others to gain user data, Silicon Valley behemoths have had an uneasy relationship with the United States government. Apple, which encrypts its iPhones, has been one of the most outspoken on the issues of encryption and privacy, saying it cannot give authorities access to people\u2019s private data and information.\nThat outspokenness reached a new height on Tuesday after a federal court order was issued requiring Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, published a strongly worded letter opposing the order and argued that unlocking one iPhone could lead to a slippery slope.\n\u201cWe fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect,\u201dMr. Cook wrote.\nMr. Cook\u2019s move immediatelysparked a debate about which side was in the right, write Eric Lichtblau and Katie Benner.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Stance Highlights a More Confrontational Tech Industry",
        "fulltext": "Thebattle between Apple and law enforcement officialsover unlocking a terrorist\u2019s smartphone is the culmination of a slow turning of the tables between the technology industry and the United States government.\nAfter revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.\nBut if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.\nIt may not seem that way at the moment. On the one side, you have the United States government\u2019s mighty legal and security apparatus fighting for data of the most sympathetic sort: the secrets buried in a dead mass murderer\u2019s phone. The action stems froma federal court order issuedon Tuesday requiring Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the two attackers whokilled 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.\nIn the other corner is the world\u2019s most valuable company, whose chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said he will appeal the court\u2019s order. Apple argues that it is fighting to preserve a principle that most of us who are addicted to our smartphones can defend:Weaken a single iPhoneso that its contents can be viewed by the American government and you risk weakening all iPhones for any government intruder, anywhere.\nThere will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.\nYet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public\u2019s collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.\nAny crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what\u2019s to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?\nApple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.\nApple\u2019semerging global brand is privacy; it has staked its corporate reputation, not to mention invested its considerable technical and financial resources, on limiting the sort of mass surveillance that was uncovered by Mr. Snowden. So now, for many cases involving governmental intrusions into data, once-lonely privacy advocates find themselves fighting alongside the most powerful company in the world.\n\u201cA comparison point is in the 1990s battles over encryption,\u201d said Kurt Opsahl, general counsel of theElectronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog group. \u201cThen you had a few companies involved, but not one of the largest companies in the world coming out with a lengthy and impassioned post, like we saw yesterday from Tim Cook. The profile has really been raised.\u201d\nApple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple\u2019s public opposition to the government\u2019s request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.\nYou can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government\u2019s reach.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.\nOnce armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.\n\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201d\nYet it\u2019s worth noting that even if Apple ultimately loses this case, it has plenty of technical means to close a backdoor over time. \u201cIf they\u2019re anywhere near worth their salt as engineers, I bet they\u2019re rethinking their threat model as we speak,\u201d saidJonathan Zdziarski, a digital forensic expert who studies the iPhone and its vulnerabilities.\nOne relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.\n\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201creasonable assistance\u201d will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.\nIn other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses."

        "title": "For Apple, a Search for a Moral High Ground in a Heated Debate",
        "fulltext": "What does it mean to be a good corporate citizen?\nThat\u2019s one of the questions being tested as Apple and the federal government battle over whether Apple should help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone to gain access to encrypted data that officials say is necessary for their investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings that killed 14 people.\nApple initially assisted the F.B.I., but is now fighting a government order directing it to create a new piece of software to open the phone, contending that its position is meant to protect the privacy of its customers.\nAside from the thicket of legal issues raised by the case, does Apple have a moral obligation to help the government learn more about the attack? Or does it have a moral obligation to protect its customers\u2019 privacy? Or how about its shareholders? And which of these should take precedence?\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has long spoken about running his company based on certain values. He has used his position to advocate gay rights, for example, and pushed the company to be more \u201cgreen,\u201d once going so far as to tell a shareholder who questioned the return on investment of taking such stances, \u201cIf you want me to do things only for R.O.I. reasons, you should get out of this stock.\u201d\nDuring a graduation speech last year at George Washington University, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe believe that a company that has values and acts on them can really change the world.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is opportunity to do work that is infused with moral purpose.\u201d\nMr. Cook has argued that complying with the court order would threaten \u201ceveryone\u2019s civil liberties\u201d and make customers more vulnerable to digital crime. And Mr. Cook is not alone. Chiefs at several technology companies have supported his position. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic with Apple on this one,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., said on stage Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\ntranscript\nna\nApple has come under sharp criticism from law enforcement officials. \u201cThere was once such a thing called corporate responsibility,\u201d William J. Bratton, the police commissioner of New York City, said of Apple. \u201cNow, it\u2019s corporate irresponsibility.\u201d\nThe debate over Apple\u2019s stance is just the latest in a series of questions about corporate patriotism. In recent years, questions have been directed at companies that renounce their United States citizenship to move to a country with a lower tax rate. Others, including Apple, have faced questions about tax strategies to shelter income abroad. And companies\u2019 social responsibility programs, say for clean energy or water efficiency, have been scrutinized.\nBehind Mr. Cook\u2019s worry is a separate, perhaps even more immediate threat: the possibility that if Apple were to comply with the court\u2019s order, other governments might follow suit and require Apple to give them access for their own investigative purposes. If Apple refused the request of, say, the Chinese government, it would risk being barred from doing business in China, its second-largest market after the United States.\nAnd then there\u2019s the possibility that if Apple were to build special software for the F.B.I., it could fall into the wrong hands, leading to even greater privacy and safety concerns.\nAll of which leads back to the same question: At what point is there a moral obligation for a company to help law enforcement, regardless of the business or privacy risk, in the event of a terrorist attack, or any crime?\n\u201cWhat are we really doing here? We\u2019re protecting a terrorist,\u201d Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney, told Bloomberg News, referring to Apple\u2019s position. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around that.\u201d\nAs principled as Mr. Cook\u2019s position may be, it still has the effect of hindering (or at least not helping) a criminal investigation that his company is uniquely situated to assist. (It is worth noting that the government already has most of the material on the phone from a previous backup.)\nSome business economists like Milton Friedman would most likely argue that Apple has no moral obligation to the government that isn\u2019t in the interest of maximizing its profits.\n\u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities?\u201dMr. Friedman wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970. Citing his book \u201cCapitalism and Freedom,\u201d he wrote, \u201cThere is one and only one social responsibility of business \u2014 to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.\u201d\nThe Justice Department has suggested Apple\u2019s position \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d\nJames Comey, the director of the F.B.I., says that this lawsuit presents a narrow legal issue, and that what the government seeks is limited to this particular case.\n\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation isn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201d\nYet other law enforcement officials suggest that the conflict with Apple extends far beyond the San Bernardino case.\n\u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West of technology,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said last Thursday, citing at least 175 iPhones that his office cannot gain access to, and arguing that it should be able to do so. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201d\nUltimately, it appears that both sides have left little room for compromise. \u201cTim Cook and lawyer Ted Olson have draped their argument in one of moral absolutism \u2014 but there is a hierarchy of moral reasoning they miss,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, referring to Apple\u2019s outside lawyer, Mr. Olson.\nBut if this broader controversy is ever going to be solved for the long term, there has to be an opportunity to reach a consensus in the middle.\nMaybe that means Apple should work with law enforcement to train officials so they have a better ability to rapidly retrieve information legally? (After all, law enforcement had a chance to gain access to the iPhone in question had they taken certain steps early on.) Or maybe the president should create a commission to study the issue, bringing together people from Silicon Valley and law enforcement to create agreed-upon rules of the road. Or, perhaps new legislation is required.\nMr. Comey, in a statement issued Sunday night, suggested as much, citing the need to resolve the \u201ctension between two values we all treasure \u2014 privacy and safety.\u201d\n\u201cThat tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also should not be resolved by the F.B.I., which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Hey hey, Farhad! We\u2019re just coming off our annual Times tech reporter summit in San Francisco this week, and I\u2019m pumped! There\u2019s nothing like Dean Baquet catching me in a trust fall to make me believe in teamwork.\nFarhad: Let\u2019s not lie to our readers, Mike. He didn\u2019t catch you. We weren\u2019t even doing a trust fall. I hope you got some medical attention for those bruises.\nMike:The aspirin is kicking in. So, on with the news!\nIt looks like Zynga, the social gaming company, isselling its headquarters, which at this point I imagine consists mostly of the chaff of empty Farmville fields. The Eero, a Wi-Fi router, is supposed to be incrediblyfast, simple and easy to use, except for taking the difficult first step of actually paying $500 for a three-pack of Wi-Fi routers.\nAnd speaking of Wi-Fi, earlier in the month American Airlines decided to sue Gogo, the in-flight Wi-Fi provider, for generallybeing the opposite of incredibly fast, simple and easy to use. On Monday, American Airlinesdropped the suit. I assume it was all some elaborate legal chess game, but it was nice to have my terrible onboard Wi-Fi experiences vindicated publicly, however briefly.\nFarhad: Oh, also,Facebook finally rolled outthe emoji reactions that it has been chatting up for some time as an evolution of the Like button. There are now icons for \u201clove,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d How does that make you feel, Mike?\nMike: Is there a reaction for \u201cgenerally apathetic at a feature that has received far too much press for what it is\u201d? Because I would use that emoji. Reaction. Whatever.\nBut what I want to get to is what we\u2019ve all been thinking about and talking about in tech for the last two weeks:Apple versus the F.B.I. I think it\u2019s safe to say that at this point, it will probably be the biggest tech story of the next few years \u2014 if not the decade \u2014 and it is all playing out in public in gory detail.\nTo recap: The F.B.I. essentially wants Apple to help crack open an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., that ended with the deaths of 14 people last year. The way the F.B.I. wants Apple to do that is by writing some new software that bypasses a bunch of safeguards Apple created to help consumers\u2019 phones stay safe in the first place. That is a thing that, for many reasons, Apple does not want to do.\nThe whole thing is fascinating, as it cuts to the heart of so many issues in a rapidly changing age of new technologies, one in which we must decide the balance between our personal right to privacy and digital liberties, and the authority of the government to seek out information in the name of national security.\nBut while I imagine it will take quite some time for the courts to pass judgment, I\u2019m already seeing some fairly clear lines in the sand being drawn. As a token tech reporter living and working in New York, the questions that most normal, nontechies have been asking me is, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Apple care about finding the terrorists? Why is the company acting so anti-American?\u201d\nThat\u2019s starkly different than what I hear from most people in our industry, but I\u2019d love to hear your take on it and what you\u2019re hearing from people on the West Coast.\nFarhad: Maybe it\u2019s just my sun-soaked California attitude, but to me Apple\u2019s stand here makes sense. If it loses, it would be a very big deal.\nOne thing that\u2019s clear is that we are not talking about just one phone. This is a test case. If the F.B.I. wins, it hasa collection of other phonesit would like Apple to unlock for it. The Manhattan district attorney has a lot more. I suspect many other D.A.s will be lining up for this service as well. There\u2019s a good chance that most of these cases won\u2019t be about terrorism \u2013 they\u2019ll be about more routine investigations that don\u2019t make headlines.\nSo,as I argued in a column this week, what we really should be discussing is the precedent this case sets. We are now surrounded by tech devices that contain all our secrets and that can be set to record and monitor us from afar. As we\u2019ve seen often in the last couple of years, police powers can be abused. So before we force a tech company to break open its security to grant the cops access to an unprecedented trove of data, it seems wise to have a debate about whether we want any limits on those powers.\nFor instance, should a court be able to compel access to a smartphone for any law-enforcement aim? What about drug crimes? What about immigration enforcement? After all, several presidential candidates have endorsed rounding up undocumented immigrants for deportation. Or look at Ferguson, Mo.,where riots erupted in 2014after a police officer killed a teenager named Michael Brown. TheJustice Department foundthat Ferguson\u2019s police and courts were routinely stopping, searching and issuing arrest warrants for the city\u2019s black citizens. Should those authorities be allowed to search through people\u2019s smartphones, too?\nThese questions make me really queasy. What about you?\nMike:I mean, I\u2019m always queasy, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve had a lot of San Francisco burritos on this last trip back.\nSeriously, though, of course all those things make me nervous. Do I want the government to access my text messages with you? Man, that would look bad.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: A year or so ago, Apple took the deliberate step of making it so it could not gain access its own phones at the behest of the government, and it isonly accelerating that effort. And I\u2019ve already reported they\u2019re going totake similar steps with iCloudand generally embrace this approach overall. That\u2019s drastically different than Apple\u2019s history of complying with government requests for data when it is legally required to do so.\nSo when the company bound its own hands, I have to ask: What did it expect the government to do, just sit back and say, \u201cOh, well, I guess we won\u2019t request any more data.\u201d Of course not. This is an escalation in a continuing war for reach into consumer data, and now it\u2019s going to court.\nI think, in general, people don\u2019t want the government snooping on their data. However, I think this is perhaps the absolute worst case Apple and others chose to push back on, considering that it includes questions of terrorism and the mass slaughter of innocents. Tracking down terrorist ties to murderers is far easier for normal, nontechie people to comprehend than the intricacies of software and data extraction.\nAnyway, I expect this will continue on into our next set of trust falls in 2017. Till then, I\u2019ll continue to nurse my bruises and watch the case.\nFarhad:You\u2019re right, the F.B.I. picked the perfect case for pushing for this authority. We are in for interesting times."

        "title": "In Nod to Law Enforcement in Apple Case, Obama Ends Attempt to Straddle Privacy Divide",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For years, President Obama has struggled to reconcile a civil libertarian\u2019s belief in personal privacy with a commander in chief\u2019s imperatives for the nation\u2019s security.\nThis week, security won.\nThe decision by Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to force Apple to help it breach an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists has ended, at least for now, the president\u2019s attempts to straddle the feud over encryption between Silicon Valley and law enforcement.\nAsked about the president\u2019s backing of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s inquiry into San Bernardino, one of the worst terror attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Obama\u2019s press secretary declared on Wednesday that \u201cthe F.B.I. can count on the full support of the White House.\u201d\nThe decision may have been all but inevitable for Mr. Obama, who every morning receives a classified intelligence briefing about the terrorist threats facing the United States. But he took the position after years of trying to find middle ground on the issue.\nIn a meeting with technology company executives in the Situation Room last spring, Mr. Obama pleaded with them to allow national security and law enforcement officials some access to private data, according to one participant in the room. In an interview last year with Re/Code, a technology website, Mr. Obama lamented being stuck, \u201csmack-dab in the middle of these tensions.\u201d\n\u201cI think he realizes there\u2019s no clear-cut answer here,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cBut if ever there was going to be a nod to the law enforcement view, this was the one to do it.\u201d\nFor much of his presidency, Mr. Obama has been unwilling to become a champion for either side, even as technological advances in encryption made a clash between privacy and security inevitable.\nAfter Edward J. Snowden exposed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs in 2013, the president repeatedly expressed support for the protection of user data on iPhones and other devices. But he also acknowledged the \u201clegitimate need\u201d to penetrate encryption, especially during terror investigations.\nStarting in 2010, top law enforcement officials for Mr. Obama, including officials at the F.B.I., began pushing for legislation to force technology companies to ensure that law enforcement agencies could have access to personal data. By 2015, Mr. Obama\u2019s administration had backed away from support for a new law, saying the president preferred to seek cooperation with Silicon Valley instead.\nMr. Obama has a close relationship with Silicon Valley \u2014 he has dinners with its tech titans and raises money there \u2014 but like his predecessors, he has been torn by the responsibilities he faces every day: securing the country against terrorists, supporting criminal investigations and prosecuting a war against extremists who are increasingly turning to encrypted technologies to evade detection.\ntranscript\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) Cyrus Vance, Manhattan District Attorney:\n\u201cToday iPhones are the first consumer product that I know of in our history that are designed to be and are in fact beyond the reach of judicially authorized warrants. They are warrant proof.\u201d\n//\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Cyrus Vance, Manhattan District Attorney:\n\u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen the wild west in technology. Apple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201d\n//\n6. SOUNDBITE (English) Cyrus Vance, Manhattan District Attorney:\n\u201cEvidence that used to be stored in file cabinets and on sheets of paper and safes is now found on smartphones and this includes important evidence such as iMessages between sex traffickers and the victims that they control.\u201d\n//\n8. SOUNDBITE (English) Cyrus Vance, Manhattan District Attorney:\n\u201cIt is very difficult to explain to a victim of crime, whether it is an assault, a sexual charge or a financial charge that we cannot get the evidence that may identify the individual who committed the crime because a cell phone company and designer has decided that they know better.\u201d\n\u201cThere are times where folks who see this through a civil liberties or privacy lens reject that there\u2019s any trade-offs involved, and in fact there are,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview with Re/Code. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that there are no trade-offs whatsoever.\u201d\nSeveral former Obama administration officials said they believed the president personally leaned, at least slightly, toward the view that technology companies must be allowed to secure personal data if they want to earn the trust of their customers.\nHe also understands, they said, the problems that could arise if governments like China and Russia demand the same backdoor access to American technologies that the F.B.I. wants. In the same interview, he said, \u201cI lean probably further in the direction of strong encryption than some do inside of law enforcement.\u201d\nBut some civil libertarians view Mr. Obama as, at best, a weak supporter of their views and one who has too often been swayed by his national security and law enforcement apparatus.\nSome of those civil libertarians said Thursday that Mr. Obama\u2019s vocal support for the F.B.I.\u2019s aggressive legal tactics against Apple was evidence that the president is too willing to accede to the demands of his national security advisers. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, who in the past has expressed deep respect for Mr. Obama, has vowed to fight the order.\n\u201cThis is yet another disappointment in a string of disappointments when it comes to privacy,\u201d said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation.\nMr. Bankston said the F.B.I.\u2019s decision to choose the San Bernardino case to press, legally, had been a smart way to put pressure on Mr. Obama and the technology companies. But he urged the president to consider the broader implications for privacy if Apple loses the case.\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s linked to the shootings makes it much more difficult politically,\u201d Mr. Bankston said. \u201cBut the answer is to highlight that it\u2019s not just about this case. It\u2019s about every encrypted device.\u201d\nMr. Schiff said the specifics of the California case might provide courts with the ability to narrow that impact. The phone in the case was owned by the terrorist\u2019s employer, who has given permission for law enforcement to search it. To do that, officials need Apple\u2019s help. If courts agree with the government, they might attempt to apply their ruling in limited cases.\nRegardless of the outcome of the case, any final resolution is unlikely to come before Mr. Obama leaves office early next year \u2014 timing that in some ways works for the president.\n\u201cTaking this case to the courts buys the administration a bit more time on these issues,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThis is a very challenging issue for the administration. There simply is no easy answer.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple vs. the F.B.I. is quickly becoming a fight only a lawyer could love.\nIn case you missed it, investigators want Apple\u2019s help breaking into an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple says no way, since it would have to create new software to do this and would essentially be hacking its own products.\nThe basis of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s demand is a 1789 law called the All Writs Act. The government has used this very old law in the past to obtain customer information from Apple, but the companycontended in a court filing Thursdaythat \u201cCongress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the F.B.I.\u201d\nIf you do not find discussions of 1789 law all that fascinating, there is also a Bill of Rights discussion. Apple contends that its First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by a court order supporting the F.B.I.\nHow\u2019s that? Apple says that courts often consider software code to be speech under the protection of the First Amendment, and compelling Apple to write code would amount to compelling speech. Also, Apple says last week\u2019s court order amounts to \u201carbitrary deprivation of [its] liberty by government.\u201d That\u2019s covered in the Fifth Amendment.\nNext, a number of tech companies are expected to file court briefs in support of Apple.\nSo fasten your seatbelts. Silicon Valley \u2014 which has lots of money and lawyers \u2014 is throwing down with the Justice Department, which has lots of clout and lawyers.\nIt is not clear yet if the industry\u2019s lobbyists have been deployed en masse to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill."

        "title": "When the Apple and F.B.I. Fight Really Began",
        "fulltext": "In many ways, the current battle between Apple and the F.B.I. really began in June 2013, when the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the scale of government spying on domestic Internet traffic.\nUsually, tech companies faced with often-secret court orders cooperated with this snooping. But the industry has since come to believe, thanks to the Snowden documents, that despite their cooperation, national security agents were also hacking into their networks.\nGiven that history, it should surprise no one that Apple is digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to create software that would help law enforcement gain access to a password-protected iPhone that belonged to one of the gunmen in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nBut Apple engineers, as The New York Times reported Wednesday, are working ontechnology that would make even that impossible.If Apple should succeed, it will present an even tougher barrier to government snoops. And law enforcement, in turn, would have to find a way around that.\nAfter that? Some believe the only way to stop the back-and-forth would be for Congress to get involved."

        "fulltext": "To understand what\u2019s at stake in thebattle between Apple and the F.B.I.over cracking open a terrorist\u2019s smartphone, it helps to be able to predict the future of the tech industry.\nFor that, here\u2019s one bet you\u2019ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today\u2019s smartphones hold a lot of personal data \u2014 your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow\u2019s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.\nConsider all the technologies we think we want \u2014 not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.\nThis gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.\nBut if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there\u2019s no longer any room for keeping secrets?\n\u201cThis case can\u2019t be a one-time deal,\u201d said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. \u201cThis is about the future.\u201d\nMr. Richards is the author of \u201cIntellectual Privacy,\u201d a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire toeliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we\u2019re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.\n\u201cIf we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we\u2019re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, \u2018deviant\u2019 ideas \u2014 and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.\u201d\nMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.\u2019s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.\n\u201cThe particular legal issue is actually quite narrow,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I.,wrotein a blog post on Sunday. \u201cWe simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist\u2019s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nBut civil liberties activists say they\u2019d have an easier time believing Mr. Comey\u2019s assurances if there weren\u2019t a long history of the government relying on legal cases based on old technology to decide how to handle newer technologies. Courts in the 1960s and 1970s created rules for the wiretapping of analog phone calls; those rulings were laterappliedas the basis for mass surveillance of the Internet.\n\u201cBy and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that\u2019s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s \u2014 before email, before search engines, before social networks,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nMr. Soghoian pointed out the government had already tried to turn connected devices into surveillance machines. In a mob case more than a decade ago, the F.B.I. asked a company that made an in-dash roadside assistance device \u2014 something like OnStar, which uses a cellular phone to connect to an operator in case of an emergency \u2014 to secretly record the private conversations of people inside a car. Acourt ruled against the F.B.I.\u2019s request, but only on the very narrow grounds that bugging the car would have interfered with the proper functioning of the in-dash device.\n\u201cThe court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said. \u201cSo as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.\u201d\nMr. Soghoian was referring toAmazon\u2019s handy digital assistant, a device that is constantly listening to your household conversations to try to offer you friendly help. The Echo listens for a keyword \u2014 \u201cAlexa!\u201d \u2014 which prompts it to start streaming your voice to Amazon\u2019s servers to decipher your request. Amazon, which declined to comment on how the Apple case might affect Echo users\u2019 privacy, has said it is not constantly recording people\u2019s voices, and that it keeps voice recordings only to help the system learn to better understand you.\nButthe Apple casethreatens to undermine those promises. If a court can get Apple to hack into an iPhone, why couldn\u2019t it also force Amazon to change the Echo\u2019s security model so the Echo can record everything you say? Mr. Soghoian believes the Apple case could set that precedent.\n\u201cWhat we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we\u2019re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,\u201d he said.\nSome readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don\u2019t buy the Amazon Echo. Don\u2019t put cameras in your house. Don\u2019t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not.\nThere\u2019s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.\nThe Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.\n\u201cFrom a historical perspective, we\u2019re entering into a very new era,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. \u201cIn the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.\u201d\nBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.\n\u201cNow we have a surveillance-enabled world,\u201d Ms. Granick said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap, and it\u2019s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?\u201d"

        "title": "Narrow Focus May Aid F.B.I. in Apple Case",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the months leading up toApple\u2019s standoff with the United States governmentover the unlocking of an iPhone, the technology industry braced itself for a big demand \u2014 a back door into all of Apple\u2019s products, or a way to destroy the company\u2019s strong encryption.\nInstead, the F.B.I. took the industry by surprise and cleverly stopped short of expectations. The bureau asked Apple for something very specific: that it create an alternative operating system for just one phone that would help the government break into the device. The limited nature of the request has helped the government portray this case as a one-time demand, without ramifications beyond the case at hand.\nInpublic statements posted on Sunday, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr. wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201d\nWhile the F.B.I. is pursuing a narrow focus, Apple is arguing its side as broadly as possible.\nThe company has repeatedly said this case is about much more than the iPhone of one of the attackers from a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14. The company has framed the government\u2019s request as a larger discussion of privacy and civil liberties, and a slippery slope that could open the way to similar demands in the future.\nIn an internal email sent to Apple employees on Monday, Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive,wrote: \u201cThis case is about much more than a single phone or a single investigation, so when we received the government\u2019s order, we knew we had to speak out. At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people, and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone\u2019s civil liberties.\u201d\nThe differing approaches are set to be the core of each side\u2019s arguments as Apple and the United States government dig in for an extended period of legal wrangling. Both are betting that their narrow-versus-broad lines of reasoning will help them win both in court and in the court of public opinion.\nFor now, while civil liberties groups and many tech companies say they side with Apple, the government may have carved out an advantage by proffering its narrow argument.\n\u201cBy making its request so targeted, Apple has fewer grounds to argue their side than had the government asked it to permanently change its code,\u201d said Jason Healey, a former White House security policy director and a research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.\nThe government\u2019s edge was reflected ina report from the Pew Research Center on Monday. In its report, Pew said 51 percent of Americans say Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the San Bernardino attack, while 38 percent said Apple should not help, and 11 percent did not offer an opinion.\ntranscript\nna\nApple has until Friday to file a formal brief opposing the federal court order requiring it to cooperate with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the San Bernardino incident. The order was issued last Tuesday byMagistrate Judge Sheri Pymof the Federal District Court for the District of Central California.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks that Mr. Cook had made.\nThe greatest fear among many privacy and computer security advocates was that the government would try to force Apple to give up the security keys it uses to digitally sign its code, keys that would let government programmers disable Apple\u2019s security.\nInstead, the F.B.I. understood that Apple can cleanly install new software on broken phones, without replacing them, and asked the company to make a similar tool that would let investigators break into a work phone issued to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.\nThe bureau has taken pains to note that it did not ask Apple to break the password, and that this solution would not work on newer phones.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Comey\u2019s statement to defend why the agency needed to break into the iPhone said that the court order \u201cisn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.\u201d\nF.B.I. technical specialists have been working with companies to figure out how to extract data from phones for years.\nA government official said on Monday that investigators quickly realized that in the San Bernardino case, a technical solution was available. \u201cThis was just the logical extension to what we were already doing,\u201d one senior government official said.\n\u201cI think Apple was hoping that the request that came was more outrageous,\u201d said Dan Guido, the founder of the security firm Trail of Bits. \u201cThe F.B.I. was very adroit. They waited for the perfect situation where they had all these factors aligned so the request looks pretty straightforward.\u201d\nAfter the judge ordered Apple last week to create the new tool, Mr. Cook posted a personally signedletter to customersthat \u201cthe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201d\nIn anoteposted to its website on Monday, Apple reiterated that the government\u2019s request seems narrow but really isn\u2019t. \u201cLaw enforcement agents around the country have already said they have hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the F.B.I. wins this case,\u201d the company said.\nTo that point, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., criticized Apple after it refused to comply with the court order and said that they currently possessed 175 iPhones that they could not unlock.\nCharlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.\nMr. Vance responded: \u201cAbsolutely right.\u201d\nEven people who oppose the Justice Department\u2019s request concede the government made a smart first move, one that could establish precedent to justify more invasive tactics.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come up with a reason why for every single phone,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former White House security adviser who, while in government, said he opposed this tactic. But as a strategic matter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s tactically brilliant.\u201d\nSome citizens and politicians have attacked Apple\u2019s decision, like the families of the San Bernardino victims, Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Senators Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins.\nTo gird for the fight, Apple has hired Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Theodore B. Olson, partners at Gibson Dunn, as outside counsel. Both men have a long history of pushing the courts and the public to see the bigger picture on heated issues including gay marriage.\nTechnology peers like Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft and Yahoo have shown support,albeit muted, for Apple\u2019s stance on the issue. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, cautiously weighed in on the matter last week,while others followed suitin the days after.\nBut privately, there is talk among these companies that Apple may have overplayed its hand by taking the issue public in an all-out defiant assault against the F.B.I., according to two people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. These people fear the public may eventually sympathize with the F.B.I.\u2019s argument, especially considering the heinous nature of the crimes.\nPerhaps sensing that hard battle lines are being drawn, with most technologists and security professionals on one side and a country rattled by the threat of terror attacks on the other side, Apple said on Monday it wanted to shiftits battlewith the government from a courtroom \u2014 where it is currently being fought \u2014 to a hearing room on Capitol Hill.\nThestatementcame after the House Energy and Commerce Committeeinvited Mr. Cook and Mr. Comeyto testify at a hearing on privacy and national security \u201cto explain to Congress and the American people the issues at play and how they plan to move forward.\u201d\nApple proposed in its statement that federal prosecutors de-escalate the situation by withdrawing their demands, and \u201cas some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\u201d"

        "title": "A Brief Explanation of Apple\u2019s Showdown With the U.S. Government",
        "fulltext": "The F.B.I. wants Apple to help unlock an encrypted iPhone used by one of the two attackers whokilled 14 people in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting in December.\nSpecifically, the bureau wants Apple to create software that would help it override a security system on the phone designed to erase its contents after 10 unsuccessful tries to enter its password.\nApple is resisting for several reasons. First, it argues that the government is trying to force it to create software that does not exist. What is more, the company says writing that software would amount to hacking its own technology.\nApple claims this would create a security risk for all iPhone customers, especially because other government agencies in the United States and abroad could then demand Apple\u2019s assistance in other cases. In a court filing,Apple disclosed that there were nine other casesin which the Justice Department has asked for its help unlocking phones.\nThe F.B.I., for its part, says that Apple is overstating the issue, since the bureau is asking for the company\u2019s help breaking into only one phone, not phones all over the world.\nThe technology industry and the government have beenwrangling for yearsover the growing use of encryption in communication tools that make it much harder for law enforcement and spy agencies to gather information in investigations.\nThat fight took on new urgency in 2013 after documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed extensive government spying on Internet traffic.\nOn Feb. 16,a federal judgeissued an order compelling Apple to assist the F.B.I. and gave the company until Feb. 26 to respond.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook,wrote a letter to customerswarning of the \u201cchilling\u201d breach of privacy sought by the government and vowed to appeal. The F.B.I. shot back, calling Apple\u2019s position a \u201cmarketing strategy.\u201d\nOn Thursday,Apple filed a formal responseto the court order, asking the judge to vacate it. The company said that the order violated its First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights and exceeded the powers granted to the government in the All Writs Act, the 1789 law that the court had used to compel Apple\u2019s assistance.\nApple argues that software code can be treated as speech under the First Amendment, and that the court order violated due process because it deprives the company of its right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.\nThe court will consider Apple\u2019s request. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google plan to file one or more briefs next week supporting Apple\u2019s position.\nBoth the F.B.I. and Apple say they want Congress to weigh in. On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on encryption issues. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., and Apple\u2019s top lawyer are among those scheduled to testify."
