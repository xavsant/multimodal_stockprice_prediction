        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We\u2019re not the only ones.\nMr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.\nBut as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.\nWhat set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.\nMr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.\nFor now, at least.\nBefore the hearing on Tuesday, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,sent lettersto Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey with 14 questions. Inhis letter to Google, Mr. Grassley wanted to \u201cunderstand how Google manages and monitors user privacy for the significant amounts of data which it collects.\u201d\n[2 days, 10 hours, 600 questions:Read about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg went to Washington.]\nThe companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.\n\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201d\nLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.\nOn Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.\nMr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.\nGoogle employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.\nIn a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201d\nGoogle has been criticized \u2014 even fined \u2014 for its privacy practices over the years. It paid a $17 million fineto settle a casewhen it bypassed privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser to track users and show them advertisements in 2011 and 2012. It also got dinged for scooping up people\u2019s passwords, email and other personal informationduring its Street View mapping project.\nPrivacy advocates also criticized a Google social network,called Buzz, in 2010 for automatically including users\u2019 email contact. Google eventually settled the matter with the Federal Trade Commission and agreed to strengthen an existing privacy program.\nGoogle is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.\nMr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.\nSimilarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.\n\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.\nApple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201d\nAfter users download Apple\u2019s most recent software update for iPhones and iPads, released on March 29, their devices prominently display a message that said \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said the update, which has been in the works for months, was intended to better inform users on its data practices and comply withEurope\u2019s new data-privacy rulesthat take effect May 25 \u2014 not taunt Facebook.\nWhen asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201d\nAmazon, for its part, has mirrored Google\u2019s approach, staying silentdespitethe frequent attacksPresident Trump has made against the company on Twitter. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.\nAmazon uses shoppers\u2019 purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.\nPrivacy advocatesare also concernedabout the tens of millions of Amazon Echo smart speakers and other voice-controlled devices that have put microphones in people\u2019s homes.\nAmazon\u2019s top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.\nMany tech companies understand that Washington\u2019s renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.\n\u201cThe tide has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is passing us by.\u201d"

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Own Data Disclosed After Senate Hearing: His Notes",
        "fulltext": "A photographer captured two pages of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s notes forhis appearance at a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Oncehighlighted on Twitter, the image was retweeted thousands of times.\nTo many commenters, the paradox was clear. On a day Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, faced lawmakers\u2019 questions about whether his company adequately protected users\u2019 data, he experienced a disclosure of his own.\nThe talking points gave a detailed view ofFacebook\u2019s extensive preparationsfor the appearance before Congress of its billionaire founder. While some of the notes matched what he said on Tuesday, others reminded him what not to say or anticipated questions that were not raised. Mr. Zuckerbergwill appear Wednesday for another day of testimony.\nOne section of the notes suggested responses in case Mr. Zuckerberg was asked if he would step down. He was not asked that question, but the suggested reply indicated he planned to stay.\n\u201cResign?\u201d read the notes, which were written in an abbreviated form. \u201cFounded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we\u2019ve faced problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.\u201d\nThe notes also included what Mr. Zuckerberg should say if asked whether Facebook should be broken up. \u201cU.S. tech companies key asset for America,\u201d was the suggested reply. \u201cBreakup strengthens Chinese companies.\u201d\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina,asked if Facebook was a monopoly. But he did not press Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company should be divided, and the answer citing Chinese competition was not used.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you have a monopoly?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg replied.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes also guide a response to recent criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has described his own company as a far more robust defender of consumer privacy.\n\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d read the notes. But Mr. Cook\u2019s comments were not raised during the hearing, and the response was not used.\nAnother section warns Mr. Zuckerberg about comments to avoid. In response to any questions about European Union privacy and data protections, the notes instructed that he should not say Facebook already complies with adata privacy law that goes into effect in May.\nThe image was photographed by Andrew Harnik of The Associated Press and was included in atweet from Stefan Becket, a senior news editor at CBSNews.com, that was shared widely.\n\u201cI took 70 photos of Zuck today,\u201d Mr. Harnikwrote in response. \u201cLeave it to the writers to love the photograph of pages of text.\u201d\nMr. Harnik said he didn\u2019t think the photo constituted the sharing of private information.\n\u201cHe left it on the desk surrounded by probably upwards of 100 film and still cameras pointed at the desk from every direction,\u201dhe tweeted. \u201cI do not think that constitutes an invasion of privacy.\u201d\nPhotos of notes during official events have a long history of revealing more information than those who held them intended.\nIn 1975, a photograph of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the Helsinki Accords showed himreading a document with the heading\u201cTOP SECRET SENSITIVE EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY CONTAINS CODE WORD.\u201d\nThe document, which discussed diplomatic relations between France and North Vietnam based on a C.I.A. source with access to the French Foreign Ministry, undermined ties between Washington and Paris, Lawrence Martin-Bittman, a Boston University scholar, wrote in 1981.\nMore recently, President Trump was photographed during a meeting with parents, students and teachers who lost loved ones in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting holding notes that included the line, \u201cI hear you.\u201d The imageraised questions about his abilityto empathize with people who were grieving."

        "title": "They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed.",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ryan Knight, a Democratic activist in Los Angeles, called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn\u2019t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming-video service afterthe Parkland, Fla., school shooting.\n\u201cDear @Apple,\u201d Mr. Knightwrote on Twitter. \u201cYour silence is deafening. #BoycottApple.\u201d More than 330 accounts retweeted the message.\nHow did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone.\nAs the reach and influence of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies\u2019 products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid.\nThat issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook. Hundreds of peopledeleted their accountsafter revelations that the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica hadimproperly harvested the informationof 50 million Facebook users. Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram, which is owned by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Facebook.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same company. I realize it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.\nMs. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.\nPeople looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.\nOne Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.\nEven Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices \u2014 and it said it wouldlivestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMarisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.\nBut a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.\nAfter the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.\nPeople used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtagfrom the actress Alyssa Milano.\n\u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201d\nNearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.\n\u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.\nEddy Cue, a senior executive at Apple,recently saidthat the NRA channel didn\u2019t violate the company\u2019s policies. Facebook, Google and Amazon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nMany of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company\u2019s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company\u2019s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.\nWhen Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, \u201c2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.\u201d But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.\nLikewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla,deleted the Facebook pagesof both companies \u2014 but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine \u201cso long as it stays fairly independent.\u201d\nStephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.\u201d\nInstagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to aJanuary surveyof 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey.\nRayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram.\nWhile she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat.\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to go?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was something else.\u201d"

        "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Find My Friends",
        "fulltext": "Lurking on my phone is an app I didn\u2019t put there, one I wouldn\u2019t have touched were it not for a few glasses of wine and a pointer-fingered dare from an insolent friend named Jeff. He was visiting from San Francisco, and as we sat in the white-brick backyard of a bar, he urged me to disclose my location to him on Find My Friends, a function that Apple began quietly placing on all iPhones in 2015. In a world where we use social media to broadcast highly curated versions of ourselves, the app offers a frightening antithesis: to tell the people in our lives, via a small orange dot moving across a map, exactly where we are at all times. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d Jeff asked me, giggling and snapping his gum like some teenage villain.\nAt first I objected to Jeff\u2019s challenge with profanity. But then I asked myself why. WhatwasI hiding? He lived across the country, so at the very least the app couldn\u2019t make our friendship worse. It wouldn\u2019t keep me from the sort of white lies that keep society lubricated:I\u2019m going to turn in early, but have fun at the party, we say, even if what we really mean is,I need company but not yours, orThere\u2019s a walk I\u2019d like to take alone, a book I\u2019d rather read. Jeff is something like a sibling to me, the sort of friend who offers a ride to a faraway doctor\u2019s appointment, then spends the ride gleefully mocking my haircut. Relenting to his taunt, I pulled out my phone and pressed a button that posed a terrifying question: Share location indefinitely?\nIn the next few weeks, I was more in touch with Jeff than I had been in the half-decade since I left California. During his visit, we\u2019d spoken about all the hiking I wasn\u2019t doing and all the hiking that he was, so I took the opportunity, when I saw him stuck in gridlock traffic on the freeway at the foot of Potrero Hill, to text: \u201cHow\u2019re those great outdoors treating you, bud?\u201d During a week when I had dodged a call, claiming the careerist busyness of a New Yorker, he caught me strolling through Central Park at 3 on a Tuesday, and he volleyed back. Sometime in July, Jeff and his wife, Evyan, went up to the Russian River, where as a kid I learned to swim crosscurrent. It\u2019s a place I dream of often, and when I saw him there, I wrote to say that I missed them, missed the river. \u201cSend a picture,\u201d I wrote, and he did. It felt so much better to see it this way, a piece of their lives I\u2019d asked for, than to encounter it on Instagram and absently double-tap.\nBy August, I was even using the app the way Apple intended, having invited my friend Dean to an evening picnic in Prospect Park. I waited in a favorite place, an occluded lakeside gazebo with a view of thebeaux-artsboathouse, watching his dot make its way down an unlit, twisting path. Dean is honest by vocation, a Canadian talk-show celebrity turned therapist, so the GPS arrangement stayed. We were each recently single, each recently living alone, and we dissected each other\u2019s love lives with the devotion and horror of a soap-opera audience. The app helped us talk about the strangeness of the transition: When one of us slept with a man we\u2019d agreed it was best not to sleep with again, a trip to a suspect neighborhood revealed it. \u201cUh-oh, babe, you\u2019re in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Let me know how it goes.\u201d\nIf the current zeitgeist is a love of transparency \u2014 about our social and romantic lives, our political ideas and professional triumphs \u2014 location is the rule\u2019s agreed-upon exception, the factor that divides our real lives from their digital counterparts. But Find My Friends rewards a groundwork of trust that\u2019s already laid, magnifying what we know to be true about the people we love through the changes in place that express it. The significance of our place on the map is essentially contextual, offering more of our lives only to those with whom we\u2019ve already shared so much. I might not text about what brings me shame \u2014 how I choose the solipsism of my work over the company of other people, how I run toward brilliant, frigid men as if they have offered me gratis seaside property \u2014 but my coordinates reveal it.I trust you\u2019ll know what to do with this, my location says, to the few people who have it: better than almost anybody, maybe even better than myself.\nThat I should expose myself this way is particularly strange, given how I value my independence, often leaving my normal life for months at a time to be alone in the woods. Oddly enough, the app that allows my friends to spy on me constantly supports this part of me, too. Late in September, I planned a hike to a peak in the White Mountains, on the border of Maine and New Hampshire, precisely the type of risky, grueling, seven-hour undertaking I was told as a Girl Scout never to do alone. There most likely wouldn\u2019t be enough service to make a phone call if I missed a crucial cairn or snapped an ankle, but GPS would work, so I asked two friends to periodically check my dot, and to call someone if, by an hour after dark, it had disappeared or stopped moving.\nThat climb was astonishing, the green sugar maples giving way to oversaturated orange and red as the altitude rose and the temperature dropped. Not passing anyone on my way past the tree line was moving, and scrambling alone up the pink granite was a spectacle, but there was also the pleasure of being seen like this, by the people who know me \u2014 as solitary as I often want to be, as silent and as far."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple has hired Google\u2019s chief of search and artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, a major coup in its bid to catch up to the artificial intelligence technology of its rivals.\nApple said on Tuesday that Mr. Giannandrea will run Apple\u2019s \u201cmachine learning and A.I. strategy,\u201d and become one of 16 executives who report directly to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook.\nThe hire is a victory for Apple, which many Silicon Valley executives and analysts view as lagging its peers in artificial intelligence, an increasingly crucial technology for companies that enable computers to handle more complex tasks, like understanding voice commands or identifying people in images.\n\u201cOur technology must be infused with the values we all hold dear,\u201d Mr. Cook said Tuesday morning in an email to staff members obtained by The New York Times. \u201cJohn shares our commitment to privacy and our thoughtful approach as we make computers even smarter and more personal.\u201d\nWhile Apple has risen to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company on the back of the iPhone, many in the technology industry consider the iPhone\u2019s digital assistant, Siri, to be less effective than its counterparts at Google and Amazon.\nMr. Giannandrea, a 53-year-old native of Scotland known to colleagues as J.G., helped lead the push to integrate A.I. throughout Google\u2019s products, including internet search, Gmail and its own digital assistant, Google Assistant.\nHe joined Google in 2010when it purchased Metaweb, a start-up where he served as chief technology officer. Metaweb was building what it described as a \u201cdatabase of the world\u2019s knowledge,\u201d which Google eventually rolled into its search engine to deliver direct answers to users\u2019 queries. (Try googling \u201cHow old is Steph Curry?\u201d) During Mr. Giannandrea\u2019s tenure, A.I. research became increasingly important inside Google, with its primary A.I. lab, Google Brain, moving into a space beside the chief executive, Sundar Pichai.\nEngineers with A.I. expertise are some of the most sought-after people in Silicon Valley, with salaries sometimesexceeding eight figures. Whennews brokeMonday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.\nApple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.\nApple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.\nResearchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.\nOn the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandreatold MIT Technology Reviewin an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.\n\u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime. I just see no technological basis as to why this is imminent at all.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The United States undercut China\u2019s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country.\nThe Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn\u2019t trust them.\nA day earlier, the governmentbarred ZTEfrom using components made in the United States, saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against North Korea and Iran.\nThe moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries.\nLong bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States.\nThe company made a big push in the United States with a new line of smartphones this year. Butthat effort was derailedwhen AT&T, appearing to bow to government security concerns, walked away from a deal to sell the devices.\nSince then, Huawei has signaled that its political battles in Washington may be all but lost. The company has been dialing back on government outreach in the United States, including lobbying, and last week it cut key staff there, according to people familiar with the matter. The new F.C.C. rule, which would become final with a second vote, could kill off what little equipment business Huawei has in the United States.\nThese are uncertain times for tech companies, whether American or Chinese, that are trying to do business across the Pacific. The two nations are playing an aggressive game of one-upsmanship, both to support their own companies and guard against threats to national security. Last month, the Trump administration accused Beijing of stealing American know-how as part of its ambitions to transform the Chinese economy, prompting tit-for-tat tariffs.\nThe latest moves against Huawei and ZTE mean that American companies like Apple and Qualcomm could soon be caught in the crossfire \u2014 and they have a lot to lose. Apple, for example, sold $46.5 billion worth of iPhones and other products in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong last year. That was about 20 percent of its total sales.\nWealthy Chinese consumers have gravitated toward Apple, and President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party still aim to keep the public happy. But there are limits to Apple\u2019s leverage in the country.\n\u201cBeijing will not sit idly by,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy. \u201cChinese officials will likely pause to digest this move, and the series of other trade and investment moves coming at them in waves, before deciding how best to respond. It is likely to get ugly before it gets better.\u201d\nBeijing could use its broad cybersecurity laws to steal the core computer code of American companies operating in China, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents the largest American tech companies. The Chinese government also could walk back recent commitments to allow more financial and electronic payments services from Mastercard, Visa and JPMorgan Chase. Or it could simply restrict American companies\u2019 ability to do business in China, he said.\nFor ZTE, this week\u2019s sanctions are a nightmare come true. The company\u2019s smartphones and network gear rely on American microchips and software, which means it could need to redesign as much as 90 percent of its product line.\nZTE and Google, which supplies the Android operating system in the Chinese company\u2019s phones, are concerned that the ban may prevent ZTE from licensing the software, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. No conclusion has been reached yet, the person said.\nHuawei is a global telecommunications equipment powerhouse, with $93 billion in revenue last year. It has spent millions trying to pry its way into the United States but found few takers \u2014 save for smaller, rural telecom companies that receive federal subsidies and would likely be barred from working with it by the F.C.C. rule.\nHuawei\u2019s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000.\nMajor American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. And bills are before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.\nIn January, researchers discovered security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei\u2019s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.\nThen, last week, Huawei laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington.\nThe company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.\n\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday in its home city, Shenzhen. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201d\nMr. Plummer, who was Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei\u2019s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.\nIt is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company\u2019s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.\nA Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with \u201cbusiness strategy and objectives.\u201d\n\u201cAny changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,\u201d he said.\nIn the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.\u2019s proposed rule \u2014 small cellular carriers, largely in rural areas \u2014 may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.\nThese carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.\nThe association\u2019s members have even elected a Huawei executive, William Levy, to their board.\nMs. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.\n\u201cThese companies who are reliant on this support, they don\u2019t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic safety, getting 911 services, broadband \u2014 it all just starts falling apart.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Deal for Shazam Is Delayed in Europe Over Data Concerns",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 If data is the most valuable currency of the digital economy, at what point does a company have so much that it becomes unfair?\nThat\u2019s a question antitrust experts are increasingly asking themselves as the world\u2019s biggest technology companies harvest more and more information about people and businesses. On Monday, European regulators pushed the idea forward, announcing an investigation into Apple\u2019s proposed acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns the iPhone maker would get access to data on competitors like Spotify.\nAntitrust cases, particularly in the United States, are typically argued over the impact a deal will have on consumers, such as the price of a product or service. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official, hasargued data should become more of a factor.\nMs. Vestager has said that with free services, customers pay with their data, and are not always getting a fair deal. This broader interpretation of antitrust law would have important consequences for future acquisitions made by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.\nApplesaid in Decemberthat it would buy Shazam, the song-recognition service that has been a mainstay on people\u2019s smartphones for years with its ability to name a track after listening for a few seconds. The app has also become a valuable source of data, giving music industry executives insight into what songs and artists are performing well and in what regions.\nEuropean authorities are raising alarms because Shazam has important data about Apple\u2019s rivals, potentially allowing the company to \u201cdirectly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch\u201d to Apple\u2019s own streaming service, the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm,said in a statement.\n\u201cCompeting music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d the commission said. It added that it wanted to prevent Apple from blocking Shazam from referring users to other music services.\nThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to make a final decision on whether to block or approve the deal, or seek concessions from Apple.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe inquiry adds to the growing roster of cases in which European authorities are resisting the expanding power of global technology companies. Apple and Ms. Vestager\u2019s competition office are already in the midst of a contentious fight over a 2016 ruling in which Ireland wasordered to recoup13 billion euros, or about $15.9 billion, in back taxes from the iPhone maker. Both Apple and the Irish government are appealing that decision.\nMs. Vestager\u2019s office has also fined a number of other tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm. And a new data protection law taking effect next month is expected to bring even more scrutiny.\nAntitrust cases based on data will become more common as companies use customer information as a moat against competitors, according to Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, who has written in favor of broader enforcement of antitrust rules. He cited a potentially influential German investigation of Facebook over the use of data.\nThe European inquiries are likely to influence governments elsewhere in the world, Mr. Stucke said. Governments, wary of the technology industry\u2019s power over the global economy, will develop rules to account for concerns that data can be used to build monopoly positions, even when companies buy businesses that wouldn\u2019t initially seem to be consequential, he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing significant changes over the last three to four years on data, privacy and competition policy,\u201d Mr. Stucke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sea change.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The recent tribulations of Facebook, which has lurched fromcrisistocrisisover the last year,most recentlyover the handling of users\u2019 personal data, has pushed a few of the industry\u2019s most prominent names to speak out against the company.\nMarc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, has compared the deleterious effects of social media to those of tobacco and alcohol, and has called for more regulation of those tech companies. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hasalso suggested new regulationprotecting personal data might be in order for businesses like Facebook.\n\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,\u201d Mr. Cooksaid recentlyat an event in China, referring to Facebook\u2019s recent problems.\nBut don\u2019t expect a long lineup of other industry leaders to speak out any time soon.\nAlthough technology companies have their differences, a spirit of comity prevails among its leaders in moments of crisis. For example, technology chiefs have mostly kept quiet about Uber\u2019s travails \u2014 from its efforts tosidestep law enforcementto apedestrian death causedby one of its self-driving cars \u2014 even if they might express their opinions privately.\nRepresentatives from companies as varied as Amazon, Microsoft and Slack declined to comment for this story. Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.\nOthers say companies have little moral standing to criticize Facebook\u2019s practices, when they have themselves relied on the social network to acquire customers, using the same ad-targeting tools that rely on personal data that have stirred up so much controversy in the context of politics.\n\u201cI think we just have to acknowledge the entire industry\u2019s complicity with what\u2019s happening with Facebook,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an internet real estate firm. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019reInspector Renaultin \u2018Casablanca\u2019 where we say we\u2019re shocked, shocked with what\u2019s happening and then a moment later someone hands us our winnings.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been advertising avidly on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Kelman added.\nMany companies are also linked to Facebook through partnerships, professional organizations and a worldview about the power of data that is not all that different from that of Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook.\n\u201cIt has been really hard for executives to turn their back on the gold mine of big data even in the face of compelling arguments to do so,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and a mentor of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s before becoming one of the company\u2019s most vocal detractors. \u201cThe C.E.O.s who are stepping forward here are taking the long view.\u201d\nVanessa Chan, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment.\nThere are many critics of Facebook in Silicon Valley. Theyincludeformer tech workers, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs like Brian Acton, who became a billionaire when Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a messaging company he helped found. \u201cIt is time. #deletefacebook,\u201d Mr. Acton posted on Twitter last month.\nBut there are few active corporate leaders in Silicon Valley who have taken a stand. Most of the handful of chiefs who have spoken out against Facebook have long been forthright on the topic of privacy. It is no coincidence that their businesses do not rely on the collection of personal data to the same degree that most internet companies do. Mr. Cook of Apple, which makes the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of devices, has for yearsdeclaredthat \u201cwhen an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer \u2014 you\u2019re the product.\u201d\nSteve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment.\nWhen asked about the Facebook\u2019s difficultiesat an event in Chinarecently, Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM, said companies needed to give their users better control over their personal information. \u201cGinni has long believed that individuals or customers own their data \u2014 not platforms,\u201d said Edward Barbini, a spokesman for IBM.\nNoah Theran, s spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group that counts Facebook and Salesforce among its members, though not Apple and IBM, said maintaining privacy and security was a top priority for internet companies.\n\u201cInternet companies comply with a wide variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations that are actively enforced by the F.T.C. and state attorneys general,\u201d Mr. Theran said. \u201cTrust and comfort with our products and services is essential to a thriving internet, and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used, seen and shared online.\u201d\nAnother tech leader, Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, said recently on Twitter thatnone of his companies advertiseon the social network and vowed to take down the official Facebook pages for Tesla and SpaceX.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a political statement and I didn\u2019t do this because someone dared me to do it,\u201d hewrote. \u201cJust don\u2019t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.\u201d\nMr. McNamee, the early Facebook investor, believes more industry leaders should speak out, partly because he predicts the United States can and should eventually adopt more stringent regulations akin tothose emerging in Europe.\n\u201cCompanies that get ahead of that curve,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be way more successful than those who can pretend they can sustain the old model.\u201d"
