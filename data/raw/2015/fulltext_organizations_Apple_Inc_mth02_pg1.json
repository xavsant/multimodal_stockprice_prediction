        "fulltext": "TakingiPhone\nOn the Road\nQ.I am 71 years old and plan to drive to Florida soon. Are there any apps to locate hotels to stop along the way, along with directions to find them from the highway? I have an iPhone 5 and a MacBook Air.\nA.Thanks to your iPhone\u2019sLocation Services(GPS) feature, which pinpoints your location as you travel, you can use a map program like the built-inApple Mapsand theGoogle Maps appfor iPhone to display nearby places to stay. Just search for \u201chotels\u201d with the name of a town you are near. The app should show you lodging choices and provide an option (usually the icon of a car) to see the driving directions when you select an establishment.\nFiddling with a phone screen is dangerous when driving, and bothAppleMaps and Google Maps have an audio-navigation feature that provides turn-by-turn directions to a specific address while you are behind the wheel. You can use Apple\u2019sSiri personal assistantor the voice-search functions built intoGoogle\u2019s search appto seek out local hotels without having to type.\nYou can also find apps dedicated to showing all the coming hotels, restaurants and other local businesses near each exit as you drive.RoadNinjaandiExitare two such apps with both iOS and Android versions available, and can supply directions from your location.\nIf you would like to use the MacBook Air\u2019s bigger screen and keyboard to do the hotel-searching before you leave, you can use the desktop editions of Apple\u2019sMapsprogram, (available in OS X 10.9 and later) or theGoogle Mapssite to do the research. Both programs let yousend your maps and directions to your iPhonefor mobile reference.\nUsing your phone as a GPS unit is handy, but it runs the battery down. Packinga mobile phone chargerthat plugs into the car\u2019s dashboard power port can keep the iPhone going, too.\nStopping\nThe Surface Sync\nQ.How do I make Microsoft OneDrive stop syncing my browser history between my Surface and Windows 8.1 PC?\nA.The OneDrive service cansync personal settings and databetween machines that all use the same Microsoft account, but if you would rather keep your browsing sessions separate on the device you are using, start in the Settings area. Swipe in from the right side of a touch screen or move the cursor up from the desktop\u2019s lower-right corner, then select Settings and Change PC Settings.\nChoose OneDrive and then Sync Settings. On this screen, you can turn off syncing for your browsing history and anything else you no longer wish to keep synchronized between devices.\nTIP OF THE WEEKIf you have to get back to work before you finish watching your lunchtime selection of YouTube videos, you can mark clips for later viewing if you have a YouTube account. In the desktop browser, move the cursor over the video to show the toolbar along the bottom of the clips\u2019s window and then click the clock icon. When the clock changes to a checkmark, the video is saved.\nLater, when you have time to view the saved clips, log into your YouTube account. Under the YouTube logo on the left side of the window, click Watch Later from the menu to see the saved videos and play them at your leisure. If you do not see theWatch Later list, click the menu icon next to the YouTube logo. In the YouTube mobile app, you can save videos to your Watch Later list by tapping the plus (+) sign in the clip\u2019s toolbar and choosing \u201cAdd to Watch Later\u201d from the menu.J.D.

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is going big on solar.\nTimothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at an investors\u2019 conference on Tuesday that Apple planned to build an $850 million solar farm that would power its California operations, including\n                                        its new Cupertino campus, stores and a data center in Fremont.\nApple said it teamed up withFirst Solar, a solar-energy equipment supplier, to construct the solar farm in Monterey County. The farm is\n                                        expected to be completed by the end of 2016, First Solar said.\nApple\u2019s investment in the solar farm is a significant expansion of its efforts to shift toward renewable energy sources, including wind and solar, to power its operations. Renewable energy has powered the company\u2019s\n                                        corporate campuses in Austin, Tex., and Sacramento for many years. In 2013, Apple completed a transition to using 100 percent renewable energy to power its data centers.\nLast week, the company said it wouldinvest $2 billionto\n                                        convert a closed sapphire glass plant in Arizona into a data center that would be powered mostly by solar energy.\nMr. Cook said in an onstage interview at a Goldman Sachs conference here that the company was looking to address the issue of climate change.\n\u201cWe know at Apple that climate change is real,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the conference. \u201cThe time for talk is past. The time for action is now.\u201d\nMr. Cook has been vocal about his views on issues such as environmentalism and gay rights.\nApple\u2019s market capitalization rose to $710.7 billion on Tuesday, making Apple the first American company to close above $700 billion. Shares of Apple ended 1.9 percent higher, at $122.02.\nLater in the interview, Mr. Cook also talked about the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s smartwatch, which is set for release in April. The Apple Watch will not be the first smartwatch on the market, but Mr. Cook noted\n                                        that MP3 players and tablets that came out before the iPod and iPad were too difficult to use or had niche applications.\n\u201cI see the smartwatch category very much like that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nHe said consumers would like the features and many apps that would be available for the Apple Watch. One feature nudges users with a tap on the wrist when they have been sitting too long, encouraging them to stand up,\n                                        he said.\nA version of this article appears in print on 02/11/2015, on pageB2of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Apple to Build Solar Farm for California Operations."

        "title": "Deleting Files From Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive",
        "fulltext": "Q.I have Windows 8.1 on my desktop computer. I moved a document to the OneDrive, which I did not mean to do, so how do I delete it?\nA.Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive(the cloud-storage service formerly known as SkyDrive) is designed to let you transfer files and folders easily to an online server from either the desktop mode or the app-tiled Modern interface. However, it is also quite easy to drag a file from the computer\u2019s desktop and inadvertently drop it on the OneDrive icon in the Windows File Explorer.\nBefore you delete the file from OneDrive, check to see if it was eithercopied or moved, as these are two different actions. Copying a file to OneDrive puts a duplicate in the online folder, while leaving the original where it was on the computer. Moving the file removes it from your PC and relocates it on the OneDrive server.\nIf this is your only copy and you want to keep the file, go to the Windows 8.1 desktop mode, click on the OneDrive icon in the left pane of the window and drag the file back to the computer\u2019s desktop.\nIf this is a duplicate or otherwise unwanted file that is now parked on OneDrive, you canremove it in a couple of ways. In the Windows Desktop mode, open the File Explorer, click on the file and press the Delete key. In the OneDrive app for Windows 8.1\u2019s Modern interface, you can delete an open file by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and selecting the Delete button.\nYou do not even have to be on your own PC to delete a file from OneDrive. From the web browser on just about any computer, you can also log into theOneDrive sitewith the name and password for your Microsoft account, and select each item you want to remove by clicking the box in the upper-right corner. Then, from the toolbar at the top of the page, select Manage and choose Delete.\nThe OneDrive website has its own recycle bin, so if you accidentally trash a file, you canrestoreit by opening the Recycle Bin icon at the bottom-left of the window and choosing the Restore option. (You can also fish out deleted files from OneDrive in Windows File Explorer by opening the desktop Recycle Bin.) Files in the OneDrive Recycle Bin are deleted permanently after one year \u2014 or after three days if you have maxed out your online storage space and your bin is full.\nChecking a Firewall\u2019s Status\nQ.My computer is supposed to come with its own firewall, but I don\u2019t remember setting it up. How can I tell if the firewall is actually on?\nA.Most recent versions of Windows and Mac OS X come with the built-in firewall software turned on by default, or as a personalization step during the computer\u2019s initial setup \u2014 but you can double-check your settings. (For those running third-party security software, that program may have turned off the system\u2019s firewall for one of its own, so check the settings of that specific application for the firewall\u2019s status.)\nInWindows 8.1, open the Search charm by swiping in from the right side of the screen with a finger or pointing the cursor to the upper-right corner of the screen and then moving it down to the Search icon that appears. Type \u201cfirewall\u201d into the Search box, and select Windows Firewall from the list. (On aWindows 7system, you can find Windows Firewall in the Control Panel.) Opening the Windows Firewall lets you see its status and settings.\nMacs runningOS X 10.5.1 (and later)also include firewall software. In the current version,OS X 10.10 Yosemite, you can find the settings by going to System Preferences in the Apple menu. In the System Preferences box, click the Security & Privacy icon and then click theFirewall tabto see if the program is turned on or off."

        "title": "Google and Apple Fight for the Car Dashboard",
        "fulltext": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 When Google hosted a boot camp here this month for its Android operating system, there were some new faces in the room: auto manufacturers.\nThey made the trip to learn about Android Auto, a new dashboard system meant to let a smartphone power a car\u2019s center screen. Tasks as varied as navigation, communication and music apps, all constantly talking to the cloud. And to the driver.\nA similar scene is playing out just a few miles down the road at Apple, where a rival system, CarPlay, has been developed for iPhone users.\nAfter years of being treated as an interesting side business, autos have become the latest obsession for Silicon Valley, with Appleassigning about 200 peopleto work onelectric vehicletechnology and Google saying it envisionsthe public using driverless carswithin five years.\nBut nowhere is that obsession playing out more immediately than in the battle to develop the next generation of cars\u2019 dashboard systems. In the coming weeks and months, dealerships around the country will begin selling vehicles capable of running Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, or both.\nThe systems go far beyond currently available Bluetooth pairing for playing music or making a hands-free call, and allow for Google\u2019s or Apple\u2019s operating system to essentially take over the center screen and certain buttons within the car.\n\u201cConsumers have spoken,\u201d said John Maddox, assistant director of the University of Michigan\u2019sMobility Transformation Center. \u201cThey expect to have coordination between their phone and their vehicle.\u201d\nHere at Google\u2019s headquarters, Android Auto is about to make its debut in Americans\u2019 cars after two years in development. Plug in a smartphone with a USB cord and the system powers up on a car\u2019s screen. The phone\u2019s screen, meanwhile, goes dark, not to be touched while driving.\nApple\u2019s CarPlay works similarly, with bubbly icons for phone calls, music, maps, messaging and other apps appearing on the center screen. (Apple declined to comment for this article.)\nWhile the idea of constantly connected drivers zipping along roads raises concerns about distracted driving, both companies say their systems are designed with the opposite goal: to make cellphone-toting drivers safer.\n\u201cWe looked at what people do with their phones in the car, and it was scary,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, the lead project manager of Google\u2019s Android Auto team. \u201cYou want to say to them, \u2018Yikes, no, don\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Brenner said his team tried to figure out how to minimize distraction during tasks people frequently do while driving, while also deciding what should be prevented in the car altogether. Google even built its own driver-distraction lab, to test different variations.\nAndroid Auto, for example, has no \u201cback\u201d button like the smartphone version. No \u201crecents\u201d button either. Google Maps has been adjusted to make fonts bigger and streets less detailed, for easier reading while driving.\nNo action should take more than two seconds \u2014 consistent with the Transportation Department\u2019svoluntary guidelines.\n\u201cThings that we don\u2019t show are just as important as what we do show,\u201d Mr. Brenner said.\nMusic is most definitely in. Streaming video? Most definitely not. Most social media will also be blocked, and texts can be sent only with voice commands. Apps on the screen are optimized for speed: glance, touch and eyes back to the road.\n\u201cIt\u2019s these little glances at the screen that people do in a car,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that\u2019s very glanceable, that can be seen and done quickly.\u201d\nOn a recent afternoon, Mr. Brenner drove through the streets here in a Hyundai Sonata equipped with a demonstration version of Android Auto. Part techie, part car guy, Mr. Brenner was hired two years ago after Google discovered he had rigged up a Nexus 7 tablet to his dashboard in an early attempt to make his own connected car.\n\u201cNavigate to Krispy Kreme,\u201d he said after settling into the driver\u2019s seat. Up popped the nearest location on the screen, and a voice began turn-by-turn directions. A little music never hurt either: \u201cPlay Black Sabbath,\u201d he said.\nThe Krispy Kreme near Google\u2019s campus played a notable role for Mr. Brenner and his team of engineers. It was the destination they always tried to reach during testing without Android Auto failing along the way.\n\u201cThey thought we were a little nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would pull up with four people taking notes and order three dozen doughnuts for the engineering team.\u201d\nIt took until last April to finally succeed in making the trip without a glitch. They added some Champagne to bring back from that doughnut run.\nWhen the Android Auto project began, it included a core group of automakers like General Motors, Audi, Honda and Hyundai. Now, as it prepares for its debut, roughly two dozen car brands have signed on to offer it soon. Apple has teamed up with roughly the same number of brands, many of which will offer both systems.\nMost automakers are staying mum on their exact start dates, but Hyundai is expected to act shortly, and Volkswagen has indicated availability for its next Golf. G.M. has said the same about its Spark subcompact.\nOne of the most widespread adopters will be Ford, which this year will begin offering both Android Auto and CarPlay in conjunction with the revamping of the automaker\u2019s much-criticized Sync system. By the end of 2016, they will be available on all Fords sold in the United States.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to have to make a vehicle choice based on which mobile phone they have,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director for connected vehicles and services. \u201cWe want to accommodate all customers and their devices.\u201d\nWhile automakers traditionally aimed to control all aspects of the infotainment experience \u2014 building their own closed-off, proprietary systems \u2014 the results were not always stellar. And the pace of technology meant a car\u2019s hardware and software could become dated quickly.\nIn some cases, the systems carried what seemed to be needless costs, like an annual fee for updating map software \u2014 something unthinkable for any user of Google Maps or Apple Maps.\nMr. Butler said that leveraging smartphones and the ecosystem of apps surrounding them provided a new way forward.\n\u201cThe challenge with closed systems is you need to predict where the future is heading, or have enough robustness that it\u2019s future proof, which of course is virtually impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s better to put a broad platform for innovation in place.\u201d\nOne area where automakers have struggled mightily, but the tech giants have found more success, is in voice recognition. Using voice commands has huge potential to help keep drivers\u2019 eyes focused on the road. The challenge there is that they have to work.\n\u201cMany of the systems out there now in cars, the voice interface is almost unusable,\u201d said Mr. Maddox, the University of Michigan transportation expert. \u201cIt\u2019s inaccurate, people get frustrated and they\u2019ll just stop using it.\u201d\nJ.D. Power\u2019s 2014 Initial Quality Study found that consumers cited bad voice recognition as their most dissatisfying experience when buying a new car.\nIn Apple\u2019s CarPlay, Siri, the voice-controlled assistant, guides the system, and the company provided specifications to automakers to ensure that a user\u2019s voice is easily understandable while inside the car. If a user\u2019s car has a touch screen or control knobs, CarPlay can be controlled that way as well.\nGoogle has taken similar steps to make sure that consumers can speak as they normally do. As he approached the doughnut shop, Mr. Brenner said that getting consumers comfortable with voice commands is all about allowing them to say things in different ways.\n\u201cI could have said \u2018Take me to Krispy Kreme,\u2019 or \u2018Go to Krispy Kreme\u2019 or even just \u2018Krispy Kreme\u2019 and it would have figured out what I wanted,\u201d he said.\nBut despite the momentum building in Silicon Valley, not all automakers are sold on the idea of giving up their dashboards to the tech giants.\nJohn Hanson, the national manager of Toyota\u2019s advanced technology communications, said while the company talked frequently with both Google and Apple, it currently had no plans to adopt Android Auto or CarPlay in the United States.\n\u201cWe may all eventually wind up there, but right now we prefer to use our in-house proprietary platforms for those kinds of functions,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.\nFiat Chrysler, considered to have one of the better infotainment platforms on the market, has signed on to support Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s systems. But a bit of lament is evident.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that our systems deliver a good experience for our customers,\u201d said Eric Mayne, a spokesman at Chrysler. \u201cBut we\u2019re not standing still either.\u201d\nAs Mr. Brenner pulled into the drive-through line at Krispy Kreme, the attendant on duty, seeing three people in the car, asked: \u201cYou guys want anything?\u201d\n\u201cOne original glazed doughnut please,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cOnly one?\u201d came the surprised response. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re all set,\u201d he said."

More tech workers\n                                        are choosing to live in urban areas like San Francisco and commute to suburban corporate campuses 30 or even 60 miles away. That has created competition for scarce housing, driving up rents and home prices.\nThe working conditions of the drivers \u2014 who make it possible for big tech companies to recruit employees who live far away \u2014 have become one flash point in the region\u2019s debate over the gap between\n                                        highly paid technology workers and the lower-paid workers who provide crucial support services.

        "title": "Tax Reform Is the Cry, Until Details Are Offered",
        "fulltext": "\nIt has been a regular refrain from corporate America\u2019s chief executives, \u201cCorporate tax in this country needs to be reformed,\u201dJeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive ofGeneral Electric, has said repeatedly.Timothy D. Cook,Apple\u2019s\n                                        chief executive, told lawmakers, \u201cApple has recommended to the Obama administration and several members of Congress \u2014 and suggests to the subcommittee today \u2014 to pass legislation thatdramatically simplifies the U.S. corporate tax system.\u201d\nOn Monday, the business world got its wish from President Obama \u2014 aproposed overhaul of corporate tax policyin\n                                        the United States \u2014 but not in the way it might have hoped.\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget calls for a lower overall tax rate \u2014 28 percent, down from 35 percent. But it also calls for a one-time 14 percent tax on all cash sitting overseas and a 19 percent tax on all\n                                        foreign profits in the future, minus taxes paid abroad. The one-time tax would hit hardest the businesses with huge cash piles abroad like G.E. ($110 billion),Microsoft($74 billion),Pfizer($69 billion) and Apple ($54.4 billion).\nThe plan was greeted by big business, at least privately, with disgust, if not disdain. It was called everything from \u201cconfiscatory\u201d to \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d RepresentativePaul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the president\u2019s budget was based on \u201cenvy economics.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the rub: While chief executives often give lip service to the need for corporate tax reform \u2014 and some believe in it \u2014 when it comes right down to it, companies aren\u2019t necessarily\n                                        interested in a simpler tax system, just one that significantly lightens their tax burden.\nThat\u2019s a pretty high hurdle when you consider that the true tax rate for cash sitting abroad isn\u2019t the statutory 35 percent, it\u2019s zero because foreign profits aren\u2019t taxed in the United States\n                                        unless the money is brought back.\nIt helps explain why true tax reform is going to be so challenging: any rate higher than zero hits a company\u2019s bottom line.\nJust last week, the senatorsRand Paul, Republican\n                                        of Kentucky, and Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, proposed a one-time tax holiday that would allow companies to repatriate cash at a 6.5 percent rate and use the money to finance the Highway Trust Fund. That\n                                        was considered too high by some executives because it was more than the 5.25 percent tax rate that Congress used when it granted a tax holiday in 2004. (Tax holidays, as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous DealBook\n                                        columns, are a terrible idea because they create a perverse incentive for companies to keep stashing cash abroad in hopes Congress will grant another tax holiday.)\nAnd the idea of a mandatory one-time tax on all foreign cash is likely to run into opposition, even though such a tax is necessary for practical purposes as part of any transition to a more globally oriented tax regime.\n\u201cA 14 percent tax on corporate earnings held overseas is totally out of the question; the White House threw out that figure as a first offer,\u201d Gregory R. Valliere, chief political strategist at the Potomac\n                                        Research Group, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIf that 14 percent figure was lowered to, say, 5 percent, then things might get very interesting.\u201d\nIt is worth noting that a 2014 proposal by Representative David Camp, Republican of Michigan and former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who retired last year, included a one-time mandatory tax of 8.75\n                                        percent on foreign cash. Of course, that proposal didn\u2019t go anywhere, either.\n\u201cObama\u2019s deemed repatriation tax isn\u2019t all that unreasonable of a plan,\u201dJeremy Scott, editor in chief of Tax Analysts commentary,\n                                        wrote. \u201cThe idea of using a reduced rate to tax profits permanently reinvested overseas has been a part of almost every serious international tax reform plan for the last several years.\u201d\nIf United States chief executives were focused on economic perspective, they would recognize that a one-time tax of 14 percent on overseas cash would cause little distortion or change in behavior as part of a transition\n                                        to a new system that would tax all foreign income at 19 percent.\n\u201cTaxing those earnings as part of the transition to an entirely new international tax system will have no effect on future behavior, since the earnings hoard relates entirely to the past,\u201dEdward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at theUniversity of Southern Californiaand former staff director of the Joint Tax Committee,told Congress last year. \u201cThus demands for a very low transition tax rate on the repatriation of existing foreign earnings in the context of tax reform are precisely backwards as an\n                                        economic matter.\u201d\nAs for President Obama\u2019s plan to tax foreign profits regardless of whether they are brought home or not, the business community is, of course, already pushing back.\n\u201cThis is the wrong direction for corporate reform,\u201d James Pethokoukis of theAmerican Enterprise Institutewrote. \u201cUnder a better territorial system, theI.R.S.would only seek to tax those profits earned in the United States. American companies with foreign-earned profits would be free\n                                        to leave that dough overseas or bring them home without any further tax consequences.\u201d\nAt issue is how our biggest companies pay taxes on foreign profits. In most other developed countries, companies pay taxes only to the jurisdiction in which they do business.\n\u201cThe fact is I\u2019d take Germany\u2019s or Japan\u2019s or the U.K.\u2019s corporate tax policy today, sight unseen, without any dispute,\u201d Mr. Immelt said atDartmouth Collegein 2011. \u201cI would take any of those tax policies today.\u201d\nThe trillion-dollar question is whether any of these machinations around tax reform will spur the economy and job growth. And that remains open to debate.\n\u201cA repatriation deal could have a significant impact on stock buybacks, dividends, M.&A. activity, business fixed investment, etc.,\u201d Mr. Valliere said. \u201cWhether it would lead to a surge in hiring\n                                        is debatable; it didn\u2019t when earnings were repatriated a decade ago.\u201d (Companies that received the tax benefits on $150 billion of repatriated cash later cut at least 20,000 jobs.)\nHe puts the odds of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal leading to a deal before the next election at 35 percent.\n\u201cWhy not better odds?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause the vehicle would have to be corporate tax reform, and the details are daunting.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in print on 02/03/2015, on pageB1of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Tax Reform Is the Cry, Until Details Are Offered."

        "title": "Aiming to Ease App Discovery, Apple Pairs With Pinterest",
        "fulltext": "Updated, 12:09 p.m.\nThere are more than 1.4 million mobile applications in Apple\u2019s App Store. This is a good thing for Apple\u2019s customers, because the choices are practically endless. This is also a bad thing for Apple\u2019s\n                                        customers, because the choices are practically endless.\nUnless you have a good idea of what you\u2019re looking for, it can be tough to stumble upon novel, surprising items among Apple\u2019s sprawling garden of apps.\nPinterest, the popular social bookmarking start-up, thinks it has a fix for this. The company isunveiling a new producton Thursday that could make it easier for people to discover new smartphone apps without even having to go into Apple\u2019s App Store.\nThe product, called App Pins, aims to do the same thing for smartphone apps that Pinterest\u2019s service has done for photos, recipes and many other types of websites. In short, the service is a type of digital corkboard\n                                        that lets visitors save, or \u201cpin,\u201d items they like or places they want to go.\nPinterest\u2019s philosophy is that it can help nudge people into doing things \u2014 be it buying a coffee maker or trying a new recipe \u2014 by letting the site\u2019s 70 million estimated regular visitors\n                                        search for and save for later the things that interest them. If I\u2019m looking to buy a good espresso machine, for instance, I could head over to La Marzocco\u2019s website and pin a link to the$7,000 GS/3to my Pinterest board to buy it later.\nThat same philosophy goes for smartphone apps. I could search for \u201chealth\u201d on Pinterest and come across a fitness app that I may want to download. With App Pins, it takes only a few taps to download the\n                                        app directly to my phone, without ever having to leave Pinterest to do so.\n\u201cWe can be a really powerful service for app discovery, which is a problem that still really hasn\u2019t been solved,\u201d Evan Sharp, a founder of Pinterest, said in an interview. \u201cOur specialty\n                                        is really connecting people to the things they want to do.\u201d\nThe pairing, which is currently exclusive with Apple\u2019s iOS apps, and not Google\u2019s Android apps, is not without precedent. Facebook says it helps millions of people discover apps in its News Feed, and last\n                                        year, Twitter gave small developers the ability to promote their apps on the service.\nPinterest believes it is better positioned to help promote apps because of the nature of the service. People come to Pinterest, the company says, to find new things to do, see and buy. That is unlike Facebook, which\n                                        has been used to connect with friends, or even Twitter, which is often about public discourse and news.\nIn addition, more than 75 percent of Pinterest\u2019s use comes from mobile users, a crowd more able and willing to download new apps.\nIt is also a significant move for Apple, which has long surfaced popular smartphone apps via the \u201cfeatured\u201d section of its App Store. If an app is placed in Apple\u2019s featured section, which is carefully\n                                        curated by Apple employees, it is much more visible than the hundreds of thousands of other apps in the company\u2019s gigantic repository.\nIn the past, Apple has had some difficulty with providing adequate app search to its customers, and has made several moves to better surface apps. In 2012, Apple bought Chomp, an app search company, and it has also\n                                        introduced a host of new features to the app store ace apps, including a menu that shows which apps are trending in popularity at the moment, and also gave users the ability to search by categories and sub-categories\n                                        of apps.\nAlong with Pinterest\u2019s App Pins initiative, Apple will introduce its own curated App Store account on Pinterest, featuring multiple boards on the service on Thursday; it will use its in-house team to promote\n                                        apps that will vary by season, theme and even the choices of so-called \u201cguest pinners.\u201d\nApple also has an App Store Twitter account, which has close to 3.5 million followers, as well as an App Store Facebook Page, which is liked by more than 11 million people.\nPinterest said it did not yet have any plans to make money directly from App Pins. However, if Pinterest aims to follow in the footsteps of other social networks, App Pins could be significant for Pinterest\u2019s\n                                        business.\nLike Facebook and Twitter, which offer paid app advertising products, the new Pinterest product could, in time, be a way for developers to promote their applications across the social network."

        "title": "Apple Grabs 93% of the Handset Industry\u2019s Profit, Report Says",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s record-breaking holiday quarter, which brought in$18 billionin earnings, allowed the company to capture\n                                        93 percent of the profit in the handset industry, according to a new report from Canaccord Genuity, an investment firm.\nSamsung took the rest, but its share is shrinking, the report said.\nCanaccord Genuity\u2019s report on industry profits a year ago estimated thatApple took\u00a087.4 percentof phone earnings in the fourth quarter of 2013, while Samsung took in 32.2 percent of industry profits. (The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because Apple and Samsung combined made more money than other\n                                        competitors lost.)\nThe report acknowledges that it may be overstating Apple\u2019s profit because it does not include estimates\u00a0for some Chinese vendors like Xiaomi, which\u00a0is one of\u00a0the biggest smartphone makers in China,\n                                        the largest smartphone market in the world. The report notes that no estimate could be drawn because Xiaomi,\u00a0a private company, does not disclose\u00a0its profit numbers.\nHowever, Xiaomi\u2019s profit model does not primarily rely on smartphone sales.\u00a0Thecompanysells\n                                        its phones for nearly the same amount it costs to buy and assemble the materials. To make money, Xiaomi focuses on selling apps, games, and special Android operating system themes and Internet services.\nThe upshot of the report is that Samsung\u00a0is losing ground in its fight\u00a0with Apple\u00a0for smartphone dominance.\u00a0Samsung still sells more cellphones than any other company. But its profit is eroding because\n                                        Apple is eating into its sales of high-end smartphones, a trend that is likely to continue after\u00a0the enormous success of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Both iPhones, which include bigger screens, gaveApple a huge boostin China, an important market for Samsung.\nMike Walkley, the Canaccord Genuity analyst who wrote the report, said he estimated that Apple will have nearly half a billion iPhone customers\u00a0by the end of 2015.\n\u201cIf Apple continues to gain high-end smartphone market share,\u201d Samsung will be the most affected maker of Android smartphones, he added."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While Apple has been preparing to release its first wearable computers, the company has also been busy assembling a team to work on an automobile.\nThe company has collected about 200 people over the last few years \u2014 both from inside Apple and potential competitors like Tesla \u2014 to develop technologies for an electric car, according to two people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans, who asked not to be named because the plans were private.\nThe car project is still in its prototype phase, one person said, meaning it is probably many years away from being a viable product and might never reach the mass market if the quality of the vehicle fails to impress Apple\u2019s executives.\nIt could also go nowhere if Apple struggles to find a compelling business opportunity in automobiles, a business that typically has much lower sales margins than the products the company currently sells, like the iPhone.\nMany of Apple\u2019s newer employees have come from companies that specialize in battery and automotive technologies. Applehas hiredmany engineers from A123 Systems, Tesla and Toyota to work on advanced battery technologies.\nApple\u2019s hiring spree of automotive experts more recently accelerated as the company\u2019s plans came into sharper focus, according to a lawsuit filed this month in Massachusetts federal court.\nA123 Systems, a company in Livonia, Mich., that makes batteries for electric cars, said in its complaint that Apple \u201cembarked on an aggressive campaign\u201d in June to poach its employees. A123 is accusing five former workers of violating their noncompete agreements by leaving their jobs to perform similar roles for Apple.\n\u201cUpon information and belief, Apple is currently developing a large scale battery division to compete in the very same field as A123,\u201d the lawsuit said. Michael Rosen, A123\u2019s lead attorney, declined to comment.\nThe Financial Timesfirst reportedthat Apple had been hiring automotive experts to form a secret research lab.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nApple has long had partnerships with automakers like BMW and Volkswagen to offer systems compatible with iPods inside cars.\nLast year, Apple introduced CarPlay, a system that allows users to link iPhones directly with the so-called infotainment systems for some cars."
