        "title": "The Tech That Needs Fixing in 2024, and What Got Fixed Last Year",
        "fulltext": "Tech companies would like us to believe that their products tella story about progress. Faster phones! Better cameras! Brighter screens! Yet despite all the improvements, there are pieces of tech that have been flawed for years.\nText messaging technology, which created what many call the \u201cgreen vs. blue bubble\u201d disparity, has madetexting between Apple and Android phones a subpar experiencefor nearly as long as smartphones have existed. Newer inventions, such asself-driving carsandcryptocurrency, continue to put people in harm\u2019s way.\nTo give credit where it\u2019s due, there were some improvements last year that were big wins for consumers. We now have acommon power cablefor charging our many gadgets. So-calledfoldable smartphones that open and close like a booknow have consumer-friendly software. Companies also made strides inwireless phone service technology,which greatly simplified the process for people to switch phone plans and save lots of money.\nWith the start of a new year, let\u2019s look ahead at the tech that needs improvement this year and reflect on the solutions we found in 2023.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the green bubble?\u201d Among smartphone users, this has become a common question inside group texts. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But when texts are sent between iPhone users and Android users, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.\nThe technological incompatibility betweensmartphones has created a deeper sociological divide. In schools, children with Android phones are often mocked and excluded from activities by those with iPhones, according to education experts. And some adults using dating apps perceive messages sent through a green bubble to be a \u201cred flag\u201d for a potential suitor\u2019s financial instability because some Android phones cost less than iPhones.\nLater this year, a big part of these texting issues will be fixed. Apple said itplanned to adopt rich communication services, a modern texting standard that Google and Android phone makers use for messaging. Text messages sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but videos and images will load in high resolution, and features like location sharing and read receipts will also work inside texts. But it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to end the bubble war.\nThe rise and fall of Cruise, a self-driving car company, is a cautionary tale for Silicon Valley\u2019s modus operandi of placing innovation above all else, including public safety. In October, a few months afterCalifornia regulators allowed Cruise and Waymo to fully operatepaid driverless taxi services, a Cruise vehicle struck a San Francisco pedestrian and dragged the victim for 20 feet.\nShortly after, regulators ordered Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, to halt its robotaxi service. The companycut 25 percent of its work force, and Kyle Vogt, the company\u2019s chief executive, resigned.\nHere\u2019s hoping 2024 is a better year for autonomous driving technology. Waymo, the driverless car company spun out of Google, continues to test its services with far less controversy. Waymo cars are still not as proficient as a competent driver \u2014 in my experience, they can struggle to find pickup zones, stop abruptly and take inefficient routes \u2014 but then again, many human drivers can be just as annoying.\nFor the average person experimenting with cryptocurrency, the premise of the technology has been dubious fromthe start: You buy virtual currency through a decentralized system of computers, similar to the way Wikipedia is run by a decentralized network of writers. This, in theory, offers privacy and gives consumers more control of their money than a traditional bank does.\nThespectacular implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchangeunderscored the sheer risks of hoarding money in a decentralized financial service. When FTX declared bankruptcy in 2022, those with holdings there lost their money, although they could still recoup some in the bankruptcy process. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was convicted in November of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, which involved stealing $10 billion from customers to finance political contributions, venture capital investment and lavish purchases, including a five-bedroom penthouse in the Bahamas.\nOther than the inherent risks of entrusting cash with an unregulated and relatively unknown group, there is still no strong use case for cryptocurrency for the average person. While there may be plenty of things to buy with crypto, the transaction process, which involves using third-party crypto wallet apps, remains more complex and time-consuming than making traditional payments with a credit card or bank service.\nEveryone is familiar with this scenario: You\u2019re on the road and thought you packed your charging cables for your phone, laptop and earbuds. But you realize that just one wire was left at home, so it\u2019s off to the drugstore to buy another. This annoying predicament was exacerbated by companies (namely Apple) that designed their products to work with proprietary chargers.\nThanks to a newEuropean mandate requiring all portable devices to use a common charger, we\u2019re now a step closer to the dream of carrying just one charger for all of our devices. Last year, new iPhones no longer shipped with the Lightning port that Apple had been using for more than a decade. Instead, theyshipped with USB-C, the oval-shaped charging port that is commonly used by many laptops, Android phones and audio accessories. What a relief.\nFor the last four years, smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola have beenhyping smartphones that can be folded or unfoldedto decrease or increase their screen size. The devices received little fanfare because they were cumbersome to use, their software was gimmicky \u2014 and, at nearly $2,000, they were more than double the cost of traditional handsets.\nLast year, Google released thePixel Fold, a foldable phone that fixed many of the problems and gave a clear answer for why the category should exist. Unfolded, it transforms into a tablet that makes reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. Folded up, it becomes a regular smartphone that is not too chunky inside a pocket. In my tests, its camera was also excellent, and battery life was long.\nThe remaining issue is price. At $1,800, the Pixel Fold may be inaccessible to most people. But the maturation of the technology offers an exciting glimpse of what\u2019s to come for smartphones and screens in general.\nWhen it began arriving on smartphones about six years ago, eSIM technology, the digital equivalent of the SIM card that carries your phone number, was tough to recommend. The technology was intended to simplify the process of activating a new phone line when you\u2019re taking a smartphone abroad and connecting to a foreign network, for instance. But in the early days, eSIMs were a mixed bag. Some plans failed to activate, and others charged exorbitant rates for stingy amounts of cellular data.\nIn 2023, eSIM technology reached a high point. Now dozens of trustworthy mobile network operators offer fast, reliable wireless services for much less than traditional carriers. The steps to activate eSIMs are now simpler, too.\nThat all leads to benefits that could help you save thousands of dollars over a few years on wireless service. For one, whentraveling abroad, you can easily use eSIM to activate a phone plan and pay a few dollars for a generous bucket of cellular data (for example, $4.50 for one gigabyte of data in Italy using the eSIM app Airalo).\nFor domestic wireless service, if you subscribe to AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon, you can useeSIM to experiment with cheaper phone plans offered by discount carrierslike Visible, Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile that cost as little as $25 a month \u2014 and break up with your big carrier once you\u2019ve found a satisfying phone plan."

        "title": "The True Price of Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro Is Closer to $4,600",
        "fulltext": "WhenApple unveiled the Vision Provirtual reality goggles last year at a technology conference, many in the audience gasped at the price: $3,500. That\u2019s more than quadruple the cost of a new iPhone and 14 times the cost of a competing headset from Meta.\nThe headset, which Apple has marketed as a computer, movie player and gaming machine, will arrive in stores on Friday. Ahead of its release, the discussion has focused on its price: Many have wondered why people would pay so much to do what they could already do with their computers, TVs and game consoles.\nYet the true cost of owning the Vision Pro is probably even higher. Try $4,600. That\u2019s because the price shoots up with the add-ons and accessories that many people would want to buy, including:\nApple\u2019s $200 carrying case to protect the Vision Pro on the go.\nA pair of earphones, such as Apple\u2019s $180 AirPods, to listen to music privately.\nA spare $200 battery pack to get more use from the headset (because with only two hours of battery life, the headset won\u2019t last long enough to play a feature-length movie).\n$100 prescription lens inserts for those who use glasses.\nA spare $200 cushion to make the goggles fit another member of the family.\nAn additional $200 for the larger data storage option (512 gigabytes instead of the 256 gigs on the base model) to hold more videos and apps on the device.\nAnd those are just the extras that many consider must-haves. Other options, including Apple\u2019s $500 extended warranty coverage, a $70 video game controller and a very uncool $50 battery holder to clip onto your pants, could drive the price well above $5,000 \u2014 before tax.\nWhile I have your attention with these breathtaking numbers, we can all learn a valuable lesson from the Vision Pro about \u201cphantom costs,\u201d the add-ons that significantly inflate the amount we spend. For electronics, including smartphones, computers and virtual reality headsets, they can include cases and charging gadgets.\nA clear grasp of the true cost of tech ownership is crucial for any consumers trying to stay in control of their budget, said Ramit Sethi, a personal finance adviser. He said he had learned about phantom costs when he bought a Honda Accord about 20 years ago. He initially thought he was spending $350 a month on the car, to pay off his loan. The true cost ended up $1,000 a month after he added up maintenance, insurance, gas, parking and tolls.\n\u201cCompanies count on you not being able to run the math,\u201d said Mr. Sethi, who hostsa podcast on money psychology. \u201cThe bigger the purchase, the more money you invisibly spend.\u201d\nThese lessons apply to any tech products we regularly use, not just Apple hardware. Let\u2019s run through the phantom costs of a Windows computer and a Samsung phone.\nMicrosoft sells itsSurface Laptop 5at a starting retail price of $1,000. But after some extras are added in the Microsoft store, it\u2019s more realistically a $1,950 laptop \u2014 nearly double the sticker price.\nThe extras include:\n$500 for more memory.\nA pair of earphones, such as Microsoft\u2019s $250 headphones.\n$200 for the Microsoft dock that charges the laptop and connects it to an external display.\nHere, the biggest phantom cost is memory, which is important for helping the computer smoothly run multiple apps at the same time. Typically, computer makers sell their base models with a modest amount of memory that isn\u2019t likely to be enough to keep the computer running fast for many years, so it\u2019s wise to buy the model with extra memory.\nThe $1,000 base model of the Surface Laptop 5 comes with only eight gigabytes of memory, but most people are likely to need double that to smoothly run the latest Windows operating system and new apps and games. The model that includes 16 gigabytes costs an extra $500.\nSamsung\u2019s new high-end smartphone, theGalaxy S24 Ultra, has a starting price of $1,300. But it\u2019s more realistically a $1,540 phone.\nIn the last five years, many smartphone makers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, stopped shipping phones with basic accessories like earphones and charging bricks, a shift that increased their profit margins. And in an echo of the way computer makers upsell memory, the base model of a smartphone typically includes a modest amount of data storage that isn\u2019t likely to be enough to hold your photos, videos and apps for the long haul.\nFirst, a quick aside on storage. An average photo takes up five megabytes, according to Samsung. So shooting 3,000 photos would take up roughly 15 gigabytes. Popular mobile games like Fortnite and Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis gobble up dozens of gigabytes. On Netflix, each hour of video downloaded for offline viewing takes up about a gigabyte. Long story short, data storage can run out fast, so why get 256 gigabytes when you could spend about $100 more for double that?\nUnless you already own accessories to work with your new phone, you\u2019ll have to tack on these extras:\n$30 for the Samsung charging brick.\n$40 for a Samsung protective case.\n$50 for the Samsung wireless earbuds.\nAn extra $120 to get 512 gigabytes to hold more photos and apps. (As of this writing, this data upgrade is free for a limited-time promotion.)\nThat\u2019s not including the cost of using the phone with a modest wireless phone plan for, say, $70 a month. With wireless service included, the cost of owning this Samsung phone over three years is about $112.77 a month, or $4,060 total.\nThe point is not to shame people about buying tech, but to raise awareness of what we\u2019re actually spending on new gadgets, which is a lot more than we think, Mr. Sethi said. That\u2019s why the best practice for most people buying tech products is to hold on to them for as long as they can. This way they maximize the value they get not just from the devices but from the many extras they bought for them along the way.\nFor comparison purposes, the examples above showed the costs of extras like headphones and cases if you bought them directly from the device makers. A simple method to save money would be to shop around for cheaper third-party alternatives, but the purchases would still nonetheless be phantom costs that drove up the overall price of your tech.\nThis all brings us to the biggest phantom cost of regularly buying products like new phones and Apple\u2019s Vision Pro: the price you pay for being an early adopter.\n\u201cThe more you buy a new phone, the more the people around you expect you to have the newest thing, and the more you create an identity that you always have the newest thing,\u201d Mr. Sethi said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest phantom cost of all.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Making Face Computers Cool Isn\u2019t Easy",
        "fulltext": "After years of anticipation, Apple\u2019s first major new product in nearly a decade has arrived. The$3,500 Vision Pro, a face computer that resembles ski goggles, will be released next week.\nSo, what can we expect?\nThe device, which includes high-resolution displays and sensors that track eye movements and hand gestures, is one of Apple\u2019s most ambitious products. It bills the headset as the beginning of an era of \u201cspatial computing,\u201d which blends data with the physical world to make our lives better. Imagine giving a presentation with digital notes shown in the corner of your eye, for example.\nI was among the first group of journalists to try the Vision Pro last year and walked awayimpressed with the quality of the picture but ultimately not surethat people would want to wear it. My skepticism was colored by my experience wearing more than a dozen headsets in the last 12 years from companies like Google, Meta, Snap, Samsung and Sony, including virtual reality goggles that plugged into bulky desktop computers and smart glasses that shot photos. The devices were intended to create immersive experiences for getting things done by moving the body instead of typing on keyboards.\nBroadly speaking, the problem with headsets has less to do with technology and more to do with behavior: People quickly get tired of wearing a computer on their face,the devices end up in closets, and software developers lose interest in making apps. Sales of mixed reality and virtual reality headsetsfell 8.3 percentlast year, according to the research firm IDC, though they may rebound this year with Apple entering the market.\nEven though Apple has a reputation for being late to the party with superior products, as it was with music players and smartphones, the Vision Pro is not guaranteed to be a breakthrough hit, especially with its breathtaking price.\n\u201cIs this Apple entering a market late but coming in with the best product and therefore will be successful?\u201d asked Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst and former Apple marketing director. \u201cOr is there not an existing market because there are no $3,500 headsets aimed for the mass market?\u201d\nTo better understand how an Apple face computer may (or may not) fit into our lives in the future, it\u2019s worth taking this moment to look back at the many face computers I\u2019ve worn that set the scene for the Vision Pro.\nIn 2012, Google unveiled a mixed-reality headset,Google Glass. It was essentially a headband with a camera and a monocle, positioned above your right eye, that contained a transparent display showing calendar and maps software. To demonstrate its exciting potential, Google produced a video of people wearing the face computer whileleaping out of an airplane.\nWhen I tried an early prototype of Google Glass that year, the only working feature was a maps app that showed directions as I walked around a path. This could be useful, in theory, to keep my eyes on the road while driving or bicycling, but at a significant cost: I looked like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d character.\nSure enough, after Google Glass made its public debut, pandemonium ensued. A blogger in San Francisco wasassaulted for wearing one. Memes emerged, including the term\u201cGlasshole\u201dfor anyone who could potentially be recording video of people without their permission. Google eventually marketed the monocle as a businessdevice, but finally killed the product in 2023.\nAfter Google Glass flopped, the tech industry regrouped and tried to address the design and privacy issues. In 2016 and 2021,SnapandMetareleased stylish glasses with cameras and tiny lights that indicated when a user was recording. Both products were unpopular. I recently tested the second-generation Meta glasses and concluded that while they looked satisfyingly hip, the privacy concerns remained becauseno one noticed when I was taking pictures of them.\nThe tech industry was also eager to sell people on a different type of headset for virtual reality. The headsets, which looked like plastic goggles, blocked out your view of the outside world to immerse yourself in a 3-D digital environment and experience something as if you were actually there \u2014 by moving your head around to look at the Grand Canyon, for example.\nTo make virtual reality headsets an easier sell, tech companies like Google and Samsung tried relying on smartphones for their screens and computing power. In 2015, Samsung collaborated with the virtual reality company Oculusto design Gear VR, a headset into which the user could insert a smartphone to look at virtual reality content. In 2016, Google released Daydream VR, a similar product for Android phones.\nWhile the products lowered the cost for people to try VR, I ran into problems with them. The smartphones running VR software became very hot, their batteries drained rapidly and the applications were gimmicky \u2014 one simulation I tried involved staring at a virtual dinosaur. Google killed Daydream VR in 2019, and Samsung announced the end of its VR content services in 2020.\nIn 2016, Oculus, which Meta had acquired for $2 billion two years earlier, released theOculus Rift, a high-end VR system that plugged into a powerful desktop computer. The full bundle, which included the headset, a game controller and a computer, cost $1,500. With 30 games at launch, the product was marketed as a next-generation gaming device.\nVirtual reality games were designed to let you move around as if you were inside the game. A shooting game could involve looking for guns and bending over and using motion controllers to pick them up and fire them at opponents.\nOther similar products followed, including Sony\u2019s $400 PlayStation VR, a headset that plugged into PlayStation consoles. For years, the PlayStation headset dominated the high-powered virtual reality space because it lowered costs by eliminating the need to buy a separate computer. The second-generation PlayStation headset came out last year.\nNonetheless, a Sony executive recentlycalled virtual reality a \u201cchallenging category\u201dbecause VR had not changed much for the games industry. Most people still prefer to play video games on a television.\nIn my experience testing all of these products over the years, they shared the same flaws: The headsets felt heavy, the hardware and wires created clutter in a living room, and there weren\u2019t many compelling games to play.\nStand-alone headsets, which cram the computer, display and sensor technologies into one product, have become the most convenient VR products to date. Since 2019, Meta\u2019s Quest headsets, which range from $250 to $1,000, have used this approach, but the products are still not mainstream hits.\nLast year, Meta released the $500 Quest 3, its first consumer headset with a focus on mixed reality, which uses cameras to see into the real world while using the headset. When firing a gun inside a shooting game, you can take cover behind the couch in your living room, for example. In my tests, I concluded that while the graphics had greatly improved, the headset felt too heavy on my neck after about 15 minutes. I also felt unimpressed with the games and the device\u2019s short battery life of two hours.\nThis brings us all to the product in question: the Vision Pro, which Apple is marketing as a productivity tool to replace your laptop with a virtual screen and digital keyboard, a 3-D movie player and a gaming device.\nAt 21 ounces, the Vision Pro is just as heavy as Meta\u2019s products, and my eyes and neck felt similarly fatigued after I wore it for half an hour.\nThe Apple headset\u2019s battery, a separate brick that connects to the goggles via a wire, delivers two hours of life like Meta\u2019s \u2014 not enough to finish most feature-length movies, let alone get much work done.\nAs for games, no major game studio has yet announced any made specifically for the Vision Pro. The headset does include an app for looking at a 3-D dinosaur, though."

Google\u2019s Assistant Routines and Apple\u2019s Shortcuts app are two free options that may help \u2014 by condensing several actions into one tap or command. Here\u2019s how to get started.\nSay you\u2019d like to ease into the day with a personalized audio briefing \u2014 for example, the day\u2019s weather forecast, commuting conditions, your meeting schedule, and a news summary or podcast. You\u2019d prefer to listen while getting ready for work, but you do not want to keep interacting with the phone. Here\u2019s where theGoogle AssistantforAndroidoriOScomes in, with an easy way todo all that in a Routine.\nDownload the app if you don\u2019t have it, then open the Google Assistantsettingsby voice (\u201cHey, Google, open Assistant Routines\u201d) or by tapping the Settings icon; choose Apps, then Assistant and then Routines. The Routines screen offers several suggestions for different scenarios, like a routine for those work-from-home days, a routine that plays music and adjusts your smart thermostat when you arrive home and a routine for winding down at bedtime. Tap \u201cSet up routine\u201d on the one you want to use, and edit its actions to your liking.\nYou can design your own routine from scratch, too. Tap the + button at the top of the screen, and then, from the menu, select the actions you want to include. Pick a starter phrase or condition that will activate the routine, and follow the rest of the onscreen instructions.\nTo manually run a routine, say your starter phrase; iOS users should have the Google Assistant app open. Routines can be activated automatically by a specific time or event, like sunrise or sunset. Android users can make a home-screen icon that runs the Routine with a tap. (Action Blocks, a Googleaccessibility tool for Android, can alsomake home-screen shortcuts for common actions.)\nRoutines run on Assistant-compatiblesmart speakers,watchesandother devicesas well; Samsung has similar\u201cModes and Routines\u201d toolsfor its Galaxy devices. TheGoogle Guidebookssite has an illustratedtutorial for setting up a Routine.\nApple\u2019sShortcutsapp foriPhone, iPadandMaclets you string together separate actions for a larger task into one little script. The app has gotten easier to use over the years, and recentupdateshave added more features. Just ask Siri to \u201copen Shortcuts,\u201d swipe through your screens until you find it or download it from the App Store.\nThe app includes a large collection of ready-made shortcuts that do things like estimate the travel time to meetings or convert text into audio. To see the included shortcuts, tap the Gallery icon at the bottom of the screen. To add a shortcut to your personal collection, tap the + button on its tile.\nIn the app, tap the Shortcuts icon at the bottom of the screen to see your collection. You can fire off a shortcut by tapping it or byasking Siri to run it. Some shortcuts appear on the Share menu, or you can add home-screen icons for them. Your shortcuts sync with other devices using the same Apple ID, includingan Apple Watch. Additionally, Shortcuts can run automatically when prompted by a specific time or by a certain event.\nIf you don\u2019t see an existing shortcut for something you want to do, create your own (like a shortcut to open the Google Assistant app). Start by tapping the + sign in the upper-right corner of the Shortcuts app. Next, add steps (in the order they should occur) from the menu of actions and apps.\nFor example, if you have a regular FaceTime call with the same group of friends, you can condense those multiple steps into one. Tap the Add Action button, select All Actions from the menu and choose FaceTime from the list. Tap the grayed-out Contact button and add a name from your Contacts list. After you add the first name, tap the + button and repeat the steps until you have added everyone else. Name the shortcut, then tap the Done button.\nYou can save the shortcut to your home screen by tapping the Share menu icon and choosing Add to Home Screen. Tap it to call everyone in the group \u2014 or tell Siri to run that shortcut by name.\nCertain shortcutscan be complicatedto construct, and it may take a few tries to get your creation to work. TheShortcuts User Guideon Apple\u2019s support site has detailed instructions for creating more complex sequences for chores you want to automate, like transcribing voice memos to notes.\nRoutines, Shortcuts and other automations probably won\u2019t cure a serious smartphone addiction. However, theycanhelp you spend fewer minutes squinting at a screen \u2014 and save time in the long run."

        "fulltext": "Ever bought a discounted new phone from Apple? For most people, the answer is no. That\u2019s because Apple doesn\u2019t really do discounts.\nBut in China, Apple is slashing the price of some of its latest iPhones by $70 amid worries that Chinese consumers have cooled on the brand. That would save a buyer about 6 to 8 percent, based on prices onApple\u2019s China website. It has also knocked $112 off the price of some MacBook Air laptops. The sale will start on Thursday and run through Sunday.\nCutting prices on high-end electronics to buyers in China is an unexpected move for Apple, one that highlights the challenges the American company faces in China, where patriotic shoppers are choosing domestic brands amid rising U.S.-China tensions.\nApple and its Chinese rival, Huawei, are on the front lines of abattle over technology between Beijing and Washington that has seen both countries restrict access to foreign technology. Long suspicious of Huawei\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government and wary that its technology could be used for spying, American officials have stopped federal agencies from buying equipment from Huawei and tried to discourage other countries as well.\nChina, for its part, has issued directives to some of its government employees not to use iPhones at work and encouraged domestic brands.\nThe tit-for-tat is not good for business. Apple has a lot to lose from the surge in tensions between the United States and China, a huge market that accounts for one-fifth of its overall revenue.\nOverall sales of smartphones in China fell about 3 percent in 2023 because of the country\u2019s slowing economy. It is also the only major economy tosink into deflationas Chinese cut spending, and household savings rose to a high point.\nHuawei has taken aim at Apple\u2019s market share in China, most recently unveiling a smartphone with an enhanced camera, something that Apple has long advertised as a selling point.\nApple said in November that its overall sales in China had fallen 2.5 percent. The company has reported a drop in sales for three quarters over the last year.\nDiscounts are not unusual ahead of the Lunar New Year, which is next month and one of the biggest shopping periods of the year in China. Apple\u2019s current promotion includes an image of a giant dragon made of iPhones, Apple watches and AirPods, in a nod to the upcoming year of the dragon in the Chinese zodiac.\nThe discounts prompted debate on Chinese social media on Monday.\n\u201cApple will only cut the price of its phones when domestic phones become more popular,\u201d wrote a well-known blogger known as Victorious Zhang Beihai. Another commentator wrote: \u201cIt is still too expensive. I support domestic phones.\u201d\nApple\u2019s Lunar New Year promotion is \u201ca move not commonly seen in the past,\u201d said Toby Zhu, a senior analyst at Canalys, a market research firm. Canalys\u2019s research indicates that Apple\u2019s sales in China fell last summer compared to 2022, but that the company still holds about 66 percent of the market for high-end smartphones in China.\nMr. Zhu added that the models of iPhones under promotion appear to have already sold out.\nStill, he added, \u201cit does indicate the challenges Apple is facing in the mainland China market.\u201d\nOlivia Wangcontributed reporting."

Before the watch went on sale, Apple gave early versions of it tocelebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, featured it infashion publications like Vogueandstreamed a splashy eventon the internet trumpeting its features.\nBut as Apple prepared to sell its next generation of wearable computing, the Vision Pro augmented reality device, it marched far more quietly into the consumer marketplace.\nThe company said ina news release this monththat sales of the device would begin Friday. No big product event was scheduled, though Apple has created a catchy commercial about the device and offered individual demonstrations of it to tech reviewers. And in a departure for the secretive company, the Vision Pro has been tested with more developers than past Apple products were to see what they like and don\u2019t like about it.\nThe toning down of marketing tactics speaks to the challenges facing Apple, a company that has grown so large over the years that new product lines that could one day be worth billions are still a sliver of iPhone sales, which topped $200 billion last year.\nApple\u2019s low-key approach to the Vision Pro also speaks to the challenges associated with selling a device that could still be years away from appealing to mainstream consumers. In addition to explaining what the Vision Pro can do \u2014 as it does with every new device \u2014 Apple must overcome its high price of $3,500, as well as muted interest in augmented reality gadgets that blend the digital and physical worlds. Another challenge: The three-dimensional experience provided by the device can really be understood only through demonstrations.\nApple\u2019s solution is to take it slow and seed interest with developers who may build apps that work with the Vision Pro. The company is expected to pitch the device to more mainstream customers after it has lowered the price and improved the technology.\nAnalysts expect Apple to sell about 400,000 units of the Vision Pro this year. By contrast, the companysold an estimated 12 million Apple Watchesin 2015, analysts said.\n\u201cApple knows that this product is not ready for the masses,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, a tech investment and research firm. \u201cFor them to put a big splash out would be off the mark.\u201d\nApple declined to comment.\nThe Vision Pro has been nearly a decade in the making and cost billions of dollars to develop. The device, which looks like ski goggles, uses cameras and sensors to track people\u2019s eyes and hand movements as they interact on the headset\u2019s display with three-dimensional digital objects like apps and computer screens. It can also record three-dimensional video and play films on screens that look as big as those in a movie theater.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first Apple product you look through and not at,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in June during the product\u2019s introduction.\nBut augmented reality devices have struggled to catch on with consumers. Last year, the tech industry sold 8.1 million augmented reality headsets, an 8.3 percent decrease from the previous year,according to IDC, a market research firm. Sincejumping into the market in 2014, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been selling Oculus and Quest headsets for video games and virtual meetings. Sony, Microsoft and Varjo, a Finnish company, also have augmented reality devices.\nApple has tried to set its device apart from competitors that have described their products as gateways to the metaverse. Rather than use that term, which Neal Stephenson coined in the 1992 novel \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d Apple has called its augmented reality experience \u201cspatial computing.\u201d\nIn its headset guidelines,Apple asked developersnot to refer to the apps that they create as virtual reality or augmented reality products but as spatial computing apps.\n\u201cThey\u2019re maintaining complete control,\u201d said Grant Anderson, the chief executive ofMirrorscape, the maker of an augmented reality app for tabletop games.\nSince the June unveiling, Apple has courted developers it hopes will build apps for the device. It created test labs around the world where developers could try the product.\nIn August, Cristian D\u00edaz, an engineer at Monstarlab, went to a Vision Pro lab in Munich. After stepping through a secret door marked with an Apple logo, he joined several other developers who were each fitted with a headset and given six hours to test their apps and write code in the system.\nMr. D\u00edaz said Apple\u2019s engineers had asked the developers for feedback on the device, including on how the software and development tools worked. They took notes. When Mr. D\u00edaz returned for a second lab experience in London in September, he said, it was clear that Apple had made improvements based on the feedback.\nAmong the changes, Apple made it possible for its engineers to watch what developers were doing inside the headsets by connecting to them with Apple\u2019s wireless communication tool, AirPlay, Mr. D\u00edaz said. That allowed the engineers to assist developers in solving problems as they worked on their apps.\n\u201cWe were like animals in a lab,\u201d said Mr. D\u00edaz, who called the Vision Pro \u201ca great experience.\u201d\nThe approach was something of a departure for Apple. Under its co-founder Steve Jobs, the company largely avoided doing focus groups for its products because he believed that Apple\u2019s job was to figure out what customers wanted before they knew it.\nMr. Cook has been more open to seeking feedback, said Phillip Shoemaker, who worked at Apple for seven years, leading its App Store. Under both Mr. Jobs and Mr. Cook, Apple tested its iPad and Watch products with select developers in Cupertino, Calif. But with the Vision Pro, the company took an unreleased product to developers overseas for the first time.\n\u201cOf all products to do that with, a headset makes sense because a headset is fickle,\u201d said Mr. Shoemaker, the executive director of Identity.com, an identity-verification nonprofit. \u201cThey don\u2019t fit everyone well.\u201d\nIn addition to courting developers, Apple has worked with entertainment companies to outfit the Vision Pro with TV shows, movies, music and sports. Disney has made it possible to watch films from a theater in its streaming app on the device, and Alicia Keys recorded an intimate performance in an immersive, three-dimensional video.\nContent experiences will be key to broadening the device\u2019s appeal, said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. Because headsets close people off from the world, she said, Apple will have to give people reasons to spend time in one.\nTo raise consumer interest, Apple has been running a commercial on national television. Thespot shows clips from famous filmsof people donning headsets, including Luke Skywalker of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Doc Brown of \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d It culminates with a woman pulling on a Vision Pro.\nThe ad is a reminder of theoriginal iPhone commercialthat showed TV and movie clips of people answering the phone, like Lucille Ball in \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d\nApple has been running the Vision Pro ad during National Football League games, according to iSpot.tv, which measures ad spending. Apple spent $6.4 million on the spot during the second week of January. By comparison, it spent $9.3 million onan iPhone adin the first week after the release of the iPhone 15 last September.\n\u201cIs it a product that will be ubiquitous? No,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a product that takes time.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Overhauls App Store in Europe, in Response to New Digital Law",
        "fulltext": "Since Apple introducedthe App Storein 2008, it has tightly controlled the apps and services allowed on iPhones and iPads, giving the company an iron grip on one of the digital economy\u2019s most valuable storefronts.\nNow Apple is weakening its hold on the store, in one of the most consequential signs to date of how newEuropean regulationsare changing consumer technology.\nTo comply with a European Union competition law taking effect on March 7, Apple on Thursday announced major changes to the App Store and other services for consumers in Europe. Users of iPhones and iPads in the 27-nation bloc will for the first time be able to use alternative app stores to download games, productivity tools and other apps. Banks and shopping services can offer competing payment methods inside their apps. People who buy new iPhones in the future will also see a new menu for downloading alternative browsers to Apple\u2019s Safari, such as Chrome and Firefox.\nThe changes are some of the most tangible examples of how acheckerboard of laws and regulationsis now fracturing people\u2019s technology experiences, depending on where they live. In China, government rules force Apple to block apps like virtual-private networks, known as VPNs, which would give users access to the unfiltered internet. In Europe, customers will now have access to competing app stores and other services. In the United States, where there are fewer laws and regulations, Apple and other tech giants have more flexibility to operate as they please.\nThe shifts in the App Store stem from a 2022 law called the Digital Markets Act. The far-reaching law was aimed at loosening the power of the world\u2019s largest tech companies in areas like e-commerce, social media and messaging. Amazon,Meta, Google and Microsoft have also announced changes to comply with the new rules.\n\u201cThe changes we\u2019re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act\u2019s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect E.U. users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings,\u201d Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store, said in a statement.\nEurope accounts for about 6 percent of Apple\u2019s App Store sales, which are estimated to be $24 billion annually worldwide.\nE.U. regulators have long raised alarms that Apple abuses its control over the App Store to stifle competition. The Silicon Valley company has argued that its gatekeeper role protects customers from malware, privacy breaches and flawed apps. But app developers like Spotify andEpic Games, the maker of Fortnite, have said Apple misuses its power by demanding that they pay high fees and forcing them to use underlying technology that it makes.\nFor years, Apple has resisted making the kinds of changes it announced on Thursday. It is unclear if the moves will satisfy European regulators who have vowed to aggressively enforce compliance with the Digital Markets Act.\nA spokesman for the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive branch, declined to comment on Apple\u2019s announcement.\nApple said it would maintain some oversight of new marketplaces and apps working outside its App Store, but warned that the new E.U. policies would give hackers and criminals a new path to distribute malware and defraud customers. The company said it had created a system to monitor all iOS apps, approve alternative app stores and track alternative payment systems.\nApple said developers would also be charged a fee of 50 euro cents for every download of their app after it has been downloaded one million times or more within a 12-month period, regardless of whether it was through the App Store or an alternative. This will also apply to free apps, but not apps distributed by government, education and nonprofit organizations.\nThe new rules could dent Apple\u2019s finances. The App Store\u2019s policy of taking up to 30 percent of developers\u2019 sales has made it a critical piece of the company\u2019s nearly $400 billion business. But it has also opened Apple to criticism and regulatory scrutiny because many developers complained that the fees were unjust.\nIn Europe, Apple said, developers using the App Store will have the option to continue using the existing commission terms, or move to a new fee structure. This will include a reduced commission fee of up to 17 percent for digital goods and services. An additional fee of 3 percent will be charged to developers who use Apple\u2019s payment system.\nTim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic Games, said Apple\u2019s new policies were a \u201chorror show\u201d for developers, filled with \u201cnew junk fees on downloads and Apple taxes on payments they don\u2019t process.\u201d He said Apple was also maintaining the power to block a company like Epic from introducing a games store.\n\u201cApple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,\u201d hesaidin a post on X.\nApple said its fees covered the costs of developing its software and providing tools to developers.\nDevelopers who distribute their app through a competing app store will not be subject to any Apple commission. And developers who provide links to complete payments outside their apps can also forgo certain transaction fees.\nDevelopers will also be able to avoid what some of them have said is a cumbersome review process by Apple of the apps it distributes in its store. But the company has created a new system, which it calls notarization, to maintain some control over the apps distributed across iPhones. Every iPhone app will include an installation key to provide Apple with information on when it was installed and allow the company to do automated scans for malware.\nAs part of the notarization process, apps will provide Apple with descriptions and screenshots of the services they offer, as well as the names of the developers. Apple will share that information with iPhone users before an app is downloaded.\nSpotify did not immediately have a comment on Apple\u2019s announcement. In ablog postthis week, Spotify said the Digital Markets Act would help developers offer new services to customers.\n\u201cDevelopers everywhere are continuing to ask other governments to pass their own laws like the D.M.A.,\u201d the company said.\nApple also introduced a feature for customers to use alternatives to its Wallet app for mobile payments, an increasingly common form of payment for public transportation, restaurants and cafes. Major banks and businesses like PayPal can now offer competing services.\nApple has challenged some elements of the new European law, including a requirement that would open its messaging service, iMessage, to work more smoothly with Android devices. The company has argued that iMessage isn\u2019t subject to the requirements because it is free to customers.\nThe European Union has not made a final decision on the messaging issue."

        "title": "The Apple Vision Pro Is a Marvel. But Who Will Buy It?",
        "fulltext": "Last week, I was ushered by an Apple employee through a security gate, past a manicured lawn, down a flight of stairs and into a tastefully decorated faux living room inside the Steve Jobs Theater to get a preview of the company\u2019s new Vision Pro headset.\nMy demo, like the early tours of the Vision Pro given to other reporters, was far from exhaustive. I spent about 45 minutes wearing the device under the supervision of two watchful Apple employees, who guided me through a curated demo while I sat on a midcentury gray sofa next to them. I wasn\u2019t allowed to take any photos or video of the device itself or take one home for further testing.\nGiven how limited my trial was, I can\u2019t in good conscience tell you whether the Vision Pro is worth the $3,500 \u2014 yes,three thousand five hundred United States dollars\u2014 it costs. (That price doesn\u2019t include tax or thecost of any add-on accessories, such as the $100 Zeiss lens inserts that are required if you wear prescription glasses or contacts, or the $200 travel case.)\nI also can\u2019t say if the Vision Pro solves what I call the \u201csix-month problem.\u201d With many V.R. headsets I\u2019ve tried \u2014 and I\u2019vetried a lot\u2014 the initial novelty fades, and minor annoyances, like blurry graphics or a lack of compelling apps, start to pile up. Six months later, invariably, every headset I test ends up in my closet collecting dust.\nBut I can say two things about my first impressions of the Vision Pro.\nFirst, in many ways, the Vision Pro is an impressive product, one that has been many years and billions of dollars in the making. It\u2019s leaps and bounds better than the previous best V.R. headsets on the market, the Meta Quest series, when it comes to its eye-tracking and gesture-based controls, the quality of its displays and the way it combines immersive virtual experiences with the ability to see the world around you, a feature known as \u201cpass-through.\u201d\nI was primed for skepticism going into my demo \u2014 Apple\u2019s aggressive stage-managing made me wonder what the company was trying to hide \u2014 but there were several moments while wearing the Vision Pro when I felt genuine wonder, and a feeling of being present for what could turn out to be a major shift in computing.\nThe second thing to say about the Vision Pro is that even after trying it, I still have no idea whom or what this thing is supposed to be for. At $3,500, it\u2019s not a device for the masses, or even the mass affluent. It\u2019s a big, honking statement piece \u2014 a status symbol for your face.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say the Vision Pro isn\u2019t compelling, or that I didn\u2019t enjoy testing it. It is, and I did. But after my experience, I have a better idea of the kinds of people who might be tempted to buy one now, and who might be better off waiting.\nIf you\u2019re one of theestimated 40 percentof Americans who have never tried a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro is likely to blow your mind.\nIf this is your first foray into V.R., it\u2019s really worth getting a Vision Pro demo at an Apple store once they go on sale Friday, or cajoling a friend into letting you use his or hers. (V.R. headsets, like boats, are often better to borrow than buy.)\nEarly V.R. headsets were plagued by problems like blurry displays, headache-inducing motion tracking, cheap controllers and the fact that you couldn\u2019t do anything else while wearing them.\nApple has solved a lot of these problems, starting with the Vision Pro\u2019s displays: two screens roughly the size of postage stamps. They\u2019re amazing: crisp, bright, detailed. When you look at them, you feel like you\u2019re peering out of your eyes, not into a screen.\nI was also impressed by the Vision Pro\u2019s immersion toggle, which allows you to see more of what\u2019s happening in the room around you by turning a dial on top of the device.\nUnlike other V.R. systems, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t require controllers. To navigate, you just look at an icon. Then you pinch your thumb and a finger together to select it. The learning curve isn\u2019t steep, but I needed a few minutes to get the hang of it.\nWearing the Vision Pro is comfortable-ish. I say \u201cish\u201d because while it felt fairly light on my head and didn\u2019t give me a headache the way other V.R. headsets have, I did feel some slight discomfort while my eyes adjusted after putting it on and taking it off. (A colleague who also got a demo compared it to the feeling you get when you leave a dark movie theater on a sunny day.)\nI don\u2019t know if these are temporary problems, or if I\u2019d acclimate to them. But they weren\u2019t bad enough to ruin the experience.\nAfter a short setup process, my Apple minder guided me to the Photos app on the Vision Pro. There, I found several examples of what Apple is calling \u201cspatial photos and videos.\u201d These are made using a three-dimensional camera that is built into the Vision Pro itself. (The newest high-end iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, can also take them.)\nI\u2019ve been excited about \u2014 and disappointed by \u2014 the promise of 3-D photos and videos for years. I\u2019m a bit of an obsessive camera dad, and I\u2019ve long awaited the day when 3-D images are good enough to make me feel that I\u2019m actually reliving a family memory, rather than looking at a grainy snapshot.\nLooking at spatial photos and videos on the Vision Pro, I realized that moment had arrived. The photos and videos in Apple\u2019s demo \u2014 which included a scene from a kid\u2019s birthday party, a video of a mom making bubbles for her daughter and a family gathered around a kitchen table \u2014 were gorgeous, and the depth added by the 3-D camera made them uncannily realistic. To my eyes, it felt no different from being part of the scene myself. I got a lump in my throat thinking about rewatching my son\u2019s first steps this way years from now.\nNot everyone is so sentimental. But Apple\u2019s spatial photos and videos got me by the heartstrings, and I imagine other camera-obsessed parents will almost be able to justify the Vision Pro\u2019s steep price tag for the home movie potential alone.\nI was less impressed when it came to work-related tasks.\nApple has billed the Vision Pro as a desk worker\u2019s dream: a spatial computer that allows you to create your perfect desk setup and take it with you anywhere. Users can open any number of virtual windows, resize and move them around in space, and combine them with a real-world Mac display.\nI didn\u2019t get to try writing a column or hosting a podcast in the Vision Pro. But I did try some basic web browsing and typing, and found the experience underwhelming.\nThe pinch-and-drag gesture you use to scroll on a Vision Pro was a pain compared with using a regular mouse or track pad. And typing on the Vision Pro\u2019s virtual keyboard was a slow, clumsy mess. (Just typing nytimes.com into Safari took me the better part of a minute.) Anyone who wants to get real work done on the Vision Pro will most likely need to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which kind of defeats the portability part of the pitch.\nVideo calls may not be much better. I wasn\u2019t able to test FaceTime on the Vision Pro, or third-party video conferencing apps like Zoom, but other reviewers have given Personas \u2014 Apple\u2019s attempt to create a lifelike avatar that can stand in for you on video calls \u2014 athumbs down.\nI did get to try one workplace tool that wasn\u2019t part of the official demo, a version of Keynote, Apple\u2019s slide show app, which lets you rehearse a presentation in a simulated conference room or on a virtual stage. But it felt more like a gimmick than a real productivity enhancer.\nApple is also trying to make the Vision Pro appeal to fans of immersive movies and games.\nMy demo included several movie clips, including a scene from \u201cSuper Mario Brothers 3-D,\" a trailer for \u201cStar Wars\u201d and some Apple-produced clips of various immersive films, like footage from a soccer game and of a scuba diver swimming with sharks. I also saw an interactive video in which a butterfly landed on my finger and a dinosaur appeared to step out of the screen toward me.\nSome of these clips were impressive, and the technology needed to render them on such small screens is nothing to sneeze at. (One clip, of a tightrope walker balancing herself while suspended high above a canyon, was so realistic that it triggered my fear of heights.)\nBut I\u2019ve seen similar things on other V.R. headsets, and the Vision Pro\u2019s movie-watching experience wasn\u2019t superior enough to those models to justify the device\u2019s cost. It doesn\u2019t help that several leading entertainment companies, like Netflix and YouTube,aren\u2019t offering apps for the Vision Pro, so you\u2019ll have to use Apple TV or another compatible service, like Disney+, if you want to get the fully immersive experience.\nI also can\u2019t see myself wanting to play games in a Vision Pro, at least not with the meager game selection available for the device today.Without external controllers, the device isn\u2019t good for fine-grain movement or rapid button pressing, making it a poor choice for serious gamers. And forgetworking out in it; you think I\u2019m going to risk ruining a $3,500 computer with my face sweat?\nThe clearest lesson from my demo \u2014 aside from the fact that I need to spend more time with this thing in order to get a fuller picture of its abilities \u2014 is that the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t blend into its surroundings as well as Apple wants it to.\nApple has avoided marketing the Vision Pro as something that replaces the real world or isolates you in some kind of sci-fi metaverse. It wants using a Vision Pro to feel as subtle and unobtrusive as pulling out an iPhone or a pair of AirPods.\nBut that\u2019s not going to happen, at least not for a while.\nThat\u2019s because most of what\u2019s impressive about the Vision Pro happens in fully immersed V.R. environments, not the kinds of \u201caugmented reality\u201d situations that Apple is envisioning, in which virtual objects are overlaid on your physical surroundings. And while Apple has made it much easier to toggle between virtual and physical worlds, there\u2019s still some friction involved.\nV.R. headsets are still niche enough that they attract attention, which is why the target market for the Vision Pro right now includes both show-offs (people whowantto be noticed wearing the latest high-end Apple gadget) and shut-ins (people who rarely leave their houses anyway, so why does it matter if the device attracts stares?).\nThe novelty factor may wear off, but for now, it\u2019s a real consideration for anyone hoping to fly under the radar while wearing a Vision Pro. Like it or not, Apple has built a device that is too wild to be ignored."

        "title": "U.S. Moves Closer to Filing Sweeping Antitrust Case Against Apple",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple and could file a sweeping antitrust case taking aim at the company\u2019s strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone as soon as the first half of this year, said three people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company\u2019s devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active.\nSpecifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple\u2019s payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said.\nSenior leaders in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division are reviewing the results of the investigation so far, said two of the people. The agency\u2019s officials have met with Apple multiple times, including in December, to discuss the investigation. No final decision has been made about whether a lawsuit should be filed or what it should include, and Apple has not had a final meeting with the Justice Department in which it can make its case to the government before a lawsuit is filed.\nThe Justice Department is closing in on what would be the most consequential federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple, which is the most valuable tech company in the world. If the lawsuit is filed, American regulators will have sued four of the biggest tech companies for monopolistic business practices in less than five years. The Justice Department is currently facing offagainst Googlein two antitrust cases, focused on itssearchandad techbusinesses, while the Federal Trade Commission has suedAmazonandMetafor stifling competition.\nThe Apple suit would likely be even more expansive than previous challenges to the company, attacking its powerful business model that draws together the iPhone with devices like the Apple Watch and services like Apple Pay to attract and keep consumers loyal to its products. Rivals have said that they have been denied access to key Apple features, like the Siri virtual assistant, prompting them to argue the practices are anticompetitive.\nA spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment for this article. Apple also declined to comment.\nThe company has previously said that its practices do not violate antitrust law. In defending its business practices against critics in the past,Apple saidthat its \u201capproach has always been to grow the pie\u201d and \u201ccreate more opportunities not just for our business, but for artists, creators, entrepreneurs and every \u2018crazy one\u2019 with a big idea.\u201d\nThe company prides itself on the way the iPhone integrates hardware and software to create a seamless customer experience. In 2020,Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, saidduring testimony before a congressional antitrust committee that the company redefined mobile phones with \u201cits effortless user experience, its simplicity of design and a high-quality ecosystem.\u201d He added that Apple competed against Samsung, LG, Google and other smartphone makers, which offer a different approach.\n\u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the time. \u201cThat is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any product category.\u201d\nThe case would add to the growing regulatory pressure both domestically and abroad cutting into Apple\u2019s business, currently valued at $2.83 trillion.\nThis year, European regulators are expected to force Apple to accommodate app stores beyond its own under the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 to rein in tech giants. Similar actions against the App Store have been taken or are under consideration inSouth Koreaand Japan.\nAdditionally,the European Commission said in 2021that Apple had violated its antitrust laws by imposing app store fees on competitors to its Apple Music product. The commission\u2019s investigation into the issue is continuing.\nThe resolution of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation could be affected by the details of how Apple complies with European regulations, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was ongoing.\nApple is facing the increased regulatory pressure as its business slows. Last year, the company reported its annual revenue fell 2.8 percent, to $383 billion, its first decline in a fiscal year since 2019, as sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs slowed. Still, the company sold more than 200 million iPhones andaccounted for nearly three-quarters of the smartphonessold worldwide that were priced above $600, analysts estimate.\nWhen the Justice Department started its tech investigations in 2019, it prioritized its antitrust review of Google over Apple because it lacked the financial resources and personnel to fully evaluate both companies, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That changed in 2022 after the department\u2019s budget increased.\nThe investigation has encompassed a wider span of Apple\u2019s business interests than previously reported, said six people with knowledge of the meetings. That includes how Apple has blocked cloud gaming apps, which let users stream a multitude of titles to their phones, from being offered in its App Store.\nInvestigators spoke with executives at Tile, the Bluetooth tracking service, about Apple\u2019s competing AirTag product and the company\u2019s restrictions to outside parties on access to the iPhone\u2019s location services. Executives at Beeper, a start-up thatmade iMessage available on Android phones, spoke with investigators about how Apple blocked it from making it possible to offer messaging across competing smartphone operating systems. Investigators also had conversations with banks and payment apps about how Apple prevents them from accessing the tap-to-pay function on iPhones.\nTile and Beeper declined to comment for this article.\nThey have also looked at how the Apple Watch works better alongside the iPhone than other competing smartwatches. Users of Garmin devices have complained in Apple\u2019s support forums about being unable to use their watches to reply to certain text messages from their iPhones or tweak the notifications they receive from the iPhone that they have connected to their watch.\nApple\u2019s new privacy tool, App Tracking Transparency, whichallows iPhone users to explicitly choose whether an app can track them, drew scrutiny because of its curtailing of user data collection by advertisers. Advertising companies have said that the tool is anticompetitive.\nMeta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, encouraged the Justice Department to look at the issue in its conversations with the agency, two of the people said. The company \u2014 which makes most of its money from advertising \u2014said in 2022that it could lose roughly $10 billion in revenue that year because of the changes. Meta declined to comment. Investigators have also examined Apple\u2019s policy of applying fees to purchases made inside of iPhone apps, which companies like Spotify and the dating app powerhouse Match Group say is anticompetitive.\nIn 2020,Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Appleover the App Store\u2019s requirement that developers use the tech giant\u2019s payment system. Afederal judge found that Apple didn\u2019t have a monopoly in mobile games, dealing a major blow to Epic\u2019s claim.\nWhen Epic Games sued Google over similar claims, it got a different result. Ajury ruled in Decemberthat Google\u2019s app store policies had violated antitrust laws. Google plans to appeal the verdict.\nTheJustice Department last sued Apple in 2012, accusing it of conspiring with book publishers to raise the price of digital books. Applelost the case and paid a $450 millionsettlement."

        "fulltext": "\u201cPersonalization is very, very important in our industry,\u201d said Barbara Weichselbaum, chairwoman of the board for the wearable tech accessories brand WITHit, \u201cwhether it\u2019s watches or wearables.\u201d\nAnd that is the focus of Band Candy, an accessories collection for the Apple Watch that the company debuted in July.\nThe collection features smooth silicon straps, available in four colors, and charms to customize them. There are also textured silicon straps, in two colors, which can be paired with decorative strips called sliders, in silver, yellow gold and rose gold colors, some embellished with crystals; and metal link bracelets, featuring a two-tone design, available in three neon colors.\nThe five sets of charms, each of which features four charms, include emojilike motifs such as red lips, a flowering cactus and a triple-scoop ice cream cone. Made of an ionic-plated alloy, enamel, and \u2014 in some instances \u2014 crystals, the charms can be attached through the strap\u2019s holes, several of which are positioned near the watch face. That way, \u201cyou can really see the design,\u201d said Bill Devaney, WITHit\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. (The strap\u2019s reverse has a long groove to ensure the backs of the charms don\u2019t chafe the wearer\u2019s wrist.)\nThe Band Candy products are sold on the WITHit website, and they were recently added to Macy\u2019s site. The straps, which come in two sizes to fit all Apple Watches, are $20 to $35. The charms are $15 per set.\nWhile the brand would not disclose sales figures, Mr. Devaney said they had \u201ctaken us by surprise.\u201d\nMarta Indeka, the senior foresight analyst at the Future Laboratory, a consultancy in London, said that WITHit has created \u201cthe Crocs of watches\u201d \u2014 referring to the popular footwear brand that allows wearers to customize shoes by snapping on charms, called Jibbitz, that depict letters, images and characters.\nSimilarly, she said, the Band Candy pieces allow owners of mass-produced Apple Watches to personalize their timepieces. \u201cThey all, in the end, want the same thing,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they want them unique.\u201d\nThe luxury world has had a similar focus in recent years, with companies including theBamford Watch Departmentin England andJurmo Watchesin Finland customizing watches.\nIn recent years WITHit, which was founded in 2004 in Las Vegas by David Nelson, Phil Grandinetti and Mr. Devaney, had decided it needed to invest in itself or to find a partner that could do so. And in early 2021 it sold a controlling interest to E. Gluck Corporation, a fashion watch business in Little Neck, N.Y. (Ms. Weichselbaum\u2019s family has operated E. Gluck since its establishment in 1956; she is its chief executive).\nThe idea behind the partnership of the companies was to combine WITHit\u2019s technology and experience in product development with E. Gluck Corporation\u2019s design and production network, and to push E. Gluck beyond just watches. Mr. Devaney noted that future plans included a similar Band Candy concept for AirPods and new Band Candy sliders and charm sets.\nAdam Gelnick, the chief financial officer at E. Gluck, said moving from watches to developing the Band Candy line had been an exciting opportunity \u2014 to go from \u201csomething that we always defined as a timeless product to a product of our time.\u201d"
