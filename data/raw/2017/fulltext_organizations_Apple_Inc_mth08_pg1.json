        "title": "Apple Sales Exceed Expectations as Buyers Wait for New iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations for revenue and profits for its most recent quarter, as strong sales of Macs and digital services offset flat sales of iPhones while consumers wait for new models to be released in the fall.\nThe strong results eased Wall Street\u2019s fears that consumers were pulling back from Apple\u2019s products, particularly its flagship, the iPhone.\nApple said little about the upcoming phones and declined to address reports of production delays with a new high-end model, which is expected to feature an edge-to-edge screen and is expected to cost more than $1,000. The company\u2019s revenue projections for the quarter ending in September spanned a wide range, suggesting that executives are hedging on the exact timing of the iPhone update.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, addressed Apple\u2019s decision over the weekend to remove dozens of unlicensedvirtual private networking appsthat allowed Chinese consumers to access the entire internet and evade government censors.\n\u201cWe would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,\u201d Mr. Cook said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t state our point of view in the appropriate way.\u201d\nHe also said that Apple fought the United States government last year over unlocking an iPhone belonging to a dead terrorist because the legal circumstances were different.\n\u201cThe law in the U.S. supported us,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt was very clear. In the case of China, the law is very clear there. Like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we have to abide by them in both cases.\u201d\nFor the quarter ending July 1, Apple reported revenue of $45.4 billion, up 7 percent from the same quarter last year. Net income was $8.7 billion, or $1.67 a share. Analysts had expected Apple to report revenue of $44.9 billion and net income of $8.2 billion, or $1.57 a share, according to estimates compiled by S&P Capital IQ.\nFor the same quarter last year, Apple reported revenue of $42.36 billion and net income of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 a share.\nThe company\u2019s stock rose 6 percent in after-hours trading once the quarterly numbers were released.\nIn an interview, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company saw increases in unit sales and revenue in every product category, including iPads, which had been struggling in recent quarters. Global sales of iPhones rose 2 percent to 41 million units. Revenue from services, which include app sales as well as iCloud storage and Apple Music, grew 22 percent, ahead of Apple\u2019s previous projections.\nApple said revenue fell 10 percent in greater China, a key market where sales have dropped for six consecutive quarters. But Mr. Maestri said that sales in mainland China had stopped falling, with poor sales in Hong Kong dragging down the region\u2019s numbers. \u201cWe feel we will do better in the September quarter,\u201d he said.\nThe company is wrestling with increased competition in China from Samsung, as well as from Chinese companies making Android phones.\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said Apple\u2019s business in China still faces big challenges. The rise of WeChat, a wildly popular Chinese chat app and social network, has made the underlying choice of phone less important to Chinese buyers. And many Android models sport cutting-edge features, yet cost less than an iPhone.\n\u201cThe jury is still out on China,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.\nApple is also sensitive to the fact that its products are almost entirely made in China at a time when President Trump is pushing companies to increase American manufacturing jobs.\nMr. Trumpsaid last weekthat Mr. Cook had promised to build \u201cthree big plants\u201d in the United States. Asked Tuesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, Mr. Cook deflected the question, saying that Apple had created two million jobs in America \u2014 mostly developers who had written apps for the company\u2019s products and suppliers who made parts that went into Apple products.\nHowever, he added that Apple would have more news coming later this year about its direct employment in the United States. The company\u2019s Mac Pro computers are assembled in Texas, and the aging lineup is due for a revamp, offering Apple a chance to rethink its manufacturing."

        "title": "Google\u2019s War Over the Sexes",
        "fulltext": "Men and women are different. On this, almost everyone acquainted with reality agrees. How different is the more controversial question, to which there is one particularly interesting answer: A little more different than they used to be.\nThis growing difference seems to be a striking aspect of modern Western life. In societies where both sexes have greater freedom \u2014 and women have more educational and professional opportunities relative to men than in the past \u2014 the sexes\u2019 academic interests tend to diverge relative to more traditional societies. And not only their interests but their personalities as well: The more officially egalitarian a society,a credible bodyofresearchsuggests, the stronger the differences in stereotypically male and female personality traits.\nConservatives sometimes worry that our society features an unhealthy blurring of sexual identities, an androgyne confusion. The left tends to be more optimistic about such blurring, seeing it as a liberation from the rule of patriarchy and the prison of heteronormativity.\nBut the opposite trend, the divergence of the sexes, might be more important. Some of our present difficulties may flow from an excess of feminine and masculine differentiation, from the sexes growing apart and losing common ground, from the decline of marriage\u2019s male-female partnership and the rise of a singlehood that\u2019s often more sex-segregated than family life.\nCertainly the frontiers of sexual license often feature strong male-female differentiation rather than androgyny or gender-neutrality. Think of the clich\u00e9s that prevail in internet pornography, or the gendered kinks of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d Even our culture\u2019s highest-profile gender transition had a highly sex-specific presentation \u2014 Bruce Jenner was the ultimate male Olympian; Caitlyn Jenner, a busty, hyper-feminized Vanity Fair cover model.\nSo too with political trends. The idea of a \u201cMommy Party\u201d and a \u201cDaddy Party\u201d goes way back, but the Trump-Clinton election made the increasinglygendered natureof the parties seem ridiculously stark. As Ed West, a columnist for The Week,pointed out last week, the social justice left and the alt-right are among the most gendered movements imaginable \u2014 \u201cthe political equivalent of the Lego Friends Heartlake Cupcake Cafe and the Lego Nexo Knight\u2019s Clay\u2019s Falcon Fighter Blaster, examples of where greater freedom of association and self-actualization has led men and women.\u201d\nConsider it this way: If you asked a right-wing misogynist to craft a sexist parody of his political opponents, you might get something like the highly neurotic, fainting-couch politics of recent campus and online progressivism, whose acolytes oscillate between soft therapeutic language andmaenad-like frenzy.\nIf you then asked a left-wing misandrist to do the same sort of parody in reverse, you\u2019d end up with something like the online far-right \u2014 nerds and autodidacts obsessed with cuckoldry, fascist cosplayers eager for evidence of their own racial superiority, would-be lotharios furious at feminism, libertarians with a ten-point case for despotism.\nThe divergence of the sexes also provides a useful context for thinking about this week\u2019s culture-war controversy, the high-profile firing of a Google software engineer, James Damore, for a memo he wrote criticizing the company\u2019s diversity policies.\nDamore\u2019s memoargued, roughly, that the tech world\u2019s conspicuous dearth of women is quite possibly a consequence of the trend I\u2019ve just described \u2014 that more men than women are attracted to the kind of work that\u2019s done by programmers and software engineers, and that it\u2019s a mistake to assume discrimination when self-selection might be at work. He also questioned why Google\u2019s official rhetoric and internal propaganda focus on the diversity of sex and race while ignoring the value of political or ideological diversity.\nThe memo was sometimes tone deaf, clinical, insensitive (in, well, a stereotypically male sort of way), understating the ways in which self-selectionandsexism can shape an industry. Even if more men than women are attracted to a particular field, a male-dominated profession can be distinctly unpleasant for the women who work in it, in ways that can justify special scrutiny, recruitment and redress.\nBut Damore also made reasonable points about different ways to pursue diversity and the costs and benefits thereof, in an earnest and dialogic style that a healthy corporate culture would have found a way to answer without swiftly giving him the ax.\nAt the same time, there was a sense in which Damore had to be fired, precisely because of the intertwined realities that he described. Silicon Valley is a very male environment, a land of nerd kings and brogrammers whose deepest beliefs tend to be the sort that men come up with when they don\u2019t have very many women around \u2014 arch-libertarian, irreligious, utopian in a mechanistic style.\nBut the internet industry is also part of a wider elite culture that is trending in the opposite direction, becoming more feminized and feminist, and inclined to view male-dominated enclaves with great suspicion. So Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders use corporate wokeness, diversity initiatives and progressive virtue signaling as a kind of self-protection, a way of promising that they\u2019re mostly men but they\u2019re thegoodkind of men, so that discrimination lawsuits and antitrust actions and other forms of regulation are less attractive to their critics.\nI strongly suspect that more than a few Silicon Valley higher-ups agreed with the broad themes of Damore\u2019s memo. But just as tech titans accept some censorship and oppression as the price of doing business in China, they accept performative progressivism as the price of having nice campuses in the most liberal state in the union and recruiting their employees from its most elite and liberal schools. And for questioning that political performance while defending the disproportionate maleness that makes it necessary, the Google memo-writer simply had to go.\nThis is not a healthy dynamic, obviously. Indeed, part of why the alt-right has such a strong (if sub rosa) presence in Northern California is because it\u2019s a predictable kind of male response to professional life under the rule of political correctness \u2014 a response that the Damore firing will only make more attractive.\nMeanwhile, the real truth \u2014 which the memo at its most sensible almost grasped \u2014 is that Silicon Valley might benefit from having a more female-friendly culturebecauseof thedifferencesbetween men and women, not because those differences are all somehow a misogynist invention. The fact that the brave new online world of social media may be particularlypsychologically unhealthyfor young women, for instance, seems like a telling indicator of what can go wrong with a virtual architecture built by brilliant and obtuse males.\nBut since the usual way to reintegrate the sexes is to have them marry one another and raise kids, what Silicon Valley probably needs right now more than either workplace anti-microaggression training or an alt-right underground is a basic friendliness to family, pregnancy and child rearing.\nThis is why the new Apple headquarters, which has a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center butno child care center, is a more telling indicator of what really matters to Silicon Valley than all the professions of gender-egalitarianism that have followed James Damore\u2019s heretical comments about sex differences.\nThose differences,the real ones, have one common root: Women bear children; men do not. Figuring out how to respect that essential fact and all its implications, while also respecting the equality of the sexes, is one of the great challenges of our age. And it\u2019s because we are failing at it that the sexes have begun to go their separate ways."

        "title": "Crowded TV Marketplace Gets Ready for Three Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "Apple has more than $1 billion budgeted for original programming, Facebook wants its own version of \u201cScandal\u201d and Google is ready to spend up to $3 million per episode on a drama.\nThe three digital giants have signaled to Hollywood that they are serious about entering a television landscape that Netflix and Amazon shook up just a few years ago. Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.\nAlthough there have been some signs that the industry\u2019s output may plateau \u2014 cable companies like A&E and WGN have saidthey are getting out of the scriptedtelevision business \u2014 the entry of Apple, Facebook and Google into the fray almost guarantees that the volume of shows will continue to grow, even as viewers grapple with aglut of programmingand an expandingnumber of streaming platforms.\nWith the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\n\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.\nStill, many in the industry are taking a believe-it-when-we-see-it approach to the new players. Netflix and Amazon have made successful forays into scripted entertainment, but some efforts by digital titans likeMicrosoftandYahoohave fizzled.\nScripted television is enormously expensive, so any commitment to it must be sincere. From shooting on location to taking out insurance to paying actors, crew members, directors and writers, it is impossible to dive in without allocating plenty of cash, while also being patient enough to weather blows at a time when it is increasingly difficultto land a signature hit.\nThe moves also come amid a fierce arms race for content. Netflix recentlypoached Shonda Rhimes from ABC, whose parent company, Disney, is preparing its own stand-alone streaming services.\nBut Apple\u2019s wealth and its willingness to commit resources have sent shock waves through the industry. Two months ago, the company chose Sony\u2019s television studio heads, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to leadits programming efforts.\nMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.\nThat budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.\nFX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201d\nMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.\nIt is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.\nApple declined to comment for this article, but it should not be long before Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg begin competing for projects, most likely to be made by outside studios at first. (And there are already are plenty of projects on the market, includinga highly coveted newseries about morning TV shows starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.) With the amount of money at its disposal, Apple could easily have more than a dozen original series.\nBut as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.\nThe company\u2019s Hollywood development team isled byMina Lefevre, previously of MTV. Facebook has told people in the industry that it is willing to spend $3 million to $4 million an episode on new programming, according to a person familiar with their plans. That kind of spending would put the company on an equal footing with many broadcast and cable networks.\nAnd while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.\nIt has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.\nUnlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.\nA Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.\nFacebook will soonunveil a Watch tab, where users can find the original series and other video content that will be less expensive to make.\nYouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.\nAlthough Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.\nYouTube\u2019s ambitions are now pointed toward creating more traditional TV fare. Mr. Kyncl said the company was drawing lessons from what users on its platform search for. (The tactic is not new. Netflix has long used its vast supply of subscriber datato help inform itsoriginal programming choices). YouTube plans to put some of its shows behind a paywall, while others will be free.\nYouTube recently began development on \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d a \u201cKarate Kid\u201d comedy spinoff that got the go-ahead after executives saw how often people were searching for clips from the original movie, Mr. Kyncl said. The company gavea green light last yearto the scripted dance series \u201cStep Up\u201d after it saw how popular dancing videos were with users.\nData searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense. It\u2019s in the service of our users.\u201d"

        "title": "The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the Camera",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We all know the drill. For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.\nBut it\u2019s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device\u2019s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.\nHere\u2019s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.\nSome of this futurism is already starting to happen.\nNext month, Apple plans to hold a special event tointroduce a set of new iPhones, including a premium model that can scan 3-D objects \u2014 including your face. Samsung, the No. 1 phone maker, also recently introduced theGalaxy Note 8, highlighting its fast dual-lens camera as the signature feature. And rivals will soon work to catch up with Samsung and Apple.\n\u201c2018 will be the year where the smartphone camera takes a quantum leap in technology,\u201d said Philip-James Jacobowitz, a product manager for Qualcomm, a chip maker that provides components to smartphone makers.\nMr. Jacobowitz added that emerging camera technologies would be the key to stronger security features and applications for so-called augmented reality, which uses data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.\nHere\u2019s a rundown on what this all means for how your next smartphone will work.\nFor the last few years, we have become accustomed to unlocking our smartphones by scanning our fingerprints or entering a passcode. But when Apple shows its new iPhones next month, including a premium model with a starting price of $999, the company will introduce infrared facial recognition as a new method for unlocking the device.\nHow would the new iPhone do that exactly? Apple declined to comment. But Qualcomm\u2019s Spectra, a so-called depth-sensing camera system, is one example of how face scanning works.\nThe Spectra system includes a module that sprays an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. If the dots are smaller, then the object is farther away; if they are bigger, the object is closer. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the contours of the head \u2014 it\u2019s not just the front of the face as you\u2019re typically thinking about,\u201d said Sy Choudhury, a senior director of product security for Qualcomm.\nBecause of the uniqueness of a person\u2019s head shape, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with the incorrect face is 1 in a million, he added. That compares with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 for previous facial recognition systems, which had very poor security.\nOlder facial recognition systems worked by simply using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera \u2014 which some people already did withSamsung\u2019s facial-recognitionfeature.\nThere are, however, limitations to infrared-scanning technologies. For example, objects that you wear, like a hat or a scarf, might throw off the camera, according to Qualcomm. In addition, experts said infrared light can get drowned out by bright sunlight outdoors, so face scanning might work less reliably on the beach.\nIt remains to be seen how exactly face scanning will work in the next iPhone. But Apple is well acquainted with depth-sensing camera technologies. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a depth-sensing camera system that let Xbox players control games using body movements. Analysts expect some rendition of PrimeSense\u2019s technology to appear in future iPhones.\nDepth-sensing cameras may be crucial to enhancing augmented reality, a jargony industry term that probably makes your eyes glaze over. But bear with me for one moment: Augmented reality will have major implications for future mobile apps.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Apple is bullish about augmented reality. In a recent financial earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called augmented reality \u201cbig and profound,\u201d with major implications for gaming, entertainment and business products. This fall, Apple will release iOS 11, its next mobile operating system that includes support for applications made with ARKit, a tool kit for app developers to easily create augmented-reality applications.\nARKit uses a combination of the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope, to let people lay digital objects on top of the real world and interact with them with precise movements.\nI got a demo of ARKit from Ikea, the furniture maker, with its coming app Ikea Place. I placed an Ikea bed on the floor and was able to move around and look underneath it. This type of application would be useful for getting a sense of how an item looks and fits alongside other furniture in a space before placing an order.\n\u201cThis is like a real application that real people can use to make real-life decisions,\u201d said Michael Valdsgaard, the head of digital transformation at Ikea.\nBut the limitations of the Ikea Place app underscore what\u2019s missing from ARKit. For placing virtual objects, the app can detect horizontal surfaces, like a table surface or the ground, but it cannot yet detect walls.\nVertical planes like walls are trickier to detect because they are not as smooth as floors \u2014 with doors, windows and picture frames getting in your way. Depth-sensing cameras make wall detection much easier for future iPhones, said Blair MacIntyre, a research scientist who is working on augmented reality for Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser.\nAll the tech giants are betting big on augmented reality. For years, Microsoft has beendeveloping HoloLens, an augmented-reality headset. In April, Facebook announcedCamera Effects Platform, an environment for software developers to build augmented-reality apps for Facebook. This week, Google unveiledARCore, an augmented-reality tool kit for Android devices, in response to Apple\u2019s ARKit.\nMr. MacIntyre said augmented reality has huge potential when it matures. He envisioned people being able to take a tour of a natural-history museum, pointing their smartphone cameras at a fossil exhibit to bring a dinosaur back to life.\nBut he said that augmented reality on smartphones was a stopgap to the inevitable: wearing data in front of your face at all times through some kind of headset.\n\u201cIf you look at science fiction, a lot of it has this characteristic of being always on and serendipitous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to that when you get a head-mounted display.\u201d\nUntil that happens, smartphones are about to become much smarter."

        "title": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\nOn Wednesday, Apple\u2019s stock surged 5 percent to a record high of $157.14 after itreported surprisingly strong financial results. It is now worth $822 billion, more than any other company in the stock market. And that is before it releases a hotly anticipated new lineup of iPhones this fall, on the 10th anniversary of the original model. Analysts say the new phones could drive sales up by more than 10 percent next year.\nApple is not alone. Other aging tech giants likeMicrosoft,AmazonandAlphabet, the parent of Google, and younger players likeFacebookhave also managed to post strong growth despite their tremendous size. The secret to their vigor, according to analysts and investors, is the vast amount of data they have about customers and their ability to sell all sorts of products to those customers.\n\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201d\nFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.\nIn the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.\nThe iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.\nIn a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\n\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201d\nMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.\nEven Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.\nApple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\n\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201d\nBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.\nStill, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nThe risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\n\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said."

        "fulltext": "In June, you were hired as chief brand officer for Uber, a job you took after months of controversy over legal, workplace and personnel issues at the company. You\u2019ve said you want to \u2018\u2018humanize\u2019\u2019 Uber. Do you think that brands can have human characteristics?I do think brands are like people. The product does not exist without an emotion connected to it. You\u2019ve birthed life into a product and created a personality. You can look at any industry and say: \u2018\u2018Why this sneaker over that sneaker? Why this soda over that one?\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s what brands are \u2014 they\u2019re living, breathing things that are sometimes very happy, sometimes sad, sometimes angry. It\u2019s our job as marketers and brand professionals to nurture the brand and calm it down when it\u2019s angry and to encourage when it\u2019s trying to grow.\nI have to say: As a Gen Xer, I mistrust brands.Brands mean different things for different generations. When I was growing up, the brands that were most powerful were people brands, like Michael Jackson or Madonna. They stood for something that, perhaps, wasn\u2019t wholly who they were, which then became an image that they sold. That\u2019s still a brand to me.\nYou\u2019ve talked a lot about the importance of Uber\u2019s reputation, which stems from reports of a notoriously bad corporate culture. Can you improve the reputation of Uber without changing the culture?I\u2019m a woman, I\u2019m black, I am passionate, I am transparent. The culture changes simply by being, right? It\u2019s like any other thing where you change one molecule and the matter changes.\nIn the past, Uber has famously rejected the idea that metrics are a good way of measuring diversity. Do you think that those evaluations are a good tool for showing commitment to social progress?Yeah, I do. It keeps us in check. You can look at the numbers and make sure that we are wholly represented and that people are feeling satisfied at their jobs.\nThe brands you\u2019ve managed in the past \u2014 Apple, Beats and Pepsi \u2014 were all pretty beloved already. Will it be a new challenge for you to work with a brand that is in crisis?I\u2019m pretty confident in my abilities, and I don\u2019t know that there is a utopia for any of us, in any of our companies. But I don\u2019t see a difference between the evolution of where the music industry was going and how to evolve people\u2019s listening habits and, now, how to evolve people\u2019s feelings around ride sharing and Uber.\nWhat about Uber in particular is worth saving?It is so innovative and has such a bright future in terms of disrupting what has been a very old and antiquated system of transportation. It\u2019s also about the thousands of people who work so tirelessly every day for the company. They\u2019ve been working hard for a number of years to bring a product to life. Why shouldn\u2019t we save it?\nWell, some might argue that the rise of ride sharing and the gig economy is hollowing out long-term employment. Do you think Uber has a role in helping to maintain some kind of social safety net that used to be filled by people having single long-term employment?I don\u2019t think that you can look back even 200 years and say that we have the same economy or the same society as we did then. Part of our human nature is finding new ways of being. I\u2019m not so afraid of the future in that way, in that somehow we\u2019re all going to be phased out \u2014 I think that there\u2019s going to be new ways for us to work and interact with each other and create an economy that is sustainable.\nYou made a splash in the tech world when you became the first black woman to be onstage at the Apple Developers\u2019 Conference in 2016; you previewed iTunes\u2019 lyrics feature by trying to start a singalong to \u2018\u2018Rapper\u2019s Delight.\u2019\u2019If I had gone with Coldplay, that wouldn\u2019t have been very much me, you know?"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Barnstorms for \u2018Moral Responsibility\u2019",
        "fulltext": "AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201d\nThat was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, across the table from me over breakfast here in downtown Austin late last week at the end of a mini-tour across the country during which he focused on topics usually reserved for politicians: manufacturing, jobs and education.\nHe had just spent the prior day in Ohio, where he toured CTS, a technology company that produces the equipment that Apple uses to test water resistance and dust protection for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. He then flew to Des Moines, where he announced plans to make a $1.3 billion investment in a 400,000-square-foot data center in nearby Waukee to help store and move giant amounts of information for its services like iCloud and FaceTime. And he arrived here to announce that Austin Community College will begin offering its 74,000 students a curriculum that Apple developed to teach them how to write code to create apps for iPhones. Austin is one of 30 community colleges that will offer the curriculum.\nAs Mr. Cook\u2019s breakfast arrived \u2014 two scrambled egg whites, crispy bacon (they didn\u2019t have his preferred turkey bacon), sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk \u2014 he described his week, punctuated by a visit the night before to the L.B.J. Presidential Library, the museum of President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\u201cOne of the things that hits you,\u201d he said, is \u201call of the major acts, legislation, that happened during just his presidency.\u201d His eyes widened as he listed some: \u201cYou have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Act, you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, you have several national parks, you have Head Start, you have housing discrimination, you have jury discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cRegardless of your politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look at it and say, \u2018My gosh.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Cook\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a dig at President Trump so much as they were a critique of Washington\u2019s seemingly perpetual state of gridlock.\nAnd now Mr. Cook is one of the many business leaders in the country who appear to be filling the void, using his platform at Apple to wade into larger social issues that typically fell beyond the mandate of executives in past generations.\nHe said he had never set out to do so, but he feels he has been thrust into the role as virtually every large American company has had to stake out a domestic policy.\nHe was vocal, for example, in criticizing Mr. Trump after Charlottesville in a memo to his staff: \u201cI disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.\u201d\nWatching Mr. Cook over the years, I\u2019ve been fascinated to see how he has become as animated when talking about big issues like education and climate change as he is when talking about Apple.\n\u201cI think we have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to contribute to the other countries that we do business in,\u201d he said.\nHe added, \u201cI think there\u2019s still probably a more significant group that feels my sole responsibility is to Wall Street.\u201d\nHis critics will, of course, say all this happy talk is a P.R. ploy for a company that makes its most popular products on the other side of the world and keeps nearly a quarter-trillion dollars abroad, untaxed by Uncle Sam. In fairness, Apple is one of the largest taxpayers in the country, paying $28 billion in federal taxes between 2014 and 2016 at an average rate of 26 percent, which is in the middle for big multinational American corporations.\nAnd Mr. Cook is paid handsomely: On Thursday, as a result of the company\u2019s financial outperformance compared with its peers, Mr. Cook was given nearly $90 million of stock as part of his previously agreed upon compensation plan. (He has said he plans to give away all of his wealth.)\nBut there\u2019s a more nuanced version of Apple\u2019s story \u2014 and Mr. Cook\u2019s transformation of the company after taking over as its chief executive in 2011 \u2014 that has been lost amid the din of nonstop chatter about the company in Silicon Valley and Washington.\nWhen Mr. Cook announced, for example, the new data facility in Waukee, he said it would run fully on renewable energy. But he slipped in another fact that has largely gone unnoticed: Over the past several years, Mr. Cook has gotten all of the company\u2019s corporate facilities in the United States to run on wind and solar energy \u2014 in their entirety.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running Apple a hundred percent on renewable energy today\u201d in the United States, he said over breakfast, \u201cand we\u2019ve now hit that in 23 other countries around the world.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say Mr. Cook, 56, is running an altruistic institution. Apple received $208 million in tax breaks from Iowa to locate its data center there. The state has aggressively recruited technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, with deep subsidies. A Los Angeles Times columnistcriticized the stateas a \u201cfirst-class patsy\u201d for making the deal with Apple, which will create 1,700 construction jobs but only about 50 long-term jobs. Apple agreed to donate \u201cup to $100 million\u201d for local infrastructure, including a youth sports complex, offsetting part of the tax break.\nMr. Cook is most passionate when he talks about education, which led the company to create the curriculum for developing apps, estimated to be a$1.3 trillion part of the global economy.\nHe is hoping the curriculum turns into jobs. Last year, according to Apple, 150,000 new jobs were created through the App Store. Apple paid out $5 billion directly to app makers.\nHe said he had chosen to focus on getting the curriculum to community colleges, rather than four-year colleges, because \u201cas it turns out, the community college system is much more diverse than the four-year schools, particularly the four-year schools that are known for comp sci.\u201d He noted that \u201cthere is a definite diversity issue in tech, in particular in coding and computer scientists.\u201d\nApple has already rolled out the curriculum in Alabama, Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. \u201cYou want it to increase the diversity of people that are in there, both racial diversity, gender diversity, but also geographic diversity,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cRight now, the benefits of tech are too lopsided to certain states.\u201d (Like California.)\nStudents who take the classes learn the Swift language, which is used to make apps on Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad. Admittedly, Mr. Cook is not helping students learn how to code in languages for his competitors, but he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s significantly transferable.\u201d\nHe continued, with a laugh: \u201cWe know that people making a mobile app, many of them are going to make iOS apps and Android apps. And I wish they wouldn\u2019t, but they\u2019re probably going to.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to make money on it. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Cook\u2019s coding skills? \u201cI might fail a little bit on that.\u201d\nAs we finished up breakfast before we headed over to Austin\u2019s Capital Factory, an incubator for tech start-ups where he would announce the new curriculum, I mentioned a question that some in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have asked: Is his focus on jobs and speeches in front of American flags a hint at something bigger? After all, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s name is now regularly bandied about in discussions of potential presidential candidates.\n\u201cI have a full-time job,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cI appreciate the compliment,\u201d he added with a wry look, \u201cif it is a compliment.\u201d"
