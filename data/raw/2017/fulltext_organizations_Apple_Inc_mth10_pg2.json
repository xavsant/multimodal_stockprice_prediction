        "fulltext": "Q.I\u2019m about to purchase an iMac desktop computer. Are they as good as the old ones? I have an old MacBook on which I use AppleWorks. Will a new Mac convert it to a current word-processing program?\nA.Apple regularly updates its computers with faster processors, sharper screens and slicker software, so buying a new iMac gets you a machine that\u2019s technically better than an older model. However, you may have an adjustment period with the new hardware and the new operating system if you have not upgraded in several years. TheMigration Assistantprogram included with new Macs can also help you move your files from the old machine to the new one, but older software may not run on a modern Mac.\nThe oldAppleWorkscollection of office and art programs was officiallyretired more than 10 years ago, replaced by Apple\u2019siWorksuite. That software has evolved into three free programs (a word processor calledPages, spreadsheet software calledNumbersand theKeynotepresentation application) that work on Macs, on iOS devices and within a web browser. You get the current version of the programs on your new Mac when you buy it, but depending on the version of AppleWorks you were using, you may have some trouble opening the older files with the new software.\nIf you were using AppleWorks 6 and saved all your files in that version of the program, you can try to open them with the current iWork programs, but files in AppleWorks 5 or earlier are not compatible. Just double-clicking on an AppleWorks document icon from files you have copied over probably will not work, but try opening the Pages program first, then going to the File menu to Open and selecting an AppleWorks file (oran older iWork file) in the window to see if it cooperates and opens. If it does, choose Save As from the File menu to save the old document in the newer Pages format.\nThe Numbers and Keynote programs may be able to open AppleWorks spreadsheets and presentations the same way. If the files will not open, you may be able to convert them to newer formats by opening them within the open-sourceLibreOffice suite, which has a good reputation for cracking open files in outdated formats.\nYou can also check the Mac App Store or around the web for a text-utility program that can extract the words from the file from the garbled formatting code. TheTextEditapp, which comes with your Mac, may be able to open the file so you can copy the content into a Pages file.\nIf the older computer and version of AppleWorks you have been using are still operational, you could also prepare your files for transfer ahead of time and export them right from AppleWorks into more flexible formats that newer programs can easily open. With AppleWorks 6 word-processing documents, for example,you can save themas plain text, HTML files, rich-text format (.rtf) files or Microsoft Word files."

        "fulltext": "The tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?\nAs the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.\nSo if you\u2019re worried about the power of theFrightful Five\u2014 Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 just look at how IBM, Hewlett-Packard or monopoly-era Microsoft fell to earth. They were all victims of \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d of an \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d the theories that bolster Silicon Valley\u2019s vision of itself as a roiling sea of pathbreaking upstarts, where the very thing that made you big also makes you vulnerable.\nWell, maybe not this time.\nThe technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.\nStart-ups are still getting funding and still making breakthroughs. But their victory has never been likely (fewer than1 percent of start-ups end up as $1 billion companies), and recently their chances of breakout success \u2014 and especially of knocking the giants off their perches \u2014 have diminished considerably.\nThe best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.\nBecause today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.\nThere is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies \u2014 Snapcreated a whole new paradigm in social networking, andpioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication\u2014 it has been battered by the giants.\nAfter failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat\u2019s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook\u2019s main app,it seemed to deliver a death blow.\nBut Facebook isn\u2019t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap\u2019s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google.It agreed to pay Google $400 million a yearfor the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about$330 million in ad revenuein the first half of this year. In other words, it\u2019s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.\nOh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.\nThe small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.\nThey said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201d\nMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.\nSome of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.\nIAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.\nChris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\n\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.\nIn some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.\nIAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.\nI asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\n\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201d\nIn August, Mr. Khosrowshahi wasappointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.\nBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.\nThe future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine."
