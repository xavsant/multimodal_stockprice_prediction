        "title": "Google Has Edge in Antitrust Fight",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department took a big swing at Google this week, alleging in a lawsuit that it violated antitrust law by stifling competition, particularly with its search engine and lucrative advertising business.\nIt\u2019s a compelling case, positioning Google as an anticompetitive behemoth that suppresses would-be rivals through exclusive deals and runs up prices for marketers through its byzantine online advertising sales process. Consumers, the Justice Department contends, are suffering from a lack of choice when they search for travel deals, local restaurants and answers to everyday questions.\nIt would be great to see competitors like DuckDuckGo given a fighting chance to challenge Google\u2019s clear market dominance, but the case here is both too narrow and too long coming to dethrone the company. The Justice Department appears to haverushed the suitin a quixotic attempt to make it an Election Day issue, and it is outgunned by Google\u2019s legion of attorneys and mountain of cash.There\u2019s no question about Google\u2019s dominance: It commands as much as90 percent of the search market, and nearly75 percentof mobile phones use its Android software.\n\u201cThe Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper of the internet,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in itssuit. \u201cFor the sake of American consumers, advertisers and all companies now reliant on the internet economy, the time has come to stop Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition.\u201d\nBut American consumers shouldn\u2019t hold their breath. The case will most likely drag on for years while appeals are heard, meaning Google can continue operating largely as it does today.\nJustice Department lawyers will have to convince federal judges of the central allegation in the lawsuit: that Google\u2019s contracts paying Apple and other smartphone manufacturers to make it the default search engine and operating system on those phones are anticompetitive, rather than just savvy deal making. Google will explain that its market share is a function of consumer choice and not manipulation.\nThe government will also need to make plain the overly complicated online advertising market and demonstrate how Google\u2019s control forces marketers to pay higher fees, resulting in higher prices for consumer products.\nIt takes some mental gymnastics to connect the price of a can of Coca-Cola to the complex and opaque automated bidding wars for an ad slot atop a Google search for \u201csoda.\u201d\nThe coming weeks are likely to bring a cascade of suits from state attorneys general who have also investigated Google and will contend it hurts consumers by crowding out competitors. Eleven states joined the Justice Department\u2019s action.\nThe 58-page complaint will be a distraction for years to come, potentially degrading Google\u2019s reputation. But if the way Google approaches its business operations is any guide, this will be anything but a fair fight. The company had$17.7 billion in cashas of June, and it has hired anall-star benchof outside attorneys with antitrust experience to help defend it. The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, by comparison, is working off a2020 budgetof $167 million.\n\u201cThese civil servants at Justice are going to see these Google lawyers flying in first class and staying at five-star hotels,\u201d George Hay, a professor at Cornell Law School and former economist for the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, told me. \u201cYou have to feel for them a little bit.\u201d\nProfessor Hay said that the most likely outcome of the case is that, after years of litigation, Google will have to unravel some of its exclusive deals \u2014 such as the billions it pays annually to be the default search engine on Apple\u2019s iPhones and the default operating system on Samsung devices.\nNonetheless, business should continue largely as usual for Google. \u201cApple can still choose to use Google\u2019s search engine, and phone makers can still choose to use the Android software,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are going to just stop using Google because of a lawsuit.\u201d\nSo far, the company has hardly been chastened by the threat of antitrust challenges. Less than two months after a group of state attorneys general announced their investigation into its market power last year, Google announced that it planned to buy the fitness tracking company Fitbitfor $2.1 billion. (That deal isstill under reviewby Justice Department and European Union competition officials.)\nGoogle also may be emboldened by past challenges that hardly threw it off course. A 2011 suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy concerns resulted in a meager $22.5 million settlement. Last year, another F.T.C. suit, over children\u2019s privacy on YouTube, led to a$170 million settlement\u2014 representing less than 10 hours of Google\u2019s revenue in the most recent quarter.\nGoogle\u2019s tenacity is a testament to the success and omnipresence of its products, which Google has paid plenty for. Avoiding Google isnearly impossiblefor Americans.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is commendable, as a shot across the bow. It\u2019s the federal government\u2019s job to protect consumers from the excesses of big business. Good things can come from settlements and simply shining a light on corporations\u2019 practices.\nGoogle can certainly afford to defend itself until the bitter end, but it cannot afford complacency. This month, the company was the subject of a Democratic-led House committeereportaccusing it of anticompetitive practices and arguing for antitrust law reform. If Democrats pull off a White House win, they could widen the scope of the Justice Department lawsuit.\nGoogle and other tech firms may indeed havelittle to fear from regulatorstoday. But for consumers\u2019 sake it would be nice if Google had to fear real competition.\nAfter all, Google was once the upstart scrambling to overtake what was then the dominant search engine:Yahoo.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple iPhone 12 Review: Superfast Speed, if You Can Find It",
        "fulltext": "I started thisiPhonereview in the most peculiar way: by opening a map to find out where I could test it.\nThat\u2019s becauseApple\u2019s newest iPhones, for the first time, workwith 5G, the ultrafast fifth-generation wireless networks that will theoretically let people download a movie to their devices in seconds. The problem? The superspeedy 5G networks have not been rolled out everywhere.\nI learned this the hard way. When Apple provided The New York Times with iPhone 12s to test on Verizon\u2019s 5G network, I quickly discovered that my neighborhood in the San Francisco Bay Area didn\u2019t have any 5G connection. So I went on a journey through San Francisco to find the superfast data speeds that Apple and Verizon executives promised when theyunveiled the new iPhones last week.\nWhen I found places where I could connect to the fastest 5G networks, the iPhone experience was hugely gratifying. The network delivered download speeds to the phone that were up to seven times as fast as the best broadband services I have ever used.\nBut the locations where I tracked down ultrafast 5G were far less satisfying. At one point, I found the speedy connection in the back of a Safeway parking lot. Another time I was in front of a Pet Food Express. What would I do with an incredibly fast internet connection there?\nIn most parts of San Francisco, the iPhone instead drew data from a morevanillaflavor of 5G that Verizon calls \u201c5G Nationwide,\u201d which is the connection that most of the country will get for the foreseeable future. Those download speeds ranged from much slower than to twice as fast as my older iPhone, which was on Verizon\u2019s 4G network.\nThat\u2019s all to say that despite the hype around 5G, the network underwhelmed. At this point, it should not be the primary reason to splurge on an expensive handset in a pandemic-induced recession.\nThe iPhone 12, with bright screens and a more robust design, is still a solid upgrade from past iPhones. But you will pay a premium: The device, which becomes available on Friday, starts at $829, up from $699 for last year\u2019s iPhone 11. (Another model, the iPhone 12 Mini, costs $729 but has a smaller screen and ships later this year.)\nI tested the iPhone 12 and the high-end iPhone 12 Pro, which starts at $999, for about a week. Here\u2019s how that went.\nPhone carriers like Verizon and AT&T started rolling out 5G networks last year and have marketed them as superfast. But what they aren\u2019t telling you is that there are two flavors of 5G and that the one you will most likely get is not going to be the speedier one.\nHere are the two versions of 5G in a nutshell:\nThere\u2019s ultrafast 5G, which is called millimeter wave. (Verizon labels it \u201c5G Ultra Wideband.\u201d) It travels very short distances and has trouble penetrating obstacles and walls. That makes it usable in outdoor spaces like street corners or parks, but probably not in our offices or homes anytime soon. Because of that, only tiny slivers of the country now have superfast 5G.\nThen there\u2019s \u201c5G Nationwide,\u201d which is more widely available. It travels much farther, but carriers have said it will be only about 20 percent faster than 4G wireless networks.\nI saw the differences in 5G firsthand when I opened theVerizon coverage mapfor San Francisco. Verizon used red to highlight locations with 5G Nationwide, while areas with the ultrafast 5G were marked in dark red. The overwhelming majority of the city was shaded in red, with only small areas in dark red.\nTo test ultrafast 5G, I drove to six locations that Verizon advertised as having the fast connection and used theSpeedtest app from Ookla, a network diagnostics company.\nAt three of the locations in the city\u2019s Marina district and Mission district, I was immediately disappointed. I walked up and down the streets, constantly refreshing websites and running the Speedtest app, but there was no superfast signal to be found. Instead, I got 4G or vanilla 5G connections.\nVerizon said its engineers walked those same streets in the Marina over the weekend and were able to find the superfast 5G connection in one location but confirmed the signal had weakened in the other. (Verizon didn\u2019t immediately comment on the location in the Mission district.)\nThat led me to conclude that Verizon\u2019s coverage map was unreliable.\nStill, I drove to three other locations in the city\u2019s Marina, Presidio Heights and South of Market districts. There, I finally found the fabled superfast 5G \u2014 and I was blown away.\nStanding in front of a camera store in South of Market, I got 5G speeds reaching 2,160 megabits a second, which was 2,900 percent faster than 4G. Even where it was a tad slower \u2014 behind the Safeway parking lot in the Marina district \u2014 the 5G iPhone drew speeds of 668 megabits a second, which was 1,052 percent faster than 4G.\nThese were odd places to have blazing fast speeds, though. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, these areas did not have much foot traffic. The carriers have said ultrafast 5G speeds would be great for data-heavy tasks like streaming video, but I had no desire to do much streaming while standing on those street corners.\nWhy the nondescript locations? Karen Schulz, a Verizon spokeswoman, said the company ran into complex engineering tasks in San Francisco. While ultrafast 5G relies on access to light poles, most of the city\u2019s utilities infrastructure is underground. Verizon\u2019s progress to deploy 5G has run into red tape, she said.\nWhen I tested the new iPhones on the vanilla 5G network, any speed improvement was hardly noticeable. In the best cases, vanilla 5G was twice as fast as 4G, or 209 megabits a second compared with 103 megabits on 4G. But in some locations, 5G was slower than 4G. In one part of the Mission district, for instance, 5G speeds reached 28 megabits a second compared with 39 megabits on 4G.\nMs. Schulz said that customers should initially expect the 5G Nationwide network to perform like 4G, and that performance and coverage would grow over time.\nI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s good enough. I\u2019ve reviewed phones over the past 12 years and covered the transition from 2G to 3G, and from 3G to 4G. I have never seen a network rollout this confusing and spotty \u2014 5G, simply, is a mess.\nSetting aside the network issues, there\u2019s still a handset to review \u2014 and that brings much better news.\nThe design changes to the new iPhones are substantive. The iPhone 12 has a fancy OLED screen, a more modern display technology. So it looks brighter and has more accurate colors than the iPhone 11, which used LCD screen technology. (OLED was previously exclusive to Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones.) The edges of the phone are also now flat instead of round.\nThe changes have helped the handset shed some weight and thickness while maintaining a roomy 6.1-inch screen. It felt much more comfortable inside my pants pockets than the iPhone 11, which always seemed too thick.\nApple also said it had strengthened the display glass, making it four times less likely to break. It\u2019s difficult to test that scientifically, but I dropped the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro several times by accident on hard surfaces. They survived without any scuffs.\nAlso new is a charging mechanism that Apple calls MagSafe. It\u2019s basically a new standard to support faster charging via magnetic induction. The new standard will open doors to other companies to make accessories that magnetically attach to iPhones, such as miniature wallets.\nI tested both the MagSafe charger and Apple\u2019s MagSafe wallet. But I preferred charging with a normal wire because it was faster, as well as carrying my own wallet, because it can hold more cards.\nThere\u2019s a major downside to all of the new features: We have to pay a lot for these phones. Apple is also no longer including charging bricks or earphones with the new iPhones since so many people already own power bricks and fancy wireless earbuds. While that will lead to less waste, this shift and the price jump may annoy plenty of people.\nIt\u2019s tough to recommend splurging on a fancy phone in a pandemic. But here arethree quick questionsto ask yourself about whether it\u2019s time to upgrade:\nCan I still get software updates on my current phone?\nIs my device repairable for a reasonable cost?\nAm I happy with my phone?\nIf you answered no to any of the above questions, you will probably be happy investing in this upgrade.\nBut if you answered yes, wait it out. In a few years, the carriers will probably have a better handle on 5G. At that point, it may even be safe enough to leave the house again and reap the benefits of the mobile companions we carry everywhere."

        "title": "Apple Does Not Need to Return Fortnite to App Store, Judge Rules",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A federal judge ruled on Friday thatAppledid not need toreinstate the popular video game Fortnitein its App Store, in a blow toFortnite\u2019sparent company,Epic Games, which is locked in an antitrust battle with the tech giant over its app store fees and rules.\nJudge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California saidin her rulingthat Apple\u2019s ban of the game could continue because Epic had violated its contract with Apple. There is \u201csignificant public interest\u201d in requiring companies to adhere to contracts or resolve disputes through the normal course, she wrote.\nBut Judge Gonzales Rogers also said that Apple could not ban Unreal Engine, Epic\u2019s developer tools, from its platforms because of the \u201cpotential significant damage to both developers and gamers\u201d who rely on the software.\nThe mixed ruling showed the high cost of taking on a tech behemoth like Apple, even for an established company like Epic. The 116 million people who have accessed Fortnite through Apple\u2019s systems will continue to be kept away while Epic and Apple prepare for a trial in the case, which is scheduled for May.\nAn Epic spokeswoman said the company \u201cis grateful that Apple will continue to be barred from retaliating against Unreal Engine and our game development customers.\u201d Epic will continue developing for Apple\u2019s platforms and \u201cpursue all avenues to end Apple\u2019s anti-competitive behavior,\u201d she said.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company was grateful that the court \u201crecognized that Epic\u2019s actions were not in the best interests of its own customers and that any problems they may have encountered were of their own making when they breached their agreement.\u201d The spokesman added thatApple\u2019s app storehas been \u201can economic miracle\u201d that has created \u201ctransformative business opportunities\u201d for developers.\nEpic\u2019s battle with Apple comes as the largest tech companies face scrutiny of their power. On Tuesday, House lawmakers saidApple, Amazon, Facebook and Googlehad exercised and abused their monopoly power to stifle competition and harm consumers and recommended that the companies be restructured. European regulators have also opened aninvestigationinto whether Apple\u2019s app store rules are anticompetitive. And in the coming days, the Justice Department is expected to sue Google overanticompetitive search practices.\nAt the heart of Epic\u2019s case is Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s tight grip over smartphone apps in their app stores. Both companies require that developers use their payment systems and pay a 30 percent cut of any money they make in their apps.\n\u201cThey think they can just decide arbitrarily what apps can exist, and what fees can be charged, and tax all commerce,\u201dTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview last month. \u201cWe came gradually to the realization that we had to fight this, not just by words, but also by really broad actions.\u201d\nEpic has said it wants Apple to change its requirements that apps use its payment system and shell out a 30 percent fee. It also wants to operate its own app store within Apple\u2019s.\nThe companies began fighting in August, when Epic violated Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s rules by directing Fortnite users to its own payments service. Apple and Google responded by pulling Fortnite from their app stores. Epic then sued both companies, arguing they were breaking antitrust laws.\nApple later also cut off its support for Unreal Engine, Epic\u2019s software development tool that is used by thousands of game makers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers said on Friday that Apple must continue supporting Unreal Engine and could not retaliate against any of Epic\u2019s other affiliated apps or products.\nThe fight has escalated over the past few weeks. Apple has accused Epic of seeking a special deal for itself, while Epic has accused Apple of cherry-picking out-of-context emails in its legal response.\nOther companies have used the battle to criticize Apple. Microsoft filed a declaration in support of Epic and has announced a set of developer-friendly principlesfor its own app store. Facebook has also recently called out Apple\u2019s 30 percent app fees.\nSmaller app makers, normally wary of angering the tech giants, have found strength in numbers. In September, more than a dozen of them, including the music streaming service Spotify, the dating service Match Group and the Bluetooth tracking device maker Tile,formed a nonprofit groupcalled Coalition for App Fairness to push for changes to the app stores.\nIna hearinglast month, Apple said it was willing to reinstate Fortnite to its app store before a trial if Epic would return to complying with its rules. Judge Gonzalez Rogers proposed an arrangement that would put Apple\u2019s fees from Fortnite in an escrow account until after the trial. But Epic refused, arguing that doing so would be complying with a contract it views as unlawful.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t buy that argument before,\u201d Judge Gonzalez Rogers said in the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly impressed with it now.\u201d"

        "title": "12 Accusations in the Damning House Report on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google",
        "fulltext": "Read the report.\nHouse lawmakers released a scathing reporton four of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, accusing them of abusing their market power. The report, which was released on Tuesday and concludes a 16-month investigation into Amazon,Apple,FacebookandGoogle, recommended breaking up the companies and passing the most sweeping reforms toantitrust lawsin decades.\nHere is a summary of the accusations against each company in the report, which was endorsed only by Democratic lawmakers.\nThe company uses its market power as both the largest online retailer and the leading e-commerce marketplace to its advantage and to hobble potential competitors. Amazon sets the rules for digital commerce. About 2.3 million third-party sellers do business on the Amazon marketplace worldwide, the report said, and 37 percent of them rely on Amazon as their sole source of income \u2014 essentially making them hostage to Amazon\u2019s shifting tactics.\nAmazon harvests the sales and product data from its marketplace to spot hot-selling items, copy them and offer its own competing products, typically at lower prices. One former Amazon employee told the House investigators, \u201cAmazon is first and foremost a data company, they just happen to use it to sell stuff.\u201d\nIn cloud computing, where Amazon Web Services is the market leader, the company has dealt unfairly with some open source developers, whose software is often freely shared. One open-source engineer said, \u201cWe develop all this work and then some large company comes and monetizes that.\u201d\nApple has a monopoly on the app marketplace on iPhones and iPads, enabling the company to take an excessive cut of app developers\u2019 sales and \u201cgenerate supra-normal profits.\u201d Apple has chargeda 30 percent commissionon many app sales since it introduced the fee more than a decade ago, forcing many developers to raise prices for consumers or reduce investment in their apps.\nApple has used its control over the App Store to punish rivals, including by ranking them lower in search results, restricting how they communicate with customers, and removing them outright from the store. Apple is the sole enforcer of sometimes opaque App Store rules, leaving developers few options to complain.\nApple favors its own apps and services on its devices by pre-installing them and making them the default options for a variety of actions. For instance, when iPhone users click a link to a webpage, a song or an address, their devices will typically open Apple apps. Such an advantage, combined with the services\u2019 deep integration into Apple\u2019s software, makes it difficult for third-party apps and services to compete.\nFacebook\u2019s monopoly power in social networking is \u201cfirmly entrenched,\u201d and the company has snuffed out competitors through strategic acquisitions and copying products. Services like Onavo, a data analytics firm Facebook acquired, helped the company to spot \u201cearly bird warning\u201d signals on would-be competitors rising quickly in the app store.\nThe company has grown so overwhelmingly powerful that internal findings suggest its greatest competition exists within itself. Services like Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, grew so quickly that it threatened to overtake the popularity of Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg shifted his strategy quickly, in what one employee called \u201ccollusion, but within an internal monopoly.\u201d\nBecause of the absence of competition, user privacy has been eroded while misinformation and toxic content have proliferated across all of the company\u2019s services, which are used regularly by more than three billion people.\nGoogle maintained its search monopoly by grabbing information from third parties without permission to improve search results. In other instances, it introduced changes in search to give a leg up to its own services and disadvantage competitors\u2019 offerings.\nThe committee found that the company goes to great lengths to keep Google search front and center for users. In the past, it has forced smartphone makers to install Google search in order to use its Android software and have access to its Google Play app store. It pays Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones and it takes steps to prevent users from switching search providers on Chrome.\nGoogle has nine products with more than one billion users. That provides the company with a trove of data that can be used as \u201cnear-perfect market intelligence\u201d and reinforces its dominance because Google can track what new products or services people are using in real time to closely monitor competitors."

        "title": "When to Buy a New Phone. Or Not.",
        "fulltext": "Apple will talk on Tuesday about its new iPhones and other doodads.Brian X. Chen, a technology columnist for The New York Times, has a three-question quiz to help you decide whether it\u2019s worth considering a new smartphone or sticking with what you have. (You can watch Apple\u2019siPhoneunveilinghere.Or don\u2019t. The Times will havethe useful bits here.)\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when companies scratch and claw and advertise like heck to get us to buy the latest versions of their phones. The difference this year is that it\u2019s 2020, and the world feels upside down. Many of us are facing unemployment or dealing with stresses that can\u2019t be solved with slabs of computer circuits \u2014 and have no desire or ability to buy a new smartphone.\nThe good news is that modern smartphones are so robust and reliable that most of usprobably won\u2019t need to ditch our old ones. Here are a few questions to ask yourself to determine whether it\u2019s time to consider a new phone.\nCan I still get software updates?\nIf your smartphone is so old that the manufacturer is no longer issuing the latest operating system for your phone, you may need to consider buying a new one. Without the latest operating system, you may be missing out on important bug fixes and security enhancements. Some of your favorite apps may have also stopped working properly.\nHere\u2019s how to find out:\nApple\u2019swebsite showsthat its most recent operating software, iOS 14, works for phones going back to the iPhone 6S from 2015. If you own a model that\u2019s older than that, you should probably consider a new device.\nAndroids tend to have a shorter shelf life. On average, manufacturers support Android devices for two to three years before they stop providing updates to the operating system and security software. Do a web search for your phone model to find out whether it can download the latest version of Android, currently Android 11.\nFor example, owners of the original Google Pixel smartphone are no longer guaranteed to receive software or security updates, according to achart posted by Google. If you own the Pixel from 2016, it\u2019s a good time to replace it with a newer phone. Here\u2019ssome informationon Samsung smartphones that work with Android 11.\nIs my device beyond repair?\nIf your device can still get the freshest software but it has other problems, like a short-lived battery or a broken screen, I recommend researching whether it\u2019s worthrepairing the device. Replacing a battery costs about $50 to $70, and a new screen from an independent fix-it shop usually costs around $100. That\u2019s far cheaper (and less wasteful) than buying a new smartphone.\nBut at some point the cost of repairs isn\u2019t worth it. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to pay $1,000. Excellent smartphones, like theGoogle Pixel 4AandiPhone SE, cost $350 and $400.\nAm I unhappy with my phone?\nThis is a tough one because satisfaction is subjective. If you feel that your phone isn\u2019t keeping up with your needs in terms of speed, features or photo image quality, then it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to upgrade, assuming you can afford to. But try to make the decision based on your needs and wants, rather than caving to pressure from peers or corporate advertising.\nThis article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIt\u2019s Shira Ovide, taking over the rest of the newsletter.\nMark Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to give people a voice, and that has includedallowing denial of the Holocauston its websites and apps. The company on Mondaychanged its mind.\nFacebook\u2019s switcheroo is important for two reasons. First, it showed yet again that \u2014 despite the company\u2019s claims \u2014 it is in fact an arbiter of speech. And second, it pointed to a conundrum in Zuckerberg\u2019s argument that all views should be permitted online because the internet should be a place for people to be wrong.\nOn Facebook\u2019sstancethat it doesn\u2019t want to be an \u201carbiter of truth\u201d online, well, as I\u2019vewritten about before in this newsletter, it is.\nFacebook has thousands of pages of rules of what people are allowed to say and do on its websites and apps. Most of us would agree that it\u2019s good that Facebook takes a hard line against terrorists who openly plot violence online or people posting images of child sexual abuse. The debate is where Facebook should draw the lines in other areas and the trade offs of the company\u2019s decisions.\nSecond, the policy change exposes holes in Facebook\u2019s principles. When Zuckerberg two years ago defended the ability of Holocaust deniers to post their views, hesaidthat people should have room to say factually wrong, even abhorrent, things on the internet \u2014 unless the bad information resulted in real-world harm.\nThat sounds reasonable. But in reality, wrong information on the internet often has devastating consequences. Unfounded information aboutwireless technology causing the coronavirus, about aschool shooting being a hoaxor aboutcriminal activity in a Washington pizza parlorall caused real harm. Zuckerbergsaidthat his views on Holocaust denial and distortions changed after he saw information about increases in anti-Semitic violence.\nThat reality most likely requires Facebook to devote more people and money to effectively spot when the lines have been crossed between online expression and real-world danger. And it requires a commitment from Facebook to be smarter about understanding humans and not merely regurgitating free speech principles that don\u2019t stand up to logic.\nDivided recommendations on an Uber ballot measure:IwroteMonday about Uber and other app companies backing a ballot measure in California that would overturn a state law requiring app contract workers to be reclassified as employees.

        "title": "Microsoft Says App Stores Should Be More Competitive",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft said on Thursday that it would give developers more control in its app store, providing a sharp contrast to Apple, which is facing growing pressure for its firm grip on its App Store.\nMicrosoft said it was adopting 10 \u201cprinciples\u201d for its app store, the Microsoft Store, that customers can use to install programs on Windows 10, the computer operating system. The guidelines include giving developers the ability to sell different services on their apps and their websites, and allowing users and developers to have access to third-party app stores.\nThe announcement was not a major change in policy for Microsoft, whose app store is more open than Apple\u2019s. But it added a powerful voice to a raging debate about how the large tech companies should manage their app stores, where they act as powerful gatekeepers between developers and consumers.\nThe principles aim \u201cto promote choice, ensure fairness and promote innovation,\u201d Rima Alaily, deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in ablog post announcing the approach.\nApple is at the center of the debate over app marketplaces because it forces developers to distribute their apps on iPhones and iPads through its hugely lucrative App Store and then takes a 30 percent cut of many of those apps\u2019 sales. Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has accused Apple in an antitrust lawsuit of abusing its size to overcharge app developers. On Tuesday, Houselawmakers claimed that Apple had a monopoly on the apps marketplace for iPhones and iPads, leading to higher prices for consumers.\nApple has defended its App Store, and questioned the findings of the House report, saying that the cut it takes from developers is standard in the industry and that developers have flourished under the trust customers have in safely downloading apps on iPhones and iPads.\n\u201cThe App Store has enabled new markets, new services and new products that were unimaginable a dozen years ago, and developers have been primary beneficiaries of this ecosystem,\u201d the company said on Tuesday. It did not respond to a request for comment about Microsoft\u2019s announcement.\nMicrosoft\u2019s principles largely echo theproposals made by the Coalition for App Fairness, a new nonprofit representing app developers. The group\u2019s members include Epic Games, Spotify and Match Group, the developer of Tinder. The coalition has said it aims to coordinate the response of smaller companies in the hope of changing the standards for large app stores.\nMs. Alaily said she hoped Microsoft\u2019s commitment to the standards could be a \u201cproductive\u201d example for regulators and lawmakers as they consider whether to change the app store model.\nMicrosoft\u2019s application store is not the only way, nor even the primary way, customers get new programs on a computer. Most users download them from a developer\u2019s website. The company already allows other app stores on Windows 10, such as the game streaming platform Steam.\nBut Microsoft is a developer itself andhas clashed with Apple recentlyover its all-you-can-play cloud gaming app, which gives users access to many games through one interface. Apple said each game would need to be approved by Apple as a stand-alone game \u2014 and give Apple a cut. In July, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president,toldthe House antitrust committee that he believed Apple\u2019s behavior resembled the controlling practices that got Microsoft into antitrust problems decades ago.\n\u201cAs an app developer,\u201d Ms. Alaily wrote, \u201cwe have been frustrated at times by other app stores that require us to sell services in our apps even when our users don\u2019t expect or want them, and we cannot do so profitably.\u201d\nMicrosoft said its principles would not apply to its Xbox gaming console, which it argued followed a different business model. It said that gaming consoles were sold with little or no profit, or at times below cost, and that it instead recouped the development costs through the games."

        "title": "Big Tech Was Their Enemy, Until Partisanship Fractured the Battle Plans",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For all the divisions in Washington, one issue that had united Republicans and Democrats in recent years was their animus toward the power of the biggest tech companies.\nThat bipartisanship was supposed to come together this week in a landmark House report that capsa 15-month investigationinto thepractices of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The report was set to feature recommendations from lawmakers to rein in the companies, including the most sweeping changes to U.S. antitrust laws in half a century.\nBut over the past few days, support for the recommendations has split largely along party lines, said five people familiar with the talks, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the discussions are private.\nOn Monday, the Democratic staff on the House Judiciary Committee delayed the report\u2019s release because they were unable to gain Republican support. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the committee, has asked his colleagues not to endorse the Democratic-led report, said two people with knowledge of the discussions. And Representative Ken Buck, a Republican of Colorado, has circulated a separate report \u2014 titled \u201cThe Third Way\u201d \u2014 that pushes back against some of the Democrats\u2019 legislative recommendations, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times.\nThe Republicans\u2019 chief objections to the report are that some of the legislative proposals against the tech giants could hamper other businesses and impede economic growth, said four people with knowledge of the situation. Several Republicans were also frustrated that the report didn\u2019t address claims of anti-conservative bias from the tech platforms. Mr. Buck said in \u201cThe Third Way\u201d that some of the recommendations were \u201ca nonstarter for conservatives.\u201d\nThe partisan bickering has cast a cloud over what would be Congress\u2019s most aggressive act to curtail the power of technology companies since Microsoft stood trial on antitrust claims two decades ago. And while the House report may still be released this week, it is likely to lose some of its force if Democrats, led by Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, are unable to gain many signatures from Republican members.\nThe turmoil gives Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google a reprieve, even if only temporarily. The House committee was expected to accuse them of rising to the top of the global economy by gobbling up nascent rivals, bullying businesses that needed them to reach users and reducing competition across the economy, said three people familiar with the report.\nThe report was also expected to kick off other actions against the tech giants. The Justice Department has been working tofile an antitrust complaint against Google, followed by separate suits against the internet search giant from state attorneys general.\nMr. Cicilline declined to comment. Russell Dye, a spokesman for Mr. Jordan, also declined to comment.\n\u201cI agree with Chairman Cicilline that big tech has acted anti-competitively,\u201d Mr. Buck said in a statement. But, he added, \u201cwith a problem this significant, I\u2019m not surprised that there\u2019s a variety of legislative options.\u201d\nTheHouse Judiciary Committee began its investigationinto the four tech giants in June 2019 with bipartisan support. The committee interviewed hundreds of rivals and business clients of the platforms, such as third-party sellers on Amazon and developers who distribute their apps through Apple\u2019s App Store.\nIn July, the chief executives of the tech behemoths \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2014testified in a hearingwith the committee to defend their companies. Republican and Democratic lawmakers directed sharp questions at the chief executives, repeatedly interrupting and talking over them.\nBut the bipartisanship has eroded. Mr. Jordan, who became the committee\u2019s top Republican this year, has been publicly skeptical of the investigation. He spent much of his time in the July hearing attacking the chief executives for their platforms\u2019 alleged bias against conservatives, straying from the session\u2019s stated focus of antitrust laws and Silicon Valley\u2019s market power.\nLast week, the committee\u2019s Democratic staff made its draft report available to all members of the committee who wanted to review it, said a person with knowledge of the proceedings. The lawmakers were not allowed to take a copy of the draft with them, the person said.\nOn Friday, staff received new evidence about Facebook\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram to include in the report, which also delayed it, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\nMr. Jordan now has no plans to sign on to the Democrats\u2019 report, one person said. His reluctance to endorse the report may cause other Republicans on the committee to withhold their signatures.\nMr. Buck shared his separate report, \u201cThe Third Way,\u201d in recent days. It supports several recommendations made by the committee\u2019s Democrats, including giving more resources to federal antitrust agencies and making limited legislative changes to empower enforcement of antitrust laws. But it pushes back against other proposals, like not allowing companies online to compete on platforms they operate, calling it a \u201cthinly veiled call to break up Big Tech firms,\u201d according to the draft obtained by The Times.\nMr. Jordan\u2019s office was not involved in the drafting process for Mr. Buck\u2019s \u201cThird Way,\u201d said a person familiar with the matter. The documentwas reported earlierby Politico.\nAntitrust laws last underwent a major alteration nearly 50 years ago, when new rules were enacted around merger reviews. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 required companies to notify the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department \u2014 the main antitrust enforcement agencies \u2014 of large mergers. Those laws are now regarded by tech\u2019s critics as insufficient in accounting for the companies\u2019 power to quickly expand across new markets and kill off young competitors.\nWilliam Kovacic, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust report \u201chas the potential to be the most influential study of its kind since the 1970s.\u201d He added, \u201cIt could lead to really big changes, but any changes would come slowly.\u201d"

        "title": "Fix, or Toss? The \u2018Right to Repair\u2019 Movement Gains Ground",
        "fulltext": "If you buy a product \u2014 a car, a smartphone, or even a tractor \u2014 and it breaks, should it be easier for you to fix it yourself?\nManufacturers of a wide range of products have made it increasingly difficult over the years to repair things, for instance by limiting availability of parts or by putting prohibitions on who gets to tinker with them. It affects not only game consoles or farm equipment, but cellphones, military gear, refrigerators, automobiles and even hospital ventilators, the lifesaving devices that have proven crucial this year in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.\nNow, a movement known as \u201cright to repair\u201d is starting to make progress in pushing for laws that prohibit restrictions like these.\nThis August, Democrats introduced a bill in Congress to block manufacturers\u2019 limits on medical devices, spurred by the pandemic. In Europe, the European Commission announced plans in March fornew right-to-repair rulesthat would cover phones, tablets, and laptops by 2021.\nIn less than two weeks, Massachusetts voters will consider a measure that would make it easier for local garages to work on cars. And in more than 20 statehouses nationwide, right-to-repair legislation has been introduced in recent years by both Republicans and Democrats.\nOver the summer, the House advanced a funding bill that includes a requirement that theFTC complete a reporton anticompetitive practices in the repair market and present its findings to Congress and the public. And in aletterto the Federal Trade Commission, Marine Captain Elle Ekman and former Marine Lucas Kunce last year detailed how mechanics in the American armed forces have run into similar obstacles.\nThe goal of right-to-repair rules, advocates say, is to require companies to make their parts, tools and information available to consumers and repair shops in order to keep devices from ending up in the scrap heap. They argue that the rules restrict people\u2019s use of devices that they own and encourage a throwaway culture by making repairs too difficult.\nThey also argue that it\u2019s part of a culture of planned obsolescence \u2014 the idea that products are designed to be short-lived in order to encourage people to buy more stuff. That contributes to wasted natural resources and energy use at a time when climate change requires movement in the opposite direction to rein in planet-warming emissions.\nManufacturing a new device or appliance is still largely reliant on polluting sources of energy \u2014 electricity generated from burning fossil fuels, for instance \u2014 and constitutes the largest environmental impact for most products. Mining and manufacturing materials for thenewestiPhone, for example, represents roughly 83 percent of its contribution to the heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere throughout its life cycle, according to Apple\u2019smanufacturing data. For a washing machine, it\u2019s about57 percent.\nAdd to that complex calculus the emissions from assembling the materials into a product, and then shipping it around the world.\n\u201cThere are a lot of products that are not designed to last,\u201d said Gay Gordon-Byrne, the executive director of theRepair Association, a group focused on right-to-repair legislation. \u201cBut if you have enough options for repair, you can keep even the worst product going, if you can fix it.\u201d\nManufacturers argue that their products are repairable, and that they are protecting consumers\u2019 safety, privacy and security by restricting who does the repairs. Apple, for instance, limits consumers from repairing their devices by requiring specific tools or authorized parts.\n\u201cWhen a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in areleaselast year. \u201cWe believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman this week pointed to the company\u2019s efforts to expand its product repair programs: Last fall, the tech giantannouncedit will give independent repair businesses the same genuine parts, tools, and diagnostics for iPhone repairs as it gives to Apple-authorized service providers.\nOther companies argue that the computer code that drives the device remains the property of the manufacturer, not the consumer, which further limits the potential for third-party repair. Tractor manufacturerJohn Deereis one example, usinglicense agreementswith farmers that forbid them from even looking at the software running the tractor. Violating it could be considered breach of contract, which comes with the risk of a lawsuit.\nJen Hartmann, John Deere\u2019s director of strategic public relations, said the company has \u201cmade anindustry commitmentalong with several ag equipment manufacturers to provide a comprehensive tool kit of service tools available to help end users perform service and maintenance on their machinery.\u201d\nFor Leticia Reynolds earlier this year, it was a safety issue of a different sort. As a medical equipment technician at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, she was eager to get ventilators in service. The country faced a nationwide shortage of the lifesaving machines, which help desperately ill patients breathe.\nBut there were some that Ms. Reynolds couldn\u2019t fix herself, because the manufacturer wouldn\u2019t let her. Some ventilator makers are among those companies imposing rules prohibiting anyone but their own technicians from obtaining the tools, parts, and instructions to make repairs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100-percent solely depending on the manufacturer,\u201d she said, even for routine maintenance. But that can delay repairs, which can mean \u201cequipment isn\u2019t available for a patient that needs it.\u201d\nOver the past year or so, as much of the world was cooped up due to stay-at-home restrictions, sales of Nintendo\u2019s Switch console have increased sharply. But players have been struggling with a problem that has plagued its detachable wireless controllers, called Joy-Cons, for years: Sometimes it thinks players are moving the controller, even if they aren\u2019t.\nThat led to aclass-action lawsuitclaiming, among other things, that the company \u201croutinely refuses to repair the joysticks without charge.\u201d The case is now in arbitration, and since then, the company has begun fixing Joy-Con issues at no charge.\nStill, the fight continues: Last month, a French consumer advocacy groupfileda complaint alleging planned obsolescence, claiming Nintendo knew some controllers were failing too quickly.\nNintendo did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhile these burdens on repair can make some gadgets seem unusable and, consequently, disposable, some argue that new repair mandates wouldn\u2019t have a measurable effect on how often people replace their products.\n\u201cCommon consumer devices such as laptops and smartphones are already widely reused and recycled without any type of new repair mandate,\u201d said Walter Alcorn, vice president of environmental affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, an industry trade group that represents thousands of technology companies including Apple, Dell, and Microsoft.\nHe said that CTA\u2019s biennial survey showed that only 2 percent of consumers \u201creport throwing their old mobile device in the trash while more than 10 times as many reported either trading in their old mobile device, selling it, giving it away, or recycling it.\u201d\nThe idea of planned obsolescence isn\u2019t new. It was written about in 1928 by Justus George Frederick, an American advertising expert who suggested that people would have to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, then discard them and purchase new things, in order to help keep a consumer economy steaming along.\nSince at least the early 1960s, critics have complained that planned obsolescence wastes people\u2019s money, uses valuable resources and chokes landfills. Today, for example, there are more than 70 different elements in a modern smartphone \u2014 nearly two-thirds of the periodic table in the palm of your hand.\nResearch suggests that consumer devices may be more short-lived than in the past. According toa studyby a German sustainability research group, \u00d6ko-Institut, the proportion of major household appliances that died within five years rose from 3.5 percent in 2004 to 8.3 percent in 2012. Though the analysis is now several years old, it found the trend in a wide spectrum of products, including TV sets and large electrical appliances as well as mobile phones.\nExtending the life of a product even relatively briefly can have significant benefits, according to Nathan Proctor, who leads the right-to-repair campaign at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group. If Americans would extend the life of their cellphones by one year, for instance, it would be the climate-saving equivalent of taking 636,000 cars off the road, or about the amount of passenger vehicles registered in the state of New Mexico.\nRight to repair advocates like Ms. Gordon-Byrne and Mr. Proctor highlight recent strides in the automotive industry. In next month\u2019s election, Massachusetts will have a question on the ballot designed to ensure that drivers will continue to be able to have local repair shops \u2014 not just authorized dealers \u2014 work on their cars as they become more automated and manufacturers control access to that data.\nThat measure is designed to build on a2012 bill in the statethat required carmakers to provide independent repair shops with access to the diagnostic tools that had been available only to dealerships.\nThe new measure, known as Question 1 on the ballot, has met resistance.\n\u201cIf Question 1 passes in Massachusetts, anyone could access the most personal data stored in your vehicle,\u201dsays the narratorin one advertisement. The campaign against the measure talks about the risks of hacking, identity theft and cyberstalking as part of amultimillion-dollar advertising spendby a group called Coalition for Safe and Secure Data, a manufacturer-backed organization that is fighting the question in November.\nConor Yunits, a spokesman for the coalition, said it sees the new measure as unnecessary: \u201cMassachusetts is already the only state that has a right to repair law on the books. The technology they care about \u2014 telematics \u2014 is already covered by the existing law. In our view, this is an attempt by national auto parts chains to get access to more consumer data.\u201d\nManufacturers have considerable influence over the standards to which their products are made, said Mark Schaffer, a consultant on the life cycle of electronics. According to a2017 reportthat he wrote, that\u2019s because major manufacturers sit on the panels that set guidelines for things like environmental impact. As a result, he said, tougher standards can be difficult to achieve.\n\u201cAs a whole, the industry needs to raise the floor on repairability,\u201d Mr. Schaffer said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not going to happen until there is a legal requirement at a state or at a national level.\u201d"
