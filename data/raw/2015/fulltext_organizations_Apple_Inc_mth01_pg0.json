        "fulltext": "It is officially the first full week of the new year, and you know what that means: time to take note of what to watch for in 2015. I think it\u2019s going to be a doozy. Why? Well, here\u2019s what I have at the\n                                        top of my agenda:\n1) Oscar de la Renta and the red carpet\nTheGolden Globe awardswill be announced on Sunday, which means that the\n                                        red carpet watch has officially begun. Since the death in October ofOscar de la Renta,that designer\u2019s brand has been\n                                        among the best represented on the awards circuit. Celebrities in Manhattan, Hollywood and Washington \u2014 including Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lawrence, Tina Fey and Michelle Obama \u2014 have paid homage\n                                        to the designer\u2019s ability to make a woman feel beautiful.\nThis awards season will be the last chance to wear a design by the man himself, as the recent pre-fall collection was the last he touched. It might also offer a chance to unveil looks bythe brand\u2019s new creative director, Peter Copping,\n                                        whose first show bows at New York Fashion Week in February. I can\u2019t help but feel the Golden Globes will be a de la Renta bonanza. As of the week before Christmas, one dress from the pre-fall collection,\n                                        a strapless, tiered, midnight-blue number dotted with diamonds like stars in the night sky, had been requested by four different stylists for Golden Globe clients.\n2) John Galliano\u2019s return show\nIt\u2019s in a week! John Galliano willreturn to the fashion spotlighton Jan. 12 with his first couture show \u2014 for Maison Martin Margiela \u2014 sincehis final Christian Dior couture showin March 2011\n                                        (at which he did not actually appear, as he had just been dismissed). It\u2019s not exactly a step back into the lion\u2019s den. Instead of showing on the couture schedule with his peers in Paris, Mr. Galliano\u2019s\n                                        event will be two weeks earlier, just after the shows of London Collections: Men, and on the safe home ground of London. To me, this denotes a certain nervousness on the designer\u2019s part.\nIt will be interesting to see if Mr. Galliano\u2019s time away from the industry has incited a creative evolution, and whether he has tried to adapt his aesthetic to that of the brand he now represents. Hopefully\n                                        the answer to both questions will be yes; otherwise, he risks the whiff of irrelevance. We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n3) Frida Giannini\u2019s replacement at Gucci\nFrida Giannini\u2019slast Gucci showwill be in late February, and Kering, the brand\u2019s\n                                        parent company, says that an announcement on her replacement will not be made until March. But speculation will probably reach a fever pitch during the shows, with audience members watching eagerly for displays\n                                        of Gucci-isms on other runways.\nRumor has it that the leading contenders are Hedi Slimane of Saint Laurent, Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy, Joseph Altuzarra and Christopher Kane (the last two were recently snapped up by Kering, perhaps in part as an insurance\n                                        policy for just this sort of event). The suspense may even overshadow the debuts of Mr. Copping at Oscar de la Renta, ofNad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski at Herm\u00e8sand of Guillaume Henry at Nina Ricci. Also probably overshadowed will be the announcement about who will take the reins at Carven, now that Mr. Henry has moved on.\n4) The political catwalk\nIt\u2019s going to be a big year in politics, with the British general election in May, voting in Canada expected in October and Americans gearing up for contests in 2016. As Instagram increasingly becomes the social\n                                        media platform of choice, what the candidates wear and how they come across visually will become evermore important and considered. That means that there will be lots of fodder for watchers of sartorial strategy\n                                        and for public reactions. Goody.\n5) The Apple Watch goes on sale\nIt is one thing to unveil a new wearable object (and I am expecting big things from the Consumer Electronics Show, which officially opens on Tuesday with a keynote speech from a man who is fast proving himself to be\n                                        Mr. Fashion: Brian M. Krzanich of Intel), and to cause all sorts of buzz, but it is an entirely different thing to sell it.The Apple Watchwill finally become available in the first part of the year, and it will be fascinating to see whether consumers really put their money where their wrists are. If they do, expect a gigantic jump on the bandwagon\n                                        as far as wearables go. If not, we could be going back to the design board.\nI, for one, can\u2019t wait."

        "title": "New Rules in China Upset Western Tech Companies",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese government has adopted new regulations requiring companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over secret source code, submit to invasive audits and build so-called back doors into hardware and software, according to a copy of the rules obtained by foreign technology companies that do billions of dollars\u2019 worth of business in China.\nThe new rules, laid out in a 22-page document approved at the end of last year, are the first in a series of policies expected to be unveiled in the coming months that Beijing says are intended to strengthen cybersecurity in critical Chinese industries. As copies have spread in the past month, the regulations have heightened concern among foreign companies that the authorities are trying to force them out of one of the largest and fastest-growing markets.\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to a top-level Communist Party committee on cybersecurity, led by President Xi Jinping, foreign business groups objected to the new policies and complained that they amounted to protectionism.\nThe groups, which include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called for \u201curgent discussion and dialogue\u201d about what they said was a \u201cgrowing trend\u201d toward policies that cite cybersecurity in requiring companies to use only technology products and services that are developed and controlled by Chinese companies.\nThe letter is the latest salvo in an intensifying tit-for-tat between China and the United States over online security and technology policy. While the United States hasaccused Chinese military personnelof hacking and stealing from American companies, China haspointed to recent disclosuresof United States snooping in foreign countries as a reason to get rid of American technology as quickly as possible.\nAlthough it is unclear to what extent the new rules result from security concerns, and to what extent they are cover for building up the Chinese tech industry, the Chinese regulations go far beyond measures taken by most other countries, lending some credibility to industry claims that they are protectionist. Beijing also has long used the Internet to keep tabs on its citizens and ensure the Communist Party\u2019s hold on power.\nChinese companies must also follow the new regulations, though they will find it easier since for most, their core customers are in China.\nChina\u2019s Internet filters have increasingly created a world with two Internets, a Chinese one and a global one. The new policies could further split the tech world, forcing hardware and software makers to sell either to China or the United States, or to create significantly different products for the two countries.\nWhile the Obama administration will almost certainly complain that the new rules are protectionist in nature, the Chinese will be able to make a case that they differ only in degree from Washington\u2019s own requirements.\nThe United States has made it virtually impossible for Huawei, a major Chinese maker of computer servers and cellphones, to sell its products in the United States, arguing that its equipment could have \u201cback doors\u201d for the Chinese government.\nThe documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, revealed a major effort by the agency to enter Huawei\u2019s systems, both to figure out who controls the company and to create back doors that the United States could exploit.\nRecent calls by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey, to assure that the United States has a key to decrypt information stored on iPhones and other devices will doubtless be used by the Chinese to argue that all governments need access to sensitive computer systems.\nFor multinationals, the Chinese market is simply too big to ignore. China is expected to spend $465 billion in 2015 on information and communications technology, according tothe research firm IDC, which says the expansion of China\u2019s tech market will account for 43 percent of worldwide tech sector growth.\nAnalysts said new Chinese policies like the bank rules and an antiterrorism law that is still in draft form would make doing business increasingly difficult in China for foreign hardware and software companies.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re obviously targeting foreign vendors that are operating in China,\u201d said Matthew Cheung, a researcher at the analytics firm Gartner. \u201cThey are promoting the local technologies so that local providers who have the capabilities to provide systems to these enterprises can get more market share.\u201d\nFor instance, the bank rules say 75 percent of technology products used by Chinese institutions must be classified as \u201csecure and controllable\u201d by 2019.\nThough analysts say \u201csecure and controllable\u201d \u2014 a phrase that peppers several new Chinese technology policies \u2014 may be open to interpretation, a chart attached to the banking regulations shows the troubles foreign companies could have in winning that classification for their products.\nFor most computing and networking equipment, the chart says, source code must be turned over to Chinese officials. But many foreign companies would be unwilling to disclose code because of concerns about intellectual property, security and, in some cases, United States export law.\nThe chart also calls for companies that want to sell to banks to set up research and development centers in China, obtain permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build \u201cports\u201d to allow Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardware.\nThe draft antiterrorism law pushes even further, calling for companies to store all data related to Chinese users on servers in China, create methods for monitoring content for terror threats and provide keys to encryption to public security authorities.\n\u201cBanking is the first industry where we are aware a black-and-white regulatory document was issued,\u201d said Jeffrey Yao, a vice president for enterprise research at IDC. \u201cIn some other industries, if you talk to the customers, many of them get the pressure to adopt the local brands, but in most of the cases they are via internal communications from the top officers.\u201d\nSome of America\u2019s largest tech companies could be hurt by the rules, including Apple, which is making a big push into the country. Apple has used new encryption methods in the iPhone 6 that are based on a complicated mathematical algorithm tied to a code unique to each phone. Apple says it has no access to the codes, but under the proposed antiterrorism law, it would be required to provide a key so that the Chinese government could decrypt data stored on iPhones.\nA growing number of American technology executives have complained about new barriers to access to the Chinese market. John T. Chambers, the chief executive of the network equipment maker Cisco Systems, has raised the issue, as have executives at the chip maker Qualcomm. This week, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said his company was working through \u201cgeopolitical issues\u201d regarding China.\nIn the letter, the Western companies voiced concerns about a broader \u201ccybersecurity review regime\u201d under which the Chinese government would assess the \u201csecurity and controllability\u201d of hardware, software and technology services sold in China, through audits and other checks. More details about the checks will be sent in February to the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs, the committee led by the Chinese president, according to a recent report by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.\nThe committee, which was created after the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, is leading the charge in consolidating and streamlining online security efforts in China. Analysts said it had most likely presided over or given tacit support to the new policies.\nThe leadership committee is said to be also trying to wean the country from its reliance on foreign technology, a longstanding goal that has gained urgency after Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations.\nZuo Xiaodong, vice president of the China Information Security Research Institute, said the new policies and the broader push for indigenous innovation were not intended to eliminate foreign companies from the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re under the yoke of others. If the others stop services, what do we do?\u201d he said, noting that many Chinese companies and local governments had to scramble when Microsoft discontinued its support of Windows XP. \u201cFrom a security perspective, that simply wasn\u2019t acceptable. We\u2019re breaking away from these types of circumstances.\"\nEven if Beijing wants it to, the banking industry cannot immediately do away with all foreign hardware makers, Mr. Yao of IDC said. Banks purchase billions of dollars\u2019 worth of hardware and software to manage transactions, and Chinese companies cannot yet produce some of the higher-end servers and mainframes they rely on.\nMr. Yao said 90 percent of high-end servers and mainframes in China were still produced by multinationals. Still, Chinese companies are catching up at the lower end.\n\u201cFor all enterprise hardware, local brands represented 21.3 percent revenue share in 2010 in P.R.C. market and we expect in 2014 that number will reach 43.1 percent,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge jump.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Applehas acquired Semetric, a company that analyzes data about music online, a move that may hint at Apple\u2019s ambitions as it prepares to revamp iTunes and Beats Music.\nIn documents filed with public regulators in Britain, where Semetric is based, the company changed its address to one in London associated with Apple, and named an Apple lawyer, Gene D. Levoff, as a company director. A person briefed on the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Apple had bought Semetric, although further details, including the price, could not be confirmed.\nAn Apple spokesman said: \u201cApple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.\u201d A representative of Semetric did not respond to inquiries. The news was first reported early Wednesday by the websiteMusic Ally.\nSemetric, known for its service Musicmetric, is one of a growing number of companies that record labels, artist managers and others turn to for data about how music is consumed online. This information has become coveted as more listeners turn from CDs and downloads to streaming outlets like Spotify and YouTube. Musicmetric, along with rivals like Next Big Sound, tracks streaming services and social media chatter, and sells that information to clients like record companies and talent agents.\nFor Apple, the deal may signal a desire to expand its online music offerings after buying Beats last year for $3 billion. The availability of useful data has become a critical point for artists and labels, and Apple is eager to present itself as a valuable partner, music executives say. Apple is said to bedeveloping its plansfor Beats, which may include making the app a standard feature on iPhones and iPads, as well as changing iTunes to work in concert with Beats.\nApple\u2019s deal for Semetric is the latest of a number of investments in streaming music and data. Last year, Spotify bought Echo Nest for $91 million, mostly in stock. And also on Wednesday, Shazam, the popular song identification app that has a data-sharing agreement with the Warner Music Group, said that it hadraised $30 millionin new investment, bringing its valuation to $1 billion."

        "fulltext": "Apple continues to make billions of dollars from mobile apps sold in its App Store. The company said on Thursday that in 2014, billings from app salesrose 50 percentfrom the previous year, which results in roughly $15 billion in revenue for app developers and a $4.5 billion cut for Apple.\nApple takes a 30-percent cut of each app sale made in its App Store. The $4.5 billion sum is a tiny sliver for Apple, which makes more than $180 billion in annual sales. But it is still a considerable sum for providing\n                                        a storefront for developers to sell their apps.\nBy comparison, Google\u2019s Android is the largest mobile operating system in the world, but its app store, Google Play, generates far less money than Apple\u2019s. That\u2019s partly because Apple\u2019s iPhone\n                                        customers are wealthier and spend more money than people who own Android phones.

In June 2014, Google said it had paid out $5 billion to developers in the previous 12 months.

        "title": "What Happens if Apple Drops Google From Its Browser?",
        "fulltext": "When Google reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, one subject that is almost guaranteed to come up is the prospect that Apple could replace Google as the default search engine on Safari, the basic browser\n                                        on all of its devices. The search contract between the companies is believed to be up forrenewal this year.\nGiven that Apple has spent much of the past few years trying to strip Google services like Maps and YouTube out of its products, the natural question is whether Apple will extend that to Google\u2019s bread-and-butter\n                                        search engine. Representatives from Google and Apple declined to comment on their search deal.\nOne person who is commenting is Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive. In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Ms. Mayer said Yahoo would seek to replace Google as the default search engine on Apple\u2019s\n                                        Safari browser.\n\u201cSafari users are the most engaged and lucrative in the world,\u201d she said.\nMs. Mayer, who built her reputation overseeing Google\u2019s Internet search business, said that Yahoo remained committed to search. The company is discussing changes to its 10-year search partnership with Microsoft,\n                                        which is at the midway mark.\nSo let\u2019s say that Apple dumps Google in favor of another search engine like Yahoo or Microsoft\u2019s Bing. How bad would that be for Google? According to various reports from analysts, the impact on Google\u2019s\n                                        bottom line would be minimal. There\u2019s even an argument that it could come out ahead.\nCentral to these analyses are two questions that are difficult to answer. The first: How much does Google pay Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, iPads and Macs? Estimates are all over the place, from\n                                        35 percent to 80 percent of the revenue made for searches that go through the Google search bar. The second: If Apple put a new search engine on Safari, how many people would just switch back to Google?\nNormally, that second question would be nothing but a wild guess about the future. But, as it happens, Yahoostruck a dealin November to displace Google as the default search service on Mozilla\u2019s Firefox web browser, which accounts for 3 to 5 percent of searches. So there is some fresh data to at least consider.\nShortly after the change, Yahoo\u2019s share of the United States search market hit a five-year high, according toStatCounter.\nBut since then, it has started to erode. After the deal, Google\u2019s share of paid clicks from Firefox\u2019s updated browser \u2013- the one with Yahoo as the default search engine \u2013- fell to 49 percent\n                                        from 61 percent, according to RKG, a digital marketing agency. However, within two weeksthat share had increased to 53 percentas people either switched their default back to Google or went to Google\u2019s home page to search.\n\u201cThey have a loyal user base that will find them if needed,\u201d said Mark Ballard, RKG\u2019s director of research. \u201cThe default search provider isn\u2019t a guarantee that you can own the marketplace.\u201d\nApple is more important than Firefox, of course. The iPhone has fewer users than phones running Google\u2019s Android software, but Apple customers are wealthier and spend more, something that is important to Google\n                                        since it is really just an advertising company.\nDespite that, analysts aren\u2019t very worried about the prospect of Safari dropping Google. Carlos Kirjner, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, estimated that in the worst-case scenario Google\u2019s 2015\n                                        per-share earnings would be reduced by 6 percent from what they otherwise would have been.\nRoss Sandler, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, believes Google could actually come out ahead. That\u2019s because while Google has to pay some unknown amount to Apple for many of the Google searches done through Safari,\n                                        it would not have to share revenue from whatever \u201crecaptured\u201d searches it got after the deal expired.\nSo even if traffic fell, it might end up making more money per search.\nA version of this article appears in print on 01/29/2015, on pageB2of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Yahoo Could Be Appleu2019s Search Engine if a Deal With Google Ends."

        "fulltext": "EVERY new mobile operating system needs a little time to settle in. But now thatApple\u2019s iOS 8 has been out about four months \u2014 long enough to fix some bugs in iOS 8.1 \u2014 we have had some time to get used to its new features.\nWhether you are still getting used to it or looking for a reason to upgrade, here are some of my top tips for getting the most out of Apple\u2019s latest mobile operating system.\nKNOW YOUR BATTERYThe new version of iOS finally lets you know exactly what is using up your battery life, instead of giving you mystery percentages. In the Settings menu, under General and then Usage, you will see an option called Battery Usage. Tap that and you will see a list of apps and exactly how much battery power they have used that day and over the last seven days.\nThe amount largely depends on you; I text all the time, and that is obvious from the usage patterns. Messages accounted for 21 percent of my battery drain over the last seven days. But if you find any surprising apps, just double-tap on the home button to see all running apps and swipe up to close the offender (or offenders).\nTALK TO SIRI HANDS-FREEHolding down the home button to reach Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, Siri, is so last version. In the Siri menu under general settings, there\u2019s an option to turn on \u201cHey Siri.\u201d Then, instead of holding down the home button, you can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d and ask your question, set your reminder or start a text message or phone call.\nThe feature works only when the phone is plugged in \u2014 a pretty big miss, considering that Google introduceda similar feature for Androidphones in 2013, and it works whether or not the phone is plugged in (it\u2019s activated by saying \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d)\nBut if you keep your phone plugged in while you\u2019re driving, as many of us do (battery life still not being what it should be), the hands-free Siri service is a useful feature if you\u2019re lost or need to start a call. And it can be helpful if the phone is plugged in across the room and you need to ask for the weather, for example.\nIDENTIFY THAT SONGSiri now integrates with the music-recognition service Shazam. It can listen to music playing around you and tell you what the song is \u2014 great when a good song plays during a commercial or TV show, or in the car. To find out what the song is, ask Siri, \u201cWhat\u2019s playing?\u201d The phone will listen for a bit and then, in most cases, say and display the name of the song and artist, including a link to buy it from iTunes.\nSCAN CREDIT CARDS IN SAFARIThis is a fairly useful tool for mobile users, but I wish it went a bit further. If you are shopping on a website in the Safari browser on either a phone or an iPad and you don\u2019t have an account on the site, you will inevitably have to enter your credit card number.\nJust above the keyboard, you will see an option to Scan Credit Card. Then, hold your credit card up to the device\u2019s camera and it will read the credit card number and expiration date and enter it for you on the site. The camera doesn\u2019t take a picture of your card; it just scans it and transfers the numbers.\nIt can\u2019t read the security code \u2014 or it couldn\u2019t whenever I tried it \u2014 and you will still have to enter your billing information. But it does reduce typing mistakes, and it worked reliably every time I tried it.\nUSE A DIFFERENT KEYBOARDFor the most part with Apple, you get what you get; there is little to customize or personalize. But with iOS 8, Apple gave users the ability to download and use alternate keyboards.\nThe built-in keyboard is quite good \u2014 although the space bar is a little small, and we have all had our issues with auto-correct. There are two good options on iOS that have been available on Android for years.\nSwype ($1 on the App Store) is a clever keyboard technology in which you drag your finger across the keyboard and it recognizes patterns and makes words. Some people find it faster than typing, and it has many devotees.\nSwiftKey (free) is another strong option. It quickly learns from your typing habits for better predictive typing. (It also lets you swipe to type, like Swype.)\nSwiftKey includes themes for changing the look of the keyboard, although they are limited to black and white and, at least when I tried it, a pretty tacky holiday theme.\nReplacing the keyboard is a commitment, and I found Swype a little unstable. Most people will prefer the new multitude of apps that add colors and other personal touches to the built-in keyboard. Apps like Color Keyboard Themes and Custom Keyboard for iOS 8, both free, add colors, typefaces, styles and even sound effects.\nTAKE BETTER PHOTOSThe Camera app in iOS 8, whether you have a new iPhone 6 or not, adds some simple and some advanced features. For example, you can now control the light exposure before you take a photo. With the camera open, tap the screen to focus and a small sun icon will appear next to the focus box. Drag it up or down to let more or less light into the picture.\nIOS 8 also adds the ability to create time-lapse videos, which is an amusing extra. Open the camera and swipe all the way to the right until you get to time-lapse. Click the Record button and hold the phone steady as long as you want the video to last.\nNote that you will want to hold the phonereallysteady. One pro tip is to set the phone somewhere stable and plug in your Apple earbuds. You can use the volume button on the headphones (or on the side of the phone) to start the video, and then you won\u2019t shake it when you tap Record.\nThere is also a self-timer built into the camera app. A small timer icon appears at the top of the screen when the camera is open. Tap it and you can set the countdown to three or 10 seconds, and get your group shots or selfies just right.\nObviously, iOS 8.1 is a powerful operating system with a lot of useful features built in. Finding how to make the most of them, though, isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 and can take a little poking around."

If there is such a thing, how can I protect my Mac from infection?\nA.Windows-based PCs are the main targets of the malicious software that loops infected computers into a remote-controlled network called abotnet, but Macs are not immune. Last fall, theiWorm botnet snared more than 18,500 Macsand allowed hackers to remotely download files, relay Internet traffic and perform other tasks.\nApplebuiltseveral security featuresinto recent versions of OS X, including amalware-detection toolthat checks a list of known malicious software and warns you about it; the company quicklyupdatedthe list last fall when iWorm was discovered. Apple also issuesregular security updatesfor OS X, so be sure your Mac has the latest updates installed. If you do not have updates set to install automatically, you can manually check and install them as explained atsupport.apple.com/en-us/HT201541.\nIntego, one of the companies that offers antivirus software for Mac OS X, posted anextensive analysis of the iWorm Botneton its security blog. All the company\u2019s posts on the topic (including how to check for infection) can be found by searching for \u201ciWorm\u201d atwww.intego.com/mac-security-blog. Intego, though, is just one ofseveral Mac antivirus companies,and iWorm was just one of the Mac-based botnets.\nViruses and malware aimed at OS X are becoming more common as Macs continue to gain popularity. If you are worried about safety beyond what OS X provides, you can find several third-party security programs in the Mac App Store (under the Mac\u2019s Apple menu) or online from major antivirus companies.\nErasing\nA Memory Card\nQ.I have successfully downloaded photos from my camera to my computer but cannot find a command to delete them from the memory card. How do I remove the pictures?\nA.When you import the photos to the computer, the program that copies the images may offer to erase them from the camera\u2019s memory card for you once they are safely on your hard drive; you may also see a \u201cDelete after import\u201d box to check. (Image CaptureoriPhotoon the Mac, or theAutoPlay boxthat pops on in most versions of Windows can all do this.) Choosing this option removes the photos from the camera\u2019s memory card, but make sure everything copied over first.\nThe memory card is basically a storage device like a USB drive. After you import the pictures to a folder or program, you can also delete them from the card by dragging the files to the trash, as you would with a USB drive.\nYour camera\u2019s manual should have instructions for deleting photos one at a time or all at once. Most cameras also have a menu command toformat the memory card, which, in addition to erasing everything on the card, freshly creates the card\u2019s file system and helps its overall performance.\nTIP OF THE WEEKGetting directions from your current location to a specific address with the Google Maps mobile app can help you get around in an unfamiliar area. Nevertheless, if you are unsure about which way to go first, you can have the app point you in the right direction.\nOnce you have entered your destination\u2019s address (or marked it with a pin on the map) and tapped the button for directions, tap the compass icon on the right side of the screen. The map then orients itself on the screen so you see it from your current point of view and you can start off going the correct direction.J.D. BIERSDORFER"

What are all the characters that aren\u2019t allowed on OneDrive?\nA.Microsoft\u2019sOneDrive and Windows systems have certain restricted charactersthat cannot be used in file and folder names because those characters are reserved for system commands and functions. OneDrive is not the only site that can have syncing problems with certain file names;Dropboxand others are not immune, either.\nAlong with the question mark (?), these forbidden characters include the forward slash (/) and back slash (\\), the mathematical greater- and less-than signs (>, <), inch/straight quotation marks (\u2033), the colon (:), the asterisk (*) and the vertical bar or \u201cpipe\u201d character (|). Spaces at the beginning or end of a file name, names ending with periods or two periods at the beginning of a file name can causeproblems with syncing filesacross platforms.\nWindows-based computers have a few other rules about file and folder names. For example, you cannot name files AUX, PRN, NUL, CON, COM0, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT0, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8 or LPT9.\nMost operating systems have their own reserved characters, andsome have more than others, so it is best to stick with simple alphanumeric names \u2014 especially when working across computer platforms. Excessively long file and folder names can cause issues as well. Apple has aguide for file namesthat outlines the conventions."

        "title": "S.E.C. Has Yet to Set Rule on Tricky Ratio of C.E.O.\u2019s Pay to Workers\u2019",
        "fulltext": "\n\nLast week, we learned thatTimothy D. Cook,Apple\u2019s chief executive,was paid $9.2 millionfor 2014.Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chasemade $20 million. TheStarbuckschiefHoward Schultztook home $21.5 million.\n                                        AndViacomsaid that its chief, Philippe Dauman,received $44.3 million.\nFor any one of them, it\u2019s a lot of money.\nThose numbers are even more pronounced when set against the viral talking point of last week:Oxfam\u2019s study on inequality,\n                                        which said that those in the top 1 percent were set to control 50 percent of the world\u2019s wealth by next year. That statistic has become a rallying cry for the average worker. (There\u2019s a problem with\n                                        the math that Oxfam used, which we\u2019ll get to in a moment, but that doesn\u2019t negate the overall message about income disparity.)\nWhile many have contended that chief executives of successful companies deserve handsome pay packages, that assertion does leave hanging the question of how to value the contribution of the average worker in relative\n                                        terms.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons a provision was passed almost five years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act to try to quantify that. Public corporations were supposed to disclose the ratio between the\n                                        pay of their chief executives and the pay of their median workers.\nSeveral years later, it is still almost impossible to know that figure. A fierce debate over the disclosure requirement continues, delaying adoption ofthat section of the Dodd-Frank law.\nMary Jo White, the chairwoman of theSecurities and Exchange Commission,\n                                        said in November that she hoped the rule would be completed before the year ended. Now it is the new year, and the rule remains, well, nowhere to be found.\nOf course, corporate America has resisted the rule, calling it a politically motivated gimmick meant to pressure boards into cutting back on rich executive compensation packages.\nAnd, to some degree, that view isn\u2019t wrong. TheA.F.L.-C.I.O., which has supported the provision, is pretty upfront about its enthusiasm:\n                                        \u201cDisclosing this pay ratio will shame companies into lowering C.E.O. pay.\u201d\nWhatever side you take on the disclosure of the ratio \u2014 and it evokes passionate feelings on both sides of the argument \u2014 it is head-scratching that it has taken so long to put in place what seems like\n                                        a pretty simple rule.\nHow hard can it really be for companies to calculate the ratio?\nIn truth, it\u2019s harder than you might imagine. The S.E.C. estimates companies will spend some $73 million annually to calculate their figures and comply with the law. TheU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the main business lobbying group in Washington, claims it will cost 10 times that, more than $700\n                                        million annually. TheCenter on Executive Compensation, a policy group and lobbying organization for business on pay issues, says the cost\n                                        will be $186 million.\nWhatever the true costs of the calculations, the challenge is that most multinational companies have various payroll systems around the world. Thus, it\u2019s not easy to just press a few buttons on a calculator to\n                                        figure out the median pay of a company\u2019s workers.\nAmong the variables: Do you count just employees working in the United States? Or should large multinationals calculate the figure based on their workers worldwide, including ones in less developed countries where pay\n                                        may look puny compared with American salaries, but qualify as solidly middle class in those nations?\nThen there\u2019s the issue of whether contract workers should count. A company that outsources much of its work could show a very different ratio than a competitor in the same industry that mainly employs staff workers\n                                        in the United States.\nAs a result of all the resistance, and the S.E.C.\u2019s own seeming apprehension about the rule, the agency so far has avoided ruling on how to put the requirement in place. In a hint of the agency\u2019s own misgivings\n                                        about the law, it said: \u201cThe lack of a specific market failure identified as motivating the enactment of this provision poses significant challenges in quantifying potential economic benefits, if any, from\n                                        the pay ratio disclosure.\u201d\nThus, it appears that when the law is ultimately put into effect, it will be watered down and made so complicated as to be worthless. (Which may be the point. Congress didn\u2019t set a deadline for this aspect of\n                                        the Dodd-Frank law to be enacted, which might also be a signal of its importance, or lack thereof.)\nThe prevailing wisdom among experts following the debate is that the S.E.C. is preparing the rule so that companies don\u2019t have to determine the exact pay median for their workers. Instead, to make it easier to\n                                        comply, the agency may allow companies to conduct a statistical sampling of the pay of its employees to divine the median.\nThat could leave companies a remarkable amount of room to play with the number. Chief executives also are unlikely to have to sign off on the ratio number, in the way they do with their companies\u2019 financial figures.\nWith all the wiggle room that is expected to be allowed, companies may devise ratio numbers that are largely irrelevant. Investors, who actually could benefit, even if only marginally, from knowing the ratio will probably\n                                        have an impossible time interpreting what the ratio shows.\nAny effort by investors to compare companies using the ratio may result in misleading conclusions, especially if there are not uniform standards. While the Dodd-Frank provision is intended only to show the ratio for\n                                        a particular company, you know that some people \u2014 and the media \u2014 will try to use the ratio to compare companies. They could also become part of activist campaigns against managements.\nHow the ratio is determined is important because context matters when it comes to compensation figures. At the beginning of this column, I mentioned Mr. Cook\u2019s compensation of $9.2 million; that looks low, for\n                                        example, relative to Mr. Dauman\u2019s $44.5 million. That\u2019s until I remind you that Mr. Cook was paid a one-time stock grant thatwas initially worth a staggering $376.2 millionin 2011 \u2014 stock that has risen just as Apple\u2019s market value has. (Don\u2019t pity Mr. Dauman, either. Over the years, he has made many millions,including $84.5 million in 2010).\nWhich brings us back to the Oxfam study. The numbers in the group\u2019s study about inequality were eye-opening. But a closer look at that ratio shows that the way it was calculated may lead to misperceptions.\nThe study didn\u2019t actually measure wealth; it measured net income. As Ezra Kleinwrote on the Vox website: \u201cA\n                                        farmer in China\u2019s rural Sichuan Province with no debt but also very little money is wealthier than an American who just graduated from medical school with substantial debt but also a hefty, six-figure income.\n                                        By any sensible standard, the medical student is richer, but because her student debt still outweighs her financial assets, the net worth measure counts her as poorer than the Chinese peasant.\u201d That\u2019s\n                                        the challenge that numbers and ratios present: They are in the eye of the beholder and can always be misinterpreted.\nThat\u2019s not to say the S.E.C. shouldn\u2019t force the disclosure of the ratio. It should, and soon. After all, it is a law and until and unless Congress decides to change the law, it should be enforced.\nThe big question will be in how it is used \u2014 or potentially misused \u2014 and how it may change corporate America.\nBy PATRICIA COHEN\nA report by the charity Oxfam offers a warning about deepening global inequality ahead of this week\u2019s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nBy STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act required companies to compare their chief executive pay with that of their employees, but carrying it out may cost millions.\nA version of this article appears in print on 01/27/2015, on pageB1of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Tricky Ratio of Chiefu2019s Pay to Workersu2019."
