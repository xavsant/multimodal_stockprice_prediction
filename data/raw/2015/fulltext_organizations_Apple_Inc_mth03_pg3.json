        "title": "Apple Watch Displays Your Digital World, at a Glance",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Apple unveiled its watch last fall, the company showed only demo models of the new device \u2014 polished prototypes of the hardware running nonworking loops of the software.\nOn Monday, the company gave a closer look at the Apple Watch, including the working software. The company also said the device would start at $350 and, depending on the band and finish you chose, go into the thousands of dollars. I spent two long sessions with the watch in Apple\u2019s demo room. Here are my first impressions.\nTHE HARDWAREIt\u2019s a perfectly nice-looking watch. In its higher-end configurations \u2014 for instance, the stainless steel middle tier, with the steel-mesh Milanese loop wristband, which starts at $650 \u2014 the Apple Watch comes close to being beautiful, and it is certainly one of the best-looking computers you can buy for your wrist.\nYet it\u2019s hard to forget that it is a computer for your wrist. Even in its top-end versions, it lacks the understated elegance of old-fashioned high-end analog watches. Apple is doing something unusual here: It is trying to create an electronic device that matches the timeless appeal of a piece of jewelry.\nI\u2019m not quite sure Apple pulled that off in this version. The electronic watch face is a bit chunky compared with the high-end band, so the overall impression is one of a mash-up between jewelry and gadgets. I\u2019m reminded of the first-generation iPad or iPhone: The Apple Watch may look a bit more stylish than any other techie watch you can buy, but I can\u2019t help but dream about the third- or fourth-generation version, when everything is likely to become smaller, thinner, tighter and more elegant.\nTHE INTERFACELast fall, Apple made a big show of the rotating crown on the side of the device, the company\u2019s take on what most of us call a watch dial. The company held up the crown as its next great interface, something on the order of the mouse, the iPod\u2019s clickwheel or the touch screen on the iPhone. I was surprised, therefore, to discover how small a role the crown plays in typical use of the watch.\nIt has two primary uses: When you press it, you get to the watch\u2019s main screen of apps \u2014 or, if you\u2019re already on that screen, the watch switches to displaying the clock. In other words, the crown works as a home button. It can also be used for scrolling and zooming. In the music app, for example, you turn it to scroll through artists; if you\u2019re in the photos app, you turn the crown to zoom from a set of tiny tiles of your photos to focus on a single one.\nBut you can also scroll using your finger on the screen, and in my brief time with the watch, I found that method much faster than the crown. Over all, I found myself touching and tapping much more than turning the dial. In addition to standard taps, the screen also has another tap mode called force touch, which works just as it sounds \u2014 press the screen harder. Force touch uncovers an extra level of settings in apps. For instance, force touch an email and you see options to delete, reply or mark it as unread.\nThe diminished use of the crown strikes me as a wise choice. It\u2019s not another thing you\u2019ve got to learn; for the most part, you control the watch just like your phone. It\u2019s less busy, and much more intuitive, than I\u2019d suspected it would be.\nTHE USESApple spent a long while going through most of the watch\u2019s major functions, including its use as a fitness tracker, texting app, email reader and payment device for locations that accept Apple Pay. I boiled down the list to this rule of thumb: Just about anything you can do with your phone, you can do with your watch, faster.\nTo me, this is the most interesting potential of the watch. Whether it\u2019s calling an Uber car, checking into your hotel or answering a text, the watch will allow you to interact with the digital world at a glance, in a less outwardly antisocial way than you now do with your phone.\nBut because the watch needs the phone for connectivity, it\u2019s hardly liberating you from that device. It\u2019s just giving you less of a reason to look at it. Should you really spend hundreds of dollars, let alone thousands, on a gadget to free you from the inconvenience of accessing your $650 smartphone? That remains the deepest unanswered question about the Apple Watch. For now, at least."

        "title": "Troubleshooting Android in Safe Mode",
        "fulltext": "Q.My Android phone just started freezing and crashing a few days ago. What would cause it to do so?\nA.Certain third-party apps could make the phone act erratically, and some people have complained that recent Android updates have caused problems. As with a desktop computer, you can restart the phone inSafe Mode. When in Android\u2019s Safe Mode, only the basic original software and apps are used and any other apps you have downloaded from Google Play or elsewhere stay on the sidelines. If the phone\u2019s performance instantly improves, a third-party app is likely the culprit.\nTo restart the phone in Safe Mode, press and hold the power button down until you see the Power Off box appear on screen. Next, press and hold your finger on the Power Off box. When you see a \u201cReboot to safe mode\u201d option, tap the O.K. button. The phone should start up in Safe Mode.\nTry out the phone for an hour or two to test its stability. If the handset shows a noticeable improvement, a third-party app is the probable cause. (You can leave Safe Mode by restarting the phone again.)\nIf you have your suspicions about any new apps you have recently downloaded, delete them one by one to see if the phone\u2019s behavior improves. You can alwaysdownload and reinstallan app again if you see no difference in the phone\u2019s performance.Mobile malwareandadware apps posing as gameshave been issues with Android at times, so be careful what you download to your phone. A number of Android antivirus apps are also available, but read the reviews from trusted sources first if you are considering a security app.\nIf the phone is still freezing and crashing, a deeper level of investigation is necessary. Google hasa page of troubleshooting tipsthat may help point you in the right direction. You may also want to checkGoogle\u2019s Android Help pageand user forums on sites dedicated to Android to see if issues for your version of the system have been reported.\nSilencing a Ringing iPad\nQ.Every time I get a call on my iPhone at home, my iPad also rings. Does the iPad also ring when I\u2019m out of the house? I looked in the Cellular Settings on the Phone, but can\u2019t figure out how to turn it off.\nA.As part of last year\u2019s updates to its iOS and OS X software, Apple introduced a new feature calledContinuitythat links a user\u2019s iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Mac to share services and information. With the phone-call function of Continuity enabled, the calls you get on your phone also ring on your computer, iPad or iPod Touch \u2014 as long as you are signed into the FaceTime voice and video chat program through the same iCloud account on each device. You can also answer or make calls on the other devices through FaceTime.\nIf your iPhone is not on the same Wi-Fi network as your iPad when you get a call, however, the tablet should not ring. As part ofContinuity\u2019s system requirements, all devices must be on the same wireless network, and you also need to be running iOS 8, Mac OS X Yosemite and be using fairly recent Apple hardware.\nIf you do not want the iPad or any other device in the house making a racket when your phone rings at home, you can turn off this feature. The controls for doing so are not under the Cellular area of the Settings, however, but in the FaceTime preferences.\nOn the iPad, open the Settings icon from the home screen and tap FaceTime. On the FaceTime settings screen, turn off the button next to iPhone Cellular Calls. Mac users wishing to turn off the calls can do so by opening the FaceTime program on the computer, selecting Preferences under the FaceTime menu and turning off the checkbox next to iPhone Cellular Calls."
