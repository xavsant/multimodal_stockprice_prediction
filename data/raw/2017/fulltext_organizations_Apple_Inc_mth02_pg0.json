        "title": "How to Decide Which Headphones to Buy (Hint: Not Apple\u2019s AirPods)",
        "fulltext": "Shopping for consumer electronics can get overwhelming. The staff of The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, product review websites owned by The New York Times, do the hard work of narrowing down the options. We spoke with Lauren Dragan, theheadphone editor, about \u2014 what else? \u2014 headphones.\nThere are so many choices for earphones and earbuds. How do I decide what to buy?\nIt\u2019s tough! There really isn\u2019t any one headphone that works forallsituations, so sometimes the best option is having two less expensive headphones that are suited to your lifestyle and listening habits. If you know how you\u2019ll use them, you can better figure out what features will be important.\nWhat do you use?\nBecause of my job, I get to know the perfect headphone for every situation. I think I regularly rotate among seven pairs.\nI have aPlantronics Backbeat Fit for running\u2014 they\u2019re unsealed so I can hear traffic and my surroundings \u2014 anOppo PM-3 for longer listening sessions, anoise-canceling Bose QC25 for flying(and vacuuming), a Plantronics Voyager Focus UC headset for business calls, asweat-resistant JLab Epic 2 Bluetooth for the gym, my custom noise-isolating UE 11 for when I\u2019m trying to get work done at a coffee shop, and then I rotate in whatever I\u2019m currently long-term testing.\nI always spend a week using any potential top pick before we post a review so I can troubleshoot. I\u2019ve caught a few problems that way. And yes, I\u2019ve even done that with the kids\u2019 headphones. I have a surprisingly small hat size.\nWhy aren\u2019t the new Apple cordless earbuds on the list?\nAh, the AirPods. The current working term for those kinds of headphones is \u201ctrue wireless.\u201d Aside from not having a cord to tangle and being decent at taking phone calls, the AirPods didn\u2019t improve much over the corded EarPods. The sound quality is the same (which is to say, meh, with no bass). Plus the battery life is less than a full day at work, so you had better remember to charge them at lunch time. And this for $130 more than a replacement pair of EarPods? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re fully cooked yet.\nDo headphones and earbuds really have to cost so much?\nSome technology, like a Bluetooth antenna or an active noise-canceling circuit, is going to cost a manufacturer a certain amount for the components and licensing fees. A manufacturer can\u2019t get them into a product for any less. That sets a base manufacturing cost. So a good pair of in-ear sport Bluetooth headphones, a solid product that will last you a few years, costs about $99.\nAnything below that will likely suffer in some way. To some people, that\u2019s O.K. But you can\u2019t expect magic for $30. On the other end, when you\u2019re paying over $300, you are getting a combination of innovation, product quality and sound quality. But a lot of times, anything much above that, it\u2019s just plain old marketing and hype.\nAre you thinking of any particular headphones?\nIn the audio quality category, there\u2019s the planar magnetic Oppo, Audeze, Mr. Speakers, brands like that. They range from $400 and up. Bose has the best active-noise-canceling technology available, and it\u2019s because the company spent a ton of money on research and development. And of course, Beats has the market cornered on branding. They\u2019ve been making a lot of improvements to their sound quality. But the difference between them and others priced that high is that you\u2019re paying $150 to $200 for sound and adding on another $100 or so for the Beats label.\nWhat\u2019s your dream product?\nThere\u2019s the elusive unicorn: headphones that do everything well and work in any situation. That could be possible with what\u2019s available to purchase today, but nobody has made it just yet.\nBut I\u2019m also really fascinated with where companies like Bragi and Here One are going with \u201chearables.\u201d Those are devices that are computers worn in your ears \u2014 like what Google Glass was trying to do with vision, but in your ears instead."

        "fulltext": "Q. My phone\u2019s camera has taken blurry photos since I dropped it. Is there a way to repair the camera, or do I need to get a new phone?\nA.A smartphone\u2019s camera is just one of its many internal components, and it can probably bereplacedfor much less money and effort than it would take to buy and set up a new phone. It could cost perhaps $50 or $60, depending on the phone model and repair shop. (The phone\u2019s casing will be opened so the new camera unit can be installed. Before you have it serviced, back up everything to the cloud or your computer so your data is safe.)\nFirst, you may want to rule out any software or physical issues with the phone and its camera. Make sure that the lens is not dirty and that the latest app and system updates have been installed. Reset the camera app\u2019s settings if you have not already done so. Try another camera app to make sure the problem does not lie in the software, and test the camera in a variety of situations. The phone\u2019s manufacturer may even have suggestions for specific issues or be aware of defective hardware, like Apple\u2019siSight Camera Replacement Program for iPhone 6 Plus.\nIf you have concluded the camera is indeed damaged, seeking out a repair shop is the next step. A quick web search should turn up the smartphone repair shops in your area, along with mail-in service centers, but read the professional and customer reviews of any place under consideration. Retail chains likeBest Buy,StaplesandOffice Depotalso offer repair services, as doApple stores.\nRepair options can include sending the phone to a service depot for several days, or having a technician fix it on the spot. If you have an extended warranty like Apple\u2019sAppleCare, repairs may be free or less expensive than for out-of-warranty iPhones. The plan has a $99iPhone Express Replacement Servicebenefit for damaged devices.\nIf you do not want to part with your phone during the repair period \u2014 and do not mind prying open the device \u2014 you might be able to replace the broken camera yourself. TheiFixit repair-guide sitehas a number of free tutorials showinghow to install a new camerain several smartphone models, and it sells the tools and parts, too."

        "fulltext": "Q.I am a writer and ideas for stories come to me at the most inopportune times. I usually end up making voice memos on my iPhone, but in the end I really need to transcribe them to text. Is there an effective and efficient app to automatically transcribe voice recordings?\nA.Third-party apps and services thatconvert spoken words into text files on iOS devicesare plentiful in Apple\u2019s online store, but depending on when you need the transcribing to happen, you may not need to download anything extra. For example, theSiri assistant software built onto iOScan open theiPhone\u2019s Notes appand transcribe your words as you speak them.\nHold down the iPhone\u2019s Home button (or say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to wake up the software), say \u201cMake a new note,\u201d and then speak your thoughts \u2014reciting the punctuationlike \u201cperiod\u201d or \u201ccomma\u201d aloud. The resulting note can be emailed, copied, pasted or shared with a compatible text app.\nSiri may be the quickest way to dictate a quick set of thoughts without fumbling with other apps, but if you do not use the Siri assistant, you can turn on theDictation toolin the iPhone\u2019sSettings app. In Settings, go to General and then to keyboard to find the Dictation option buried at the bottom of the screen. When the setting is enabled, a small microphone appears on the keyboard of text-entering apps like Notes,Google Docs,Microsoft Word for iOS, or Apple\u2019s ownPagesword processor.\nFree or inexpensive apps like the $3Voice Assistant,Dragon Anywhere($15 a month) or the older (but free)Dragon Dictationalso convert speech to text. Keep in mind that with many dictation apps, a recording of your voice is uploaded to the company\u2019s servers for software-based transcription.\nConverting live speech is one thing, but if you have a collection of previously recorded memos you want to translate into text, look for an app or service that allows you to upload audio files for transcription. TheRev Voice Recorder,SpeakWriteandTranscribeMefor iOS and Android are among the free apps that can do this, but you need to pay for the transcription; fees typically range from about 79 cents to $1 per minute of audio.\nAndroid users have many of the same tools available for dictation and transcription. The\u201cO.K. Google\u201d commandis similar to Apple\u2019s Siri for dictating notes, theGoogle Voice Typing feature is available on Android phonesand third-party apps like the freeDragon Mobile Assistantapp can be found in the Google Play store."

        "fulltext": "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s coming up this week.\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nLawyers for Takata, the Japanese manufacturer whose rupture-prone airbags have been linked to 11 deaths and over 100 injuries in the United States, are set to appear before a federal judge in Detroit on Monday to enter a guilty plea to criminal charges in a Justice Department case.Takata agreedlast month to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud for its handling of the defect, to pay a $1 billion fine and to set up a victims\u2019 compensation fund. The Justice Department has also separatelycharged three Takata executivesthought to be at the center of Takata\u2019s efforts to manipulate airbag safety data. Theairbags can explodewhen triggered in a crash, sending metal fragments toward the driver or passengers.Hiroko Tabuchi\nTECHNOLOGY\nMore than 100,000 people are expected to gather Monday in Barcelona, Spain, for the weeklongMobile World Congress, which will bring together the worlds of telecommunications, the news media and technology. As these industries increasingly overlap, executives and national policy makers are battling for control over how people use their mobile devices to communicate and watch online content.Mark Scott\nECONOMY\nThe Commerce Department will release data on Monday morning for durable goods orders in January. Economists are looking to for an increase of 1.5 percent over all, after a slight declinein December. Core demand for durable goods, which excludes the volatile aircraft category, is thought to have risen by 0.5 percentage point. There have been signs of a pickup in business confidence lately, and a stronger-than-anticipated core reading would provide additional evidence of that trend.Nelson D. Schwartz\nPRIVATE EQUITY\nPrivate equity leaders from around the world will gather in Berlin this week to discuss investments and possibly some deals atSuperReturn International, an annual showcase for the industry. The speakers include Leon Black, the founding partner of Apollo Capital Management; William E. Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic; and David Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group.Chad Bray\nECONOMY\nOn Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its revised estimate of economic growth, or gross domestic product, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Economists expect the government to increase its estimate of growth in the period to 2.1 percent from aninitial 1.9 percent reading. Additional data suggests the economy had a bit more momentum at the end of the year, and many experts are looking for slightly faster expansion in 2017.Nelson D. Schwartz\nTECHNOLOGY\nApple will hold itsannual shareholders meetingon Tuesday at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Shareholders have little to complain about this year, since thestock is upmore than 40 percent in the past 12 months. Executive pay will be a big topic, with Apple seeking shareholders\u2019 blessing for its compensation plan and shareholders voting on a proposal that would require executives to hold on to 75 percent of their stock. Another proposal would make it easier for shareholders to band together to nominate two directors to the company\u2019s eight-member board. The company also faces shareholder votes on proposals to disclose more about its charitable contributions and diversify its board of directors and senior management. This could be the last meeting held at Apple\u2019s current headquarters, since the company will start moving intoApple Park, itsnew spaceship-style campus, in April.Vindu Goel\nECONOMY\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s top two officials willdeliver speechesabout the economy on Friday, offering two chances to judge the Fed\u2019s intentions ahead of its next policy-making meeting in March \u2014 but creating an unusual dilemma for Fed watchers. At 1 p.m. Eastern time, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, will address business executives in Chicago, while Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, will speak at a monetary policy conference in New York. The economy is off to a good start in 2017, and the Fed has so far maintained its prediction ofthree rate increases this year.Binyamin Appelbaum"

        "fulltext": "Warren Buffett\u2019s $1 trillion target for the iPhone maker Apple is in sight. Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway boss, has bought more stock in Apple \u2014 whose market capitalization at Friday\u2019s closing price was $717 billion \u2014 and reckons it may become the first company with a 13-digit valuation. Breakingviews first suggested that back in 2011. Growth has slowed, but the company still looks undervalued.\nThe tech giant, led by Timothy D. Cook, now trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for its financial year to September 2017. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index trades at about 19 times projected earnings for the same period. Moreover, Apple has nearly $250 billion of cash and equivalents, such a huge pot that most of it is invested in long-term securities \u2014 a category excluded from standard cash and net debt calculations.\nThe quantum and treatment are so unusual that it is worth valuing Apple and its hoard of ready money separately. Put the company\u2019s underlying business on the same price-to-earnings multiple as the S.&P. and it is worth around $850 billion. Add back cash, net of the company\u2019s almost $90 billion of debt, and the company\u2019s potential market cap tops $1 trillion.\nInvestors worry that the global smartphone market is saturated. Analysts think Apple\u2019s revenue will increase at a fairly modest 6 percent this financial year. However, as Mr. Buffett noted on CNBC on Monday, the company\u2019s products are \u201csticky,\u201d meaning most customers stay with the brand when they replace their phones. Services like apps, online data storage, payments and music are steadily growing. Heavy investment in developing new products may yet produce another Apple hit, too.\nThere is also the concern that Apple will make big, overpriced acquisitions. Yet there is no evidence for this. Mr. Cook is stingy \u2014 the company\u2019s largest acquisition in 40 years was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014. It pays out roughly that amount every quarter in dividends, and on average about three times as much in buybacks.\nPerhaps investors simply can\u2019t get their heads around such a big number. If so, that could also be an issue for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company Aramco, which is working toward floating an offering with a possible valuation of $2 trillion. It wouldn\u2019t take much of a shift in investors\u2019 attitude to get Apple to the $1 trillion mark first."

In the months leading to his death, he left me a series of voice messages on my iPhone, describing his health, his wishes, etc. I would like to archive these recordings somewhere other than on my phone. Is there a way to transfer voice messages to the computer?\nA.If your iPhone is running at least iOS 9 and you have theVisual Voicemailfeature enabled, youcan save, store or share those voice mail recordings with a couple of screen taps. Just open the phone app, select the Voicemail tab and choose a message you would like to preserve. When the message file opens to show the playback controls and additional caller information, tap the Share icon at the top-right side of the screen.\nThe Sharing screen shows all the apps and places you can put a copy of thevoice mail message. For example, you can attach it to an email or text message, save it to a Note file, make a Voice Memo from the recording or store it on any connected file-storage services you use \u2014 like iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox.\nIf you have a compatible Mac, you can also wirelessly beam the file from phone to computer with Apple\u2019sAirDropfeature. When you save the file to your computer, you can play the recording back in iTunes, Windows Media Player or another audio program that supports .m4a (Advanced Audio Coding, or A.A.C.) files.\nFor phones not running iOS 9 or later, there areother waysto copy thevoice mail messagesto a computer. You could connect the phone to the computer with a 3.5-millimeterauxiliary audio cableand use the freeAudacitysound-editing software to make recordings of the messages. You can also use programs likeiExploreroriMazingor services likeEverlasting Voice. Your wireless carrier may have other solutions."

        "title": "Wearable Fitness Devices Don\u2019t Seem to Make You Fitter",
        "fulltext": "I once received a lot of blowback for an Upshot article in which I showed (with evidence) thatexercise is not the key to weight loss. Diet is. Many, many readers cannot wrap their head around the notion that adding physical activity, and therefore burning more calories, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into results on the scale.\nWell, here we go again because some of those folks also believe that fitness devices \u2014Fitbit,Vivosmart,Apple Watch\u2014 must be helpful in losing weight. Unfortunately, evidence doesn\u2019t support this belief either.\nFor some time, people have been trying to prove devices like these succeed in promoting weight loss. In 2011, a studycompared four groupsgetting a mixture of behavioral weight loss programs and use of an armband that measured activity and energy expenditure. All the intervention groups lost weight, but those with behavioral programs and technology lost the most. The sample size of each group (fewer than 50) and the large dropout rate of the study should temper enthusiasm, though. The sample was also mostly female, and more than three-quarters of them had college degrees, so the results may not be entirely generalizable.\nIn 2015, another study,the PACE-Lift trial, was also inconclusive. Researchers randomly assigned 250 people ages 60 to 75 to one of two groups. The first group received four physical activity consultations from primary care nurses over three months; a pedometer; and a physical activity diary. The other received \u201cusual care.\u201d All patients were given accelerometers to measure their activity, although only the control group saw the results. One year later, those in the pedometer group were taking an average of about 600 more steps per day, and had about 40 more minutes of activity a week.\nBut it\u2019s hard in a trial like this to know how much of that was because of the pedometer and the feedback, and how much was because of the nurse visits and coaching.\nWhat was needed was a large, well-designed study that truly teased out the contribution of wearable tech to weight loss programs. Last year, the results of such a study,the IDEA trial,were published.\nThe trial took place at the University of Pittsburgh between 2010 and 2012, and it involved more than 470 adults between the ages of 18 and 35. All of them were put on a low-calorie diet, had group counseling sessions and were advised to increase their physical activity. Six months into the intervention, all were given telephone counseling sessions, text-message prompts and study materials online.\nAt that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months.\nAt the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7.7 pounds.\nIt\u2019s hard for many to accept, so I\u2019m going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didn\u2019t.\nYou may rightfully point out that the primary reason to wear the devices isn\u2019t to lose weight \u2014 it\u2019s to be more active. But even in this respect, it didn\u2019t work nearly as well as we might hope. In the IDEA trial, those who employed the technology were no more physically active than those who didn\u2019t. They also weren\u2019t more fit.\nMany new technologies, and dietary supplements and new diets, are sold to the public with little actual research behind them. Wearable technology to encourage fitness is no different. Somehow, in the past few years, it has become collectively understood that we need to take 10,000 steps a day. But there\u2019s no magic behind that number. There\u2019s no reason to believe that hitting this arbitrary goal is somehow life-changing.\nExercise is worthwhile for its own sake. Of course, many people can enjoy using wearable tech without tying it to weight loss goals. I have owned a Fitbit, aNike FuelBandand an Apple Watch. I still wear the watch because I like many of its features. When I first bought it, I liked how it tracked my daily 30 minutes of physical activity and reminded me to stand up every so often.\nBut I realized over time that I didn\u2019t really need it. After some months, getting 30 minutes of activity a day (the recommended amount) became part of my routine. I learned to be more mobile and less sedentary. I didn\u2019t need the precision or the reminders anymore.\nIt\u2019s possible that the devices helped me make physical activity part of my regular routine. It\u2019s possible that they provided a benefit. But my experience is just an anecdote, and there\u2019s no counterfactual to help figure out whether I\u2019d have become more active without the devices. For that, we\u2019d need a trial. The ones that exist (like the IDEA trial) argue that the devices don\u2019t make people exercise more.\nThey don\u2019t seem to hurt, though. Other than costing money, there\u2019s no harm in seeing if it might improve your activity over time. But if your goal is weight loss, then you might think twice about using such a device. The evidence suggests that you may do better without one."

The company\u2019s profits actually fell slightly, to $17.9 billion, but mostly because it spent money to buy back shares.\nAlso, Apple\u2019s once-sleepy services business in things like app sales and music is growing fast, up to $7.2 billion for the quarter. And the company is up to $246 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nMuch of that is in foreign accounts.

Would you recommend that I wait until I see which way Apple is going to jump, or does someone else make a tablet similar to the Mini?\nA.TheiPad Mini, Apple\u2019s smaller version of its iPad tablet, wasfirst released in late 2012, but the model has not been updated since 2015 whenthe iPad Mini 4arrived. Apple stopped including the first-generation Mini in iOS software updates after iOS 9.3.5. The apps are probably crashing because they are running on obsolete hardware and an outdated version of the operating system, which is currently at version 10.2.1.\nApple is notoriously private about its future products before they are officially announced, which gives Apple-focused blogs and publicationsplenty to speculate about. While Apple hasnot yet announced a public media eventto introduce new hardware, itdid announce new iPad hardware in March 2016, sosome industry observersare hoping for a repeat performance next month. Keep in mind that any Apple media event is pure conjecture until the company makes its own statement.\nWhenever Apple does get around to holding an event, it could announce an iPad Mini 5, ignore the model and keep the iPad Mini 4 in place, or discontinue the Mini line altogether. While the first two possibilities give you a chance to buy the latest model directly from Apple, if the company drops the Mini from its iPad lineup, you will probably still be able to buy one for a short time from third-party resellers likeAmazonorBest Buy\u2014 until they deplete their inventories.\nApple\u2019s standard policygives you 14 days to return an item after you purchase it from the company; other retailers may offer similar terms and may include a restocking fee. If the fear of losing out makes you nervous, you can wait until Apple announces a product unveiling, buy the current iPad Mini right before the announcement \u2014 and return the older version if a new one does appear.\nIf the iPad Mini\u2019s 7.9-inch screen size is your favorite thing about the device, you can still find smaller tablets running different operating systems (usually Android), but you will have to buy new apps to run on the device.The Wirecutterproduct recommendation site (owned by The New York Times) hastested a selection of Android-based tabletsin various screen sizes."
