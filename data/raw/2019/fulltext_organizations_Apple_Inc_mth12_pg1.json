        "title": "The Week in Tech: How Is Antitrust Enforcement Changing?",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHello, my name is Steve Lohr. I cover technology and economics for The New York Times, and I\u2019m this week\u2019s tour guide through recent tech news.\nOne of the big stories of the year has beenthe Big Tech companies becoming targetsof major antitrust investigations by the nation\u2019s federal enforcement agencies, Congress and states. The concern is not only the companies\u2019 market power but also how they handle personal data, spread disinformation and amplify partisan divisions.\nTo someone who has covered technology and antitrust for The Times for more than two decades, this period seems different than anything I\u2019ve seen before. To me, it raises a question: Are we entering a new, progressive era in antitrust?\nThe answer to that question matters a lot. The official scrutiny of the big tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple \u2014 is just getting underway. Whether it results in meaningful curbs on the companies will depend in good part on the persistence of the investigators.\nInvestigations have a way of finding things. And the institutional commitment to antitrust, or lack of it, will be shaped by economics, ideas, politics and public opinion.\nThere are intriguing parallels with the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century:growing gaps in wealth,concentration of marketsand a perceived threat to democracy.\nThen, the technology engine was the industrial revolution. Today, it is the digital revolution. Then, the targets of enforcement were the industrial trusts, led by Standard Oil. Today, it is the digital behemoths. Then, the policy response was new antitrust laws \u2014 the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914 \u2014 and aggressive enforcement. Today, the policy response remains to be seen.\nWhile reporting recent stories and a few interviews last week, I\u2019ve been struck by two things: the very different climate now compared with the one surrounding the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, and the extent of the bipartisan support for pursuing the big tech companies.\nTheMicrosoft investigationand trial, which I covered, was fairly narrowly focused. It was about market dominance and the software giant\u2019s tactics to stifle innovation.\nThe second half of the 1990s, when the Justice Department and a group of states investigated and then filed a major antitrust suit against Microsoft, were banner years economically. It was not only a period of strong overall growth but a time when productivity rose. For a few years, income gaps narrowed.\nMicrosoft was a purely economic case. \u201cBut now we\u2019re seeing an evolution in antitrust, to take in greater social and political concerns, as well as economics,\u201d saidMaurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law. \u201cAntitrust is starting to capture the public imagination in a way that Microsoft never did.\u201d\nCurrent antitrust thinking is expanding to take in matters like the control of data and privacy. Since the 1980s, a central focus of antitrust has been a dominant company\u2019s power to increase prices. But there is a lively debate now about so-called nonprice components of competition. A loss of privacy to a data-harvesting giant like Facebook or Google, for example, can becast as reducing the quality of the serviceand thus as a signal of monopoly power.\n\u201cNothing\u2019s free,\u201d Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said at the Times\u2019s DealBook conference last month. \u201cIf consumers think they\u2019re getting any service for free, they\u2019re being misled.\u201d\nData, Mr. Delrahim explained, is an asset for internet companies, and gathering and analyzing large amounts of personal data is not necessarily a problem. But digital data, he added, \u201ccan give you market power. And its abuse would be a violation of antitrust law.\u201d\nIn the last couple of weeks, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, who is the ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been a fixture on cable TV news as a hyperventilating, partisan opponent of impeachment. But in an interview last month foran article on a Judiciary subcommittee\u2019s antitrust investigationof the big tech companies, Mr. Collins was a voice of bipartisan reason.\nMr. Collins is less critical of the tech giants than the Democrat leading the inquiry, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. And he dismisses the calls to break up the companies from the Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\nBut Mr. Collins supports the House investigation. And he thinks that consumers should be given greater control over how the tech giants use their data and that the companies should be prevented from buying up nascent competitors. \u201cThose are genuine concerns of mine,\u201d he said.\nBarry Lynn, executive director of theOpen Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group, points tothe states\u2019 investigation of Google, joined by 50 attorneys general and led by Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican attorney general in Texas, as a sign of the changing times in antitrust.An investigation of Facebook, led by Letitia James, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, has nearly as many supporting states.\n\u201cThe environment is radically different than it was even a year or two ago,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a grass-roots rebellion against concentrated power.\u201d\nBut whether shifting sentiments will translate to a pendulum swing in antitrust, reminiscent of the progressive era of a century ago, is uncertain at best. Major enforcement actions would be challenged in court. For years, the courts have generally embraced the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard \u2014 typically, though not always, dependent on higher prices. The courts have also been guided by the assumption that markets are self-correcting.\n\u201cI think antitrust should move, but it will really take the alignment of a lot of stars to move this ship,\u201d saidAndrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University.\nVoices of the decade.From Edward Snowden to Mark Zuckerberg, from the Arab Spring to the end of Moore\u2019s Law, the people and events that made the decade in tech.\nHow are you being tracked on your cellphone?Aninvestigation by the Times\u2019s Opinion sectionhas remarkable tracking data, including phone users inside the Pentagon and the White House.\nRecycling reimagined.Wall Street Journal reporters go dumpster diving, and then resell the trash on Amazon\u2019s take-all-comers marketplace.

        "title": "The Catastrophist\u2019s 2019 Tech Gift Guide",
        "fulltext": "The optimistic view of the last 10 years of consumer technology is that hundreds of millions of people used unbelievable new devices and services to take part in explosive new economies and cultures.\nThe savvier take is to note that consumer tech \u2014 most of all the smartphone\u00a0\u2014 has been a force for change, but its benefits have not always been distributed in ways that are equitable, safe or desirable.\nOr maybe you are filled with dread by the devices you have allowed into your life over the last decade, all but paralyzed by the knowledge that the nightmare of surveillance, invasion and exploitation in which you live was the direct result of a few thoughtless choices you made in a Best Buy or clicking around on Amazon.\nYou\u2019re in a horror movie. Your phone is the guy who showed up in town claiming to be your brother. It\u2019s the third act. The soundtrack is all rumbling low sounds and screeching violins. You wouldn\u2019t wish this upon anyone.\nThis is the gift guide for you.\nOptimistically: Video doorbells used to be exclusively for the rich or highly security conscious. Now, starting at $100, or $17 a month, anyone can install one. Give grandpa a Ring home-security system, and in a few minutes he\u2019ll have an HD video feed from outside his door, with night vision, customizable motion alerts. He\u2019ll be able to let you into his house with his phone, even if he\u2019s not there!\nCritically: With any connected device, there are security concerns. While a Ring camera would let Grandpa see who is outside his door, press reports have suggested that Ringhas not taken sufficient care with user dataand that its devices are subject to security flaws.\nRing, which is now owned by Amazon, also makes connected alarms and surveillance cameras for inside and outside the home. Several breaches of those devices have been documented.One report, out of Mississippi, involved a man hacking into an 8-year-old girl\u2019s bedroom security camera and \u201crepeatedly calling her a racial slur and saying he was Santa Claus.\u201d\nWhat did Ring have to say about that? \u201cUnfortunately, when the same user name and password is reused on multiple services, it\u2019s possible for bad actors to gain access to many accounts.\u201d Does Grandpa change his passwords?\nCatastrophically: You\u2019ve already heard Grandpa complain about his neighbors, and you\u2019ve usually been able to change the subject. Not anymore. His phone buzzes multiple times a day with the message: \u201cMotion at Front Door.\u201d It\u2019s a delivery person. A raccoon.\nOr is it? There is suddenly a lot going on at all hours. A car on the street. Why is it sitting there? What kept the UPS guy lingering yesterday? Grandpa buys new locks \u2014 and a Ring security system too.\nGrandpa is extremely active on Ring Neighbors, the social network that the company calls \u201cthe New Neighborhood Watch,\u201d and which istearing at the already threadbare social fabric of his suburb. Ring has partnerships with more than 400 police departments; it has given users a choice to opt out. Grandpa absolutely has not opted out. Something is happening. Motion has been detected. Grandpa buys a gun.\nAlternatively: A framed pic of the two of you together?\nOptimistically: Your teenage nephew will really appreciate a pair of AirPods, which are probably the best wireless earbuds available. Pricey, generous andextremely back-ordered, AirPods are a functional status symbol. Your nephew spends all day on his phone anyway.\nCritically: AirPods are sort of extravagant, and there are lots of good wireless headphones available for better prices. And, AirPods areone of the more egregious examples of tech disposability: They are expensive and unrepairable. When their battery fails in a few years, they will end up in a landfill. Does your nephew even have an Apple device, anyway?\nCatastrophically: Your nephew doesnothave an Apple device. He and his friends all have Android phones. He\u2019s due for an upgrade on his plan, though, and your generosity \u2014\u00a0you gave him an Apple Watch last year! \u2014\u00a0has finally nudged him to Apple.\nThis is a bigger change than he thought it would be. He spends a week or two troubleshooting group texts with his pals, because for some reason they aren\u2019t all showing up for everyone. Maybe? It\u2019s hard to tell. Group texts with other classmates, classmates with iPhones, some of whom have AirPods and Apple Watches themselves, are seamless, fast and easy.\nYour nephew begins to recognize his privilege, but not in the good way. One of his old friends had been thinking of your nephew as something more, but his texts were green, and your nephew\u2019s were increasingly blue, and they lose touch after graduation. He was your nephew\u2019s soul mate. Your nephew dies alone.\nAlternatively: Socks?\nOptimistically: Last time you saw your aunt, she mentioned making a family tree. She\u2019s getting older. You are, too. Legacy and history and the future are on your mind, and it\u2019ll be something nice to talk about through the holidays. The genealogy sites do DNA tests now, too, so in addition to allowing your aunt to sift through millions of documents reconstructing your family\u2019s journey through time, and the world, she can better understand where her distant ancestors were from. It\u2019s a gift that may bloom into a hobby.\nCritically: Genealogy is a tricky subject \u2014\u00a0\u201clet\u2019s figure out the family tree!\u201d can bring the family together but is something that can become more emotionally complicated with age. Some genealogy sites, particularly those that do DNA testing, have come under scrutiny for how they handle extremely private information.\nYour aunt\u2019s genetic test may be exposed to subpoena by law enforcement, but you\u2019re pretty sure she hasn\u2019t killed anyone. Some firms, under the auspices of furthering medical research, share data with third parties, which is the sort of decision you may not want to make for someone.\nThen there\u2019s security. Who knows who will own these firms, and your aunt\u2019s data, in the future. MyHeritage, for example,disclosed in June 2018 that a hacker had obtained information from 92 million accounts.\nCatastrophically: Your aunt receives a curious DNA result that sheinterpretsto mean that the person she thought was her father was, in fact, not. The holidays are extraordinarily awkward. A second test, ordered after the first one, arrives a few weeks later. The first one suddenlyseems less clear. Your aunt spends two months in agony, and writes you a thank-you letter anyway.\nAlternatively: A nice sweater?\nOptimistically: Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal \u2014\u00a0for about $10 a month, you can buy your mother access not only to the music she always talks about, but also to more music than she, or anyone, could listen to in a lifetime. She can use it on her phone. She can use it on her smart speaker, which you bought for her three years ago. You\u2019ll set it up and everything!\nCritically: Signing someone up for a subscription, even if you prepay the first year, can seem presumptuous. You\u2019ve been on Spotify for years; it\u2019s where your music collection lives, and you take it for granted, which is another way of saying it represented a pretty big change to your life.\nThe streaming music economy has turned out better than it could have, but these services still represent yet another middleman between musicians and listeners. These companies apply further downward price pressure on music as the digital economy in which they are second-class citizens applies downward price pressure on them. Does Mom still use her smart speaker, anyway?\nCatastrophically: Your parents do not still use their smart speaker; your mother read some articles about it, and it got logged out of her accounts, and she didn\u2019t want to ask you how to log it back in. This will be the fifth time in so many years that their child has tried to upgrade their lives with some new piece of technology; they both wish you would notice that they haven\u2019t been using most of their gifts but make an effort to appear to be doing so when you\u2019re around.\nIt\u2019s a peculiar mixture of gratefulness and shame. They know you\u2019re not exactly flush right now, and appreciate the gesture. But each birthday, each holiday, is accompanied by an interminable seminar on how to use some new object, or to join some new network. It\u2019s coming from the right place, and yet it feels like the consultants have come to town to \u201cmodernize\u201d the increasingly incomprehensible electronic workplace that their life has become.\nThey can never tell you this. They hardly allow themselves to think it. The hole is too deep. Your parents love you too much to resent you. They forget about their gift until your mother gets an auto-renewal notice in her email just before holiday season 2020. Your mother thinks about calling you. Your father calls the Geek Squad.\nAlternatively: Gift certificate for a date night? (Printed.)"

        "title": "The Decade Tech Lost Its Way",
        "fulltext": "An oral history of the 2010s\nAn oral history of the 2010s\nAs told to The New York Times\nWhen the decade began, tech meant promise \u2014\u00a0cars that could drive themselves, social networks that could take down dictators. It connected us in ways we could barely imagine. But somewhere along the way, the flaws of technology became abundantly clear. What happened?\nThe people who brought us this decade explain:Mark Zuckerberg,Edward Snowden,Ellen Pao,Phil Schiller,Kevin Systrom,Brianna Wu,Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins,Mike Judge,Jonah Peretti,Diane von Furstenberg,Alex From Target\u2014 and many more. (People\u2019s titles in the interviews below, which have been edited for clarity, reflect the roles they had at the time.)\nAs told to The New York Times\n\nDesign and development by Antonio de Luca and Gray Beltran. Additional design and production by Alana Celii, Dave Horn, Sam Manchester and Anushka Patil.\nCredits: Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times; Andrew Kelly/Reuters; Photo by The Guardian via Getty Images; Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency; Jim Wilson/The New York Times; Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press; Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images; Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times\n\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\nA sophisticated Chinese cyberattack, aimed at stealing trade secrets and computer codes,prompts the search giant to withdraw from the country. Google\u2019s decision reshapes the global internet, with China developing its own closed-off version of the web.\nHeather Adkins, Google\u2019s director of security:We were not trained to think about spies. At first, we thought, \u201cThis is an employee gone rogue.\u201d But the speed was the first tip-off. Whoever this was, they were clearly practiced.\nEric Grosse, Google\u2019s director of information security engineering:Within 24 hours, this one little thread had turned into the fastest cyberattack we\u2019d ever seen. We set up a war room in a small conference room, but then we had to open a second, and a third. Sergey Brin, our co-founder, was coming around constantly.\nMs. Adkins:It was clear we weren\u2019t the only ones who were hit. We made hundreds of calls to warn the security teams at other companies.\nMr. Grosse:You could hear someone\u2019s face going white across the phone line.\nI always thought militaries were not allowed to hack civilians in peacetime. Or that they never would, because the backlash would be so severe. But it became the new international norm.\n(These interviews were conducted in 2016.)\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\n\n\nAs told toBrian X. Chen\nFollowing the iPhone\u2019s success,Steve Jobs introduces Apple\u2019s next mobile computing device:a touch-screen tablet.\nPhilip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing:It all stems back to Steve returning to Apple in 1997. Apple had a lot of stuff going on, and he refocused Apple on the Mac and tried to save Apple by doing great computers again.\nThe project started being about, \u201cO.K., what is a future computer device that can be under $500, that is something we\u2019d be proud of, that has Apple quality and an experience we\u2019d love?\u201d Very quickly, the team and Steve came to, \u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to get to a price point like that, we need to remove things aggressively.\u201d\nSo no more clamshell, no more separate keyboard.  Therefore you need to be able to type on the screen.\nAnd so the team started working on multitouch technology. During that process, a human interface designer, Bas Ording, showed us this demo where he pretended to scroll and the whole screen moved up and down with realistic physics. It was one of those \u201choly crap\u201d moments.\nIn parallel to all this, iPod had taken off.  We knew there was risk that one day a cellphone could play music, that you wouldn\u2019t carry two devices, you\u2019d carry one. We wanted to take care of that ourselves and solve that. So we decided we needed to do a phone, a phone that could also replace iPod.\n\nSomewhere around the time that we were doing the second-generation iPhone is when we said, \u201cO.K., now iPhone\u2019s up and running.\u201d\nWhen we got back to iPad, it was really easy to imagine what to take from iPhone and what needed to be different to create the product it would be. It really helped.\nWalt Mossberg, technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal:\nIt was just Steve and me in his living room. It was a large house, but it was not a mansion. You can imagine somebody with a lot less money owning that house.\nWe were sitting on the couch, and on the coffee table there was something covered in black cloth.\nAt some point he pulls the cloth off, and it\u2019s the iPad. He pulled it off the stand and he lovingly started to show it to me. And eventually I got to hold it and play with it.\nI try never to be positive or negative until I have actually tested something. But I was impressed. I was impressed with the thinness of it. In particular, he was careful to show me how it wasn\u2019t just a big iPhone.\nThen what really impressed me was the price.  He asked me to guess. I guessed $999.\nHe gave me this wicked smile, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be really amazed if that\u2019s what you think. It\u2019s way lower than that.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWell, how much?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t tell me.\nIt was $499. I\u2019m sure that it was also stunning to the competitors.\nAs told toBrian X. Chen\n\n\nAs told toNathaniel Popper\nThe Arab Spring is ahigh point in optimism about the organizing power of technology. A Facebook page, \u201cWe Are All Khaled Said,\u201d named for an Egyptian killed by the police, becomes an icon of the movement against the region\u2019s autocratic governments.\nWael Ghonim, a Google executive in Dubai:I was in my study, and I saw a photo of a corpse. I just started crying.\nI was the head of marketing for Google in the Middle East. I was thinking that the internet is a tool for empowering people. I thought, O.K., maybe create something that is as simple as \u201cWe\u2019re just one.\u201d Instead of \u201cWe\u2019re going to have revenge,\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cWe could be all in that same position.\u201d On the first three days, the \u201cWe Are All Khaled Said\u201d page had 100,000 likes.\nThe resignation of Tunisia\u2019s president is a turning point in the Arab Spring. Shortly afterward, Mr. Ghonim travels to Egypt to join the street protests.\nThe best moment I had was his apology video. Oh, my God, I kept playing that video. Because it was the first time I\u2019m seeing an Arab leader in fear of his own people.\nI had to go to Egypt \u2014 there was a call for a revolution. I cannot be sitting at home in Dubai. Hundreds of thousands of people showed up. I went to meet a fellow Googler who was visiting, but after, people \u2014 I don\u2019t know who \u2014 kidnapped me off the street. They took me out of my shirt, beat me up, covered my eyes and then I went blind. I was just thinking about my family and my daughter and my son.\nThe government closed Facebook for a couple of days. But they couldn\u2019t afford to keep it closed, because of business. When you turn off the internet right now, you\u2019re turning off the economy. There is no system that can survive anymore without the internet.\nHosni Mubarak \u2014 Egypt\u2019s former president \u2014 was forced to step down. It was not his choice. And I was like, \u201cOh, my God, Facebook is changing the Middle East.\u201d\nMr. Ghonim has since changed his mind about the utility of social networks.\nI always thought that the tool could be used for bad, because I\u2019m not that na\u00efve.\nThe system of Facebook is a mobocratic system \u2014 if there is a mob of people and they are all organized around liking content, the content will get massive distribution. The editor became dumb software that just optimizes for whatever sells ads.\nI\u2019m still using it. I have started inviting those people who hate me to Facebook Live, and just have lovely discussions with them.\nAs told toNathaniel Popper\n\n\nAs told toMike Isaac\nTwo Silicon Valley entrepreneurs start a photo-sharing app that quicklybecomes a sensation, spawning thousands of subcultures and Kardashian selfies.\nKevin Systrom, co-founder:I wanted to make a massive multiplayer game, where you would check in at a location around the city \u2014 at a cafe, a bar, a park, whatever. But as I started to show it to people, it was clear that they didn\u2019t actually want it to be a game. They just wanted to check in and share what they were doing.\nI stopped working on the game part, and it just became a check-in app. And that\u2019s where Mike and I first connected.\nMike Krieger, co-founder:I got super into it because it wasn\u2019t just \u201cOh, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d It was \u201cI\u2019m here, and here\u2019s a photo.\u201d And that sounds like a small detail, but actually it made the whole product way more interesting.\nMr. Systrom:Steve Anderson, the venture capitalist, said, \u201cHey, here\u2019s $50,000 \u2014 except the only way I\u2019m going to do this is if you find a technical co-founder.\u201d And Mike was like, \u201cCount me interested.\u201d\nMr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger begin to work on an app called Burbn.\nMr. Krieger:We had the fateful Blue Bottle meeting. We had a coffee catch-up with Ronny Conway, another venture capitalist, showing him what we\u2019d been working on. And it wasn\u2019t anything he said \u2014 I think it was this look on his face. You could tell he felt we didn\u2019t have a clear conviction on what we were building. We needed to make a major change.\nMr. Systrom:We sat down, and we were sulking. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s write out what people like most about the app.\u201d I think plans were one of the features, and check-ins and photos. Then we crossed off check-ins and plans.\nMr. Krieger:We had a one-week break because Kev had his first vacation in I don\u2019t know how many years.\nMr. Systrom:My wife and I went to Todos Santos, Mexico, which was  the cheapest Mexican vacation we could find that was  nice. We were walking on the beach, and I was asking her, \u201cHey, do you think you\u2019re going to use this app?\u201d\nAnd she said, \u201cWell, no, because all your friends take such good pictures.\u201d I said something like, \u201cThat\u2019s just because they filter their photos.\u201d She said, \u201cO.K., you should probably add filters, then.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d\nWe launched in October. That first day, we had 25,000 people sign up.\nMr. Krieger:And it just started to grow.\nMr. Systrom:I just remember Mike struggling to keep the servers up. I think we spent the next year convinced we were going to go under.\nMr. Krieger:It\u2019s not an experience that you ever would willingly sign up for, it was so intense. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. The learning pace was absolutely unmatched \u2014 every single week we were learning something new about running a company or product design or infrastructure or raising money.\nThe crazy times are all tempered eventually. Your brain probably reprograms it. You look back on it fondly \u2014 but it was nutty.\nAs told toMike Isaac\n\n\nAs told toJohn Markoff\nGoogle announces that it is testinga fleet of autonomous vehicles.\nSebastian Thrun, director of Google\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d division:The very first self-driving route was from Google to the Shoreline Amphitheater parking lot. We had begun self-driving in that parking lot, but we found that it was used by parents to give their teenagers driving lessons, and so we had to be careful to avoid them.\nWe hid from the authorities. In multiple instances, police actually pulled us over, and maybe we told them it was a self-driving car. They would stare and ask thousands of questions, but no one ever said, \u201cIs there any issue with safety or legality?\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t celebrate after the first drive \u2014 we were totally heads down. We had signed up to drive 1,000 reference miles. Those were designed by Google leadership to be really, really hard.\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders, spent many hours scoping out what looked like the most difficult places to drive on the planet. It was Highway 1 from San Francisco to Los Angeles; it was Lombard Street; it was Market Street; it was all the bay bridges; it was through Tiburon and around Lake Tahoe.\nThe very first course had probably every complication you could imagine. You are on a mountain road. You are driving very narrow lanes. You are driving in city traffic with stop signs and traffic lights and tunnels, and there\u2019s everything. And we cleared it in the middle of the night.\nAs told toJohn Markoff\n\n\nAs told toNatasha Singer\nGoogle agrees tosettle federal chargesthat it used deceptive practices in the rollout of a social network called Buzz. Later that year, Facebook agrees tosettle wider chargesthat it also deceived users.\nDavid C. Vladeck, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission:In 2010, in an effort to directly compete with Facebook, Google tried to roll out Buzz. They made some serious mistakes. Google users who had signed in were basically encouraged to go to Buzz, and if they went to Buzz, things like their contacts would be disclosed. So if you were a psychiatrist and had a bunch of patients on your contact list, that well may have been shared.\nGoogle did a good job deflecting it by being contrite. But there were a lot of people whose lives were seriously impacted.\nWhat Google did was really bad. But in some ways, what Facebook did was even worse.\nFacebook was all about sharing information and allowing third-party apps to have access to its site, to make it more interesting and promote growth. And they were very successful. The problem was the user was told that the app would only be harvesting data needed for the functionality of the app. But the apps would be taking lots of personal information.\nFacebook was acutely aware of what was going on. There were records.\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, came in and tried to basically say: \u201cWe care about privacy. We think we\u2019re protecting privacy. We think we\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d That may well have been Facebook\u2019s perception. It was just completely at odds with what we thought.\nThe consent decree was constructed to send a signal to Facebook that it really had to clamp down. Obviously, the company didn\u2019t take that very seriously.\nI regret not having done things differently. We struggled with the reporting provisions of both consent decrees. This may have been a failure of our imagination. The idea of privacy audits was floating around, but there were no templates. There was no model to use.\nWe did what we could, with biannual privacy assessments. But they turned out to be wholly insufficient. And in hindsight, that to me is the Achilles\u2019 heel.\nAs told toNatasha Singer\n\n\nAs told toJohn Markoff\nApple introducesanew way tocontrol iPhones with speech.\nAdam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri, a start-up acquired by Apple:When it came out, I went with a group of Siri employees to an Apple store to see what the vibe was. They had set up this plasma display on the front wall, just to the right of the door, showing Siri. I got these chills down my spine.\nUsage started going viral \u2014 I think it was two orders of magnitude more than marketing had predicted. I mean, every late-night TV host was having a segment about Siri.\nThe usage spikes were overwhelming because speech recognition is a challenge. You know, there\u2019s only so much you can do when you get a million simultaneous requests. We were literally sleeping on army cots in the hallways of Apple trying to keep everything stable and scaled.\nUltimately, I think we showed the world two things that they didn\u2019t know before: One is that it was possible. The challenge of being able to understand speech \u2014 I don\u2019t think most companies at the time, Google and others, thought you could really do it at that scale. It\u2019s like a diver in the Olympics who does the first quadruple flip. The second thing we showed was that users would like it, that this was an appealing interface concept.\nMany times Steve Jobs is attributed with having reinvigorated or reinvented fields, like Pixar with movies and computing itself with the graphical interface. Well, you can also say that Steve Jobs reinvigorated the field of artificial intelligence. Steve was the first to go out and put A.I. back in the marketplace.\nAs told toJohn Markoff\n\n\nAs told toJohn Markoff\nSteve Jobs, the company\u2019s visionary co-founder,dies at age 56of complications from pancreatic cancer. HislongtimeNo. 2 becomes the public face of the company.\nRegis McKenna, who was involved in Apple\u2019s creation in 1976:Steve\u2019s death was the moment the Tim Cook era began. It was a really rough beginning, because Tim had no credibility in the community or the public. There was a lot of noise out there that Tim wasn\u2019t a product guy \u2014 he was a process guy \u2014 and that he just didn\u2019t have the creativity that Steve had.\nTim\u2019s response was, \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Jobs. I\u2019m not going to try to be Steve Jobs. I\u2019m going to be me.\u201d\nWhen you sat in a meeting with Steve, he dominated, and he would tell you to shut up and let someone he wanted to hear from talk. Tim was completely the opposite. He listened to everybody no matter what you had to say, and he would come back to challenge them on things. There was a lot more openness and freedom to bring new ideas to the surface.\nAs told toJohn Markoff\n\n\nAs told toKate Conger\nDrivers for the ride-hailing start-up place pink, furry facial hair on their cars. In cities across the country, they become a conspicuous symbol ofthe arrival of the gig economy.\nJohn Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft:People are normalized to get into a car that is yellow or black because that\u2019s been known to have some sort of regulation behind it. So we needed to create a Lyft. And that was the mustache.\nI just thought it was funny. There were a lot of logistics in the early days \u2014 getting enough mustaches. We would drop-ship them to other cities.\nIt was meant to be a few weeks of a launch tactic. And it lasted probably a little over three years. The thing that has remained is the color. The logo was originally green, so when the mustache was retired, the color pink lived on \u2014 and it does today.\nThe original tagline for Lyft was \u201cYour friend with a car.\u201d Now, here we are billions of rides later. You know, 10 years ago, no one believed this was going to happen.\nAs told toKate Conger\n\n\nAs told toErin Griffith\nEight years after its birth in a Harvard University dormitory, the social network raises $16 billion in aninitial public offering.\nPaul Madera of Meritech Capital, anearly Facebook investor:Mark Zuckerberg did want to wait to go public. Facebook didn\u2019t really need the notoriety and the validation that going public adds. It was already a household name. Users certainly knew it. There wasn\u2019t going to be a coming-out party in the way that other companies get when they go public.\nBut there was still tremendous na\u00efvet\u00e9 on the part of the company. Part of that was fueled by adulation in the press and adulation from users and the expectation that Facebook could do everything right.\nA few days before the I.P.O., this concern over the move to mobile had come out. It was not clear that Facebook had yet figured out the optimal product to offer on mobile.\nOn the eve of the offering, Facebook employees hold a hackathon at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The next morning, Mr. Zuckerberg rings Nasdaq\u2019s opening bell from the Facebook campus.\nThe sun had just come up. Thousands of Facebook employees gathered around the senior team, along with the head of the Nasdaq. This big Nasdaq button was right on the stage. There was tremendous excitement.\nI remember walking through, shaking hands, lots of congratulations around the campus and then leaving to come back to the office and sitting down \u2014\u00a0and recognizing that the stock still had not started trading. As the day went on and it took longer, I\u2019m starting to wonder what had happened.\nNasdaq had a trading glitch. That caused the panic. And that generated more fear. We priced it at $38, and it immediately dived. The banking team misread the demand.\nAs told toErin Griffith\n\n\nAs told toVanessa Friedman\nThe designer Diane von Furstenberg\u2019s spring-summer fashion show features models in a special accessory:futuristic spectaclesthat can record video and display data. The devices are a pet project of the Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\nMs. von Furstenberg:In July 2012, I was at Sun Valley at the Herb Allen conference and I saw Sergey, and he was wearing these funny glasses.\nAt some point in the conference, Sergey called me behind a screen and showed me these glasses and explained that they were like a little video camera. And I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s really wonderful.\u201d And he said, \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\nThen I invited him and Anne Wojcicki, who was his wife then, to come to my fashion show, because they had never been to a fashion week. The next month I got a call, and it was Sergey, and he said, \u201cHow about if we show Google Glass for the first time on the runway?\u201d\nI thought that was a really cool idea. Then I had to sell it to my team, who weren\u2019t convinced. They said, \u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t like it. I wouldn\u2019t wear those.\u201d But I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? This is technology. You can\u2019t look at them as glasses.\u201d\nWe ended up putting them on a few of the models, on a makeup artist, on a few people backstage, and I wore them, and my head designer wore them.\nTo tell the truth, I was a little concerned about having the battery pack on my temple because it was very close to the brain, but I was also super excited. It was a big deal for me: I was doing a collaboration with Sergey Brin.\nWhen we came out to take the bow, Sergey was in the front row, so I just pulled him up to join us, and we walked the show together.\nAs told toVanessa Friedman\n\n\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\nThe Guardian newspaper begins to publish articles revealing secret government surveillance programs, based on classified documents stolen from the National Security Agency. The source,Edward J. Snowden, is a former government contractor.\nMr.Snowden:I discovered that during my time in government, the abuse of secrecy privileges was corrupting the incentives that were meant to ensure fair play by those who wielded the most power in society.\nIn the absence of public scrutiny, because no one knew what was going on, institutions \u2014 both governmental and corporate \u2014 realized that even the gravest forms of misconduct had few consequences.\nI ended up being one of the few people who really saw how everything fit together into a larger machine. And ultimately I found myself directing the use of that machine. I sat at a terminal, from which I had practically unlimited access to every man, woman and child on earth. Among these people were 323 million of my fellow American citizens.\nI had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution as a condition of my employment with the government. So I felt obligated to do what I could to reveal it. But because the problem was broader than one single particular surveillance program, this meant that I\u2019d also have to be blowing the whistle on the larger system of secrecy.\nMy hope wasn\u2019t to change the government, or industry, or anything else, but to help the public to understand what was going on. It was about democracy. It was about how the public lost their seat at the table of government because they were not permitted to know.\n\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\n\n\nAs told toNellie Bowles\nFrustrated with big tech companies\u2019 domination of San Francisco\u2019s economy and culture, activistsobstruct the charter busesthat shuttle workers from the city to Silicon Valley.\nLeslie Dreyer,organizer:Rents kept going up. People kept getting evicted. It was really every party you would go to \u2014\u00a0at every event, people would be talking about folks they know losing their housing. And the most visible thing on the streets was the Google bus, which was using all of our public bus stops.\nWe set up a fake city agency, the San Francisco Displacement and Neighborhood Impact Agency, sort of mocking what the city should be doing \u2014 suggesting that the buses should follow the law and that the city should ticket them every time they stopped in a bus zone.\nIt\u2019s a tactic that worked. It was open for anyone to do. These tech campuses \u2014 most of them are an hour, an hour and a half away, so the buses were the one thing in our city that we have access to that we can physically take action and block. That\u2019s why it worked so well.\nAs told toNellie Bowles\n\n\nAs told toKaren Weise\nThe founder and chief executive of Amazon,buys the newspaperfor $250 million \u2014\u00a0giving one of the country\u2019s richest people a powerful perch at the top of traditional media.\nErik Wemple, Post media critic:My family had a cottage on a lake in the southern Adirondacks. I got an email saying there\u2019s an important company announcement. So I get on this call, and there\u2019s Don Graham, the owner, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve sold The Washington Post to Jeff Bezos.\u201d And all I remember is, \u201cWhaaaaah\u201d \u2014 this huge gasp in the room.\nThere was this space we had our town hall meetings in, and it had this carpet and was kind of dingy. It was like a sensory deprivation chamber. There were no windows. It was the perfect place for a gasp to take over. It was as if this entire work force had been punched in the gut. It was unthinkable that Don Graham would ever sell The Washington Post, period. On some level, I was like, Yes, this makes sense. This is an owner\u2019s act of love.\nBezos buying The Post is a public service.The history of media is filled with billionaires and titans and industrialists who \u2014 at least with respect to newspapers in the 20th century \u2014 were in it for the business, in it for the buck, but also to curry favor too, to run an editorial page that would align with its business interest. When the internet came, it became a much less optimal business.\nI don\u2019t recall ever having extensive discussions about Jeff Bezos with anybody at The Post prior to the sale. There was a journalistic thirst to get this fellow in front of us and ask him questions. He came to Washington a month later and appeared in the same place.\nI asked him why Amazon wasstonewalling journalists. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that the most powerful minds in the world can hold powerful inconsistencies.\u201d\nAs told toKaren Weise\n\n\nAs told toErin Griffith\nAileen Lee, a tech investor at Cowboy Ventures, coins a term witha blog posttitled \u201cWelcome to the Unicorn Club: Learning From Billion-DollarStartups.\u201d\nMs. Lee:At the time, most people were not being very analytical about the venture industry. I had a new fund and no portfolio companies. So I felt like, O.K., I\u2019ve got an open dance card. Let me see if I can do some analysis.\nI was writing a blog post about public or private companies that were less than 10 years old, that had been venture-backed and that were worth over $1 billion. It\u2019s just a really long phrase. I guess \u201cunicorn\u201d is a really convenient term, right?\nAlfred Lin, venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital:It was stunning to me how quickly some companies\u2019 equity valuations climbed to that level.\nScott Sandell, venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates:We invested aggressively at that time. There were groupings of companies that were growing astronomically in every way that matters. We weren\u2019t the only ones \u2014 lots of people saw it.\nMr. Lin:The psychology of being a unicorn had power. It was easier to market the company to recruits, business partners and new investors. Even if you were rational about your valuation, you couldn\u2019t ignore market forces and how your competitors were operating. Founders and investors started to believe the last valuation of the company was its real valuation.\nMr. Sandell:In some cases, the private market valuations got ahead of the public market valuations.\nMr. Lin:When Aileen came up with the term, there were only about 40 unicorns, so the term seemed appropriate at the time. Today, there are over 500, so the term seems less pertinent. It gave some founders something to strive for, but in retrospect, it\u2019s a vanity term and a vanity metric.\nMs. Lee:It\u2019s wrong to pursue as an end goal. Being called a unicorn is just one part of your job. But it\u2019s not your job.\nAs told toErin Griffith\n\n\nAs told toRaymond ZhongandPaul Mozur\nA lip-syncing app called Musical.ly debuts, quickly attracting a huge and youthful audience. The app is later bought by theChinese social giant ByteDanceand becomes known as TikTok.\nAlex Zhu, co-founder of Musical.ly:Initially, the company had nothing to do with music and entertainment. We built the company to do something revolutionary for education: \u201cLet\u2019s make an online course as short as possible. Three to four minutes.\u201d It turned out to be an absolute failure. No retention, no downloads.\nThe failure told us several things. To build a community where users are generating the content, three to four minutes is not short enough. It has to be seconds.\nMaria Shabalin, a teenager with more than two million TikTok fans:I started on Musical.ly at the end of the summer before I started eighth grade. And by the time I was two weeks into eighth grade, I already had a video that went viral in a couple of hours.\nI don\u2019t remember the song exactly. But I remember I was singing with my cat and my dog. I had a guitar. I was lip-syncing, and they made cameos.\nAfter that, I just started posting more and more. Definitely multiple videos per week or even per day, sometimes two per day.\nMr. Zhu:We spent a lot of time studying Instagram, because the logic is very similar in several ways. For Musical.ly, it\u2019s kind of like making music as a filter. Everyone can create interesting enough content based on music, just like everyone can post interesting enough photos using filters.\nMs. Shabalin:After I had hundreds of thousands of followers, people would recognize me on the street. But as it turned out, it became such a big part of my identity that I lost myself a little bit on the way. There was a part of the app, like a chart that would rank the influencers. And I remember checking it and thinking, \u201cWhy am I not on the top? What do I have to do to get to the top?\u201d\nBy the middle or the end of ninth grade, I sort of, in a way, broke down. I kind of lost what I believe I previously had \u2014 that energy that people enjoyed. And one day, it just clicked: Maybe I should be spending less time on the app and more time in the real world.\n(The interview with Mr. Zhu took place in 2016.)\nAs told toRaymond ZhongandPaul Mozur\n\n\nAs told toNellie Bowles\nA biting satire of the technology industry debuts on HBO.\n\n\nMike Judge, co-creator:I think the very first time we played in front of an audience was in Redwood City, Calif.\nAlec Berg, showrunner:I don\u2019t think anybody booed.\nMr. Judge:Elon Musk was kind of glaring at me afterward, but then later he came around to liking the show.\nMr. Berg:I remember one of the early episodes airing and Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist, started tweeting quotes from it for like an entire day. I think we were all a little bit in shock that somebody who was actually in the business wasn\u2019t tearing it down as an absolute laughable farce.\nLike, we went to a bunch of companies after Season 1 and had a bunch of executives say, \u201cWe love that thing, how you\u2019re saying on the show that everybody onlysays,\u2018We\u2019re making the world a better place.\u2019 That\u2019s so funny. But we actuallyaremaking the world a better place.\u201d They had no awareness.\nAs told toNellie Bowles\n\n\nAs told toAdam Satariano\nEurope\u2019s highest courtrulesthat people in the region can demand that Google delete search results about them if those results are \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.\u201d\nJoaqu\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, a lawyer who filed the original \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d case for a Spanish citizen,Mario Costeja:In those years, there was no certainty about what a citizen had to do if he or she found information on the internet about himself or herself that was harmful, or not true, or obsolete. This led me to write an article on my blog, \u201cHow to Delete Personal Data From Google.\u201d It was read by hundreds of people \u2014 among them Mario.\nWhen Mario brought his case to my law firm, we went to both Google and the newspaper that had published an item that he wanted removed. Both replied that they didn\u2019t consider themselves responsible. So we requested the protection of the Spanish Data Protection Agency, the A.E.P.D. They ruled, then came the appeals, and then the final procedure before the European Court of Justice.\nMario Costeja:I was surprised to beat a company like Google. I had mixed feelings after so many years of struggle. Joy, of course, but at the same time, vertigo for what was coming.\nMr. Mu\u00f1oz:I found out on the phone thanks to a journalist who was in the chamber while the ruling was read. After this, a crazy number of calls from journalists was unleashed. I realized then the real impact that the case was having all over the world, and the next day, it was on the front page of almost all the newspapers and all over the TV news.\nMr. Costeja:Thanks to this ruling, there is now the right to be forgotten included in the General Data Protection Regulation, with common rules for 747 million people all over Europe.\nMr. Mu\u00f1oz:I believe that the average citizen is becoming more and more aware of the value of their data and the benefit that large companies make of the information they generate on the internet or social media. Our ruling was one of the first to set limits on a large technology company, which seemed untouchable at the time.\nAs told toAdam Satariano\n\n\nAs told toLi Yuan\nThe Chinese e-commerce giantlists its shareson the New York Stock Exchange in one of the biggest-ever initial public offerings, signaling the rise of China\u2019s internet companies.\nDuncan Clark, an early adviser to Alibaba and the author of \u201cAlibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built\u201d:A few days before Alibaba\u2019s I.P.O., I wandered by the Waldorf Astoria in New York to witness the caravan of limos pulling up outside the hotel and this very long line of people snaking up the steps into the elevators to go up to the upper rooms where Jack Ma, the co-founder, and others were making their pitch. It was quite a sight.\nI can remember late August in 1999, when I went to the apartment where Alibaba was founded. It was in a new complex in Hangzhou. When you walked into this little apartment, all the shoes were lined up at the door and people were crammed in. Jack had told people he didn\u2019t want them living more than five to 10 minutes away from that apartment.\nThe internet was pretty new, so it was a really tough slog early on. Jack wasn\u2019t blessed with connections or height or money. But there\u2019s something about his unbelievable determination in the face of crazy odds.\nOn the day of the I.P.O., Jack was at the New York Stock Exchange at the market open. But he didn\u2019t ring the opening bell. Eight customers of Alibaba rang the bell on the company\u2019s behalf. He\u2019s always been focused on customer first.\nAs the I.P.O. unfolded, I had the palpable sense of this consumer juggernaut that was being unlocked. 2014 was a very good time for Alibaba to go public \u2014\u00a0it was two years before the election of the current president of the United States, and only two years into President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule. Looking back, it does seem a little bit like it was a Gilded Age.\nAs told toLi Yuan\n\n\nAs told toKashmir Hill\nAnamorphous online movementcalled Gamergate, which ostensibly is about protecting \u201cthe historic culture of video games,\u201d\u00a0takes a disturbing turn. After Brianna Wu, a developer, posts a series of mocking tweets, she is subjected to a terrifying harassment campaign.\nMs. Wu:In July, I had just shipped my studio\u2019s first game, Revolution 60, in which woman characters were heroes the way men usually are. We got rave reviews for a studio of mostly women shipping a very complicated game. And I wrote a piece in Polygon called \u201cNo Skin Thick Enough\u201d about what it was like to be a woman in the video game industry and to get nonstop harassment.\nGamergate eventually went after me for standing up for the women who work in games. I got rape and death threats. They threatened to kill my husband, my dog. They did cyberattacks on my company. They ran me out of my home. It was total warfare on my mental health, my reputation and my ability to make a living. The police got involved and eventually the F.B.I. They based a \u201cLaw and Order\u201d episode on the death threats I got.\nThere is an entire generation of people who base their identity on games. People who wear T-shirts with a Nintendo or an Xbox or an NES controller on them. It\u2019s like tribal markings.\nWhen women come into this equation and say, \u201cYou need to start thinking about how women are treated in these games, and change that and include us\u201d \u2014 for a certain amount of the population, that is incredibly threatening. We are saying that we are going to take away their culture and change it.\nTo me, it\u2019s very similar to growing up in Mississippi and seeing Confederate flags on people\u2019s trucks. They have that because they\u2019re proud of that culture. Asking people to be more inclusive is a real affront to a certain kind of person.\nIn the aftermath of Gamergate, there was no shortage of people and institutions swearing up and down that things were going to change. I had two calls with the Obama White House. I said to them and to the F.B.I., \u201cIf you don\u2019t act, this playbook is going to catch on fire and it is going to become normalized.\u201d\nThe simple fact is, if you go on the internet today and you threaten to murder or rape someone, nothing is going to happen. Until we introduce consequences into the equation, the situation is not going to get better.\nAs told toKashmir Hill\n\n\nAs told toDavey Alba\nAlex Lee, 16, isat workat the Eldorado Parkway SuperTarget inFrisco, Texas,when an admirer snaps his photo and posts it online. It immediately takes off and becomes a huge meme.\nMr. Lee:My phone was dead that day. I was working a closing shift at Target, a normal shift, but then one of my friends came up to my cash register and asked for a picture with me. Later, I had another person from my school come and take a picture with me, and that\u2019s when I started to get a little concerned. They were like, \u201cHave you seen what\u2019s going on?\u201d And they showed me Twitter. The original #alexfromtarget picture had maybe 3,000 retweets.\nI eventually got my phone charged. It froze as soon as it came on. I had to use my mom\u2019s phone to see what was going on. At that point, I had 200,000 followers from Twitter. Thirty minutes after I got home, Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s team had reached out to my parents to ask me to come film for their show. I wasn\u2019t into TV a whole lot, so I didn\u2019t even know who Ellen was.\nI was flying back and forth between Texas and Los Angeles for the whole Ellen thing and afterward as well, for a few interviews. Eventually I had to switch over to home schooling.\nI didn\u2019t know that social media influencers were really a thing. And then we had a ton of people coming to us with business ideas to take advantage of the followers \u2014\u00a0like, making a career out of it.\nThey were like, \u201cHow about you go on DigiTour?\u201d They told me it was a tour where a bunch of social media influencers do meet-and-greets, and do skits onstage. I was terrified to go onstage for the first two shows. We went to a ton of cities; we usually went from West Coast to East Coast. Whenever they would ask me to take a picture to post, they would Photoshop the crap out of it. And I didn\u2019t like it, because that\u2019s not what I look like. So I just never really thought it was authentic.\nI had multiple experiences with management teams that just weren\u2019t very positive. I realized I wanted to get away from it shortly after it happened, probably about six months after. I realized it wasn\u2019t for me, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint the people around me that were saying I should pursue it. And everybody was saying I should continue with it. Then I just woke up one day and said, \u201cThis is it. I\u2019m getting off all my social media.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how, but yes, I still get recognized. It happens every few days.\nI\u2019m trying to figure out my plans for the future. I\u2019m about to go back to school. I got my E.M.T. certification and personal training certification. But specifically, right now, I\u2019m pursuing personal training. Hopefully, the fire department eventually.\nAs told toDavey Alba\n\n\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\nThe movie studio\u2019s system ispenetratedby a group that American officials conclude is a front forKim Jong-un\u2019s regime. The country appears to be retaliating for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a Sony comedy about an assassination attempt against the dictator.\nMichael Lynton, chief executive and chairman of Sony Entertainment:We understood fairly early on \u2014 within the first 24 hours \u2014 that this was a significant event. The damage was extensive: 70 percent of our computers were down and destroyed, and our email and other information had been stolen. Very quickly, we moved to pen and paper and set up a text chain tree because it was the only way we could run the company.\nIt brought to public light what a major cyberattack could look like. At the time, we were accused of being lax this and lax that, but soon after, a number of other companies and government agencies were hacked. We were no longer an outlier.\nIn a first, and very harsh, way, it also demonstrated the capabilities of the North Koreans. It also put a spotlight on what should or should not be on a company\u2019s network, whether it\u2019s health care data or emails.\nThe attack went off in a big way, and yet we got no support from our fellow movie studios, no support from the mayor of Los Angeles, no support from then-Attorney General Kamala Harris. In a funny way, I don\u2019t blame them because, from a distance, no one really understood how damaging or difficult the situation was.\nThe attack had eerie similarities to the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. It demonstrated that all you have to do is throw a chair through a window or crack open the safe and the media will do the rest \u2014 with all due respect. The looters were waiting with pen and paper in hand.\nAs told toNicole Perlroth\n\n\nAs told toDavid Streitfeld\nA jury in San Franciscorejects gender discrimination claimsmade by Ellen Pao, a junior partner at Silicon Valley\u2019s most famous venture capital firm. Prefiguring the #MeToo movement, the case draws attention to the lack of gender diversity in tech.\nMs. Pao:At least until recently, the venture capital industry had a lot of good will. The story was always about how it was trying to change the world for the better, and about it being a meritocracy. That was the narrative in 2012 when I sued.\nI wanted the institution to change. It wasn\u2019t \u201cI want more money\u201d or \u201cI deserve a promotion.\u201d It was seeing this happen to all the women on the team. Seeing that nobody was going to get promoted made me realize this is a much bigger thing than me.\nThe hardest part of the trial was the loneliness. There was a lack of empathy from the industry. I understand why it happened \u2014 Kleiner had a huge P.R. team; this was the first time people were really talking about a lot of these issues in tech; there was a lot of skepticism. But the idea you had to take down the person telling the story, the person who was trying to call attention to the problem, was really hurtful.\nAll that made me unwilling to settle, made me feel I had to move forward. I had to tell the story, because there weren\u2019t many other people in a position to do it.\nIf I knew going in I was going to lose, I would have taken more risks. I would have brought up the racial issues. But I wasn\u2019t sure some things would resonate. There are small things that happened that aren\u2019t on their own particularly terrible, but the pattern was death by a million cuts \u2014 constantly being asked to do the menial tasks, constantly being talked over, constantly being interrupted, constantly having your ideas taken without credit. I see now that this has happened to so many other people \u2014 it happens to women as a class, to people of color as a class.\nNearly five years after the trial, I don\u2019t see much change in the venture world. V.C. funding to woman-led companies increased in 2019 to a paltry 2.8 percent. Only 12 percent of V.C. investing partners are women. Less than 5 percent of V.C. investing partners are black or Latinx.\nAt Kleiner, the publicity from the case damaged the facade of meritocracy, and it changed the perception of their contribution. But they\u2019re still able to raise boatloads of money.\nAs told toDavid Streitfeld\n\n\nAs told toKashmir Hill\nJacky Alcin\u00e9, a software engineer in Brooklyn,uploadspictures of himself and a friend \u2014\u00a0who are both black \u2014\u00a0to Google\u2019s new service for storing photos and videos. The softwarelabels the images \u201cgorillas.\u201d\nMr. Alcin\u00e9:I did what I always do when something happens. I put it on Twitter, the world\u2019s largest cafeteria room. And a Google Plus community outreach person reached out right away, asking for access to my account. As far as I know, they wanted to take that set of information to say, \u201cBad computer. Don\u2019t do that again.\u201d But as I understand it, they just eliminated the tag \u201cgorillas\u201d entirely.\nIt\u2019s hard to undo data. There is input from a bunch of sources, and you don\u2019t know how the bad data got in, so you\u2019d have to do a lot of tracing and auditing and rolling back. For Google, it\u2019s not cost efficient, I guess, to do all that for one person complaining.\nThey could have handled it a lot better. Beyond a passive apology, they could have captured more photos of people who look like me.\nThe labeling technology is ridiculously amazing, at the component level. But at the macro level, this wasn\u2019t acceptable. It was like a 3-year-old made waffles for breakfast, which is amazing, but they burned down the kitchen while they did it, which isn\u2019t great.\nAs told toKashmir Hill\n\n\nAs told toKaren Weise\nAmazon beginsPrime Day, a shopping holiday geared toward its members, during the summer sales lull, reshaping the retail calendar.\nJeff Wilke, head of Amazon\u2019s consumer business:In October 2014, Jeff Bezos sent me an email that basically said, \u201cHow can we have a big annual sale called Prime Day, and only Prime members would be eligible?\u201d\nWe gave it a project code name, as we often do. This one was called Project Pi\u00f1ata. Few things bring as much joy as a pi\u00f1ata.\nWe have a process to crystallize any new thing that we\u2019re inventing, where we write a press release that you think you would show the world on the day of launch, and then you work backward from that press release. Around the middle of November, in 2014, I had a consumer leadership team meeting to review the press release that describes what we expected to launch as Prime Day, seven months in the future. In this case Project Pi\u00f1ata was a deal day and would be timed with our 20th birthday.\nThe first concern I had was whether we would be able to source enough inventory and deals in July. Vendors and manufacturers are all keyed up to source terrific deals in November and December. But it\u2019s a different story to do a sale where there hasn\u2019t been one before in July.\nAnd I was worried about the technology behind the website. We knew we would get pounded with traffic in a successful sale, and it had to work.\nFast forward to January. We had our first meeting with Jeff Bezos. His feedback was, \u201cDon\u2019t make this convoluted. Prime Day needs to mean one thing, and we have to do it really well.\u201d\nIn a box in an appendix, we said we want to have the largest selection of deals, more deals than Black Friday, which meant more than 10,000 deals. And he had boxed that in on his copy of the press release and said, \u201cWe have to do that.\u201d\nOn the day itself, we watched the events circle the globe. We started in Japan, and we ended in the U.S. We knew fairly early on, especially with the response we got in Japan, that Prime Day was going to be very successful.\nI gave a pep talk in this command center that we had, and I told them, \u201cTwenty years from now, you guys will be reflecting back on this and realize you changed the course of retail.\u201d\nAs told toKaren Weise\n\n\nAs told toNatasha Singer\nThe Wall Street Journal publishesan expos\u00e9 of the medical start-up. Founded by Elizabeth Holmes, it claimed to have developed technology that could run more than 200 different diagnostic blood tests using a few drops of blood.\nJohn Carreyrou, Journal reporter:In early 2015, I didn\u2019t understand everything yet. But I already understood, after a first phone call with a source, that the Theranos machine didn\u2019t work.\nThat\u2019s one reveal. The second reveal is that the machine wasn\u2019t even being used by Theranos, except for about six tests. And No. 3, for many of the other tests, they were using a conventional blood-testing machine that they had hacked \u2014 a machine made by the German conglomerate Siemens that you find in many labs throughout the world. One of the main modifications they had made is that they diluted the blood to create more volume so that the Siemens machine would accept it.\nIt dawned on me that this wasn\u2019t just a young entrepreneur who would lie to investors and her board about where she was with her technology. It was a medical fraud. This was a company that had gone out and put public health in jeopardy.\nAnaArriola, Theranos executive:Our mechanical engineer told us he had been trying to get information to the company\u2019s leadership that the device we had embedded in University of Tennessee oncology blood trials was defective.\nSo I went to Elizabeth. She basically turned to me and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re on the precipice of becoming incredibly disruptive within this industry. We have every biopharmaceutical manufacturer in the world on board to use this in their pharmaceutical trials. We cannot disrupt this right now.\u201d\nErika Cheung, Theranos lab assistant and whistle-blower:I was in charge of validating the Edison device, which was Theranos\u2019s proprietary medical device and diagnostic unit,to make sure that it had good accuracy and very good precision. They were tampering with the data to have us get as good a precision on the Theranos device as we would have seen on an F.D.A.-approved machine.\nAfter the article is published,Ms. Holmes denies wrongdoing.\nMr. Carreyrou:Elizabeth came out swinging, and she was incredibly confident and assertive. And so there was a period of weeks, if not months, where some people weren\u2019t sure what to believe.\nIt took the actions of the two main health regulators to make people realize that we had indeed gotten our facts right. The F.D.A. and C.M.S. \u2014\u00a0the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 both launched inspections of the company\u2019s facilities. Their findings showed that basically, this was all one big lie.\nMs. Arriola:It wasn\u2019t until that article came out that I felt vindicated and we, as a collective team, felt like we could start the real transition through dealing with the trauma. A lot of us are actually still processing this.\nMs. Cheung:For me, the biggest thing was when C.M.S. came in. They did an investigation, and they were able to uncover all the deficiencies and put a halt to Theranos processing the patient samples. Once that happened, I was like, \u201cO.K., your job\u2019s done here. You can go to bed at night and sleep.\u201d\nAs told toNatasha Singer\n\n\nAs told toVindu Goel\nRegulators block the social network\u2019sFree Basics program, a suite of apps that Facebook had hoped would expand internet access in the countryand establish the company as a dominant platform.\nNikhil Pahwa,journalist and activist:For us, this was a fight for freedom: Why should Facebook decide what people can and cannot see?\nWe worked with a comedy troupe called All India Bakchod to simplify the concepts with a video. We positioned Free Basics as one entity that was impacting the freedom of the internet, and most importantly, calling it the internet when it wasn\u2019t the internet.\nWe set up a site, SavetheInternet.in, which the video directed people toward, to send comments to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The video just went viral. We were quite enthused about how many people seemed to care about an issue that they had no clue about.\nThis was the first pushback against a Facebook product anywhere in the world at this scale. This was also Facebook\u2019s first global public policy loss, where they went up against citizens.\nWhat we did has been vindicated by, for example, what we\u2019ve seen subsequently in Myanmar and Philippines \u2014 where for most people, Facebookisthe internet and its algorithms end up prioritizing content. That is not necessarily good for democracy.\nAs told toVindu Goel\n\n\nAs told toJack Nicas\nThe Justice Department asks a federal court to order Apple tohelp unlockthe encrypted iPhone of the gunman in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., setting off a battle of privacy versus security.\nDavid Bowdich,head of the F.B.I.\u2019s Los Angeles office:We received reports of an active shooter, so I went immediately to San Bernardino. There was a device that was found, an Apple phone, and it belonged to the County of San Bernardino. The county said, \u201cYou do whatever you need to do with it.\u201d\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel:We have a hotline that law enforcement can call and say, \u201cWe have a phone; what should we do with it?\u201d The first call came in about 3 a.m. the day after the massacre. They said, \u201cWhat can you do to help us?\u201d\nThe F.B.I. had allowed the phone to power down and had tried to reset the Apple ID. Both made it almost impossible for any kind of easy access to the data. It was clear there wasn\u2019t going to be any way short of creating a back door.\nMr. Bowdich:We were told, \u201cWe\u2019re only going to do what the law requires us to do.\u201d\nMr. Sewell:We\u2019ve been working with the F.B.I. for a long time, and it had always been incredibly civil. But it became clear that this one was different.\nThe standoff leads to the court order.\nKiran Raj, senior counsel for the deputy attorney general:The F.B.I. had found on the gunman\u2019s Facebook page pledges to Al Qaeda and ISIS. It was an intense investigation.\nThe shooting took place Dec. 2, 2015. About two and a half months later, the U.S. attorney\u2019s officefiledto get the judge to order Apple to unlock the phone.\nMr. Sewell:What the government did was file a very aggressive complaint. It essentially said: Apple is in cahoots with terrorists because they will not help us. It was a smart move by the government, but it was really aggressive.\nAs soon as we received that, we knew that immediately we needed to start communicating our message. We worked through the night onthe statement.\nIn its statement, Apple says the court order would set a dangerous precedent and put the public\u2019s privacy at risk.\nMr. Sewell:The entire company\u2019s brand was on the line. We had people like Trump standing up on the stump saying, \u201cLet\u2019s boycott Apple phones.\u201d We had people saying Apple\u2019s a non-American company. I was getting calls at my house with people going, \u201cHow dare you do this?\u201d\nMr. Bowdich:There are victims on the other end. So I was surprised that we did not receive more cooperation.\nOn the eve of a March hearing in the case, things turn.\nMr. Sewell:The teams on both sides had moved to the trial site. Then at about 5 o\u2019clock, we got a call from the U.S. attorney saying they had asked to postpone the hearing. They thought they had a way of accessing the phone.\nMr. Bowdich:A company came with a solution. The techs looked at it and said, \u201cYou know what? This one works.\u201d\nMr. Raj:The encryption issue is much more nuanced and more complicated than it has been portrayed. Unfortunately, with this particular case, people felt like they had to choose a side.\nAs told toJack Nicas\n\n\nAs told toCade Metz\nDeepMind, an artificial intelligence lab owned by Google, puts AlphaGo, a machine it developed to play the ancient and complex game of Go, upagainst Lee Se-dol, the best Go player of the decade.\nDemis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind:At the time we announced we were going to play Lee Se-dol, we were definitely nowhere near strong enough to beat him.\nSo we were relying on the power of extrapolation and statistics to get us there. We could see the performance curve improving. But you don\u2019t know, right? It was quite a risky thing for us to try. That\u2019s actually why Lee Se-dol wasn\u2019t so worried about it.\nThe matches are played in South Korea.\nI don\u2019t think we quite understood, actually, how big it was going to be in Korea. We knew it was going to be big, and we knew Lee Se-dol was a legend, and I knew that Go was huge there, and I knew they loved A.I. and technology. But we didn\u2019t quite expect it to bring the country to a standstill, which it almost did. Or it felt like it did.\nWhen I got off the plane, there were like 20 reporters waiting for me, as if I was David Beckham or something.\nAnd then there was all the top brass there from Google. We were still quite new to Google at that point. Barely two years in, and we were promising pretty crazy stuff like beating the world champion at Go.\nI met Lee Se-dol for dinner with his family on the day before the match started. He\u2019s got this incredible nobility and elegance about him as a human being and as someone who\u2019s mastered an art.\nAlphaGo wins the first three games. Mr. Lee wins the fourth and AlphaGo the fifth.\nI really felt for him. I felt it would be appropriate if he won a game \u2014 for his soul and for the soul of the game. Fortunately, he was able to \u2014 and I\u2019m really pleased that it was due to some brilliance from him.\nAs told toCade Metz\n\n\nAs told toKevin Roose\nThe website posts a Facebook Live video called \u201cWatch Us Explode This Watermelon One Rubber Band at a Time!\u201d The 45-minute video, featuring two BuzzFeed staff members in hazmat suits stretching 682 rubber bands around a watermelon until it bursts, is a viral sensation with nearly one million simultaneous viewers at its peak.\n\n\nJonah Peretti, BuzzFeed\u2019s chief executive:The watermelon wasn\u2019t just a weird lark. We built our way toward the watermelon.\nThe first experiment was when one of our executives was in a meeting, and someone who worked for him put a family of goats in his office, and then started broadcasting on Facebook Live. We saw the number of concurrent viewers go up and up and up and up while people were waiting for the boss to come back. We had this theory that people anticipating something and sharing something together is the thing that was working.\nAnd so the watermelon was designed as a way of testing that theory.\nChelsea Marshall, a BuzzFeed senior writer:At the time, I was writing for the site, and that day, my co-worker was like, \u201cDo you want to explode a watermelon?\u201d I was just, \u201cYeah, sure, it will probably take like five minutes.\u201d So James and I went and started putting rubber bands on the watermelon.\nMr. Peretti:There was a giddy feeling in the office. All the way up on the 15th floor, you could hear laughing in the canteen a few floors down.\nMs. Marshall:In the middle of it, someone was like, \u201cHow many people do you think are watching this?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, two? Our moms?\u201d There hadn\u2019t been a huge thing on Facebook Live yet.\nMr. Peretti:They were running around at Facebook trying to make sure they could keep the feed up, because at that point they had never had a live stream with that many concurrents.\nMs. Marshall:We had our hazmat suits on, and goggles, because I had personally never exploded a watermelon before. There were crowds forming around us in the office, but it didn\u2019t really occur to me or James that it was going viral while we were doing it.\nIt just kept going so much longer than either James or I thought it would. Right before, I think I could tell, \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to blow up really soon.\u201d And then obviously it exploded everywhere.\nMr. Peretti:It was a more utopian time where people were more optimistic about the future and change, and the world transforming for the better. People coming together to share a moment that was completely nonpolitical, silly, fun, lighthearted \u2014 that was pretty typical of the time.\nMs. Marshall:Afterward, my husband had to put Band-Aids on my fingers for me because I couldn\u2019t even bend them. So, I guess if anyone does that again, wear gloves.\nAs told toKevin Roose\n\n\nAs told toCade Metz\nThe principle,which refers to a prediction made in 1965 that engineers would pack twice as many transistors onto a computer chip every 18 months, slows.The endcomes when Google starts building its own computer chip, called the TPU, because standard chips can no longer keep pace with the rise of artificial intelligence.\nGordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, who coined Moore\u2019s Law:We ran out of gas sometime during the last decade. We couldn\u2019t continue to shrink things anymore. I have been amazed that the engineers have been able to keep it moving as long as they have.\nAll of a sudden, the barriers that we were tackling were coming to a fundamental limit. They had to live with the fact that transistors are made of atoms.\nThat was a prediction that Stephen Hawking made during one of his visits to Silicon Valley. Somebody asked him what the fundamental limits would be. He said the velocity of light and the atomic nature of matter, both of which are fundamental.\nJohn Hennessy, board member of Google:We\u2019re probably about seven to 10 years into a slowdown on Moore\u2019s Law. We\u2019ve strayed away from Gordon\u2019s original prediction. And we\u2019re beginning to see the effects of this.\nOne complication is energy efficiency. If you think about an Intel microprocessor, it currently generates, let\u2019s say, 135 watts. Imagine something, some tiny object that is about a centimeter and a half on a side, that\u2019s generating more heat than a 100-watt light bulb.\nYou have to get the electricity in, and then you have to get the heat out. That\u2019s become a major limitation in our ability to build chips, particularly in the mobile space, because you care about battery life. You also don\u2019t want your phone to be so hot that it\u2019s burning holes in your pocket.\nImagine you\u2019re only a little bit behind on Moore\u2019s Law. What would you do? You put more transistors on \u2014 perhaps not twice as many as you had in the previous generation, but perhaps 1.5 times as many \u2014 and then you\u2019d try to figure out how to use those transistors to make the CPU faster.\nThe problem is, if you put transistors on that chip and you activate them, you\u2019re going to burn up too much power. You\u2019re not going to be able to get the power out. We have already reached this regime where these things are limiting the ability to use even what remains of Moore\u2019s Law.\nArtificial intelligence is also speeding the end of Moore\u2019s Law.\nMr. Hennessy:Why do computers need to be fast? The answer to that is the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Your home speaker, whether it\u2019s a Google Home or an Alexa or whatever, offers speech recognition. The best speech recognition in the world is based on machine learning.\nWhen Google adopted its \u201cA.I. first\u201d strategy, which was probably seven, eight years ago, we quickly did a computation that said that if we were going to use conventional, general-purpose processors, two things would happen. One was: We couldn\u2019t afford the energy. And we probably couldn\u2019t afford to buy all the processors that we would need to do everything we needed to do.\nThat\u2019s what motivated our thinking with the TPU. We had to think about really trying to improve efficiency dramatically. The result is, you can get about a factor of 100 in terms of computational power per watt of power. That\u2019s like giving you an extra seven years on Moore\u2019s Law.\nAs told toCade Metz\n\n\nAs told toDavid Streitfeld\nThe app is aninstant global hit. In an update of the old-fashioned scavenger hunt, players use augmented reality to capture creatures from the Pokemon video game franchise in the physical world.\nJohn Hanke, chief executive of Niantic, the game\u2019s developer:I grew up loving board games, outside games like tag and cops and robbers, video games like Pong, and everything that came later. I was attracted to the idea of making games as well as playing them. I worked at Google on Google Maps and Google Earth, so I had an opportunity to bring together the map of the world and game playing.\nI was also thinking about technology that would be directly beneficial to me and my family. Rather than camping out in front of the TV with my oldest son, I wanted to marry my interest in getting him outside, exploring the places where we lived and at the same time play a game.\nOur business plan with Pokemon Go was to slowly ramp up over a period of six months. We immediately surpassed that goal.\nThe full impact of the game\u2019s popularity hit me when I was on a trip to Japan. I took my oldest son with me. We went to the bamboo forest in Kyoto, a very tranquil place.\nThen I got a call from my wife in Oakland, who said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what is going on with this game. Packs of kids are roaming through the town. All the parks are full.\u201d\nPokemon Go was the first digital game of any kind of scale that brought people together in the real world. It was self-propelling. As people came out to play and saw other people playing, they got even more excited. It was a kind of real-world virality.\nAs told toDavid Streitfeld\n\n\nAs told toVindu Goel\nReliance Jio, a mobile carrier created byMukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest man, begins offering free calls and 1.5 gigabytes of wireless data a day for $2 a month,opening the internetto hundreds of millions of Indians.\nMathew Oommen, executive at Reliance Jio:We sincerely believed India needed a digital revolution and not just another carrier. All the incumbents were quite happy with the high margins from delivering vanilla voice with very high data rates.\nWe looked at not voice, not just connectivity, but data as the fundamental building block to the new economy. And that\u2019s what got ignored by the incumbents.\nOne pundit made a statement in June 2016: \u201cThere are 25 million 4G phones in India. How does Mr. Ambani plan to reach 100 million subscribers in one year?\u201d\nWe looked at this and said this was not a lack of demand. This is absolutely a lack of affordable and quality supply.\nJio spent six years building a 4G wireless network, including writing new apps, installing towers in rural areas and designing inexpensive new phones that worked with its technology.\nWe were doing over 700 towers a day. We introduced the JioPhone. It was a $22 device, but we gave it for $10.\nFrom 2011 to launch, we built connectivity, we built content, we built apps, we built devices, we built programmability with intelligence, because all of these were fundamental building blocks to our platform.\nIn 171 days, we had over 100 million subscribers \u2014 the fastest-growing company in any sector across any technology company anywhere in the world.\nAs told toVindu Goel\n\n\nAs told toSheera Frenkel\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, says the notion that the social network played a role in putting Donald J. Trump in the White House is \u201ca pretty crazy idea.\u201dRussian agentsare later found to have used Facebook to spread inflammatory posts.\nAlex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s chief security officer:I saw a clip of Mark having that conversation, and it became clear to me that the work that we were doing in the run-up to the vote, and the internal briefings that we were giving a number of executives at the company about what we had found around Russian activity, had not made it up to him.\nZeynep Tufekci, professor of information science at the University of North Carolina:I saw the remark and immediately thought that it didn\u2019t make sense. If you were actually using Facebook at the time, you knew there was a lot of false political stories on it and a lot of misinformation.\nMr. Stamos:At that time, we had a dedicated threat intelligence team whose job it was to track government activity on the platform meant to cause harm. We did not have a team in 2016 dedicated to disinformation, and I\u2019m pretty sure no other tech company had one. And I\u2019m pretty sure that the American intelligence community didn\u2019t either.\nDr.Tufekci:Social media was drowning in these conspiracies. Some of it was just for ad money; some of it we later learned was Russia; some of it were just domestic people doing it for the LOLs.\nMr. Stamos:Mark\u2019s statement set the expectation with the world that Facebook just didn\u2019t care, which is just not true.\nDr. Tufekci:People saw his statement and saw that one of the richest people on earth was trying to wriggle out of his responsibility by making this claim that contradicted everything his company had previously said to politicians, advertisers and businesses about their ability to reach and sway people through Facebook.\nAs told toSheera Frenkel\n\n\nAs told toJack Nicas\nYouTube announces a milestone: People watchedmore than one billion hoursof YouTube videos in a single day.\n\n\nNeal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer:Setting a goal of watch time was really around user satisfaction.\nUp until then, the visible currency of YouTube was views. That\u2019s how creators measured consumption of their videos. It\u2019s how users understood the popularity of a video. So the shift from views to watch time was really around: How do we move away from something that could create incentives like clickbaity thumbnails to something that was about satisfying our users?\nOnce the goal was set, it was figuring out a way for our systems to deliver.\nGuillaume Chaslot, a Google engineer who worked on YouTube\u2019s video recommendation engine:Basically, we were computing which recommendations people should see. There was a previous algorithm, and we were introducing a new algorithm. In the end, the metric that mattered was total watch time.\nLet\u2019s say you like football and you like pizza; then the algorithm is going to infer that you like beer, too. It worked a bit, but the thing that seemed to work the best is to just push in one direction. So if you like video games, you click on another video game video, and we\u2019ll show you more video game videos. But if you don\u2019t like video games, or for some reason you\u2019re not in the mood for watching video games, you have no way of giving the signal to the algorithm.\nMr. Mohan:It became clear that we were moving toward this goal of one billion hours and that we would hit it in a matter of a few weeks. We definitely recognized the milestone. It was something that a lot of people who had been here for years felt proud of achieving.\nMr. Chaslot:We had a huge impact on the world by pushing people in some directions. What seems crazy is that we didn\u2019t even care where we were pushing them because we were just monitoring the watch times.\nSome filter bubbles got really toxic. We saw, in particular, conspiracy theories; when you start watching a video telling you the earth is flat, YouTube was recommending hundreds of videos telling you the same thing.\nMr. Mohan:What this milestone, to me, represents is a step along the way, where YouTube has gone from that village to this major metropolis, where not only is it a reflection of what\u2019s happening in the world, it also has this influence on the world. One of the challenges my teams have been working on is how does YouTube live up to that responsibility.\nMr. Chaslot:They\u2019ve changed a bunch of things. In January, they said that they would decrease the promotion of conspiracy theories. That\u2019s a really great improvement, but it\u2019s still far from being enough.\nThe problem is that the recommendation engine that handles 70 percent of views on YouTube is flawed by design. If the recommendation engine is not even able to understand that the earth is not flat, it\u2019s 2,000 years backward. So why would we want this algorithm to handle all of our political information?\nAs told toJack Nicas\n\n\nAs told toNellie Bowles\nRoger McNamee, a onetime mentor to Facebook\u2019s chief executive,publicly denounces the social networkin an opinion article in USA Today for hurting democracy and spreading misinformation.\nMr. McNamee:I never expected to become an activist. I began my career as a technology investor in 1982. I spent 34 years as a true believer in what technology could do to make the world a better place.\nIn January 2016, I see things going on in the Democratic primary on Facebook \u2014 in Facebook groups notionally associated with Bernie Sanders \u2014 that appeared really inauthentic. And then I saw a series of civil rights things starting with Black Lives Matter in March 2016.\nThen Brexit hits in June. And that\u2019s when I first realized, \u201cOh, my God,\u201d the same advertising tools that make marketers so successful on Facebook can be used to affect the outcome of an election, and that\u2019s when I freaked out.\nMr. McNamee is invited by the technology journalist Walt Mossberg to write an opinion article for the tech news site Recode.\nInstead of publishing the op-ed, I sent it to Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer. That\u2019s Oct. 30 of 2016. So that\u2019s when I go to them and say I\u2019ve written this draft op-ed that basically says I believe that the algorithms and business model of Facebook, as well as the culture, are allowing bad actors to harm innocent people.\nI spent three months pleading with them to do everything in their power to protect users from this. And I failed.\nI might have said it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But for whatever reason, I chose to look at it a different way. I had helped Mark keep the company independent, and I\u2019d helped to bring Sheryl in. And for three years I advised them. My firm had profited from it.\nI never expected to become an activist, and the experience itself has been depressing in the extreme. I\u2019ve worked with most of the companies that I\u2019m now criticizing. I know a lot of the people who work there. I do not think they are bad people, but they have come to believe things that I do not understand.\nAs told toNellie Bowles\n\n\nAs told toKevin Roose\nEpic Games releases the free-to-play Fortnite Battle Royale, an online video game in which 100 players compete to be the last one standing. It becomesa global phenomenon.\nTyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins, a gamer who live-streams himself playing Fortnite:My first game, I was terrible. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. But it felt like a different, super-unique game right from the start. And as a streamer and a gamer and a YouTuber, when you\u2019re enjoying a game that you\u2019re playing, it really shows.\nOnce I started averaging like 20,000 viewers on Fortnite, that was when I was like, \u201cO.K., this game is popping off.\u201d\nMr. Blevins learns that the rapper Drake is following him on Instagram.\nHe followed me on Instagram as @champagnepapi, and I had no idea that it was him. I woke up one morning and started streaming, and my chat was freaking out, like \u201cDrake followed you on Instagram.\u201d\nI was like, \u201cAll right guys, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t.\u201d And I checked, and he did. And I followed him back right away, and I was freaking out. I ran upstairs. I was like, \u201cJess, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess, what do I do?\u201d\nJess is his wife.\nDo I ask him to play? I\u2019m like, no, I can\u2019t. I have to wait. I\u2019m going to let him message me. And then like two days later he messaged me and was like, \u201cHey man, you want to play?\u201d\nMore than 600,000 people watch their game simultaneously.\nI really do think it encouraged a lot of athletes and other artists to admit and show their love for gaming. A lot of them started to stream and play with other streamers.\nBefore Fortnite, gaming was a multibillion-dollar industry, and it\u2019s always been really weird that it was a subculture. But over the last 10 years, especially with Fortnite, it\u2019s just made it so it\u2019s O.K. to be a gamer, right? I mean, everyone games. It\u2019s freaking great, man.\nAs told toKevin Roose\n\n\nAs told toCade Metz\nNews breaksof a video circulating on the internet that shows the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d star Gal Gadot having sex with her stepbrother. The video is not real; someonehad used artificial intelligence to superimpose Ms. Gadot\u2019s face on the body of a pornographic actress.\nPhillipIsola, one of the A.I. researchers who pioneered the techniques used to create deepfakes:In 2011, 2012, deep learning started taking off. The big event was, deep nets could recognize animals in photos.\nIt took a few years until people started to make systems that could do the opposite: not take an image and recognize that it was a cat, but take the label \u201ccat\u201d and synthesize an image that looks like a cat \u2014 the inverse problem. You could make photos of really low-resolution faces.\nVery rapidly after that, people were able to use these things for face-swapping and deepfakes and all of that.\nThe sudden attention catches researchers by surprise.\nThe technology advanced so quickly right around those years. It went from \u201cO.K., this is a really interesting academic problem, but you can\u2019t possibly use this to make fake news. It\u2019s just going to produce a little blurry object\u201d to \u201cOh, you can actually make photo-realistic faces.\u201d\nIt was quite a complicated pipeline to get it to work in that era. But it was really the release of an easy-to-use piece of code that made it so that the internet went wild with it.\nDr. Isola wrestles with the implications.\nIt definitely raised some concerns, because you get into a lot of difficult problems like \u201cWhat is our ownership over our public image?\u201d And there\u2019s also the issue that people are not calibrated to know what is real and what is not.\nBut if we restrict ourselves from working on these tools, we also take away all the positive usages.\nAs told toCade Metz\n\n\nAs told toNathaniel Popper\nTheprice of the cryptocurrencyskyrockets to more than $20,000 on some exchanges \u2014 before coming down to earth a few months later.\nBrian Armstrong, co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, an exchange company in San Francisco:The vibe in the office \u2014 it was palpable. You didn\u2019t want to even go to the bathroom or go home because you might miss something historic.\nThere was a day where we had like 50,000 people sign up. That was the highest we\u2019d ever seen sign up in a day at that time. I was trying to get a visual of what that even would look like. The Giants\u2019 stadium in San Francisco holds about 50,000 people, and so I sent a photo of that to the team.\nThen a week went by \u2014 and then we had a day where 500,000 people signed up in one day.\nIt was literally just like wartime. You try to make the best decisions you can. You catch a few hours of sleep and come back.\nHe worries that many people are risking too much on cryptocurrencies.\nThe prices were kind of getting so it felt like irrational exuberance, like a bubble.\nSomebody came to my apartment to deliver a package. And the guy was like, \u201cSir, I have a question for you. I know that you run this company. Should I be buying Bitcoin right now?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, my gosh, this is super uncomfortable.\u201d\nHe writes a blog post encouraging people not to get caught up in the hype.\nIt\u2019s sort of like a love-hate relationship with these kinds of trading things. On the one hand, it\u2019s a huge gift. Because every time it happens, it gets another order of magnitude of people into the crypto ecosystem.\nBut on the other hand, it\u2019s a little bit of a distraction from the overall potential of what this can really be. It\u2019s much more than just trading some new asset class.\nAs told toNathaniel Popper\n\n\nAs told toMatthew Rosenberg\nThe New York Times and The Guardian publish articles about how thepolitical data firmwith links to Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign had harvested personal information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million people.\nAleksandr Kogan, an academic who used a personality quiz to harvest Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica:We were doing the project, collecting the data, and the idea was that there was basically a model where we could pass people\u2019s Facebook data \u2014 their pages, \u201clikes\u201d \u2014 through and generate predictions about their personalities and their politics.\nBut along the way we discovered that a lot of this data was not really useful as far as predictive accuracy. Even after delivering the data, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out if there is a way to make it better. We came to the conclusion that the answer is no.\nIn March 2018, The Times approaches Facebook after reviewing a copy of the data gathered by Cambridge Analytica and documents that showed the social network had sought to ensure the information was erased by Mr. Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie, one of the firm\u2019s co-founders. Facebook had until that point declined to acknowledge that Cambridge Analytica had collected the data.\nThe Times and The Guardian ran the story on Saturday. But my phone started to blow up Friday night. And the reason was that on Friday morning, Facebook took away my account. I just got logged out.\nI asked my wife, \u201cCan you, like, find me?\u201d And she could not find me on Facebook. I was wiped off the planet. We had no idea why.\nThen Friday evening, Facebook put out a press release saying it had banned Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. They said we\u2019d lied and engaged in fraud. So this was Facebook trying to pre-empt the articles The New York Times and The Guardian were about to run. And that opened up the floodgates.\nAt the time, Mr. Kogan believes that the revelations will not make a ripple.\nI thought this was going to come and go: Who\u2019s going to really care? I completely made a mistake. Within a day, I was under siege. I was getting hundreds of emails from pretty much every media outlet in the world.\nAn old girlfriend of mine recently told me that when this all went down, her friends were coming to her and asking if she realized her ex-boyfriend had taken down the free world.\nTech giants had been running rampant for a decade, two decades, and now folks for the first time really cared. And that\u2019s what I think is the incredible, powerful legacy of Cambridge Analytica. It couldn\u2019t do anything useful with the data it collected. But because of the Trump connection, it did capture people\u2019s imagination.\nAs told toMatthew Rosenberg\n\n\nAs told to David McCabe\nFacebook\u2019s chief executivetestifiesbefore the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees about revelations that Cambridge Analytica had improperly used personal data from users\u2019 profiles. It foreshadows other questioning of tech executives.\nSenator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, chairman of the Commerce Committee:He came in the day before the hearing. Of course he was very professional, had his team with him and talked a lot about, \u201cWe get it. We know we screwed up here and we want to fix it, and we\u2019re going to be a more responsible actor in the space.\u201d\nIt was just, sort of, to set the stage for what he said the next day.\nHe\u2019s not a real small-talk kind of guy. We joked a little bit because he was wearing a suit and tie. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen him in a suit and tie before, so we made some observations about that. He kind of smiled and laughed and said it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d worn a suit and tie, or something to that effect. It was like, \u201cSo, where\u2019s the hoodie?\u201d\nAt the public hearing on April 10, Mr. Zuckerberg says Facebook takes responsibility for its mistakes and will fix its problems.\nWe\u2019re not exactly sure what he meant by all that, because this is still an evolving story and there\u2019s still a lot of hands to play here. But I think he \u2014 at least in that meeting and at the subsequent hearing \u2014 was, I thought, very direct, very transparent, and genuinely sorrowful about what had happened and wanted to make it right.\nOn April 11, Mr. Zuckerberg testifies in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nRepresentative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee:We do what we normally do doing these investigations. You send a letter, you ask specific questions, you set a deadline. And like some groups try to do, they send in staff or attorneys. And in this case, they send in staff or attorneys who said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there then. Oh, I can\u2019t answer that. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t there then.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t answer any of them. Because they couldn\u2019t, they said. Because they weren\u2019t there when X happened or Y happened. Well, that just made the case that we better know who was there. And who was in charge. And that\u2019d be Mark Zuckerberg.\nAfter the first break, I went back with him, and we were talking, and he was astonished at some of the comments and opening statements by the Democrats.\nJust, \u201cAre they always that way?\u201d Kind of partisan. I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d It was one of those epiphany moments, I think, for him about where this could all head.\nAs told to David McCabe\n\n\nAs told toAdam Satariano\nThe European Union enactsthe General Data Protection Regulation, which provides sweeping new rights to keep companies from collecting and sharing personal data without an individual\u2019s consent.\nHelen Dixon, Ireland\u2019s data commissioner:We\u2019d had a European-wide data protection law since 1995, but that was before the internet took off, pre the smartphone and pre many of the major apps and platforms that were to come in the 10 to 20 years that followed.\nIt didn\u2019t address social media and platforms. It was a law that required upgrading so that it could better regulate Big Tech.\nVeraJourova,European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, and a politician from the Czech Republic:My impression as somebody who lived half of their life in a totalitarian regime was that, in digital, the rights of the individual, and their ability to have under control their privacy, is very limited. I felt like people moved their lives to the digital sphere, but they didn\u2019t bring their rights with them.\nWith G.D.P.R., I knew we\u2019re doing something really big and something revolutionary. There must be respect of every individual that he or she must have the possibility to be the master of his or her privacy.\nMs. Dixon:In March 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica story broke, it really opened up the minds of the public, politicians and others to the clear dangers of the misuse of personal data. That was a real turning point.\nMs. Jourova:G.D.P.R. is an exercise of rebalancing power. I see it not only in terms of data protection, but also when we speak about the harmful content of the digital industry \u2014 distributing terrorist content or child pornography or hate speech or disinformation that has the potential to distract societies and do public harm.\nMs. Dixon:We said you had to really roll back here and start looking at the user at the center of this and what their rights are. It was being taken seriously from the perspective of defending against enforcement action and avoiding fines, as opposed to going back to first principles of protecting user privacy.\nMs. Jourova:We are working intensively on exporting G.D.P.R. We have a deal with Japan now. We are advanced in negotiations with Korea. I was in Latin America some months ago. In Argentina and Chile, they are taking G.D.P.R. as a reference point. I am in intensive talks with some United States partners.\nAs told toAdam Satariano\n\n\nAs told toKate Conger\nAbout 20,000 Google workersstage protestsover how the company has givenmultimillion-dollar payoutsto a former top executive, Andy Rubin, and other senior employees accused of sexual harassment.\nClaire Stapleton, a marketing manager at YouTube and protest organizer:The curious effect of the Andy Rubin story was that people started sharing stories of their own disillusionment or difficult experiences that they had had at Google. It was a huge conversation at Google that erupted.\nI was closely following how the management responded to it, and I don\u2019t think that they met the sort of primal scream from the employee base with the accountability and urgency that we were asking for. So, I figured, you know what? Let\u2019s just make our voices a little bit louder, and even if we get 200 people to walk out, that would still make a statement.\nThat Friday night in the office, I sent an email to a group of moms at the company who had been sharing stories, with a link to a Google group for people who wanted to protest. When I woke up on Saturday morning, a couple hundred people had joined.\nThe idea of the walkout goes global.\nEach office had their own rally, their own sort of way of going about it. In Singapore, they met in the cafe; in New York, we met in a nearby park. Mountain View, Calif., the site of Google\u2019s headquarters, was obviously the biggest one, and that was on campus. It happened at 11 a.m. local time, no matter what city or office you were in.\nWe were waiting in the park there. The park filled up. We had bullhorns, but they were so insufficient to project to the amount of people who came. People were shouting, \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d People had signs.\nIt didn\u2019t necessarily feel like we were burning the place down from the inside. It felt like we were helping the company evolve.\n\nAs told toKate Conger\n\n\nAs told toKate Conger\nMeng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of its founder,is arrestedin Vancouver, British Columbia, while in transit at the airport. Her arrest by the Canadian authorities at the behest of the United States kicks off atech Cold Warwith China. Few principals are willing to discuss so sensitive a topic on the record, but the event can be reconstructed from court documents from Canadian immigration officials and law enforcement.\n11:10 a.m.:During the disembarkation process border services officer Katragadda intercepted a female Hong Kong passenger Meng, Wanzhou.\nHe had concerns in regards to her admissibility to Canada. He conducted follow-up questions with her just outside the entry of the jetway.\n(Sworn declaration of Officer Scott Kirkland, Canada Border Services Agency.)\n1 p.m.:The subject was seeking entry to transit onward to Mexico City. The subject repeatedly asked why she had been selected for secondary inspection, and on this occasion, she had posed the same question to myself.\nI asked Ms. Meng what she did for work. The subject stated that she was the chief financial officer (C.F.O.) of Huawei Technologies. The subject stated her father was the founder and current C.E.O. of the company. The subject went on to state that the company sold products in several countries around the world.\nI asked the subject if her company sold products in the United States. The subject stated, \u201cNo we do not.\u201d\n(Sworn declaration of Sanjit Dhillon, acting superintendent, Canada Border Services Agency.)\n1:15 p.m.:Ms. Meng tells me she was stopped by U.S. immigration officials in New York four years ago. According to Ms. Meng the immigration officials told her she might have an issue with her visa. The officials took her to an interview room, and looked at her electronics.\n(Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.)\n2:04 p.m.:I have Ms. Meng provide me with the phone numbers for her cellphones.\nShe provides the PIN number for both phones as well.\n(Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.)\n2:12 p.m.:Talking to Meng in CBSA secondary room.\n(Handwritten notes of Constable Dawn But, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.)\n2:14 p.m.:So because in the United States, uh, you have committed fraud, uh, we\u2019re arresting you and then you will be sent back to the United States. Right, you.\n(Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng.)\n2:21 p.m.:\u201cYou\u2019re saying, because of my company, you\u2019re arresting me,\u201d Meng Wanzhou said.\n(Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng)\n3:04 p.m.:Cst. Dhaliwal seized (1) Huawei cellphone, (1) iPhone, (1) iPad/white rose gold, (1) pink MacBook, (1) Cruzer Glide 3.0 256 GB.\n(Handwritten notes of Constable Gurvinder Dhaliwal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.)\n3:27 p.m.:Talked to company lawyer. Will find her a lawyer.\n(Handwritten notes of Constable But.)\nAs told toKate Conger\n\n\nAs told toErin Griffith\nThe ride-hailing giant\u2019sinitial public offering goes awrywhen its shares plunge on its first day of trading.\nShawn Carolan of Menlo Ventures, an Uber investor:Standing on the trading floor, everyone recognized the world-changing impact of Uber. There was a huge feeling of accomplishment. And it was emotional to be standing among many of the people who had worked to get us there.\nIt was a bit disappointing to open a bit down from the I.P.O. price, in large part because you want to see the new buyers of the stock benefit. You want them to be proud shareholders who feel lucky to be invested. It\u2019s unfortunate they weren\u2019t rewarded in the short term.\nI felt relief it was done, joy for what an amazing company Uber had become, gratitude for the whole Uber team. It was an important financing, providing cash for Uber to fund their still-big plans.\nUber\u2019s I.P.O. did affect the other unicorn I.P.O.s this year. It was a reminder to all: Public market investors care about good unit economics and a path to profitability.\nAs told toErin Griffith\n\n\nAs told toSteve Lohr\nNews breaks that theDepartment of Justice is scrutinizing Googleand whether it has used its power in anticompetitive ways, foreshadowing antitrust investigations against Big Tech companies by the Federal Trade Commission, dozens of states andCongress.\nTim Wu, a Columbia University law professor:We\u2019re witnessing the end of the long antitrust winter. After years of discussing and agonizing and asking whether Big Tech has gotten too powerful, things reached a breaking point this year.\nYou saw the first official action by federal and state agencies. And the beginning of a national conversation, which is what antitrust does at its best, as to whether Big Tech is too powerful.\nThere are many historical analogies. Antitrust is one way in which America has conversations about economic power and the size of individual companies. The original conversation on this topic surrounded Standard Oil in the 1870s through the 1890s, and that led to the passage ofthe Sherman Antitrust Act.\nThe first great trustbusting exercise, which was roughly the first 15 years of the 20th century, was much more extensive than what we\u2019re talking about now. The Gilded Age concern was that nearly every industry had been monopolized. They went after almost every monopoly in the country, and they broke up many of them.\nToday, there is a lot of market concentration in industries generally. So why focus on Big Tech in particular?\nI think there\u2019s two things. First of all, they\u2019re very visible monopolies and dominant firms. You touch and feel and sense them every day. And second, just like Standard Oil, there\u2019s a sense they have a power beyond our imagination and beyond our tolerance.\nIt comes not just from market power, but a power over the distribution of information. And from that, some apparent power over elections and how elections are contested. They\u2019re places where people share information, but also political advertising platforms. They know more about you than anyone, including the federal government.\nSo they have a particularly personal kind of power that I think people feel very sensitive to. It\u2019s almost unprecedented other than in totalitarian societies.\nMr. Wu works on a joint proposal with Scott Hemphill of New York University and Chris Hughes, a co-founderof Facebook, to break up the social network. They present it to regulators.\nI\u2019ve always felt that Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of its main competitors were exceptionally vulnerable to an antitrust challenge. Standard Oil was broken up because of its campaign to acquire its competitors. So if we wanted to revitalize the law, it struck me that easiest place to start was with Facebook.\nThe barriers to revitalizing antitrust are inertia and old habits and some degree of fear on the part of government that it will overextend itself. It was not exactly routine, but it was normal for the government to break up concentrated companies for much of its history.\nAs told toSteve Lohr\n\n\nAs told toCade Metz\nThe company achieves atechnological featthat could allow new kinds of computers to do calculations at speeds that are inconceivable with conventional equipment.\nHartmut Neven, founder of Google\u2019s quantum computing lab:An abacus and a modern digital computer are the same kind of machine. If you have a computational task \u2014 let\u2019s say multiplying \u2014 they both solve the task with the same steps.\nA quantum computer is a different beast. It can solve certain tasks with fewer steps \u2014 sometimes exponentially fewer steps.\nSergioBoixo, Google quantum computing researcher:We thought we had achieved quantum supremacy with a data set measured on April 22. The calibration had been steadily improving.\nDuring May, we were performing extensive simulations to check the data. On May 31, a Friday, we got the first results. I was quite dismayed.\nBy June 13, the preliminary checks looked better than in any previous experiment, so at that point we were pretty sure that we had achieved quantum supremacy. But we couldn\u2019t really rest until we got that email confirming we had new experimental data.\nWe got an email from a researcher in the quantum lab at 2 p.m. I was elated.\nI thought of the time when I first learned about quantum computing in college. I was mesmerized by the possibility that there existed a more efficient way to do computations than what humanity had been doing for more than 2,000 years, since the invention of the abacus. At the time, it was only a theoretical possibility. I thought I wouldn\u2019t see it realized in my lifetime.\nAs told toCade Metz\n\n\nAs told toMike IsaacandCecilia Kang\nIn a speech at Georgetown University, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, sayshis social network stands for free expressionand that he will not fact-check for truth in politicalads. Mo Elleithee of Georgetown interviews Mr. Zuckerberg after the speech.\nMr. Zuckerberg:Over the last few years, we\u2019ve had to deal with all of these different issues around content and voice, and I realized I never wrote out a full articulation of how I think about this stuff.\nMr. Elleithee, founding executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service:We were interested in doing a series of conversations on democracy in the digital age. We began soft outreach, and in the course of conversations with Facebook, we got a call from them saying, \u201cWe may have something that fits.\u201d\nFrom the second that they told us it was Mark Zuckerberg, we knew this was going to be a big moment.\nMr. Zuckerberg:So basically, the speech kind of breaks out into three sections, and it\u2019s comprehensive. That might just be another word for saying it\u2019s long.\nMr. Elleithee:Imet him for the first time the night before the speech, when he came with his team to check out the venue and did a run-through. He gave me a brief overview of what he planned to say to help me think through the Q. and A.\nMr. Zuckerberg:I hope that this is a moment to put our place in history, in perspective, but also to put some perspective around the individual decisions that we make on different types of harm and risks that come up.\nI don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with me on everything.\nMr. Elleithee:The speech was at 1 p.m. the next day, and when I showed up on campus at 8 a.m. there was already a line out the door of students waiting to get in. There were clearly students who had slept there.\nJust before Zuckerberg got onstage, I did a walk-through of the room, and I could tell from the beginning that he was going to walk into a room full of skeptics. The room was totally focused on him. You could hear a pin drop.\nYou could tell he was nervous in the beginning. But as the speech progressed, he got more comfortable.\nThe students asked tough questions. We must have had 15 cards that wanted to know, from an ethical perspective, how the company saw its responsibility when bad actors used Facebook for genocide. I don\u2019t think he was comfortable with every question, and he didn\u2019t have a good answer to that one.\n(Mr. Zuckerberg was interviewed two days before the speech.)\nAs told toMike IsaacandCecilia Kang\n"
