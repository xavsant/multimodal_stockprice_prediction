        "title": "Apple\u2019s Sales Drop Slightly While Profit Is Up 11 Percent",
        "fulltext": "At a time when the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies are rebounding from a post-pandemic dip, Apple is suffering through its most prolonged sales slump in more than a decade.\nOn Thursday, the world\u2019s most valuable tech company said that sales fell 1 percent, to $89.5 billion, from last year for the three months that ended in September, bringing an end to a fiscal year in which it posted sales declines every quarter. The company reported that profits rose 11 percent, to $22.96 billion.\nApple\u2019s most important business, the iPhone, rallied last month behind the release of four new devices, which boosted sales 3 percent, to $43.81 billion, from last year. And the company\u2019s sales for software and services, such as Apple Music and cloud storage, jumped 16 percent, to $22.31 billion.\nBut sales sank for most of the company\u2019s other businesses, including the Mac, iPad, and the Apple Watch and AirPods. Total product sales dropped by 5 percent, to $67.18 billion.\nThe results exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $89.34 billion in sales and $21.77 billion in profit. The company said that it expected sales to be similar in the current quarter to the same period a year ago, disappointing Wall Street, which had projected that sales would increase from a year ago.\nApple\u2019s shares have declined 11 percent from their peak this summer and were down more than 3 percent in after-hour trading on Thursday.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, faces a bevy of challenges in the year ahead. After a surge in demand for new 5G iPhones, wireless carriers are reporting a slowdown in the number of people buying new smartphones in the United States, Apple\u2019s largest market, according to Arete Research, an investment research firm.\nThe company said that supply constraints for the iPhone 15 in September blunted sales during the month, but that supplies were improving and would be able to fulfill demand in the current quarter.\nIn China, Apple is confronting renewed competition in the luxury smartphone business from Huawei. The Chinese smartphone maker had been hampered in recent years by U.S. restrictions on its access to 5G technology and Android software, butin August it revealed a jade-green smartphone, Mate 60 Pro, that has the same capabilities as many iPhones. Its release was followed by the Chinese government directing employees of some government agenciesto stop using iPhones for work.\nSales of Apple\u2019s new flagship iPhonesdeclined 4.5 percent during the final weeks of Septemberfrom last year, according to Counterpoint Research, which analyzes the smartphone market. The dip was an outgrowth of the broader downturn in consumer spending in China, the firm said.\nLast month, China expanded its challenge to Apple\u2019s business by launchinga regulatory review of the company\u2019s biggest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn of Taiwan. The manufacturer is facing a tax audit and being investigated over its compliance with land use regulations. The scrutiny comes as Terry Gou, Foxconn\u2019s founder, runs for Taiwan\u2019s presidency in a campaign that could boost the ruling party, which opposes closer ties with Beijing.\nMr. Cooktraveled to China last monthin an unannounced visit that included stops at an Apple store, a visit to the factory of Luxshare Precision, a Chinese iPhone manufacturer, and a meeting withWang Wentao, the country\u2019s commerce minister.\n\u201cI could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees,\u201d Mr. Cook said during a call with analysts on Thursday. He said that the company\u2019s business in China remained strong, adding that the iPhone business set a record in mainland China during the three months that ended in September.\nThe broader tech industry has been lifted by enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence. Last month,Microsoft reported that investments in A.I.were beginning to help sales of its cloud-computing business. Google\u2019s parent company,Alphabet, which has invested heavily in A.I., disappointed investors, who had hoped for a greater lift to sales. Amazon and Meta Platforms, Facebook\u2019s parent company, also emphasized their investments in that area.\nBut Apple, which is known for its secrecy, has been quiet about its plans for generative A.I. On Thursday, Mr. Cook said that the company was investing in generative A.I. but was unlikely to provide details until it had a product to bring to market. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it responsibly, and you\u2019re going to see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nAs it looks ahead to next year, much of the company\u2019s focus will shift to the release of its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality.The $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, has the potential to provide a new revenue stream at a time when sales of its other products have slowed. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units.\nThe company also is focused on reviving sales of its iPads and Macs. On Monday, Apple revealed new MacBook Pros and iMacs with speedier processors and encouraged customers with older Macs to upgrade. Sales of Macs declined 27 percent, to $29.36 billion, over the past fiscal year."

        "title": "How the Biden Administration Took the Pen Away From Meta, Google and Amazon",
        "fulltext": "One reason that the idea of free trade has fallen out of fashion in recent years is the perception that trade agreements reflect the wishes of big American corporations, at everybody else\u2019s expense.\nU.S. officials fought for trade agreements that protect intellectual property \u2014 and drug companies got the chance to extend the life of patents,raising the priceof medicine around the world. U.S. officials fought for investor protections \u2014 and mining companies got the right to sue for billions in \u201clost profit\u201d if a country moved to protect its drinking water orthe Amazon ecosystem. And for years, U.S. officials have fought for digital trade rules that allow data to move freely across national borders \u2014 prompting fears that the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies would use those rules to stay ahead of competitors and shield themselves from regulations aimed at protecting consumers and privacy.\nThat\u2019s why the Biden administration, which came into office promising to fight for trade agreements that better reflect the interests of ordinary people, has dropped its advocacy fortech-friendlydigital trade rules that American officials have championed for more than a decade.\nLast month, President Biden\u2019s trade representative, Katherine Tai, notified the World Trade Organization that the American governmentno longer supporteda proposal it once spearheaded that would have exported the American laissez-faire approach to tech. Had that proposal been adopted, it would have spared tech companies the headache of having to deal with many different domestic laws about how data must be handled, including rules mandating that it be stored or analyzed locally. It also would have largely shielded tech companies from regulations aimed atprotecting citizens\u2019 privacy and curbingmonopolistic behavior.\nThe move to drop support for that digital trade agenda has been pilloried as a disaster for American companies and a boon to China, which has a host of complicatedrestrictionsontransferring data outside of China. \u201cWe have warned for years that either the United States would write the rules for digital trade or China would,\u201d Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho,lamented in a press statement. \u201cNow, the Biden administration has decided to give China the pen.\u201d\nThe truth is that Ms. Tai is taking the pen away from Meta, Google and Amazon, which helped shape the previous policy, according to aresearch paperpublished this year by Wendy Li, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who used to answer the phone and interact with lobbyists at the U.S. trade representative\u2019s office. The paper includes redacted emails between Trump-era trade negotiators and lobbyists for Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, exchanging suggestions for the proposed text for the policy on digital trade in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \u201cWhile they were previously \u2018allergic to Washington,\u2019 as one trade negotiator described, over the course of a decade, technology companies hired lobbyists and joined trade associations with the goal of proactively influencing international trade policy,\u201d Ms. Li wrote in the Socio-Economic Review.\nThat paper explains how U.S. trade officials came to champion a digital trade policy agenda that was nearly identical to what Google, Apple and Meta wanted: No restrictions on the flow of data across borders. No forced disclosure of source codes or algorithms in the normal course of business. No laws that would curb monopolies or encourage more competition \u2014 a position that is often cloaked in clauses prohibiting discrimination against American companies. (Since so many of the monopolistic big tech players are American, rules targeting such behavior disproportionately fall on American companies, and can be portrayed as unfair barriers to trade.) This approach essentially takes the power to regulate data out of the hands of governments and gives it to technology companies,according to research by Henry Gao, a Singapore-based expert on international trade.\nWhile some of this agenda is reasonable and good for the world \u2014 too much regulation stifles innovation \u2014 adopting this agenda wholesale would risk cementing the advantages that big American tech companies already enjoy and permanently distorting the market in their favor.\nMany smaller tech companies complain that big players engage in monopolistic behavior that should be regulated. For instance,Googlehas been accused ofprivileging its own productsin search results, whileApplehas been accused of charging some developers exorbitant fees to be listed in its App Store. A group of smaller tech companies called theCoalition for App Fairnessthanked Ms. Tai for dropping support for the so-called tech-friendly agenda at the World Trade Organization.\nStill, Ms. Tai\u2019s reversal stunned American allies and foreign business leaders and upended negotiations over digital trade rules in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, one of Mr. Biden\u2019s signature initiatives in Asia.\n\u201cThe term we would use is \u2018gobsmacked,\u2019\u201d John W.H. Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe about-face was certainly abrupt: Japan, Singapore and Australia \u2014 which supported the previous U.S. position \u2014 were left on their own. It\u2019s unfortunate that U.S. allies and even some American officials were taken by surprise. But changing stances was the right call.\nThe previous American position at the World Trade Organization was a minority position. Only 34 percent of countries in the world have open data transfer policies like the United States, according toa 2021 World Bank working paper, while 57 percent have adopted policies like the European Union\u2019s, which allow data to flow freely but leave room forlaws that protect privacy and personal data. Nine percent of countries have restrictive data transfer policies, including Russia and China.\nThe United States now has an opportunity to hammer out a sensible global consensus that gives tech companies what they need \u2014 clarity, more universal rules, and relative freedom to move data across borders \u2014 without shielding them from the kinds of regulations that might be required to protect society and competition in the future.\nAs concern grows about the safety of A.I. and the power of Big Tech to freeze out competition, there are good reasons to think twice about pushing an agenda that might favor a handful of companies that have already amassed a mind-boggling amount of data and political influence.\nIf the Biden administration can shepherd a digital agreement that strikes the right balance, there\u2019s a chance that it will also restore faith in free trade by showing that trade agreements don\u2019t have to be written by the powerful at the expense of the weak.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Another Google Antitrust Battle Reaches Court in Epic Games Case",
        "fulltext": "For two months, Google has squared off against the Justice Department in court in Washington over claims that the company is abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to crush rivals, a high-stakes antitrust case that could reshape the world\u2019s most popular search engine. Now, it\u2019s facing another legal challenge closer to home.\nOn Monday, Epic Games, the company behind the hit game Fortnite, will appear in federal court in San Francisco to kick off a monthlong trial in its own antitrust lawsuit against Google. Epic is expected to argue that Google is violating both state and federal antitrust laws \u2014 as well as its founding principle, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d \u2014 by wielding monopolistic power over app developers on its Google Play Store on Android mobile phones.\n\u201cGoogle has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize,\u201d Epic wrote in its complaint, which was first filed in 2020. The video game developer had tried to bypass the Play Store\u2019s fees by letting Fortnite players pay Epic directly for in-app items,prompting Google to bar the game from the store.\nIf Epic wins, Google could be forced to alter its restrictive Play Store rules, allowing other companies to offer competing app stores and making it easier for developers to avoid the cut it collects from in-app purchases. Google generally takesa 15 percent fee for customer paymentsfor app subscriptions and 30 percent for purchases made within apps that are downloaded from the store. (The company says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases. Larger app makers like Epic must pay 30 percent.)\nThe simultaneous antitrust suits underscore how Google is playing defense on multiple fronts as regulators and competitors try to chip away at its influence over the internet.\nPart of a wider effort by tech regulators in recent years tocurb the ever-increasing power of Big Tech, the lawsuits are potentially damaging distractions for Google when it is trying to focus oncompeting with Microsoft, OpenAI and othersin the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Google makes it out of the gauntlet\u201d unscathed in the next year, said Paul Swanson, an antitrust lawyer from the firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAt some point with this many cases, one breaks against you.\u201d\nEven so, Epic faces an uphill battle. It brought similar claims against Apple in a 2021 trial that featuredsquabbling over a cartoon Fortnite bananaand the first court appearance byTim Cook as Apple\u2019s chief executive, but a federal judge rejected most of Epic\u2019s arguments.\nThis trial has key differences that make Epic think it has a shot. For one, the case will be decided by a jury rather than a judge. Epic also will point to what it believes are damning pieces of evidence, arguing that Google forced phone makers like Samsung to pre-install and promote its apps on their devices. It will argue that a Google program called Project Hug paid off some developers so they would continue using Google\u2019s payment system. Epic is also being countersued by Google, which is seeking damages.\nMr. Swanson said a jury trial could be beneficial for Epic.\n\u201cGoogle faces a much larger risk when they are up against a bunch of normal folks who are assessing their behavior versus judges assessing the behavior through a lens of a century of antitrust jurisprudence,\u201d he said.\nOver time, the antitrust claims against the Play Store have been whittled down to a one-on-one confrontation between Google and Epic. In 2021, dozens of state attorneys generalsued Google on similar grounds. Google reached a tentative settlement with the group in September. On Tuesday, Google also announced a settlement with Match Group, the dating app company, which had joined Epic\u2019s case.\n\u201cEpic wants all the benefits of Android and Google Play without having to pay for them,\u201d Wilson White, a Google vice president of public policy, said during a briefing with reporters. \u201cThe lawsuit would upend a business model that has lowered prices and increased choices.\u201d\nIn 2020, Epic antagonized Google and Apple by encouraging its customers to sidestep the tech giants and pay Epic directly for purchases made in Fortnite, the animated battle royale game. That was a violation of both companies\u2019 rules, so they kicked Fortnite out of their app stores.\nEpic responded with lawsuits and a public relations blitz that focused on Apple. Fortnite was still available on Android phones because Google allows a practice called sideloading \u2014 downloading apps from the internet outside a phone\u2019s app store.\nEpic is expected to argue that Google has made life tough on both Android phone users and app developers through a variety of means. Sideloading, Epic will argue, is an arduous process that most phone users struggle with, meaning that Google can maintain de facto control over what apps are on its phones through its Play Store restrictions. Samsung also offers an app store on its Android devices.\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Epic\u2019s, Tim Sweeney, are expected to testify.\nThis week, Mr. Pichai testified in the Justice Department\u2019s flagship antitrust suit against Google\u2019s search engine. The department and attorneys general from dozens of states accuse Google of crushing competition by paying Apple, Samsung and other partners billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default on their web browsers.\nGoogle says that it obtained the default positions because it has a superior product, and that its rivals have failed to invest in search.\nIn addition to Mr. Pichai\u2019s appearance, the case has included testimony from Google employees and executives from some of its competitors, including Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella. A ruling is likely to come in 2024.\nA federal judge in Virginia is considering a separate Justice Department lawsuit accusing Google of illegally abusing its monopoly power over the technology that delivers ads online. A trial in that case could begin as soon as next year.\nDavid McCabecontributed reporting from Washington."

        "fulltext": "When Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, suffered a dizzy spell on Wednesday, he took a precautionary trip to the hospital and learned that he had suffered a minor stroke. A day later, he said in an interview, the hospital released him and he was \u201cdoing good.\u201d\nThe health scare came during a trip to Mexico City, where Mr. Wozniak, 73, was slated to speak at a conference called the World Business Forum. The dizzy spell hit him as he was typing at his computer, he said. The hospital did an M.R.I., he added, and determined that he had a small capillary leak as well as symptoms of vertigo.\nMr. Wozniak flew home to Los Gatos, Calif., on Thursday and was waiting for dinner to be served when he talked with The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m back home and feeling good,\u201d he said.\nThe worst part of the experience, he said, was that the hospital required him to stay on a gurney for 24 hours and wouldn\u2019t let him roll onto his side. The health scare, he added, means that he will have to cancel a number of trips for speaking engagements in Dubai; Medell\u00edn, Colombia; and Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\u201cThat\u2019s life for me in the busy times,\u201d Mr. Wozniak said of the travel.\nKnown as \u201cWoz,\u201d Mr. Wozniak teamed with Steve Jobs to build thefirst Apple computer in 1976. The business they built helped popularize the personal computer and became one of the world\u2019s most influential technology companies.\nMr. Wozniak left Apple in the 1980s but has remained close to the company and regularly attends its high-profile events. His legend at Apple helped him build a huge fan base among tech enthusiasts, and his celebrity broadened beyond tech in 2009 after he became a contestant on the popular show \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the firstface-to-face meetingin a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqu\u00e9 after Wednesday\u2019s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications.\nThe San Francisco summit, and Xi\u2019s banquet with American business leaders afterward, were signs of how entwined the economies remain despite years of rising tensions \u2014 and why both sides and many U.S. companies don\u2019t want the relationship spiraling into a more serious conflict.\nBiden and Xi found room for cooperation.The leaders agreed to restart military communications that were suspended last year after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, visited Taiwan. Biden said they had made progress on curbing Chinese production of the opioid fentanyl.\nBut there was plenty they didn\u2019t agree upon.Xi complained that U.S. export controls on advanced technology, such as semiconductors, were intended to suppress China. Biden\u2019s effort to enlist Beijing as a kind of peacekeeper in the Middle East \u2014 specifically, putting pressure on Iran to not escalate the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 was unsuccessful.\nAnd the two sides didn\u2019t make much progress on systems to ban the use of artificial intelligence to manage their nuclear arsenals, agreeing only that their officials would keep talking.\nXi got a standing ovation from top American business executives.Larry Fink of BlackRock and Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone reportedly sat at theChinese leader\u2019s table. Theexclusive dinnerat the Hyatt Regency hotel also included Tim Cook of Apple, Albert Bourla of Pfizer and Ray Dalio of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. Xi\u2019s message: China is a market that\u2019s open to foreign business.\nXi wants to portray China as a friend to foreign companies \u2014 because he needs them.The Chinese economy is struggling andforeign direct investmentrecently hit a 25-year low. A meeting with American corporate leaders is agood image to projectto his audience back home.\nBut Western businesses say it\u2019s tougher to operate there, with many rethinking their supply chains or pulling out altogether.\nYet the dinner showed that many aren\u2019t ready to quit China.For all of the talk about decoupling and de-risking, \u201cChina is still enormously important for just about any multinational you can think of,\u201d Richard McGregor, a China expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based think tank, told DealBook. \u201cThey might not be investing as much, but they\u2019re not getting out. And it\u2019s a market they can\u2019t ignore and have to try and manage.\u201d\nThe DealBook Summit is on Nov. 29. Among the guests are Vice President Kamala Harris; Elon Musk of SpaceX, Tesla and X; and Jensen Huang of Nvidia. You canapply to attend here.\nIsrael and Hamas appear closer to a hostage deal.Israeli officials say the proposal would see the groupfree about 50 women and childrenin exchange for a pause in fighting and the release of roughly the same number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.\nThe Senate approves a spending bill that would keep the government open.The measure wouldkeep the federal government fundedthrough early next year, clearing the way for President Biden to sign the legislation. But the billexcludes more contentious items, including aid for Ukraine and Israel, and Congress will have to negotiate again on funding in a few months.\nAnother activist investor targets Disney.ValueAct Capital has amassed a stake in the entertainment giant, DealBook hears, confirming areport by 13D Monitor. It joins Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian in seeking to shake up Disney amid investor dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s performance.\nMicrosoft introduces its own A.I. chips.The semiconductors, which will be used in the company\u2019s Azure cloud data centers, are the latest effort by the tech industry to reduce its dependence on chips from Nvidia for their artificial intelligence applications. Shares in Arm, whose designs are powering the Microsoft chips, jumped nearly 4 percent on the news on Wednesday.\nThe fate of the United Automobile Workers union\u2019s tentative contract with General Motors, won after a hard-fought strike, now looks uncertain. Workers at the automakerhave unexpectedly pushed backagainst the terms, prolonging the drama around the Detroit auto industry.\nThe final tally on the contract could be a squeaker,with results expected as soon as Thursday. Veteran G.M. workers have opposed the deal, which would raise the top wage by 25 percent, to more than $40 per hour over the next four and a half years, as well as offer cost-of-living adjustments and more generous pension and retirement plans.\nA majority of workers at several G.M. plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the proposal, while those at a large sport utility vehicle plant in Arlington, Texas, voted yes. (A simple majority is needed for ratification.)\nOne G.M. worker told The Times that he rejected the agreement because it didn\u2019t include retiree health benefits. \u201cI\u2019m not voting yes on any contract that doesn\u2019t have that in it because I don\u2019t need the health care when I\u2019m 25 \u2014 I\u2019m 65,\u201d he said.\nWorkers at Ford and Stellantis seem set to approve the deal.That appears to validate the U.A.W.\u2019s decision to strike at all three automakers this fall to exert more pressure, creating a work stoppage that cost the companiesbillions of dollars.\nThathardball strategy, coupled with similarly tough moves by unions of Hollywood screenwriters and actors, helped workers in both industries achieve some of their biggest wage gains and benefits increases in decades.\nBut those concessions won\u2019t matter if union members won\u2019t accept them.That could create issues for the U.A.W. as well as G.M. Shawn Fain, the union\u2019s president, has hoped to build on the victory by seeking to organize workers at nonunionized automakerslike Tesla and Toyota.\nThe White House could also suffer blowback.President Biden has embraced a pro-union stance as part of his 2024 re-election campaign, including by taking the extraordinary step of joining its picket line in September. Last week,he joined Fainat a Stellantis factory in Illinois, where \u2014 wearing a U.A.W. T-shirt \u2014 he lauded the union\u2019s gains.\nBut his position could become thorny if G.M. workers reject their union\u2019s deal. And any disruption that arises from new labor tension could compound voters\u2019 concerns about his handling of the economy.\nAs corporate America rushes tostand up against antisemitismamid the Israel-Hamas war, Elon Musk is taking a different tack.\nThe billionaire on Wednesday reignited concerns about hisefforts to combat antisemitismwith aseries of replies to posts on X, the social network he owns, criticizing the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, and seemingly endorsing a claim that some Jewish communities are pushing hate speech.\n\u201cYou have said the truth,\u201dMusk wrote in a reply to an X post that said Jewish communities \u201chave been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\u201d (The author of the original post has since limited who can see it.)\nMusk added, without citing evidence, that the A.D.L. \u201cunjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel.\u201d He later said that not all Jewish communities promote hate, but reiterated that the A.D.L. and similar groups are pushing \u201cde facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind.\u201d\nThe A.D.L., which did not appear to respond to Musk\u2019s latest charge, on Wednesdaycalled outthe \u201crecord levels\u201d of hate speech generated in online forums and social media.\nIt\u2019s the latest instance of Musk taking aim at the A.D.L.,which is one of several groups cataloging hate speech on X. The social network has faced criticism over asurge in racist, antisemitic and other harmful contentsince Musk took over last year, charges thatthe tech mogul has strongly disputed. \u201cThe @ADL has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic,\u201dhe wrote in September. He later threatened to sue the organization for hurting X\u2019s revenue; the two sideslater backed down.\nThe controversy is unlikely to help X\u2019s already embattled business,which many advertisers had abandoned after upheaval at the company and a weakening of its content moderation teams and policies. Last month, X disclosed that it nowvalued itself at $19 billion, a fraction of the $44 billion that Musk paid for the company.\nIn other Musk news:He denieda report by Bloomberg that SpaceX was weighing aninitial public offering of its Starlinksatellite internet service as soon as next year.\nDeals\nEY named Janet Truncaleas its next global C.E.O., making her the first woman to lead a Big Four accounting firm.

        "title": "\u2018Vague\u2019 iPhone Alert Triggers Serious Accusations of Spying in India",
        "fulltext": "More than a dozen iPhones across India buzzed with the same message earlier this week. Each notification sounded its own little alarm, but was amplified many times over when the targets identified themselves publicly. Most were prominent political opponents of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.\nThe warning on their phones, sent by Apple on Monday, seemed stark: \u201cState-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone,\u201d it said in part. But these so-called threat notifications could, by Apple\u2019s own admission, be a false alarm, and Mr. Modi\u2019s government dismissed allegations that it was spying on the opposition, journalists and critics, as some speculated.\nNow in power for nearly a decade, Mr. Modi and his government have consolidated power bycracking down on free speech,undermining the independent pressand silencing dissenting voices, includingthose in the opposition. This week\u2019s episode seemed to fit into that pattern for his critics and many who got the warning from Apple. And, they said, the surveillance suggested by the alert would help the governing party in getting an upper hand on rivals ahead of next year\u2019s election.\nRahul Gandhi, the foremost opposition leader, said many of his confidants in the Congress Party received the notification. Mr. Gandhi added that he takes illegal surveillance by the government for granted. At a news conference, he said, \u201cWe are not scared. You can do as much phone-tapping as you want, I don\u2019t care.\u201d This tussle is a distraction, he said, from the government\u2019s most serious failings, like corruption.\nAshwini Vaishnaw, India\u2019s minister of communications, electronics and I.T., dismissed the allegations of spying as complaints from \u201ccompulsive critics,\u201d making it plain that he meant Mr. Gandhi in particular. He, too, called it a distraction, adding that the government would investigate the matter even as he urged the public to ignore the \u201cvague\u201d notifications.\nBut Sriram Karri, a newspaper editor in the southern city of Hyderabad, said this was the fourth such alert he had received in two years. This time, he said, he \u201cfreaked out\u201d and feared \u201cvery political\u201d motives.\n\u201cOne feels breached, that not just your calls, but someone has access to all of the data on your phone including photos and videos,\u201d Mr. Karri said.\nApple started sending the threat notifications in 2019, after the widespread use of Pegasus, a spyware program developed by NSO, an Israeli cyber-intelligence company, became public. NSO\u2019s clients included governments around the world who used Pegasus to sneak into the phones of dissidents and opponents. One of those customers,The Times reportedlast year, was India. Pegasus was a centerpiece of a $2 billion defense package that it bought from Israel in 2017.\nSome independent researchers in India have reported evidence of Pegasus infections on their phones. A committee formed by India\u2019s Supreme Court to investigate those reports disbanded last year, noting that \u201cthe government of India has not cooperated.\u201d\nThe human rights group Amnesty International played a crucial role in uncovering the global scale of Pegasus spyware. In a statement, Likhita Banerji, a technology and human rights researcher at the group, said that the cause of the Apple notifications \u201cappears to be yet another surveillance scandal.\u201d She added: \u201cIn India, reports of prominent journalists and opposition leaders receiving the Apple notifications are particularly concerning in the months leading up to state and national general elections.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Apple confirmed that it was the source of the alerts in India. But its public statements, like the Indian government\u2019s, had the effect of minimizing the warnings\u2019 impact. The notifications were based on \u201cintelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete,\u201d the company said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms.\u201d And they must remain vague in order to avoid helping \u201cstate-sponsored attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future.\u201d\nThe company also said that it has sent out these notifications in nearly 150 countries since it started alerting potential victims.\nFor Mishi Choudhary, a lawyer who started an organization in Indiadefending the rights of internet users and software developers, the episode stood out because only opposition figures appeared to have received it. \u201cThis was not a run-of-the-mill security breach,\u201d she said.\nIn recent years, Apple has set up a high-stakes position in India as the country\u2019s economy has grown to the fifth-largest in the world. It has moved more forcefully into India\u2019s consumer market,opening Apple Storesand challenging the dominance of the Android platform.\nAt the same time, Apple has become more important to India\u2019s government. It is by far the most prominent company to have joined a government campaign to increase manufacturing in the country. India\u2019s Tata Sons and Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn have bought and built factories that are churning out more and more high-end iPhones at the same time that Apple is eager to reduce its dependence on China as a manufacturing hub."

        "title": "Apple Is Doing Its Part to End Green Bubble Shaming. It\u2019s Our Turn.",
        "fulltext": "For more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have faced a major problem in how we communicate: the \u201cgreen versus blue bubble\u201d disparity.\nWhen iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.\nOver time, the annoyance and frustration that built up between blue and green bubbles evolved into more than a tech problem. It created a deeper sociological divide between people who judged one another by their phones. The color of a bubble became a symbol that some believe reflects status and wealth, given a perception that only wealthy people buy iPhones.\nNow part of this problem will soon be addressed.\nThis month, Apple announced that it wouldimprove the technologyused to send texts between iPhone and Android users, starting next year, by adopting a standard that Google and others integrated into their messaging apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will look higher-quality and security features like encryption may eventually arrive, Apple said.\nBut that\u2019s where the good news ends. The bubble culture war is far from over.\nOn dating apps,green-bubble users are often rejected by the blues. Adults with iPhones have been known to privately snicker to one another when a green bubble taints a group chat. In schools, a green bubble is an invitation for mockery and exclusion by children with iPhones, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology\u2019s impact on families.\n\u201cThis green-versus-blue issue is a form of cyberbullying,\u201d said Jim Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense, which works with thousands of schools that have shared stories about tensions among children using messaging apps.\nThat means it\u2019s now on us to do better and tamp down digital elitism. The solutions, including third-party messaging apps that work consistently between different phones, have been around for years. The rest is about modifying our behavior.\nTech companies are well aware of the power of defaults. Whatever technology comes loaded on a device is what the vast majority of people are likely to use, because it requires the least amount of effort. The reason that we confront the blue-versus-green bubble issue is that we stick to the default texting app that is tied to our phone numbers.\nYet we have options. Third-party messaging apps likeWhatsApp and Signalhave bridged the gap between iPhones and Androids for years. They link user accounts to phone numbers, which makes contacting people similar to using a standard text-messaging app. These apps also include features like encryption, support for group chats, the ability to send high-resolution photos and videos \u2014 and, yes, fun emojis and stickers.\nSo the next time you exchange numbers with someone on a different phone platform, consider asking the person to keep in touch through an alternate messaging app. This could be a tall order for people who are less technologically inclined, like relatives who barely know how to use their phone. In that case, lend them a hand with setting up their phones. Most Android phones, for example, can be modified toautomatically send and receive all messagesfrom a third-party app.\nIf third-party apps don\u2019t sound appealing, there are other avenues for texting. Plenty of younger people congregate on apps like Discord, Snapchat and Instagram, which have messaging abilities that work consistently between different types of phones.\nIt comes down to whether you care more about your tech preferences or about your relationships with people, said Irina Raicu, an internet ethics director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.\n\u201cSmooth and easy means without any friction or any effort, but sometimes you might need to make more effort just because somebody has a different phone than you,\u201d she said. \u201cRelationships require effort.\u201d\nIn apopular memeon TikTok and YouTube, a man poses a question to random women on the street: \u201cHe\u2019s a 10, but he has an Android phone. What\u2019s his new rating?\u201d Most women respond with \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d and make comments along the lines of \u201cThe green bubble, not good \u2014 it\u2019s, like, cheap.\u201d\nLet\u2019s zoom in on the stereotype. It\u2019s true that Android phones can be more affordable than iPhones because various companies make a wider range of them, including budget models that cost as little as $100. But the top-selling Android phone brand, Samsung, makes flagship Galaxy phones that cost $800 to $1,100, or roughly the same as Apple\u2019s iPhones.\nThere\u2019s also no evidence that everyone buying iPhones is wealthy. One in five Americans believes that a new iPhone is worth going into debt for, according to a survey byWalletHub, a personal finance research firm.\nPeople choose their phones for various reasons, including features like screen size, camera quality and battery life. While budget may be a factor, a green bubble is not a strong indicator of a person\u2019s income or social status.\nIn social gatherings, plenty of adults still fuss about the colors of bubbles. When a text conversation turns green, not only do photos and videos look terrible but fun features like adding stickers to messages no longer work properly, and it becomes impossible to leave a group chat. (Messages rendered as green bubbles also lack encryption, an important privacy feature, though this isn\u2019t usually what people fuss about.)\nThese complaints can influence our children to behave in more negative ways, Mr. Steyer said. For several years, teenagers with Android phones have shared stories about converting to iPhones because they werebeing left out of iMessage group chatsabout homework and extracurricular activities.\nThe onus is on adults to demonstrate to children that many of these tech issues can be addressed \u2014 and to remind them that a person\u2019s phone is just a phone, not much more.\nThose adults should include the executives of Apple and Google, who have leaned into the bubble war to try to persuade users to join their platforms, Mr. Steyer said.\nAt a tech conference last year featuring Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, an iPhone user in the audience asked whether Apple would make improvements to its messaging app so he could send clearer videos to his mother, who used an Android phone. Mr. Cook flippantly told the questioner tobuy his mother an iPhone, a response that many critics deemed elitist.\nApple and Google declined to comment.\n\u201cRise above this \u2014 show some maturity here,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to bully or shame other people over the color of their bubble or the type of their phone.\u201d"

        "title": "The Long Shadow of Steve Jobs Looms Over the Turmoil at OpenAI",
        "fulltext": "Steve Jobs, driven by his genius and his gut, invented the iPhone and built Apple into the world\u2019s most valuable company. He was uncompromising, larger than life and irreplaceable. His life was creating the future, which would be filled with devices controlled by their users.\nSam Altman spent the last year taking on the mantle of Mr. Jobs as the Silicon Valley entrepreneur in charge of tomorrow. It is the biggest job in Silicon Valley, and now the most difficult. As more people worry they will be controlled rather than in control, the future is fraught with danger.\nUntil Friday, Mr. Altman was the chief executive of OpenAI, the dominant artificial intelligence company. He promised A.I. would usher in humanity\u2019s first golden age even though it came from the same kind of inventors who thought there was a market forinternet-connected toasters.\nMr. Altman\u2019s vague but vast ambitions got him in trouble with the board of OpenAI, which said he was \u201cnot consistently candid\u201d in his communications and fired him. This shocked Silicon Valley, which did everything but march to the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters with pitchforks to demand Mr. Altman\u2019s reinstatement. The future is abstract, but serious money was at risk.\nThe attempt at a reinstatement apparently failed \u2014 this is an ongoing saga \u2014 but the last few days deepened the parallels to Mr. Jobs, who was marginalized by the board of Apple in 1985. Apple was faltering, and Mr. Jobs was not exactly a model employee. He left the company of which he was a founder and the personal computer industry he championed.\nEleven years later, with Apple even worse off,Mr. Jobs returned. It was the greatest second act in American business history. Apple is now worth $3 trillion.\nThe career of Mr. Jobs, who died in 2011, presents tech founders with an enticing but perhaps impossible comparison. There are many clich\u00e9s about Silicon Valley that Silicon Valley likes to believe are true, including \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money\u201d and \u201cMove fast and break things\u201d and \u201cThree people are building something in a garage that will be the next Google.\u201d\nOne of the most persistent clich\u00e9s is that of the visionary founder \u2014 the executive who can reach into the future, break off a piece and make it into something that the masses adore. Do this right and your company will be worth a trillion dollars. Do it wrong and you have an overpriced toaster.\nThe legend of the visionary founder didn\u2019t start with Mr. Jobs, but he pushed it to a new level. \u201cHe seemed to be able to see slightly beyond the horizon when other people couldn\u2019t see beyond the end of their nose,\u201d Michael Moritz, an Apple historian who later became a venture capitalist,told The New York Timesin 1985.\nIt was a description Mr. Jobs himself came to embrace. \u201cSome people say, \u2018Give the customers what they want,\u2019\u201d he said, in one of his most-quoted statements. \u201cBut that\u2019s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they\u2019re going to want before they do.\u201d\nMr. Jobs made it look easy.A little devicethat holds a thousand songs? Sold. But even with something as simple to understand as self-driving cars, what people are going to want is not quite clear.\nAs Mr. Altman was unsuccessfully negotiating Sunday to get his job back, theresignation of Kyle Vogtas chief executive of Cruise, General Motors\u2019 self-driving-car division, was announced. His departure was prompted by a nightmarish sequence of events last month when a woman in San Francisco who had just been the victim of a hit-and-run was then run over by a Cruise robotaxi. Cruise\u2019s license to operate in California was suspended after the accident.\nMr. Vogt was a co-founder of Cruise, which G.M. bought in 2016, and was a principal architect of its success in a once-crowded field of autonomous start-ups. His hard-charging ways are now a liability, which made his exit an inevitability. Self-driving advocates can argue that many more people are injured by human drivers than autonomous vehicles, but there is something deeply unsettling about a car that seems to go rogue.\nMr. Vogt was replaced by two G.M. insiders, one of them its general counsel. It was a pointed message: This is not a moment for visionary leaders.\nFor all the relentless exaltation of Mr. Altman over the weekend, the extravagant claims made by him and his former OpenAI colleagues will eventually have their own moment of reckoning. A.I. \u201cis going to be the greatest force for economic empowerment and a lot of people getting rich we have ever seen,\u201dhe said in February.People are going to ask: Who is getting rich, exactly? Did I want this?\nBefore a version of ChatGPT was released to the public a year ago, Mr. Altman was largely unknown beyond Silicon Valley. He was a semi-successful entrepreneur who had run Y Combinator, the start-up incubator. He learned there that turmoil always lurked underneath a promising new company. \u201cStart-ups on the inside arealways badly broken,\u201d he said.\nMr. Altman had the reputation of a swashbuckler. He wroteon his blog in 2017that he felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in communist Beijing than in liberal San Francisco. Maybe he was thinking of the time in 2015 whenhe said at a conferencethat \u201cA.I. will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there\u2019ll be great companies.\u201d\nAre the world\u2019s peoplegoing to get their eyeballs scannedin return for some fake currency and vague promises that their retinas will be used, somehow, someday, by someone to help prove they really exist? That was one of Mr. Altman\u2019s side bets, introduced this summer. Even as it was mocked, he declared that \u201cwe especially love our haters, it gives us energy, please keep it coming!\u201d\nHundreds of OpenAI employees signed a letter Monday demanding Mr. Altman\u2019s return. On Friday, it was one of the most important companies in Silicon Valley; on Monday morning, most of its employees were threatening to quit. Mr. Altman is the visionary founder who can save them, and OpenAI, and perhaps all mankind.\nThis superhero narrative is the secret engine of just about every book beloved by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber, was a devotee of Ayn Rand, whose heroes are at war with society. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was a childhood fan of \u201cStar Trek,\u201d where Captain Kirk made every decision and took charge of every landing party. Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist who backed Donald J. Trump in 2016, loves \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d an epic tale where a handful of heroes save the world. Mr. Thiel\u2019s corporate names (Palantir, Mithril, Valar) are taken from the story.\nMr. Altman, to his credit, has endorseda wide reading listthat goes beyond books written by his friends in Silicon Valley, like Mr. Thiel. He recommended another Valley favorite, Isaac Asimov\u2019s \u201cFoundation\u201d science fiction series, which is once again about how a charismatic and farseeing savant and his mostly male acolytes can save everyone, in this case 25 million planets.\nBut the path to becoming a real-life Gandalf or Captain Picard is strewn with peril.\nElizabeth Holmes of Theranos modeled herself on Mr. Jobs. When she couldn\u2019t get her blood-testing technology to work, she simply pretended it did. Adam Neumann promised to reinvent the office experience with WeWork. It declared bankruptcy two weeks ago, although Mr. Neumann did manage to become rich. Sam Bankman-Fried, the bright promise of cryptocurrency, will be sentenced in March for fraud. Elon Musk has not helped his reputation or his bank account by buying Twitter, now called X.\nFor Mr. Altman, this past weekend may have been a personal peak. For all the talk of A.I. taking jobs, he suddenly became the one essential person in all technology. Apost on Xby Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, captured some of the mood, and never mind that Google is in a fierce competition with OpenAI:\n\u201cSam Altman is a hero of mine. He built a company from nothing to $90 Billion in value, and changed our collective world forever. I can\u2019t wait to see what he does next. I, and billions of people, will benefit from his future work \u2014 it\u2019s going to be simply incredible.\u201d\nThis is Jobs-level praise. Perhaps wisely, Mr. Altman scorned all the offers he was getting to fund his next start-up. Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI, announced late Sunday that he would be coming there. He\u2019ll work for others now."

        "fulltext": "The blowback over Elon Musk\u2019sendorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theoryon X gathered steam on Friday, as several major advertisers on his social media platform cut off their spending after his comments.\nDisney said it was pausing spending on X, as did Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS. Apple, whichspends tens of millions of dollars a year on X, also suspended advertising on the platform, a person with knowledge of the situation said. They followed IBM, whichcut its spendingwith X on Thursday.\nMr. Musk, whobought Twitter last yearand renamed it X, has been under scrutiny for months for allowing and even stoking antisemitic abuse on the site. That snowballed on Wednesday when the tech billionaire agreed with a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the \u201cexact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them\u201d and supporting the immigration of \u201chordes of minorities.\u201d\n\u201cYou have said the actual truth,\u201d Mr. Muskreplied.\nJewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known asreplacement theory, a conspiracy theory that posits that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online beforekilling 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburghin 2018.\nOn Friday, the White House condemned Mr. Musk, 52, for boosting the anti-Jewish conspiracy theory. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was \u201cunacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\u201d\nAn X spokesman declined to comment on the advertising pauses, and Apple didn\u2019t respond.Axiosreported earlier on Apple\u2019s decision, andBloombergreported earlier on the Lionsgate suspension.\nLinda Yaccarino, X\u2019s chief executive,posted on the siteon Thursday that the company had been \u201cextremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.\u201d But on Friday, Mr. Musk agreed with a post on X that suggested advertisers like IBM were pulling back from the platform to save face.\nHe latersaidaccounts that made \u201cclear calls for extreme violence\" would be suspended, highlighting two phrases associated with Palestinian supporters that would not be tolerated on the site.\nAdvertisers have been skittish about X since Mr. Musk bought the social media service last fall and said he wanted more free speech and would loosen content moderation rules. That meant the platform could theoretically place brands\u2019 ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.\nMany companies, including General Motors and Volkswagen, have balked at various points over the past year at having their promotions appear alongside aheavily documented surgein hate speech, misinformation and foreign propaganda on X. In April, Mr. Musk saidnearly all advertisershad returned, without indicating whether they were spending at the same levels; he later noted that ad revenue had fallen 50 percent.\nMr. Musk also swung from threatening any advertisers that dared to pause their spending with a \u201cthermonuclear name & shame\u201d to wooing them by choosing Ms. Yaccarino, a former top ad executive at NBCUniversal, to replace him as chief executive. He picked public fights with major spenders like Apple andchurned throughsales executives given the task of maintaining relationships in the advertising industry.Top advertising companies, such as IPG, urged their clients to step back from X.\nAdvertising had long been about 90 percent of Twitter\u2019s revenue before Mr. Musk bought the company. Last month, X told employees that the company wasvalued at $19 billion. That was down from the $44 billion that Mr. Musk paid.\nThe heightened sensitivity around antisemitism, Mr. Musk\u2019s penchant for public squabbling and general fatigue after months of fuss over X left many advertising professionals hesitant to weigh in on Friday.\n\u201cClients have always had to make decisions about content they will or will not be associated with,\u201d Renee Miller, the founder of the Miller Group advertising agency in Los Angeles, said in an email. \u201cWe generally counsel our clients to not take an openly public political stand.\u201d\nIBM, which cut off about $1 million in advertising spending that it had committed to X for the rest of the year, said on Thursday that it had \u201czero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination.\u201d The tech company acted aftera reportthis week from Media Matters for America, a left-wing advocacy group, which said ads from companies including Apple and IBM were appearing on X next to posts supporting white nationalism and Nazism.\nMr. Muskpostedlate Thursday that \u201cMedia Matters is an evil organization.\u201d\nAngelo Carusone, president and chief executive of Media Matters, said Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201ccalling us evil\u201d for pointing out what was on X was \u201cnot dissimilar from any right-wing account who we highlight.\u201d\nHe added that X was \u201cnot just going to just lose money with Apple, but also the cornerstone of their strategy to woo back advertisers.\u201d\nKate Congercontributed reporting."

        "title": "You Paid $1,000 for an iPhone, but Apple Still Controls It",
        "fulltext": "For a decade, it was easy to get help repairing an iPhone. Cracked screens could be replaced in minutes, and broken cameras could be exchanged without a hitch.\nBut since 2017, iPhone repairs have been a minefield. New batteries can trigger warning messages, replacement screens can disable a phone\u2019s brightness settings, and substitute selfie cameras can malfunction.\nThe breakdowns are an outgrowth of Apple\u2019s practice of writing software that gives it control over iPhones even after someone has bought one. Unlike cars, which can be repaired with generic parts by auto shops and do-it-yourself mechanics, new iPhones are coded to recognize the serial numbers for original components and may malfunction if the parts are changed.\nThis year, seven iPhone parts can trigger issues during repairs, up from three in 2017, when the company introduced a facial recognition system to unlock the device, according to iFixit, a company that analyzes iPhone components and sells parts for do-it-yourself repairs. The rate at which parts can cause breakdowns has been rising about 20 percent a year since 2016, when only one repair caused a problem.\nIn a series of tests, iFixit determines which parts cause issues when swapped between working iPhones of the same model. The results reveal that the number of malfunctions has increased with later iPhone generations.\n\nPart doesn\u2019t work as expected when swapped with the same working part from an identical, new\n\t\t\t\tiPhone.\n\nSometimes stops working as expected when swapped, sometimes fine.\nWarning\nPersistent alerts after swap.\nNote: Data reflects the iOS update 17.1; tested on Oct. 29, 2023. For the iPhone 15, only the Pro Max version has been tested. LIDAR is available only in the Pro and Pro Max versions of each applicable phone.\nSource: iFixit\nThe software phenomenon, which is known as parts pairing, has encouraged Apple customers to turn to its stores or authorized repair centers, which charge higher prices for parts and labor. In recent years, only approved parts and sanctioned repairs have avoided the problems. Replacing a shattered screen typically costs nearly $300, about $100 more than work done by an independent shop using a third-party screen.\nTo put it another way: The cost of replacing a cracked screen on a year-old iPhone 14 is nearly equivalent to the phone\u2019s value, which Apple appraises at $430 in trade-in credit.\nApple\u2019s grip on the repairs creates an incentive for customers to spend up to $200 on device insurance, known as AppleCare, which provides free battery replacements and screen repairs. Apple collects an estimated $9 billion annually for the service.\nIt has also spurred questions about Apple\u2019s commitment to sustainability, with independent repair advocates saying the company could more effectively meet its goals ofreducing carbon emissionsby lowering repair costs to encourage people to maintain devices rather than buy new ones.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company supported a customer\u2019s right to repair a device and had created a self-service repair program to help. \u201cWe have been innovating to offer our customers the best choice and options when their product needs service,\u201d he said.\nState lawmakers from New York to California have responded with laws that aim to make repairs easier. TheBiden administration has encouraged the Federal Trade Commissionto advance rules that would stop smartphone makers from restricting independent repairs. But most of the regulations don\u2019t include explicit restrictions on parts pairing.\nSource: iFixit | Note: Phones are not shown to scale. The\niPhone 15 shown is a Pro Max.

The Taptic Engine\nsometimes stops working when replaced and sometimes does not.\nThe iPhone 7, released in 2016, has been lauded as the last easily repairable model.\nIt has only one function \u2014 Touch ID \u2014 that stops working when the home button of the phone is replaced in a non-Apple-authorized repair.\nThe release of the iPhone X in 2017 represented a significant shift in the design of iPhones. Parts pairing increased, and more parts, including the front display and the front-facing camera, stopped working correctly when replaced.\nApple\u2019s latest phone, the iPhone 15, has more features and, with them, more parts pairing.\nUsing software to control repairs has become commonplace across electronics, appliances and heavy machinery as faster chips and cheaper memory turn everyday products into miniature computers. HP has used a similar practice to encourage people to buy its ink cartridges over lower-priced alternatives. Tesla has incorporated it into many cars. And John Deere has put it in farm equipment, disabling machines that aren\u2019t fixed by company repair workers.\nApple and other companies have defended the practice by saying it protects customers\u2019 safety and the company\u2019s brand. Shoddy parts, like a faulty face scanner, could compromise the phone\u2019s security, and if an independent shop messes up a repair, the customer often blames Apple instead of the shop, the company has said. The practice also allows Apple to create a record of parts in the device, which can be helpful to buyers of secondhand phones.\nBut the increase of pairing parts with software has animated a movement that wants to make repairs cheaper and easier. Proponents, which include iFixit, say it would be better for the environment and customers\u2019 wallets to extend the life of devices. They have urged lawmakers to simplify repairs, asking: \u201cWho owns the device after it\u2019s been purchased? The customer or the manufacturer?\u201d\n\u201cYou basically have to ask permission before doing a repair,\u201d said Nathan Proctor, who has lobbied states for repair legislation on behalf of U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit largely funded by small donors.\nWhen Apple expanded its software limits in 2017, it upended repair businesses. Shakeel Taiyab said iPhone repairs at his independent shop in South San Francisco had decreased about 15 percent this year. Some customers with issues like cracked screens keep using the phones because they find repairing or replacing it unaffordable.\nFree Geek, a nonprofit based in Portland, Ore., that donates repaired computers and smartphones to underprivileged people, decided that Apple\u2019s software made iPhones too difficult to service, said Amber Brink, Free Geek\u2019s director of technology.\nLast year, Free Geek received thousands of donated iPhones but repurposed only 280, Ms. Brink said. \u201cIt\u2019s a headache,\u201d she added.\nConsumers who opt against paying top dollar for an Apple-authorized repair may suffer the consequences. In February, after Gio Grimaldi, a 15-year-old in New Hampshire, shattered the screen of his iPhone SE on a snowboarding trip, he took it to a nearby repair shop.\nHe said the closest Apple Store was 90 minutes away and had quoted $130 for replacing the screen \u2014 40 percent higher than the independent store. When he took the phone home, it worked fine but was lacking True Tone, a software feature that adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness and color to match the ambient lighting.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just plain stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cI always love Apple as a company, but they\u2019re really stuck up about third-party repairs.\u201d\nOver the past year, New York, Minnesota and California passed bills requiring that electronics manufacturers provide parts, tools and manuals to third parties.\nAfter years of lobbying against such rules, Apple signed on to support California\u2019s law and honor it across the United States. It has also encouraged the federal government to adopt similar rules, said Brian Naumann, the head of Apple\u2019s repair service efforts, who spoke about the right to repairsduring a White House event last month.\n\u201cApple has taken significant steps to expand options for consumers to repair their devices, which we know is good for consumers\u2019 budgets and good for the environment,\u201d Mr. Naumann said.\nBut the California legislation failed to directly address Apple\u2019s practice of using software to control the repair process. In Oregon, State Senator Janeen Sollman, a Democrat representing an area outside Portland, is part of agroup of lawmakers aiming to pass a state lawthat would prohibit Apple and others from having restrictions on repairs.\nAs the Oregon legislation has progressed, Apple has encouraged lawmakers to scale it back. Apple paid for a half dozen legislators to visit its Silicon Valley headquarters this year, and tried to impress on them how important security and safety were to repairs, Ms. Sollman said.\nShe left California unpersuaded. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re making it more accessible, but it\u2019s not a true right to repair if you have ultimate control,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sollman said."
