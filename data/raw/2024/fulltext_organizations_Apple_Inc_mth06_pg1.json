        "fulltext": "Move over, Microsoft and Apple. The stock market has a new king.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia leapfrogged two of tech\u2019s most storied names to become the world\u2019s most valuable public company, according to data from S&P Global. Its ascent has been powered by the boom in generative artificial intelligence and surging demand for the company\u2019s chips \u2014 known as graphics processing units, or GPUs \u2014 which have made it possible to create A.I. systems.\nNvidia\u2019s rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company\u2019s market valuation was a little over $400 billion. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s share price rose 3.6 percent, lifting its value to $3.34 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chip maker.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent is a testament to how much artificial intelligence has upended the world\u2019s biggest companies. The rise of the powerful technology first elevated Microsoft to the biggest market capitalizationin January, dethroning Apple, before pushing Nvidia to take the crown. Last week, Apple said it, too, wasgetting into the A.I. gameand will add the technology to its products, including the iPhone, this fall.\nYears before other big chip companies, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jensen Huang, bet that GPUs would be essential to building artificial intelligence, and he tailored his company to accommodate what he believed would be tech\u2019s next big boom.\nHis big bet is paying off. By some measurements, Nvidia controls more than 80 percent of the market for the chips used in A.I. systems. Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers regularly jockey for orders for chips to run computers in their giant data centers, and are building their own A.I. chips so they are not so dependent on one supplier.\n\u201cNo one else fully saw or appreciated this,\u201d said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \u201cThey saw the trend, built for the trend and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has made Mr. Huang, 61, a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan early this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him tosign her chest.\nThe company\u2019s rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco\u2019s shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nThe speed at which Nvidia\u2019s value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $3 trillion company last June. Microsoft also took nearly five years to climb from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.\nNvidia\u2019s investors are betting more on its potential than on its current profits. Microsoft and Apple each generated more than $21 billion in profit during the three months that ended in March. Nvidia generated $14.88 billion in profit in its most recent quarter, which ended in April, but that was up more than 600 percent from a year earlier.\n\u201cThe numbers have gotten so big so quickly that people worry: Is this sustainable?\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cIf the return on A.I. turns out to not be there, then the whole thing comes crumbling down.\u201d\nJust 12 companies have led the S&P 500 by market valuation since the index was created in 1926: AT&T, Apple, Cisco, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Walmart and now Nvidia, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nNvidia\u2019s rise has been fueled by its ability to consistently exceed Wall Street expectations. Sales in its last quartertripled from a year earlierto $26 billion. It also projected that it would double sales in the current quarter.\nNvidia sells everything from chips, and the software needed to build A.I. systems with those chips, to supercomputers. The machines, which have 35,000 parts and are packed with the company\u2019s GPUs, sell for $250,000 or more. A new supercomputer that Nvidia is bringing to the market could sell for more than $1 million, Mr. Rasgon said.\n\u201cEven though the cost of the system is going up, the performance per dollar is getting better with every generation, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re able to keep customers buying,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said.\nWall Street has been watching for signs of a slowdown.Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazonhave all developed their own chips that can be used for A.I., and traditional chip rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have tried to cut into Nvidia\u2019s business with their own A.I. processors.\nBut Mr. Huang believes that it will take time for anyone to catch up to Nvidia. The company has a decade head start and hascultivated a large communityof A.I. programmers who prefer its technology.\n\u201cWe are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\u201d Mr. Huang said in a conference call with analysts in May. \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "What\u2019s a five-letter word for an activity that media and technology companies are increasingly relying on to gain subscribers and keep them coming back?\nG\nA\nM\nE\nS\nApple released a series of word-focused puzzles in its subscription news service last fall. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, debuted a set of word games this spring. News sites including Morning Brew, The Washington Post, Vox Media and The Boston Globe have added new puzzles beyond the crossword and hired staff to work on games. The publication you are reading has also invested in a collection of brainteasers.\nIt isn\u2019t all fun and games, exactly. For media companies, games are a way to attract new customers as their sites face declining traffic from Google, X and Meta, which have backed away from emphasizing news. For tech companies with editorial offerings, the puzzles are a way to entice new subscribers while engaging existing users who may not return to the apps daily.\n\u201cA publication is more than the stories it produces. It\u2019s an experience to look forward to, a pleasure,\u201d said John Temple, a former journalist and co-founder of Amuse Labs, which sells a software platform that helps publishers create puzzles. \u201cThey want to recreate that same satisfying experience for people that they might have had over years of doing a crossword in the newspaper.\u201d\nAdding games and puzzles has become central to many publishers\u2019 strategies over the past few years, with momentum spiking in recent months as Apple and LinkedIn jumped in. As these news and tech companies vie for consumer attention against competitors like Netflix, Spotify and other forms of digital entertainment, others are likely to follow.\nMany of the games are not Call of Duty-like shooters or the next Angry Birds. They are often word or logic puzzles, which can help people feel a sense of accomplishment for exercising their intellectual muscles. For companies with editorial products, word games also aren\u2019t drastically different from their core businesses.\nThere are early signs that the games are working. At The New York Times, new subscriptions for non-news products \u2014 which include subscriptions for Games, Cooking, Wirecutter and The Athletic \u2014 surpassed new subscriptions for the core news offering in the first quarter. (The Times doesn\u2019t provide numbers for games subscriptions alone.) Apple and LinkedIn said, without giving specifics, that early results were promising.\nPublishers have a long history of adding games to their news offerings. For more than a century, newspapers included word games and brain teasers. The New York World published the first crossword on its \u201cFun\u201d page on Dec. 21, 1913.\nAn exception was The Times, whichpromoted itselfas \u201cstrictly anewspaper for intelligent, thoughtful people.\u201d That shifted after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, dragging the United States into World War II. Times editors said that because of the heavy news environment, readers might want a diversion from relentlessly bleak headlines. In February 1942, The Timesintroduced its first crossword puzzle, which became a hallmark of the paper.\nPublishers and tech platforms today have found the news cycle just as challenging, with wars in Israel-Gaza and Ukraine, as well as the looming U.S. presidential election and the culture wars that surround it. News and tech executives have sought to provide at least some refuge, however brief, from what can seem like an endless stream of bad news.\n\u201cNews and current events are often characterized by things that are intractable,\u201d said Ross Trudeau, the puzzles editor at Apple News. \u201cPuzzles are a way of saying some of these problems do have solutions \u2014 even elegant ones.\u201d\n(Mr. Trudeau comes from a lineage of media bona fides. His parents are Garry Trudeau, best known for creating the \u201cDoonesbury\u201d comic strip, and Jane Pauley, the television news anchor and journalist.)\nThe Times has had breakout games beyond its crossword puzzle. They include homespun creations like Spelling Bee, where users create as many words as possible with a handful of letters, and Connections, where people group a series of words that have a similar link. In 2022, The Timesbought Wordle, a word guessing game that was a surprise hit, from its creator, who was a Reddit engineer. The game went viral when people shared their Wordle scores on social media.\nOthers have noticed. Last fall, Apple debuted a daily set of crossword puzzles for subscribers to Apple News+, its paid subscription service that curates articles from partner publishers. (The Timesleft the programin 2020.) Last month, Apple introduced aspelling game, Quartiles, where users spell words based on a jumbled series of fragmented word tiles.\n\u201cThe more value we add to Apple News+, the more subscribers we bring in, which benefits our publishing partners,\u201d said Lauren Kern, theeditor in chief of Apple News. Apple has also integrated Apple News+ puzzles into Games Center, its gaming social network, which lets users compete with friends for top scores.\nLinkedIn followed withthree puzzle games, which are featured prominently on its website and mobile apps. Dan Roth, editor in chief at LinkedIn, said the goal was to keep the content in line with the company\u2019s \u201cprofessional network\u201d brand, while also giving people a reason to regularly return and engage in conversations, both publicly and privately on the site.\n\u201cOne of the main goals of LinkedIn is to bring people to the site, take the knowledge that\u2019s in their heads and share it with their network,\u201d Mr. Roth said in an interview. \u201cYou sometimes have to prime the pump to get people to start sharing, and adding games is a clear way to do that.\u201d\nThe companies said their approach to making games started with humans. Apple trumpeted its diverse team of puzzle makers and contributors to appeal to a broader audience, and said it tried to avoid crossword jargon in puzzle clues.\nLinkedIn hired Paolo Pasco, a longtime crossword constructor and recent Harvard graduate, as its first games editor. The Times has highlighted its games team byshowing the often low-tech processof handwriting and crafting the most popular puzzles on the site.\nAll of these companies are in the business of building new habits for consumers. That\u2019s especially true for new casual customers, whom they may bring into their apps with games but hope to keep around long enough to introduce them to other products, such as podcasts, sports \u2014 and even hard news.\n\u201cWhen we see subscribers engage with both games and news in any given week, we\u2019re seeing some of the best long-term subscriber retention from that pattern,\u201d said Jonathan Knight, head of games at The Times. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing lots of things to encourage that behavior.\u201d\nPeople need to feel good about visiting the apps, many of the companies said, even if it\u2019s in the fleeting but satisfying moment of completing a crossword puzzle at a personal best time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time well spent, and you\u2019re deciding how it fits into your life,\u201d Mr. Knight said. \u201cYou do one puzzle a day. Put it down and come down to the next one when you want. It\u2019s a real sense of achievement, and people can feel good about that.\u201d"
