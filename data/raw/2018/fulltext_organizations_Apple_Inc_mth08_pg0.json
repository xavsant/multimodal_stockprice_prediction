        "fulltext": "Apple, Google and Facebook this week erased from their services many \u2014 but not all \u2014 videos, podcasts and posts from the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars site. And Twitter left Mr. Jones\u2019s posts untouched.\nThe differing approaches to Mr. Jones exposed how unevenly tech companies enforce their rules on hate speech and offensive content. There are only a few cases in which the companies appear to consistently apply their policies, such as their ban on child pornography and instances in which the law required them to remove content, like Nazi imagery in Germany.\nWhen left to make their own decisions, the tech companies often struggle with their roles as the arbiters of speech and leave false information, upset users and confusing decisions in their wake. Here is a look at what the companies, which control the world\u2019s most popular public forums, allow and ban.\nOf all the tech companies, Facebook has faced the biggest public outcry over what it allows on its platform.\nWhenever the social media company has been pressed to explain its decision-making, it has referred to its community standards, a public document that outlines Facebook\u2019s rules for users. The company has outright bans against violent content, nudity and terrorist recruitment propaganda. The rules on other types of content, including hate speech and false news, are more ambiguous.\nWhen asked about Infowars last month, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg,saidhe wouldn\u2019t remove pages hosting popular conspiracy theories of the type Mr. Jones is known for sharing. Mr. Zuckerberg then turned the conversation to the subject of the Holocaust, defending Facebook users who deny the Holocaust occurred.\nHis awkward explanation prompted outrage, and less than a day later, Mr. Zuckerbergoffered a public apology.\nNow, less than a month later, Facebook has banned Mr. Jones and removed four pages belonging to him \u2014 including one with nearly 1.7 million followers \u2014 for violating its policies. The ban means that while Mr. Jones still has an account and can view content on Facebook, he is suspended from posting anything to the platform, including to his personal page or any pages on which he is an administrator.\nIn a post, Facebook said it banned Mr. Jones and his pages for \u201caccumulating too many strikes.\u201d\nThe company has refused to say how many strikes is too many, however. It has also not answered questions on how long Mr. Jones will be banned or whether Facebook will be reviewing similar content posted by other right-wing conspiracy theorists.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the actions Facebook has taken against Mr. Jones signal a new approach by the company against hate speech or whether they are, once again, responding to an isolated case because of public pressure.\n\u2014 Sheera Frenkel\nOf all the major online services, Google\u2019s YouTube is probably the most explicit about what is and is not allowed. But even with its published\u201cCommunity Guidelines,\u201dYouTube has wrestled with the subjective interpretation of those rules.\nUsers can flag videos that they believe violate those guidelines, which include bans on videos with nudity or sexual content or incite violence. YouTube will then review those flagged videos for potential violations. In addition, YouTube\u2019s computer systems also comb the site for videos that violate its rules.\nBut many videos operate in a gray area. Even in YouTube\u2019s own explanation of \u201chateful content,\u201d the company calls it is a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d between free expression and protecting YouTube users.\nYouTube still hosts videos of Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich., whose sermons were viewed by one of the knife-wielding attackers in the terror attack on London Bridge last year. His sermons posed a quandary for the video service because the cleric does not directly call for violent jihad and is, therefore, not in clear violation of community guidelines. YouTube now presents Mr. Jibril\u2019s sermons behind a warning that the video has been deemed \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d by part of the YouTube community.\nMr. Jones incurred two content violations from YouTube over the last year. In February, YouTube said he had violated its policies regarding harassment and bullying when a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201d\nIn Mr. Jones\u2019s most recent violation last month, YouTube took down four of his videos that included hate speech against Muslim and transgender people as well as footage of a child being shoved to the ground. YouTube said the videos had violated its policies pertaining to hate speech, harassment and child endangerment.\n\u2014 Daisuke Wakabayashi\nTwitter has been more permissive of controversial content than its social media peers, with executives calling it \u201cthe free speech wing of the free speech party.\u201d While Facebook removes nude or gory images, Twitter is more tolerant of adult and violent content. Rather than deleting these kinds of images, Twitter tends to hide them behind warnings that require users to click through before they can see the content.\nTwitter\u2019s approach has provoked plenty of criticism, particularly around its lax handling of harassment. Celebrities like the actress Leslie Jones have been temporarily driven off the platform by swarms of abusers.\nJack Dorsey, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said that the company needed to do better at policing trolls. In December, Twitter said it would promote \u201chealthy conversation\u201d by using a combination of human moderation and machine learning to detect trolls and minimize the appearance of their posts on the platform.\nAlthough the parents of several Sandy Hook shooting victims are suing Mr. Jones for defamation, a Twitter spokesman said that neither Mr. Jones\u2019s personal account nor his Infowars account are currently in violation of Twitter\u2019s policies. Tweets questioning the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., remain live on both accounts.\nThe simultaneous takedowns across YouTube, Spotify and Facebook are troubling, said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. The number of bans in quick succession from multiple companies raised the specter that this could have been influenced by outside political pressure rather than a straightforward application of company policies, he said.\nTwitter\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Jones and Infowars to stay on its platform may reflect a commitment to consistent policy enforcement, Mr. Bankston said.\n\u201cA Twitter that\u2019s not accountable to its own rules is not accountable to anybody,\u201d he said.\nIn a series of tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Dorsey suggested that other tech companies had caved to political pressure in their decision to remove Mr. Jones from their platforms and argued that journalists \u2014 not Twitter \u2014 were better suited to fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019 claims.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t violated our rules,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\u2014 Kate Conger\nWithout a social-media platform, Apple typically avoids the content controversies that ensnare its peers. Yet the iPhone maker still makes many decisions about what apps, podcasts, songs and videos it will make available on its popular services.\nApple on Sunday banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its podcasts service. Apple determined the sixth podcast, RealNews with David Knight, did not violate its policies,which prohibit podcaststhat \u201ccould be construed as racist, misogynist, or homophobic\u201d or that depict \u201cgraphic sex, violence, gore, illegal drugs, or hate themes.\u201d In the past, Apple has also removed neo-Nazi songs and the Nazi anthem from iTunes.\nApple\u2019s decision to ban the Infowars podcasts was surprising partly because an app that Infowars introduced last month was gaining steam on Apple\u2019s App Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 33rd most popular news app on the app store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones\u2019s bans spread, the Infowars app was Apple\u2019s fourth most popular news app, outranking every mainstream news organization.\nApple reviews all apps that apply for its app store and determined that the Infowars app did not violate its rules. Apple postsextensive policiesfor apps that it distributes, including prohibitions on \u201ccontent that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste.\u201d The policies give a series of examples, including content that is defamatory, discriminatory, meanspirited, overtly sexual, encourages violence or includes \u201crealistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused.\u201d\nHow Apple decides which apps violate those policies is more vague, however. Apple said in its policy: \u201cWe will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, \u2018I\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u2019 And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\u201d\n\u2014 Jack Nicas"

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nApple is handing cash back to its shareholders at an unprecedented rate.\nThe iPhone maker repurchased $43.5 billion of its own stock during the first six months of this year. Not only is that up from more than $14 billion during the same period last year, but the company\u2019s repurchases in the past two quarters also rank as the biggest in history, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.& P. Dow Jones Indices.\nAmong companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, each of the five largest quarterly stock buybacks on record was by Apple.\nApple\u2019s increased spending on its own shares follows the $1.5 trillion tax cut signed into law late last year. The overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The aim was to encourage companies to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories to stimulate the American economy.\nThe legislation has caused corporate America, toramp up stock repurchases. In the first quarter of 2018, companies in the S. & P. 500 purchased a record-breaking $178 billion of their own shares.\nApple was among the biggest beneficiaries of the new tax law. In January, the company said it wouldbring back most of the $252 billion in cashthat it held abroad. At the beginning of May, the company said it woulduse a large chunk of that cash to buy back an additional $100 billion in stock.\nThat added to its already record level of returning capital to investors. No company has bought back more shares since 2012 than Apple. It has repurchased almost $220 billion of its own stock sinceit announced in March 2012that it would start to buy back shares. That is roughly equivalent to the market value of Verizon Communications. Over that period, the number of Apple\u2019s shares outstanding has dropped by just over a quarter.\nLike most stock repurchase efforts, Apple\u2019s buyback program has helped bolster its share price in recent years. Apple shares are up 18 percent this year and nearly 150 percent since March 2012. By reducing the number of shares on the market, buybacks also lift a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 a key metric for investors. For instance, Apple\u2019s earning per share grew 40 percent last quarter compared with the same period last year, while its net income rose just 32 percent.\nApple\u2019s buyback binge also affects the calculation of its stock market value, which is approaching $1 trillion. Based on its share count from its fiscal second-quarter filing, the company would have a market value of $984 billion Wednesday. But Apple reduced its share count by 5.5 percent during its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. That means Apple\u2019s market capitalization stands at roughly $970 billion, and its shares now need to hit $206.49 for the company to be valued at $1 trillion."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 1997, Apple was on the ropes. The Silicon Valley pioneer was being decimated by Microsoft and its many partners in the personal-computer market. It had just cut a third of its work force, and it was about 90 days from going broke, Apple\u2019slate co-founder, Steve Jobs, later said.\nOn Thursday, Apple became the first publicly traded American company to be worth more than $1 trillion when its shares climbed 3 percent to end the day at $207.39. The gains came two days after the company announcedthe latest in a series of remarkably profitable quarters.\nApple\u2019s ascent from the brink of bankruptcy to the world\u2019s most valuable public company has been a business tour de force, marked by rapid innovation, a series of smash-hit products and the creation of a sophisticated, globe-spanning supply chain that keeps costs down while producing enormous volumes of cutting-edge devices.\nThat ascent has also been marked by controversy, tragedy and challenges. Apple\u2019s aggressive use of outside manufacturers in China, for example, has led tocriticism that it is taking advantage of poorly paid workersin other countries and robbing Americans of good manufacturing jobs. The company faces numerous questions about how it can continue to grow.\nAnd Mr. Jobs, admired for his dazzling product demonstrations and feared for his blunt management style, was arguably the tech industry\u2019s most famous figurewhen he died in 2011after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 56.\nA look at how Apple\u2019s trillion-dollar value stacks up against other companies and entire industries.\n\u201cCould anyone really imagine this back then?\u201d said Apple\u2019s former software chief Avie Tevanian, who joined Apple in 1997. \u201cWe hoped to make the company very successful and very valuable. But to think it would get to where it was today? Of course not. And Steve wouldn\u2019t have thought that, either.\u201d\nApple was founded in 1976 with the mission of making computers \u2014 then bulky, complicated industrial machines \u2014 cheap, small and simple so they could become a mass-market product. By the 1980s, the company was one of the world\u2019s best-known brands.\nBut in 1985, Mr. Jobs was ousted in a boardroom coup. In the following years, the company was increasingly outgunned and outmaneuvered in the personal-computer market it helped invent.\nApple, hamstrung by a lack of new ideas, failed products and leadership turmoil, had lost its way.\nFred Anderson, Apple\u2019s former chief financial officer, said that shortly after he joined in 1996, he initiated a $661 million bond offering to keep the company afloat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how bad it was until I started digging in,\u201d he said.\nBy the end of that year, Apple had lost $867 million and the total value of its shares was less than $3 billion.\nThe ailing company decided to take a gamble. It bought Next, a tech firm run by Mr. Jobs, for $400 million. Mr. Jobs, still synonymous with the Apple brand, would return to the company he had founded.\n\u201cIt was on the rocks,\u201dMr. Jobs later recalled. \u201cIt was much worse than I thought.\u201d\nMr. Jobs slashed 70 percent of Apple\u2019s product plans, commissioned the company\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d ad campaign and reimagined how it put its products together.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get back to the basics,\u201d a weary Mr. Jobs said in a 1997 internal meeting with staff. Avideo of the meeting posted onlinelater showed him sporting shorts and sandals. \u201cThe question now is not: Can we turn around Apple? I think that\u2019s the booby prize. I think it\u2019s: Can we make Apple really great again?\u201d\nThe focus on simplicity became a hallmark of Apple, from the way Mr. Jobs dressed \u2014 jeans and black mock turtlenecks became his uniform of sorts \u2014 to the way his products operated to the eventual look of his company\u2019s retail stores.\nIn 1998, Apple introduced the iMac G3, a round, colorful, all-in-one desktop computer. It became a hit. Apple had its swagger back.\nThe company\u2019s revitalization was confirmed with the iPod, the portable music player that almost immediately changed consumers\u2019 relationship with music. The iPod, which debuted in 2001 and went on to sell more than 400 million units, showed that Apple wasn\u2019t just a computer company. The device was paired with iTunes, the company\u2019s music store, which would help upend the recording industry. And it portended a bigger product to come.\n\u201cThe iPod was a step \u2014 a really important one,\u201d said Ken Kocienda, a longtime Apple software engineer who will soon release a book about Apple called \u201cCreative Selection.\u201d \u201cBut the iPhone was really the definitive answer to the question: What comes next after personal computers?\u201d\nThe iPhone transformed the way society interacts with technology, and quickly became one of the best-selling products ever: More than 1.4 billion have been sold since it was introduced in 2007.\nNo product or decision was remotely as instrumental to Apple\u2019s rise to $1 trillion as the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs first announced the iPhone, Apple was worth $73.4 billion.\nFormer employees and analysts said that while Mr. Jobs deserved credit for overseeing the reinvention of the company\u2019s vision and its innovation, his successor, Timothy D. Cook, had also played a crucial role in the turnaround by overhauling the way Apple built its products.\nMr. Cook, as chief operating officer under Mr. Jobs, remade Apple\u2019s distribution pipeline to heavily rely on contract manufacturers in China, which gave it the flexibility, cost savings and scale to build such a big business.\nAs chief executive, Mr. Cook has also overseen most of the rise in Apple\u2019s value. (The total value of the company\u2019s shares was $346 billion when he took the helm in August 2011.) Mr. Cook has been a steady, if unflashy, hand as chief executive, building the iPhone into a huge business, including sales of accessories and services off it.\nNow, with Apple reaching the $1 trillion milestone and the iPhone turning 11 years old, pressure is likely to increase for the company to develop a hit new product.\nThere have been other popular devices, like the iPad, the Apple Watch and routinely updated versions of Apple\u2019s personal computers. But none have come close to the impact of the iPhone.\nThe company also has been linked to self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses, but Apple would face major technical and even social hurdles with either product.\nThere are other challenges. Apple depends on China for a significant amount of its sales, as well as its manufacturing.It could be caught in the middle of the trade warbrewing between China and the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most miraculous corporate turnarounds in business history,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a technology analyst and consultant who has tracked the company for nearly 40 years. \u201cThe question going forward is: Can Apple continue to innovate?\u201d"

        "title": "Why Apple Is the Future of Capitalism",
        "fulltext": "With Apple Inc. nowexceeding $1 trillionin market capitalization, it\u2019s tempting to understand this moment in terms ofthe dominance of all-too-large companiesand technology in our lives.\nThose interpretations obscure Apple\u2019s other accomplishment \u2014 pioneering a financial model that is the envy of corporate America. Sure, Apple produces innovative phones and laptops, but look inside its sleek exterior and you\u2019ll find an elegant financial machine that has become the ideal for corporate America. Without investing significantly in hard assets, Apple spins cash and returns it to shareholders at a stunning rate. It\u2019s difficult not to admire.\nBut the model that has been perfected at Apple is risky and imitated poorly by many American corporations. The next decade will reveal whether these imitations were a series of brilliant moves or large-scale financial engineering.\nFirst, consider the changes in how Apple rewards its shareholders and is financed. Six years ago, the company owed no debt and had never undertaken a share buyback or paid dividends.Pressured by a shareholder revolt in 2013, it is now transformed.\nApple has $115 billion of debt outstanding, and it has distributed $288 billion to its shareholders in the past six years, most of it through share buybacks. In the most recent nine months alone, Apple bought back $54 billion worth of shares.\nThis transformation is representative of trends in corporate America. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have issued on net over $1.3 trillion of debt and retired over $1.9 trillion of equity over the past four years. American companies are borrowing money to buy their own shares in what is tantamount to a huge, slow-motion leveraged buyout.\nApple has conducted its buybacks responsibly: It bought shares when they were relatively cheap, rewarding the patient shareholder. Other companies have not been so prudent, taking on debt to make ill-timed purchases of expensive shares rather than investing in growth opportunities. In some cases, they have done so simply to push up share prices so that management can meet goals for quarterly earnings or metrics that trigger compensation.\nSecond, Apple\u2019s financial model emphasizes cash flow over profits. Apple is not simply immensely profitable; in 2017, it generated $16 billion more in operating cash flow than profits. It does that in part by running its day-to-day operations in a distinctive way. Typically, a company has to use external funds to fund the process of stocking goods and collecting revenue from customers.\nApple\u2019s model turns this upside down. Its retail stores collect cash from customers quickly, it is ruthless on keeping inventory low, and it takes forever to pay suppliers. In the process, Apple\u2019s operations are extremely effective cash generators. This is no coincidence. It is the result of the canny supply chain that Tim Cook built. In effect, Apple has largely been financed on the backs of its suppliers, who are willing to hold their inventory and wait more than 100 days to get paid, just for the pleasure of doing business with Apple.\nThis restructuring of operations to minimize inventory, move to subscription models (which generate predictable streams of cash) and keep suppliers waiting has become the dominant pattern in large corporations. Amazon, for example, generates relatively small profits but mountains of cash through this process. But this emphasis on cash also means that executives can become wary of making capital expenditures, such as new factories or server farms. This kind of spending can increase profits in the long run but bites into cash flow in the short run. That is a recipe for sluggish corporate investment, just as we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the financial crisis.\nFinally, Apple is the epitome of an \u201casset light\u201d company: It owns very few hard assets and therefore needs almost zero outside capital to run its business. As of mid-2018, Apple has $105 billion of operating assets and $120 billion of operating liabilities. What does that mean? Miraculously, its operations rely on no capital from outside financiers.\nHow does one achieve this apotheosis of the asset-light strategy? First, create a supply chain in Asia run by companies willing to invest in low-return projects that create your products. Second, hold those suppliers under your thumb. Idolizing asset-light strategies, however, can also lead to underinvestment, an excessive reliance on outsourcing and the artificial division of companies to avoid hard assets.\nThe accomplishments of Apple\u2019s model are substantial. But the financial strategy that has worked so well for Apple is a risky one for less capable companies with weaker strategic positions. For them, aping Apple can just as easily result in too much debt on their balance sheets, precarious supply chains and deferred opportunities for investments.\nThe financial archetype defined by Apple \u2014 asset-light strategy, leveraged share buybacks and cash flow above all \u2014 is a high-wire act. Boards should guard against the temptation to follow Apple\u2019s path blindly. Big investors, especially mutual funds and pension funds that represent so many individuals, should question the management of any company that does. Many of Apple\u2019s imitators are more likely to mortgage the future than create it."

        "fulltext": "U.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.\nSmall potatoes.\nApple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of:a market value of more than$1 trillion.\nThat landmark is the result ofan extraordinary corporate success story. In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, pushing the tech industry away from big, bulky machines and producing some of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products, like the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone. Apple\u2019s products have reshaped swaths of everyday life.\nApple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.\nThe impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.\nBut the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.\nEconomists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201d\nIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.\nOn Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.\nThe difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.\nMore than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.\nA consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.\nThe consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.\nWhen the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.\nApple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.\nBut the trend is not confined to technology.\nToday, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.\nConsolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.\nThat is great news for the stock markets.\nThis year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.\nOf course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.\nAnd in the labor market, scholars havelinkedcorporate consolidation to rising income inequality and thedeclining share of the nation\u2019s wealththat goes to workers. The so-called labor share of the economy has been declining in the United States and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. And that decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation.\nEconomists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.\nOther economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simplyless competition for workersand therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialized, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay. Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low byagreeing not to poach each other\u2019s workersand by inserting provisions into workers\u2019 contracts thatbar themfrom joining competitors.\nSome on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.\nAlthough companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.\nThe same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.\nGooglewas recently fineda record $5 billion by European antitrust regulators who accused the search giant of abusing its market position by forcing mobile phone companies to install Google apps on their phones.\nFacebook is being forced by angry politicians and regulators to do more to safeguard users\u2019 data and to prevent its platform from being used to interfere with American elections. Last week, Facebook reported that its growth was slowing and it was increasing spending on privacy and security. Its sharesplunged 19 percent, lopping roughly $120 billion of the company\u2019s market value in a single day.\nAnd President Trump has repeatedlytakenaimat Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Trump \u2014 who has expressedanger about coverageof his administration in The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos bought in 2013 \u2014 has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes and of taking advantage of the United States Postal Service. If Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric translates into policy changes, it could hit Amazon\u2019s bottom line.\nApple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\n\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201d"

        "title": "Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever",
        "fulltext": "You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.\nOver the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularlythe ones I\u2019ve called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets.\nThe concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.\nIn different ways, the companies haveconceded some of these fearsand have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for their contributions to society \u2014 these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation.\nYet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed \u201ctechlash\u201d: It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants\u2019 financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings,reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street\u2019s projections. On Tuesday,so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion.\nWait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?\nIn a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201d\nTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.\nWhy is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.\nBack when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.\nThree years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.\nWhere did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\nFor rival retailers, Amazon\u2019s new profitability constitutesa kind of nightmare scenario. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace.\n\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nBut it\u2019s not just Amazon that\u2019s profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen\u2019s thesis that \u201csoftware is eating the world.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s surging earnings werealso driven by its cloud business, while Apple\u2019s software services \u2014 things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay \u2014 arethe fastest-growing part of its business.\nThe European Union recentlyfined Google $5.1 billionfor abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followeda $2.7 billion fine last yearfor abuse of its search monopoly. (Google is appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data.\nBut Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.\nThere is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Google watchers say it\u2019s notable that President Trumptweeted criticismof the European Union\u2019s fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won\u2019t take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.)\nOr consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201d\nFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.\nFacebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.\nAnd that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\n\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201d\nIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere."

        "title": "Top C.E.O.s Denounce Trump Immigration Policy as Threat to U.S. Economy",
        "fulltext": "Dozens of American business leaders are challenging the Trump administration over changes to immigration policy that they say threaten the livelihoods of thousands of their skilled foreign workers, and the nation\u2019s economic growth and competitiveness as well.\nThe executives, members of the Business Roundtable, expressed their \u201cserious concern\u201d over the administration\u2019s immigration moves ina jointly signed letterdelivered late Wednesday to Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security.\nSome of the most prominent chief executives in the United States signed the letter, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Laurence Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Indra Nooyi, the departing head of PepsiCo.\nThe letter comes during a week when the broader debate over the country\u2019s immigration policies has been reignited by the arrest of a Mexican laborer inthe killing of an Iowa woman. It also underscores the continuing tension between America\u2019s globally minded corporate establishment and the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\nBusiness leaders have praised President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and rolling back of many regulations. But they have deplored some of his statements and some of his administration\u2019s actions, including on immigration.\nIn one of the most notable examples of the strain,several White House business advisory councils dissolvedlast year after Mr. Trump blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va.\nIn June, a group of top executives condemned the administrationfor the forced separation of migrant childrenfrom their parents at the Mexican border. The Business Roundtable described the separations as \u201ccruel and contrary to American values.\u201d\nWith their letter on Wednesday, the group\u2019s members took issue with a series of immigration enforcement guidelines that they said were \u201carbitrary and inconsistent\u201d and created new and unnecessary hurdles for skilled foreigners working in the United States.\nThe changes, the letter stated, were \u201ccausing considerable anxiety for many thousands of our employees while threatening to disrupt company operations.\u201d\nThe business group\u2019s complaint focused on new guidelines and practices by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security that vets visa applications and administers immigration policy.\nThe letter\u2019s main focus was the treatment of applications for, and renewals of, H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The visas are used by companies to hire computer engineers and other professionals.\nAs a result of the changes, there has been a sharp increase in the number of denials and requests for more information. A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan policy research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions had increased 41 percent in the government\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, compared with the third quarter.\nGovernment examiners\u2019 requests for additional information on H-1B visa applications tripled in the same period. The government\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter began in July 2017, a few months after Mr. Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order.\nThe policy foundation\u2019s analysis,published last month, was meant to examine the \u201cTrump effect\u201d on immigration for skilled foreign workers, said Stuart Anderson, executive director of the foundation and a former immigration official.\nThe Trump administration, experts said, was using the government\u2019s regulatory apparatus, which it has so often scorned, to serve its policy goal of clamping down on the flow of foreign workers into America.\n\u201cStep up investigations, slow things down, and you can accomplish your policy goals without legislation,\u201d said Hal Salzman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University.\nIn response to the business leaders\u2019 letter, the immigration service said in a statement on Thursday that the administration had been \u201crelentlessly pursuing necessary immigration reforms that move towards a merit-based system.\u201d It added that it handles all applications and petitions \u201cfairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nThe H-1B program was created to provide a pathway for talented foreigners whose special skills were expected to strengthen the American economy. Today, the nation\u2019s technology hubs are filled with H-1B alumni who have become entrepreneurs, executives, venture capitalists and, quite often, United States citizens.\nIn recent years, however, the visa program has been criticized because corporations, especially Indian technology outsourcing companies, have exploited legal loopholes in the H-1B regime to replace American workers and shift jobs out of the United States. The immigration service has said its increased scrutiny and enforcement actions were intended to strengthen \u201cprotections to combat H-1B abuses.\u201d\nBut to the business leaders, the policies are vague and capricious, creating uncertainty for their workers and in company operations. For example, the group\u2019s letter stated, \u201ccompanies now do not know whether a work visa petition that was approved last month will be approved when the company submits the identical application to extend the employee\u2019s status.\u201d\nA particular concern, the business leaders said, was that the immigration service was expected to revoke work eligibility for spouses of H-1B visa holders. The spouses, they said, are often highly skilled workers who have built careers in America.\n\u201cRevoking their U.S. work authorization,\u201d the letter said, \u201cwill likely cause high-skilled immigrants to take their skills to competitors outside the United States.\u201d"

        "title": "Fatherhood Through the Lens of Steve Jobs",
        "fulltext": "In a new memoir, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, a daughter of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, maintains that what some might see as cruel treatment by her father was his way of building strength in her, and she forgives him. In nearly 1,500 commentson a profile of her last week, many readers struggled with that.\nWhat do our reactions to Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s story tell us about ourselves?\nI have spent decades studying father-daughter relationships, andmy own research and that of othersoffers several insights.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that our childhood memories are not always accurate representations of what actually happened, as the work of the cognitive psychologistElizabeth Loftus established. What we forget or remember and the meaning we give to those selected memories is colored by the \u201clife story\u201d that we create for ourselves. We feel more comfortable creating a consistent, coherent story than trying to make sense of or make peace with erratic, inconsistent memories and contradictory facts \u2014 regardless of whether our story is more negative or more positive than the facts warrant.\nAs family members, this leaves us with no agreed-upon picture of dads, moms or stepparents. (Indeed, in a statement to The Times, Mr. Jobs\u2019s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, her children and Mr. Jobs\u2019s sister, Mona Simpson, said that \u201cthe portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew.\u201d)\nAccording toleading experts on fatherhood research, compared to mothers, fathers are usually more blunt and tend to expect and require more from their children. Dads are less likely to indulge or acquiesce to their children\u2019s immature behavior. Dads promote more self-reliance, more maturity, and more resilience. Most fathers also communicate more directly and more honestly with children about their flaws. Ask daughters which parent is more likely to help them confront the unpleasant truths about themselves and most will say \u201cDad.\u201d\nAdults who love their children and whose children love them can be lousy parents. To be clear, \u201clousy\u201d parenting does not mean being physically or sexually abusive, or having serious mental health or substance abuse problems that endanger the children. It means that a father who loves his daughter can be self-absorbed, insensitive, hot-tempered, and inept in communicating with her. Parenting is a learned skill that some parents never master. This is not to excuse poor parenting. It is simply a reminder that, as they both age, a father and daughter can acknowledge their love for one another without ignoring or denying his failures as a parent.\nResearch also teaches us that we cannot always know the motives or intentions behind another person\u2019s behavior. We know when someone\u2019s behavior or comments hurt, belittle or embarrass us. But we don\u2019t necessarily know if that was the person\u2019s intent.\nAs to whether a brilliant, successful man can be embarrassing, awkward, rude and insensitive in communicating with his daughter, the research answer is clear: yes. Highly intelligent, successful people can have very little of what is known asemotional intelligence. They may be terrible at reading and responding to other\u2019s feelings and social cues. This does not necessarily mean these fathers don\u2019t love or care about their daughters \u2014 or that they are self-absorbed narcissistic men. They are simply inept communicators.\nWhen considering our personal reactions to Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s memoir, we might also ask ourselves whether our feelings are more a reflection of our own family relationships than of hers. Whether we are applauding or criticizing how she came to terms with her relationship with her father or how she views her mother, stepmother, and half siblings, our vision is affected by the reflections in our own family mirrors.\nForgiving her father is a gift a daughter gives, not just to her father, but to herself. In choosing not to allow her bitterness about his failings as a father to consume her, a daughter is choosing not to deprive herself of whatever pleasure she can still derive from their relationship. She does not deny the past. But she does not dwell in it. Forgiving does not mean forgetting.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s memoir may provide a comforting message for parents who fear that their mistakes and missteps inevitably will lead to irreparable damage \u2014 and for daughters who are grappling with their father\u2019s failures as a parent. Adult children can choose to focus on the dearness or the darkness of their childhood relationships with their parents. Ms. Brennan-Jobs chose dearness. Will we?\nLinda Nielsen is a professor of educational and adolescent psychology at Wake Forest University and author of \u201cBetween Fathers and Daughters: Enriching and Rebuilding Your Adult Relationship\u201d and \u201cFather-Daughter Relationships: Contemporary Research and Issues.\u201d"

        "title": "In \u2018Small Fry,\u2019 Steve Jobs Comes Across as a Jerk. His Daughter Forgives Him. Should We?",
        "fulltext": "When Steve Jobs told his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs that the Apple Lisa computer was not named after her, it was not a cruel lie to a little girl, she insists \u2014 he was teaching her \u201cnot to ride on his coattails.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Jobs refused to install heat in her bedroom, he was not being callous, she says \u2014 he was instilling in her a \u201cvalue system.\u201d\nWhen a dying Mr. Jobs told Ms. Brennan-Jobs that she smelled \u201clike a toilet,\u201d it was not a hateful snipe, she maintains \u2014 he was merely showing her \u201chonesty.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strange thing to write a devastating memoir with damning details but demand that these things are not, in fact, damning at all. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Ms. Brennan-Jobs has done in a new memoir, \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d and in a series of interviews conducted over the last few weeks.\nThanks to a dozen other biographies and films, Apple obsessives already know the broad outlines of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s early life: Mr. Jobs fathered her at 23, then denied paternity despite a DNA match, and gave little in financial or emotional support even as he became a god of the early computing era. \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d which goes on sale Sept. 4, is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort to reclaim her story for herself.\nThe backdrop to her raw depictions of life with and without Mr. Jobs is 1980s Silicon Valley, where artists and hippies mixed with technologists, ideas of how to build the future flourished, and a cascade of trillions of dollars was just beginning to crash onto the landscape. Ms. Brennan-Jobs navigated a childhood on welfare with her mother, the artist Chrisann Brennan, and an adolescence ensconced in her father\u2019s wealth.\nIn passage after passage of \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs is vicious to his daughter and those around her. Now, in the days before the book is released, Ms. Brennan-Jobs is fearful that it will be received as a tell-all expos\u00e9, and not the more nuanced portrait of a family she intended. She worries that the reaction will be about a famous man\u2019s legacy rather than a young woman\u2019s story \u2014 that she will be erased again, this time in her own memoir.\nOn the eve of publication, what Ms. Brennan-Jobs wants readers to know is this: Steve Jobs rejected his daughter for years, but that daughter has absolved him. Triumphantly, she loves him, and she wants the book\u2019s scenes of their roller skating and laughing together to be as viral as the scenes of him telling her she will inherit nothing.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s forgiveness is one thing. What\u2019s tricky is that she wants the reader to forgive Mr. Jobs, too. And she knows that could be a problem.\n\u201cHave I failed?\u201d she asked, in one of our conversations. \u201cHave I failed in fully representing the dearness and the pleasure? The dearness of my father, and the outrageous pleasure of being with him when he was in good form?\u201d\nAfter college, Ms. Brennan-Jobs left the United States to work in finance in London and Italy; she later shifted into design, and then freelance writing for magazines and literary journals. Now 40, she has long avoided publicity. She has never been profiled, and she has carefully eluded most of her father\u2019s chroniclers. (One exception: Aaron Sorkin, who called her \u201cthe heroine\u201d of his 2015 Steve Jobs biopic.) Ms. Brennan-Jobs said she did not trust Walter Isaacson, who wrote the definitive, megaselling biography of her father in 2011.\n\u201cI never spoke with Walter, and I never read the book, but I know I came off as cold to my father and not caring whether he felt bad,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said in late July, sitting in Cantine, a small, vegan-friendly cafe in Brooklyn\u2019s Carroll Gardens neighborhood. \u201cI was devastated by it.\u201d\n\u201cI felt ashamed to be the bad part of a great story,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I felt unresolved.\u201d\nAnd so in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she seeks to resolve some of that shame by describing how her childhood unfolded, who key characters were, why it all happened. Ms. Brennan-Jobs went back to Silicon Valley and interviewed her family, her friends, her mother\u2019s ex-boyfriends, and her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In her childhood, the region had been green with eucalyptus and full of garage hackers. Now it is the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of the world, and Mr. Jobs remains its towering hero.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs began work on what would become \u201cSmall Fry\u201d not long after her father\u2019s 2011 death. Years into writing, she felt rushed by her publisher, Penguin Press, and feared being \u201ctarted up\u201d and made to take advantage of her father\u2019s legacy. She wanted to be with a smaller publisher who would work with her and give her more time, and switched to Grove, taking what she says was a 90 percent cut in her advance. (A spokesperson for Penguin declined to comment.)\nOne result of the delay is that \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is entering the public conversation at a time when, across industries, formerly disempowered or ignored women are having their say about powerful men. A memoir by Steve Jobs\u2019s firstborn was always going to be a publishing sensation, but Ms. Brennan-Jobs has inadvertently timed hers to land when the public is even more attuned to marginalized voices \u2014 and when many are having darker thoughts about the world Mr. Jobs created with his attention-devouring devices.\nNone of that, of course, was imaginable when Ms. Brennan-Jobs was born on May 17, 1978, on a commune farm in Oregon. Her parents, who had met in high school in Cupertino, Calif., were both 23. Mr. Jobs arrived days after the birth and helped name her, but refused to acknowledge that he was the father. To support her family, Ms. Brennan cleaned houses and used government assistance. Only after the government sued Mr. Jobs did he agree to pay child support.\n\u201cSmall Fry\u201d describes how Mr. Jobs slowly took a greater interest in his daughter, taking her skating and coming over to her house for visits. Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with him for a time during high school, when her mother was struggling with money and her temper, but Mr. Jobs was cold and had extreme demands for what being a member of the family entailed. The neighbors next door worried about the teenage Lisa, and one night, when Mr. Jobs was out, they moved her from his house and into theirs. Against Mr. Jobs\u2019s wishes, the neighbors paid for her to finish college. (He later paid them back.)\nIn an interview, Ms. Brennan-Jobs spoke of \u201cnot wanting to alienate people\u201d she loves, but acknowledged that her memoir might do just that. Aside from Mr. Jobs, all the central characters are very much alive. \u201cI hope Thanksgiving\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said.\nHer mother, Ms. Brennan, is portrayed as a free spirit who nurtured her daughter\u2019s creativity \u2014 but could be mercurial, hot-tempered and sometimes neglectful. \u201cIt was horrendous for me to read,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in an interview. \u201cIt was very, very hard. But she got it right.\u201d\nMr. Jobs\u2019s infamous venom is on frequent display in \u201cSmall Fry.\u201d Out one night at dinner, Mr. Jobs turns to his daughter\u2019s cousin, Sarah, who has just unknowingly offended him by ordering meat. \u201c\u2018Have you ever thought about how awful your voice is?\u201d Mr. Jobs asks Sarah. \u201cPlease stop talking in that awful voice,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cYou should really consider what\u2019s wrong with yourself and try to fix it.\u201d\nMs. Brennan-Jobs describes her father\u2019s frequent use of money to confuse or frighten her. \u201cSometimes he decided not to pay for things at the very last minute,\u201d she writes, \u201cwalking out of restaurants without paying the bill.\u201d When her mother found a beautiful house and asked Mr. Jobs to buy it for her and Lisa, he agreed it was nice \u2014 but bought it for himself and moved in with his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.\nMs. Brennan said that her daughter has, if anything, underplayed the chaos of her childhood. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that,\u201d she said.\nBut \u201cSmall Fry\u201d also contains moments of joy that capture Mr. Jobs\u2019s spontaneity and unparalleled mind. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs goes on a school trip to Japan, he arrives unannounced and pulls her out of the program for a day. Father and daughter sit, talking about God and how he sees consciousness. \u201cI was afraid of him and, at the same time, I felt a quaking, electric love,\u201d she writes.\n\u201cWhen I started writing,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so interesting on the page, and I was almost frustrated that he pulled so much gravity.\u201d\nAfter Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with Mr. Jobs as a teenager, he forbade her from seeing her mother for six months, as a way to cement her connection to his new family. At the same time, Mr. Jobs shifted from neglectful to controlling. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs was getting increasingly involved at her high school, starting an opera club and running for freshman-class president, he got upset. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out. You\u2019re not succeeding as a member of this family,\u201d Mr. Jobs says in the memoir. \u201cYou\u2019re never around. If you want to be a part of this family, you need to put in the time.\u201d\nTo appease her father, Ms. Brennan-Jobs transferred to another school that was closer to her father\u2019s house. She persisted in becoming editor in chief of the school newspaper. Her mentor there, a journalism teacher named Esther Wojcicki, says \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is a faithful account.\n\u201cThe dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cThe book is a gift to all of us.\u201d\nEarly copies of the memoir have circulated among family and friends. Ms. Powell Jobs, her children and Mr. Jobs\u2019s sister, Mona Simpson, gave this statement to The Times: \u201cLisa is part of our family, so it was with sadness that we read her book, which differs dramatically from our memories of those times. The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew. Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood. It was a great comfort to Steve to have Lisa home with all of us during the last days of his life, and we are all grateful for the years we spent together as a family.\u201d\nOn a hot August day in Brooklyn, Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I walked to her studio, a small apartment with brick walls she painted white and a bamboo floor she painted black. While writing \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she told me, she covered the mirrors around her work space with paper. \u201cI don\u2019t like catching myself in the mirror,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, self.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Brennan-Jobs said she was nervous about how she would be described physically in a profile, and so I asked her to use her own words. \u201cMy face is uneven,\u201d she said. \u201cI have small eyes. I wish I had dimples, but I don\u2019t. I think right now I look jowly.\u201d\nI interjected to say she had delicate features, and freckles, and was about 5 foot 2, with slightly reddish brown hair.\n\u201cMy nose,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs replied, \u201cis not particularly delicate.\u201d\nShe is deeply self-deprecating, saying she was horrified to be doing \u201ca celebrity memoir.\u201d She said she was sure The New Yorker would not review the book, and that years ago, her first meeting at Grove only occurred because Elisabeth Schmitz, the editorial director, was doing a favor for a mutual friend.\n\u201cMy first thought on being pitched the book was, \u2018I don\u2019t do this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to publish a celebrity memoir,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Schmitz, who has acquired literary memoirs like the naturalist Helen Macdonald\u2019s \u201cH is for Hawk.\u201d But something about Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s writing made her reconsider. \u201cFrom the first page,\u201d she said, \u201cher language is fresh, surprising, unpredictable.\u201d\nI\u2019ve read it, and her writing really is compelling. Ms. Brennan-Jobs takes the same linguistic knife to herself as she does to others. She writes with disgust about using anecdotes from her childhood to elicit sympathy from others, and she is ashamed to have dropped her father\u2019s name during an interview to get into Harvard.\nOn Aug. 1, Vanity Fair published an excerpt from \u201cSmall Fry\u201d under the digital headline \u201cI Have a Secret. My Father Is Steve Jobs.\u201d A few nights later, Ms. Brennan-Jobs called me, worried. She hated the title, and on social media, readers were feasting on the more savage details of her account \u2014 especially the \u201ctoilet\u201d comment.\n\u201cHe was telling me the truth,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, adding that the rosewater perfume she wore had turned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. Sometimes it\u2019s nice of someone to tell you what you smell like.\u201d\nIt was another uncomfortable reminder that even though \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s story \u2014 one written in a precise, literary style \u2014 her father\u2019s myth looms so large that she cannot control how her words are received. When choosing a narrator for the audio version, she nixed the ones who spoke his lines too harshly or without humor.\nSo much of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort with the memoir seems to be to show how brutal Steve Jobs could be \u2014 and, in doing so, to reclaim that brutality for herself. And how she wants to reclaim it is to love it.\n\u201cYou get your inheritance, delivered in a lump of coal or whatever in a sort of awful package,\u201d she told me at one point. \u201cAnd you have to take a lot of time to turn the awful package on its head, and it reveals something kind of glorious, and then you\u2019re set free.\u201d\nIf Ms. Brennan-Jobs was alarmed by the reaction to the toilet-water excerpt, she may be unprepared for what happens when readers encounter more disturbing material. Several times in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs engages in what seems like inappropriate affection in front of his daughter.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs describes him embracing Ms. Powell Jobs one day, \u201cpulling her in to a kiss, moving his hand closer to her breasts,\u201d and up her thigh, \u201cmoaning theatrically.\u201d\nWhen Ms. Brennan-Jobs tries to leave, her father stops her: \u201c\u2018Hey Lis,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stay here. We\u2019re having a family moment. It\u2019s important that you try to be part of this family.\u2019 I sat still, looking away as he moaned and undulated.\u201d\nMs. Brennan-Jobs emphasized in an interview that she never felt threatened by her father, and that to her, these scenes show he was \u201cjust awkward.\u201d\nThis kind of display was not an isolated incident, said Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019 mother, who described an upsetting, sexualized conversation between Mr. Jobs and their daughter in her 2013 memoir, \u201cA Bite in the Apple.\u201d One evening, Ms. Brennan writes, she let Mr. Jobs babysit 9-year-old Lisa. When Ms. Brennan came home early, she found Mr. Jobs with the girl, \u201cteasing her nonstop about her sexual aspirations,\u201d \u201cridiculing her with sexual innuendos,\u201d and \u201cjoking about bedroom antics between Lisa and this or that guy.\u201d\nMs. Brennan, in her memoir, describes feeling scared for her daughter that night, and wanting to place her body between them and get out of there. \u201cI will be clear,\u201d Ms. Brennan writes. \u201cSteve was not a sexual predator of children. There was something else going on.\u201d Still, after that night, Ms. Brennan tried to make sure there was \u201ca chaperone\u201d when Mr. Jobs was with his young daughter for long hours, she told me recently.\n\u201cHe was so inappropriate because he didn\u2019t know how to do better,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. In her book, she characterizes Mr. Jobs as \u201con a slide whistle between human and inhuman.\u201d\nOne afternoon in August, as Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I talked in her kitchen, she made a juice of dandelion greens, pineapple, turmeric and ginger roots. She eats an extremely healthy diet and knows it mirrors her father\u2019s, which veered into esoteric California wellness trends, even as pancreatic cancer took over more of his body.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs has a husband, Bill, a longtime Microsoft employee now launching a software start-up. He has two daughters, aged 10 and 12, and he and Ms. Brennan-Jobs have a 4-month-old son. As she drinks her juice, Bill is nearby with the children, and there\u2019s an easygoing energy in the house.\n\u201cI see my husband and the way he is with his daughters \u2014 responsive and alive and sensitive in ways my father would have liked to be,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. \u201cMy father would have loved to be a man like that, and he surrounded himself with men like that, but he couldn\u2019t be.\u201d\nDecades after his child-support lawsuit, Mr. Jobs erased his paternity again. \u201cSmall Fry\u201d notes that on his corporate bio on the Apple website, the detail-obsessed chief executive was listed as having three children. But of course he had four.\nThe most public torchbearer for Mr. Jobs\u2019s character and legacy is Ms. Powell Jobs. With an inherited fortune of some $21 billion, she has engaged in philanthropy and launched the Emerson Collective, an organization that pursues liberal political activism and for-profit investments, and owns a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine.\nMs. Powell Jobs plays a somewhat \u201ctonic note\u201d in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. Her stepmother brings her into family photos, for example, but many of the descriptions of Ms. Powell Jobs are biting.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs told me that she gave Ms. Powell Jobs \u201cthe best line\u201d in the book. It appears in a scene where Ms. Powell Jobs and Mr. Jobs go to a therapy session with a teenage Lisa. Ms. Brennan-Jobs cries and says she feels lonely and has wanted her parents to say good night to her.\nMs. Powell Jobs responds to the therapist: \u201cWe\u2019re just cold people.\u201d\nToward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life, he finally apologized to his daughter. Ms. Brennan-Jobs calls it her \u201cmovie ending.\u201d In the book, she writes that Mr. Jobs said he was sorry he had not spent more time with her, and for disappearing during her adulthood, forgetting birthdays and not returning notes or calls.\nIn reply, Ms. Brennan-Jobs says she knows he was busy. Mr. Jobs answers that he acted the way he did because she had offended him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was busy. It was because I was mad you didn\u2019t invite me to the Harvard weekend,\u201d he says in the book, referring to a matriculation event.\nHe also cries and tells her over and over again, \u201cI owe you one\u201d \u2014 a famously articulate communicator unable to summon the basic language of contrition.\nMs. Brennan-Jobs may be experiencing a kind of author\u2019s remorse as her book makes its way toward store shelves. But details as lethal as these \u2014 they sink into Mr. Jobs\u2019s legend like daggers to the hilt \u2014 are more proof than any DNA test that she is her father\u2019s daughter.\nUltimately, Mr. Jobs left his daughter an inheritance in the millions \u2014 the same amount as his other children \u2014 and she is not involved in the allocation of his financial legacy. If she was in charge of his billions, she says, she would give it away to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 a curious twist given her father\u2019s epic rivalry with Apple\u2019s archnemesis.\n\u201cWould it be too perverse?\u201d she asked. \u201cI feel like the Gates Foundation is really doing good stuff, and I think I would just hot potato it away.\u201d\nMs. Brennan-Jobs said she wrote \u201cSmall Fry\u201d in part to figure out why he withheld money from her even as his wealth ballooned, and as he spent it more freely on the children he had with Ms. Powell Jobs. She said she now sees it was about teaching her that money can corrupt.\nThe ethos \u201cfelt true and kind of beautiful and kind of enlightened for somebody like that,\u201d she said. Still, the question was \u201cwhy he would have taken that value system and applied it so severely to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have a value system and be unable to totally live it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can imagine being that rich and famous and how amazing it is if you can hold on to some of your value system. He didn\u2019t do it right. He didn\u2019t apply it evenly. But I feel grateful for it.\u201d\nMs. Brennan-Jobs told me she likes toying with the strange power of being a memoirist writing about trauma because the reader knows she made it out O.K. She is here in the privileged position of writing this book, after all. And as a memoirist, even a reluctant one, she gets the final word.\nOne night toward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life \u2014 and the end of the book \u2014 he is watching \u201cLaw and Order\u201d in bed.\n\u201c\u2018Are you going to write about me?\u2019\u201d he asks her.\nShe tells him no.\n\u201c\u2018Good,\u2019 he says, and turns back to the television.\u201d"
