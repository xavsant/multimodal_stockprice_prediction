        "fulltext": "Good Friday morning. Want this in your inbox every morning?Sign up here.\nIn 1997, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy. On Thursday, it became the first publicly traded American company to be worth more than $1 trillion. (Here\u2019s animated context for the number.)\nJack Niclas of the NYT explainshow the ascent was driven by \u201crapid innovation, a series of smash-hit products and the creation of a sophisticated, globe-spanning supply chain that keeps costs down while producing enormous volumes of cutting-edge devices.\u201d Tim Cook, the company\u2019s C.E.O., called it \u201ca significant milestone,\u201d but \u201cnot the most important measure\u201d of success.\nButShira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion arguesthat slowing iPhone sales growth and shrinking margins could mean Apple\u2019s value is overblown. \u201cChanges are giving Apple a fundamentally different financial look,\u201d she writes, \u201cand investors haven\u2019t yet been forced to confront how much this altered Apple should be worth.\u201d\nMore generally,Matt Phillips of the NYT saysthe milestone should give pause for reflection on powerful megacompanies and consolidated profits. The effectsaren\u2019t entirely benign:\nEconomists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\nThe chief executive of CBS Corporation, Leslie Moonves, spoke to Wall Street analysts on Thursday aboutthe company\u2019s financial results. \u201cWe\u2019re as confident as ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel very good about the future.\u201d But analysts were allowed to ask questions only about financial results, so discussion of sexual harassment accusations against Mr. Moonves were off-limits.\nTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Opinion arguesthat shareholders should be worried. \u201cTwo of the biggest hallmarks of good corporate governance are transparency and accountability,\u201d she writes. \u201cCBS\u2019s board has failed at both.\u201d\nCharlie Gasparino of Fox Businesshas a more straightforward take: \u201cIf you listened to the call, you would think Moonves is about to be named C.E.O. of the year, rather than possibly lose his job.\u201d\n(The company beat expectations for the second quarter, reporting $3.47 billion in revenue and adjusted profit of $427 million.)\nThe threat from Russia is real,say top national security officials. \u201cOur democracy itself is in the cross hairs,\u201d Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, said, describing a \u201cpervasive\u201d campaign to influence the 2018 elections.\nEarlier this week, Facebook said it hadidentified a political influence campaigntargeting the midterm elections, though it didn\u2019t link the campaign to Russia. A Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday suggested that the U.S.had not done enough to protect itself.\nThe Trump officials were vague about how the government was responding to what they called Russia\u2019s interference campaign. But Ms. Nielsen said that \u201creal\u201d progress had been made, and that President Trump had directed them to aggressively confront the threats.\nMore tech threats:Inan Op-Ed for the NYT, Kara Swisher says Silicon Valley \u201cweaponized social media, and we are all paying the price.\u201d\nThese days, making savvy trades requires computer science talent. But many tech companies now offer salaries that rival those at hedge funds \u2014 plus a distinctive lifestyle.\nSo hedge funds are starting to offer perks inspired by Silicon Valley, like more casual workplaces and free food. They\u2019re also pushing the line that the work\u2019s not bad, either. Matthew Granade, the chief market intelligence officer at Point72,tells the FTthat \u201cthe markets are one of the hardest problems in the world.\u201d\nSome hedge fund managers may need to keep their snobbishness in check. One unnamed executive said going to Google or Facebook \u201cjust means doing advertising more efficiently.\u201d\nA UBS poll of300 business ownersshows that 88 percent believe that China engages in unfair trade practices, and 71 percent approve of additional tariffs being imposed on the nation. But 49 percent think that a full-blown trade war with China will hurt America\u2019s economy.\nAnother UBS poll of501 high net worth investorsshows that 92 percent think that China engages in unfair trade practice and that 59 percent approve of further tariffs, but 74 percent think a trade war would hurt the U.S. economy.\nOne way to parse those results:Business owners and investors think that President Trump\u2019s policies are justified, but require delicacy.\nMore trade:Mr. Trump\u2019s truce with Europe means he candouble down on China, but Beijing says that pressurewon\u2019t work. And Sonos\u2019s I.P.O. reveals the trade war is anew risk to going public.\nWhen President Trump tweeted about national employment figures a full hour before their official release on June 1, staff at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics were not pleased.Quartz reviewed around 200 emailswith complaints from those workers. Here are some anonymized quotes from the correspondence:\n\u25a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone tells Trump anything.\u201d\n\u25a0 \u201cI\u2019m guessing there won\u2019t be any repercussions for him.\u201d\n\u25a0 \u201cThere\u2019s probably some way in which this incident could be incorporated into our annual confidentiality training.\u201d\nYusuf Mehdi, the corporate vice president of Microsoft\u2019s Modern Life and Devices team,tells the Washington Postthat tech companies have a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to help people unplug. That thought, he says, is behind new features in Microsoft devices.\nHe\u2019s not alone. Facebook and Instagram arerolling out featuresthat cut screen time \u2014 by tracking app use, snoozing notifications for up to eight hours, and even setting time limits for the apps.\nIt sounds counterintuitive to dissuade people from using your products. But Big Tech has come under intense scrutiny over so-called smartphone addiction. And there\u2019s a hope that less time equals better time, which could get users to stick with social networks and products in the longer term.\nJohn Studzinski, vice chairman of investor relations and business development at Blackstone, is leaving.

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nThe slowdown in smartphone sales is hurting Foxconn far more than its biggest customer.\nThe news:Profit at the Taiwanese company \u2014 which is the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturer, making iPhones for Apple as well as devices for companies like Amazon \u2014 has fallen for two straight quarters. Foxconn reported a net profit of 17.49 billion Taiwanese dollars (about $567 million) for the quarter that ended June 2018. That is less than the 17.9 billion Taiwanese dollars it made during the same quarter a year earlier, and far below the 20.2 billion expected by analysts, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nBack story:Sales of smartphones have begun to plateau in recent years. The number of first-time purchasers of smartphones has tailed off and feature improvements have become more modest, meaning that consumers no longer feel the need to upgrade their devices as often. Other companies are also feeling the effects. Samsung, for instance,recently reported falling revenue and operating profits, blaming it partly on a decline in smartphone shipments and revenue.\nBut:One company succeeding in the face of the changing market is Apple. Itsold only 1 percent more iPhonesin the quarter that ended June compared with a year earlier. But revenue from iPhones surged 20 percent over the same period because their average selling price rose 20 percent. The secret: Apple has succeeded in convincing many people to spend as much as $1,000 on an iPhone.\nApple isFoxconn\u2019s largest customerand accounts for a large portion of its revenue. Apple has been able to maintain its revenue growth by raising prices, but Foxconn\u2019s sales have not mirrored those gains \u2014 which suggests that little of the iPhone price increase is making its way to Taiwan."

        "title": "Alex Jones and Infowars Content Is Removed From Apple, Facebook and YouTube",
        "fulltext": "Top technology companies erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones, the internet\u2019s notorious conspiracy theorist, thrusting themselves into a fraught debate over their role in regulating what can be said online.\nApple, Google, Facebook and Spotify severely restricted the reach of Mr. Jones and Infowars, his right-wing site that has been a leading peddler of false information online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have used social media for years to spread dark and bizarre theories, such as that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Apple made its move on Sunday and the others followed on Monday.\nThe actions, one of the tech companies\u2019 most aggressive efforts against misinformation, highlighted a difficult dilemma for their businesses. They have long desired to combat misinformation online, but they have also been reluctant to be arbiters of truth.\nBut since a rise of misinformation online around elections, such as the 2016 presidential vote, the tech companies have faced increasing calls from lawmakers and the news media to address their role in that spread of false information and a related increase in partisan divisions. The tech companies have recently stepped up enforcement \u2014 but that has led to accusations of political bias, largely from conservatives.\nThe moves over the last two days helped fuel that debate. \u201cWhether you like @RealAlexJones and Infowars or not, he is undeniably the victim today of collusion by the big tech giants,\u201d Nigel Farage, a British conservative politician,said on Twitter. Mr. Farage helped lead the successful campaign for the country to leave the European Union and has been interviewed by Mr. Jones. \u201cWhat price free speech?\u201d\nApple on Sunday removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app. Commenting on the move, a spokeswoman said, \u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech.\u201d\nFacebook, Spotify and Google\u2019s YouTube site, which removed some Infowars content last week, followed with stronger measures on Monday. Facebook removed four pages belonging to Mr. Jones, including one with nearly 1.7 million followers as of last month, for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d Facebook said the violations did not relate to \u201cfalse news.\u201d\nYouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which had more than 2.4 million subscribers and billions of views on its videos, for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.\nMr. Jones and Infowars are leaders in using the internet to spread right-wing conspiracy theories, an effort that was aided after Donald J. Trump appeared on Mr. Jones\u2019s show during the 2016 presidential campaign and praised Mr. Jones\u2019s reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Mr. Jones has repeatedly claimed that the government staged the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and numerous other mass shootings and tragedies.\nMr. Jones isfacing defamation lawsuitsfiled by the parents of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting for claiming that the shooting was an elaborate hoax. Most of Mr. Jones\u2019s conspiracies push a theme that a global cabal of political and corporate leaders run the world\u2019s institutions to brainwash citizens and take away their rights. Mr. Jones partly finances his operation by selling expensive nutritional supplements and vitamins between Infowars segments.\n\u201cTo many, Jones is a bad joke,\u201d said the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut the sad reality is that he has millions of followers who listen to his radio show, watch his \u2018documentaries\u2019 and read his websites, and some of them, like Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, resort to deadly violence.\u201d\nMr. Jones and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a message posted on Twitter on Monday,Mr. Jones said: \u201cThe censorship of Infowars just vindicates everything we\u2019ve been saying. Now, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech? We\u2019re all Alex Jones now.\u201d He railed against the tech companies on his live show on Monday, which was streamed on the Infowars website, saying their moves were part of a leftist agenda in advance of the midterm elections. \u201cI told you this was coming,\u201d he said to viewers.\nThe big tech firms that control, via their websites and apps, how much of the world\u2019s media content is distributed have faced criticism in recent weeks for enabling Mr. Jones and Infowars.\nSome tech companies, including Facebook and Google, hadappeared reluctant to remove Mr. Jones\u2019s pages entirelyand were instead taking action against specific videos or podcasts. YouTube, for instance, recently deleted four of Mr. Jones\u2019s videos.\nA Google spokesman said on Monday that YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel outright because he continued to flout policies he had already been penalized for violating.\nMr. Jones had amassed millions of followers, but limiting his influence does not solve the problem of false news. Hundreds of smaller publishers promote similar conspiracy theories, and millions of followers help spread those theories by reposting them.A new conspiracy theory called Qanon, for instance, has been gaining traction outside of Mr. Jones\u2019s sphere. And Infowars followers can also still repost videos and articles from the site onto YouTube and Facebook.\nBut the moves are a significant hit to Mr. Jones\u2019s ability to reach wide audiences, and particularly new followers. YouTube was a particularly important distribution channel, in part because YouTube\u2019srecommendation enginefrequently surfaced past Infowars videos to users who had shown interest in conservative topics. Terminating his YouTube channel erases all of its past videos and restricts it from posting new ones.\nMr. Jones and Infowars still have other ways to reach listeners and readers. They have increasingly been directing viewers to visit the Infowars website, which would limit their reliance on the tech companies, presumably foreseeing the bans. Twitter has not restricted the accounts of Mr. Jones or Infowars. A Twitter spokesman said the accounts were not in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules.\nOther tech companies\u2019 approach has been uneven; they have left up Infowars content on some of their services despite removing it from others.\nInfowars introduced a new smartphone app last month that is finding users on Apple\u2019s App store and Google\u2019s Play Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 23rd most popular news app on the Google Play store and the 33rd most popular news app on Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Monday, the Infowars app ranked ahead of apps like BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal on Google, and ahead of apps like MSNBC and Bloomberg on Apple.\nApple decided to allow the Infowars app on its store after reviewing it, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Google Play Store has different policies than YouTube, a Google spokesman said.\nMatt Rivitz, a freelance copywriter who helps run a Twitter account,Sleeping Giants, thatpressures companies to distance themselvesfrom far-right groups, said Monday that the tech companies\u2019 nearly simultaneous moves against Mr. Jones proved they were acting in response to public pressure, not new data showing he broke rules.\n\u201cThe timing is very puzzling because he\u2019s been saying this stuff for years and they haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said.\nConservatives warned that more sites would be cut off soon.\n\u201cTo all other conservative news outlets \u2014 you are next,\u201d Paul Joseph Watson, a right-wing commentator and Infowars contributor,said on Twitteron Monday. \u201cThe great censorship purge has truly begun.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "When Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, sought to fend off a coup attempt two years ago, he appealed to his supporters via FaceTime, the Apple video chat app.\nOn Tuesday, though, he turned against Apple, delivering a nationalist broadside in calling for a boycott of American electronics products, the latest salvo in a widening dispute between Washington and Ankara.\nThe tension between the two countries initially centered on thedetention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor, but it has since expanded considerably, heightening trade tensions and raising fears about the possible effects on other emerging markets.\nThe clash has coincided with a worsening economic crisis in Turkey. The country\u2019s currency, the lira, has fallen sharply, dropping more than 25 percent in the past week to a record low, though it recovered somewhat on Tuesday. Inflation, meanwhile, is accelerating and investors \u2014 fearful of mismanagement asMr. Erdogan takes an increasingly active rolein the economy \u2014 have sold off Turkish debt.\nUndeterred, the Turkish leader has railed against the United States and blamed foreigners for the dire state of the economy.\n\u201cEvery product that we buy in foreign currency from outside, we will produce them here and sell abroad,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said during a speech in Ankara, drawing applause and cheers. \u201cWe will boycott the electronics products of the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cIf they have the iPhone, there is Samsung\u201d as an alternative, he continued, referring to Apple\u2019s principal rival in the smartphone business.\nThe comments by the Turkish leader were particularly remarkable given that he and several of his top ministers are frequently seen with iPhones. In mid-2016,as he battled the coup attempt, Mr. Erdogan used FaceTime to call for his supporters to take to the streets.\nHis speech on Tuesday nevertheless largely reiterated many of the nationalist remarks he has made in recent days, seeking to rally support against American sanctions and other pressure.\n\u201cThe Turkish nation has many times shown that if its independence and its future was at risk, it would put forward its life, its property and all its wealth,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe will stand against the dollar, currency rates, inflation, interest rates. I believe in my nation.\u201d\n[Read moreabout how Turkey\u2019s economic crisis is testing the limits of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian approach.]\nHe then repeated his call for Turks to trade in their dollars for lira, to help shore up the currency. \u201cExchanging the dollar immediately to protect the honor of the Turkish lira, this would be the best answer,\u201d he said.\nThough Turkey is a relatively small economy in the global context, investors have beenfearful of the wider consequencesof an economic crisis there. Analysts have voiced concern that worsening conditions in the country could force traders to pull money from emerging markets and noted that European banks have investments in Turkey that could be at risk.\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s heavy involvement in managing the country\u2019s economy, which has resulted in the appointment of a relative as a key minister and the erosion of the independence of the central bank, has added to the concerns.\nMany in Turkey, however, have stood by him.\nOne barber shop in the northern Turkish province of Ordu responded to United States sanctions imposed over the detention of the American pastor by refusing to carry out haircuts that residents associate with the United States.\n\u201cWe do not do American shaves,\u201da sign outside the hair salon read, referring to a common hairstyle in Turkey in which the neck is trimmed closely, but hair at the top of the head is kept longer."

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nApple\u2019s flirtation with $1 trillion may be distracting investors from a big challenge: Can customers stomach continued price increases for its iPhone?\nInvestors were impressed when Apple reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter, or the three months through June, on Tuesday. The company\u2019s stock jumped nearly 6 percent on Wednesday and pushed its market value to nearly $973 billion.\nApple sold only 1 percent more iPhones, by far its main source of revenue, than a year earlier. But revenue from iPhones surged 20 percent from a year earlier because their average selling price rose 20 percent.\nThe positive spin was that Apple was able to keep its sales price up. Customers, it seems, are willing to pay $1,000 or more for the iPhone X, released at the end of 2017.\nThe average iPhone price usually drops as the selling cycle progresses. That is happening this year, but the decline has not been as steep. The $724 average price in Apple\u2019s third quarter was 9 percent below the $796 average in the company\u2019s first quarter (the fourth quarter of 2017). That was less than the 13 percent decline after the iPhone release at the end of 2016.\nAnd the company\u2019s revenue forecast suggests that the iPhone\u2019s financial performance is not about to disappoint in the current quarter.\nWhat\u2019s not to like about this situation? Apple may not be able to get away with such a large price increase when it releases its new phones at the end of this fiscal year. When the current batch of iPhones was released, Apple hoisted its average iPhone price by 29 percent, by far the highest increase of the past five releases. In other words, there may not be much headroom left for further hikes, especially since the new iPhones are not expected to be substantially different from the current models.\nJeffrey Kvaal, an analyst at Nomura, forecasts that the average iPhone price will rise only 3 percent in Apple\u2019s 2019 fiscal year, compared with 15 percent for all of its 2018 fiscal year.\nOf course, if Apple does try to charge a lot more, it may sell fewer iPhones, denting revenue as a result. And iPhone sales in China, a huge and growing market for Apple, will be at risk if a full-blown trade war with the United States breaks out and Chinese consumers pull back as a result.\nApple makes so much money that it can ride out underwhelming iPhone cycles. Investors, however, have in the past soured on Apple\u2019s stock when its iPhones fail to excite and revenue fails to match investors\u2019 high expectations. So far, selling expensive iPhones has kept Apple\u2019s profits surging and pushed its valuation within spitting distance of $1 trillion. But the strategy may not have staying power, and Apple could just as easily stumble after it has passed that milestone."

        "title": "Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.",
        "fulltext": "Just days after Google, Facebook and Apple purged videos and podcastsfrom the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars from their sites, the Infowars app has become one of the hottest in the country.\nOn Wednesday, Infowars was the No. 1 overall \u201ctrending\u201d app on the Google Play store, a metric that reflects its sudden momentum. Among news apps, Infowars was No. 3 on Apple and No. 5 on Google, above all mainstream news organizations. And the app stood at No. 66 overall on Google, excluding game apps, while on Apple it reached No. 49, above popular apps like LinkedIn, Google Docs and eBay.\nThe Infowars app, which includes news articles and the shows of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, had likely been downloaded a few hundred to a few thousand times a day on average after its introduction last month, said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, which tracks app data. Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.\nThe surge suggests the tech industry\u2019s recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles.\n\u201cThis is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,\u201d said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s gone from being niche to being mainstream.\u201d\nStill, the action by the tech companies likely reduced the overall audience for Infowars because it had relied so much on viewers fromApple, Faceook and YouTube, a unit of Google.\ntranscript\nAlex Jones is the internet\u2019s most notorious conspiracy theorist. And with his site, Infowars, he\u2019s peddled a number of dark and bizarre conspiracy theories. \u201cSandy Hook, it\u2019s got inside job written all over it. You want us to cover Pizzagate. We have covered it. We are covering it. And all I know is \u2014 God help us \u2014 we\u2019re in the hands of pure evil.\u201d After weeks of criticism, YouTube, Facebook, Apple, and Spotify all acted to essentially erase many of his videos and posts from their services. In many cases, the companies are saying he violated their terms regarding hate speech and a number of other rules. Alex Jones today in his show dedicated nearly all four hours to what he called censorship of his platform. \u201cAnd President Trump, the Republican Congress, the statehouses, independent media all need to rally together against this global move to censor America and the planet.\u201d And this is something that he essentially has been warning his followers of because there was sort of ticky-tacky enforcement for several weeks, and he sort of saw this coming. \u201cThis is the internet purge, people.\u201d I think for those who have tracked the social media policies by some of these big tech firms, today was a significant moment, because these tech companies have really struggled with this dilemma of wanting to combat misinformation online, but at the same time not wanting to become arbiters of truth. \u201cCan you define hate speech?\u201d \u201cSenator, I think that this is a really hard question. And I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why we struggle with it.\u201d For months, and really for years, the tech companies have been reluctant to weigh in on a lot of these controversial speech issues. But it appears after months of criticism, that tech companies have finally said, in the case of Alex Jones, that enough is enough.\nThat the Infowars app has also thrived on Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores just days after the companies removed its content from other parts of their sites highlights theconfusing nature of the tech companies\u2019 rulesand their enforcement of them.\nApple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed.\nThe Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d \u201cWar Room with Owen Shroyer,\u201d and \u201cReal News with David Knight.\u201d Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store.\n\u201cWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines.\u201d\nGoogle said it deleted Mr. Jones\u2019s channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment \u2014 not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones\u2019s podcast and his Infowars app.\nGoogle said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, \u201cIf an app violates our policies, we take action.\u201d\nFrom July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app\u2019s rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days.\nResearchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula.\nMr. Jones has achieved infamy and financial successfor spreading lies, such as many mass shootings are government hoaxes and Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Many of his most outlandish claims are made during his show, which runs live for four hours each weekday and is streamed and rebroadcast across the internet.\nYouTube, Facebook, Spotify and Apple\u2019s podcasts service were all important distribution points for the show, but Mr. Jones and his Infowars colleagues this week haveurged viewersto find the show on Infowars\u2019 website and app. He and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a \u201cyou\u201d tab for saved articles.)\nOn the tab that led to the outlet\u2019s news articles, a sampling of the app\u2019s stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (\u201cDemocrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!\u201d) to sensationalist (\u201cShock: FDA Acquiring \u2018Fresh\u2019 Aborted Baby Parts to Make \u2018Humanized Mice\u2019\u201d) to humdrum (\u201cCalorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years \u2014 Study\u201d).\nMany of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley\u2019s removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category \u201cInfowars Exclusives\u201d on the app included no stories.\nThe merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills.\nOne ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with \u201ccensored\u201d tape over his mouth and said: \u201cFight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special. Shop now!\u201d\nThe app has earned a nearly perfect rating on Apple after 5,500 reviews. \u201cGood to have IW on the go, able to keep up with what the Democrat globalist Luciferian communist are up to at all times,\u201d one recent review said."

        "title": "A Better Way to Ban Alex Jones",
        "fulltext": "Let me start by making a few things abundantly clear. First, Alex Jones is a loathsome conspiracy theorist who generates loathsome content. Second, there is no First Amendment violation when a private company chooses to boot anyone off a private platform. Third, it seems reasonably clear that Mr. Jones\u2019s content isn\u2019t just morally repugnant, it\u2019s alsolegallyproblematic. He makes wild, false claims that may well cross the line into libel and slander.\nRight now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it and undoubtedly there\u2019s a cover-up, there\u2019s actors, they\u2019re manipulating, they\u2019ve been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\u201d\nSo on Monday, when Apple, Facebook and YouTube acted \u2014in seemingly coordinated fashion\u2014 to remove the vast bulk of Mr. Jones\u2019s content from their sites, there\u2019s no cause for worry, right? After all, this was an act of necessary public hygiene. A terrible human being who has no regard for truth or decency is finally getting what he deserves.\nWould that it were that simple.\nThere are reasons to be deeply concerned that the tech companies banned Alex Jones. In short, the problem isn\u2019t exactlywhatthey did, it\u2019swhythey did it.\nRather than applying objective standards that resonate with American law and American traditions of respect for free speech and the marketplace of ideas, the companies applied subjective standards that are subject to considerable abuse. Apple said it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Facebook accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d or using \u201cdehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d YouTube accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201chate speech and harassment.\u201d\nThese policies sound good on first reading, but they areextraordinarily vague. We live in times when the slightest deviation from the latest and ever-changing social justice style guide is deemed bigoted and, yes, \u201cdehumanizing.\u201d We live in a world where the Southern Poverty Law Center, a formerly respected civil-rights organization, abuses its past trust to label a host of mainstream organizations (including my former employer, the Alliance Defending Freedom) and individuals as \u201chate groups,\u201d \u201cwhite nationalists\u201d or \u201canti-Muslim extremists,\u201d based sometimes on disagreements about theology or sexual morality or sometimes on outrightmisreadingsandmisrepresentationsof an individual\u2019s beliefs and views.\nExhibit A of how wrong the center has been: In June, it paid Maajid Nawaz $3.375 million for labeling him an \u201canti-Muslim extremist.\u201d This is rich, considered Mr. Nawaz is a former Islamist turned Muslim reformer.\nYet Big Tech still listens to the Southern Poverty Law Center and takes action to punish its targets.Amazon recently booted Alliance Defending Freedomfrom its AmazonSmile charity program because of the center\u2019s designation.\nJust last year, multiple internet companies took coordinated action to attempt to remove a vile white supremacist website, The Daily Stormer, from the internet. Days later, ProPublica published anextended pieceanalyzing how tech companies like PayPal help \u201cmonetize hate.\u201d The first example ProPublica provided? An organization called Jihad Watch. It\u2019s controversial, to be sure, but it is miles from The Daily Stormer. Moreover, ProPublica acknowledged that it used the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s list (at least in part) to compile its own analysis of \u201chate sites,\u201d including sites for groups like the Family Research Council.\nOne doesn\u2019t even have to look to Big Tech to see the almost infinite malleability of the \u201chate speech\u201d label. In the name of stopping hate speech, university mobs have turned their ire not just against alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer, but also against the most mainstream of conservative voices, like Ben Shapiro and Heather Mac Donald.\nDissenting progressives aren\u2019t spared, either. Just ask Evergreen State College\u2019s Bret Weinstein, who was hounded out of a job after refusing to participate in a \u201cday of absence\u201d protest in which white students and faculty members were supposed to leave campus for the day to give students and faculty members of color exclusive access to the college.\nThe good news is that tech companies don\u2019t have to rely on vague, malleable and hotly contested definitions of hate speech to deal with conspiracy theorists like Mr. Jones. The far better option would be to prohibit libel or slander on their platforms.\nTo be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike \u201chate speech,\u201d libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. It\u2019s properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims.\nIt\u2019s a high bar. But it\u2019s a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever-shifting norms in language and culture and provides protection for aggrieved parties. Nor do tech companies have to wait for sometimes yearslong legal processes to work themselves out. They can use their greater degree of freedom to conduct their own investigations. Those investigations would rightly be based on concrete legal standards, not wholly subjective measures of offensiveness.\nPrivate corporations can ban whoever they like. But if companies like Facebook are eager to navigate speech controversies in good faith, they would do well to learn from the centuries of legal developments in American law. When creating a true marketplace of ideas, why not let the First Amendment be your guide?\nDavid French (@DavidAFrench) is a First Amendment litigator and senior writer for National Review."

And that figure could reach a record $1 trillion by the end of the year.\nThe surge in buyback announcements is likely to stoke further debate about the $1.5 trillion tax cuts enacted late last year. The overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The White House and congressional Republicans said the tax bill would encourage companies to make long-term investments and would provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the American economy. Democrats argued the legislation would lead to an increase in share buybacks and wouldn\u2019t stimulate corporate investments.\nSo far the pace of hiring has picked up this year, though wage growth has remained stubbornly slow, andbusiness investment in equipment increasedmore slowly in the first half of the year.\nCompanies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock indexpurchased a record $178 billionof their own shares in the first quarter of 2018. Apple, a big beneficiary of the new tax law, has ramped up its repurchases this year. Through the first two quarters of this year, the iPhone makerbought $43.5 billion of its own stock, the most on record for a six-month period, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.& P. Dow Jones Indices.\nAt a time when other stock investors \u2014 households, mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 are selling shares, buybacks could be a source of demand in the coming months, Goldman said. That could be particularly the case for the shares of technology companies. The sector has accounted for 40 percent of the buybacks authorizations this year, but only 21 percent of the actual stock purchases.\nStill, Goldman does not expect buybacks to lift the S. & P. 500 much this year. The firm predicted the index will finish 2018 where it is currently trading: 2,850."

        "fulltext": "Not long after several of the country\u2019s biggest tech firms \u2014 namely Apple, Facebook and Google \u2014 kicked the conspiracy theorist Alex Jonesoff their various online platforms, Mr. Jones\u2019s allies complained that he had been deprived of his First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\u201cSocial media goes Gestapo!\u201d wrote Bill Mitchell, a conservative Twitter personality with 366,000 followers, on Monday evening.\n\u201cThe great censorship purge has truly begun,\u201d warned Paul Joseph Watson, a contributor to Mr. Jones\u2019s website, Infowars.\nAnd in his own message on Twitter, one platform that hasn\u2019t removed his content, Mr. Jones asked: \u201cNow, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech?\u201d\nThe removal of Mr. Jones and Infowars came after months of mounting pressure on technology companies to tackle the spread of misinformation online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. On Sunday, Apple removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app and by Monday Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube had followed with similar measures.\nBut this isn\u2019t the only effort to stop Mr. Jones from spreading his theories. He also faces multiple defamation claims, and well before Monday\u2019s moves, several scholars of free speech had already concluded that many of the things he has said online were not in fact protected by the First Amendment.\ntranscript\nAlex Jones is the internet\u2019s most notorious conspiracy theorist. And with his site, Infowars, he\u2019s peddled a number of dark and bizarre conspiracy theories. \u201cSandy Hook, it\u2019s got inside job written all over it. You want us to cover Pizzagate. We have covered it. We are covering it. And all I know is \u2014 God help us \u2014 we\u2019re in the hands of pure evil.\u201d After weeks of criticism, YouTube, Facebook, Apple, and Spotify all acted to essentially erase many of his videos and posts from their services. In many cases, the companies are saying he violated their terms regarding hate speech and a number of other rules. Alex Jones today in his show dedicated nearly all four hours to what he called censorship of his platform. \u201cAnd President Trump, the Republican Congress, the statehouses, independent media all need to rally together against this global move to censor America and the planet.\u201d And this is something that he essentially has been warning his followers of because there was sort of ticky-tacky enforcement for several weeks, and he sort of saw this coming. \u201cThis is the internet purge, people.\u201d I think for those who have tracked the social media policies by some of these big tech firms, today was a significant moment, because these tech companies have really struggled with this dilemma of wanting to combat misinformation online, but at the same time not wanting to become arbiters of truth. \u201cCan you define hate speech?\u201d \u201cSenator, I think that this is a really hard question. And I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why we struggle with it.\u201d For months, and really for years, the tech companies have been reluctant to weigh in on a lot of these controversial speech issues. But it appears after months of criticism, that tech companies have finally said, in the case of Alex Jones, that enough is enough.\nIn a recent court filing, four law professors who specialize in free-speech issues said that Mr. Jones\u2019s oeuvre was riddled with \u201cabsurd conspiracy theories\u201d and urged a federal judge considering a lawsuit against him not to let him hide behind the First Amendment while publishing his rhetoric.\n\u201cFalse speech does not serve the public interest the way that true speech does,\u201d the scholars wrote. \u201cAnd indeed, there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201d\nThe filing \u2014 an amicus, or friend of the court, brief \u2014 was submitted in June in the case of Brennan Gilmore, a former State Department official and Democratic Party activist who attended last summer\u2019s violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Gilmore, 39, was on the street on Aug. 12 when James Alex Fields Jr.drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing a woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring several others.\nAfter Mr. Gilmore posted a video of the episode online and spoke about it repeatedly to the media, Mr. Jonespublished his own video on Infowars, accusing him in a rambling jeremiad of being a plant from the Central Intelligence Agency employed by the billionaire George Soros.\nIn a breathless moment (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s like, whoa, whoa \u2014 C.I.A.?\u201d), Mr. Jones went on to suggest that Mr. Gilmore may have been involved in the attack on Ms. Heyer to bring about what he described as \u201cthe downfall of Trump.\u201d\nIn March, Mr. Gilmore sued Mr. Jones for defamation, arguing that he had suffered threats and harassment because of the report.\nMr. Jones is alsofacing defamation lawsuitsfiled by the parents of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut for claiming the attack was an elaborate hoax. But the Gilmore suit is the first against Mr. Jones in which a judge, Norman K. Moon of Federal District Court in Charlottesville, has directly sought the opinion of First Amendment scholars.\nIn defending himself, Mr. Jones has claimed in court papers that his allegations concerning Mr. Gilmore were \u201copinion, not statements of fact\u201d and that Infowars is a \u201cfreewheeling\u201d website, \u201cin which hyperbole and diatribe reign as the preferred tools of discourse.\u201d His viewers, Mr. Jones maintained, \u201cexpect an interview or monologue to be more free-flowing and opinionated and less precise in its use of language than an article or a book.\u201d\nWhile they acknowledged that the protection of speech is \u201ca priority of the first order,\u201d the First Amendment scholars, from institutions like Rutgers University and the University of Chicago Law School, noted that since the Middle Ages defamation law has created \u201csocial boundaries about what speech is and is not acceptable.\u201d It has also, they wrote, long sought to balance the freedom of expression with the safeguarding of people\u2019s reputations.\nTo do this, the scholars said, defamation statutes have always restricted some speech \u2014 especially for private figures like Mr. Gilmore, who have less of an ability than those like Mr. Jones with media platforms to \u201cdisseminate their own side of the story.\u201d\nThe scholars were particularly scathing when it came to Mr. Jones\u2019s contention that his videos on Infowars reflected nothing more than his beliefs. It would set a dangerous precedent, they said, if Judge Moon ruled on his behalf.\n\u201cIt would allow unscrupulous news organizations to couch their language as \u2018opinion\u2019 and to mask their meaning with implication and insinuation,\u201d the scholars wrote. That, they added, would leave \u201creaders clear as to the message but avoiding all liability for defamatory remarks. This should not be allowed and, in fact, is not allowed.\u201d\nThe law professors who signed the amicus brief were Lyrissa B. Lidsky, dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, Tamara R. Piety at the University of Tulsa College of Law, David A. Strauss from the University of Chicago Law School, and Carlos A. Ball of Rutgers.\nThe brief was also signed by Michael B. Hissam, a lawyer at the firm of Bailey & Glasser in Charleston, W.Va., who is amicus counsel for Mr. Gilmore, and Katharine M. Mapes and Katherine O\u2019Konski, lawyers at the firm of Spiegel & McDiarmid in Washington."

        "title": "Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google: Which Can Carry on a Conversation Best?",
        "fulltext": "ByKEITH COLLINSandCADE METZAUG. 17, 2018\n\nDigital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can carry on a good conversation.\nAs the devices that run these assistants become more commonplace \u2014 39 million Americans now own one, according to arecent study\u2014 Amazon and competitors like Apple and Google foresee a day when you can chat with their assistants like you would with a friend.\nWe explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments \u2014 even in the moments when the assistants screwed up \u2014 showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.\nBecause these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how.\nRight away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called \u201cthese things\u201d to a shopping list.\nIf your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said \u201cguacamole, chips, tortillas,\u201d he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn\u2019t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it.\nAlexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren\u2019t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.\nA digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.\nWhen you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you\u2019ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.\nEngineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time \u2014 a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.\nIn some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.\nEven if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with.\nIf you\u2019re a sports fan, you know there are two professional teams that call themselves the Giants. If someone asks about a Giants game in the summer, you know they\u2019re talking about the San Francisco Giants, who play baseball.When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.\nWhen we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.\nAlexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.\nWhen you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.\nAfter recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.\nEngineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It\u2019s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.\nAll of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don\u2019t change anything.\nMachine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\n\u201cIf you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,\u201d said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. \u201cThe technology operates by different rules than people do.\u201d\nIn the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don\u2019t use a pronoun?\nThe devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That\u2019s likely because each device is using a different \u201cknowledge graph,\u201d a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp.\nAmazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was \u201csluggish.\u201d\nA neural network also drives Google\u2019s new \u201cconversational mode.\u201d\nIn the past, you couldn\u2019t talk to the device without saying \u201cHey, Google.\u201d Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command \u2014 and when you\u2019re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with the interactions other people have had with their devices. Basically, Google\u2019s customers are helping Google build a smarter product.\nDon\u2019t expect these devices to tell you what they think \u2014 or even what other people think. It\u2019s easier to build technology that sticks to the facts. After asking these devices to identify the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which they all did correctly, we asked for their opinion of his work. None of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question, and Google eventually lost the context altogether.\n\n\nEngineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do, but conversation is such a complex task, even machine learning approaches will need years \u2014 or perhaps decades \u2014 to completely solve the problem.\nThese devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self-reflection or complex analysis.\nThis is an incredibly difficult question for a computer to answer, unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it. Many times, these devices will just reply with canned responses, as Google did with the Muffin Man bit.\nLeading researchers havebuilt experimental neural networks that learn to carry on richer conversations by analyzing reams of real (human) dialogue, like exchanges on Twitter or Facebook Messenger. But these neural networks can veer into nonsense. They tend to reinforce the flaws of human conversation (gender bias, rudeness, maybe even racism). And they don\u2019t dovetail very well with the structured systems that drive today\u2019s digital assistants. Bridging the gap between these experiments and practical products like the Amazon Echo will take some time.\nFor now, you will have to make do with the Muffin Man.\nNote: The devices tested were the Apple HomePod, the Amazon Echo Plus and the Google Home. They were each tested separately. The phrases used to trigger the devices \u2014 \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey, Google,\u201d respectively \u2014 were used before each interaction, and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity.\nAudio production by Brad Fisher\nAdvertisement"
