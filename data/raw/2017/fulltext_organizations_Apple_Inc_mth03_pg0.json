        "fulltext": "Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.\nOver the last three years, Apple\u2019s iPads and Mac notebooks \u2014 which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 \u2014 havesteadily lost groundto Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and are produced bySamsung, Acer and other computer makers.\nMobile devices that run on Apple\u2019s iOS and MacOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according toa reportreleased on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.\nOf the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015, according to the report. School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said.\n\u201cApple is struggling,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource.\nApple said education was a longstanding value for the company.\n\u201cMac and iPad are the best tools in education to help teachers teach and students learn,\u201d Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly passionate about education and new programs like Apple Teacher,\u201d a site for teachers who want to learn how to more creatively use Apple tools with their students, she said.\nThe rise of Google\u2019s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years.\nApple has recently widened its education offerings. Last year, it introduced an app,called Classroom, to help teachers see and manage their students\u2019 activities on iPads. It also createda free iPad app, called Swift Playgrounds,that introduces students to writing computer code.\nThe shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple\u2019s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion.\nThe Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google\u2019s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper \u2014 and often faster to boot up \u2014 than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives.\nBecause Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once.\nThen there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad\u2019s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests.\nThe public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,\u201d said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads.\nTo compete with Chromebooks, Microsoftannouncedlast month that it had worked with Acer, HP and Lenovo to develop low-cost Windows laptops for schools, with prices starting at $189. The company also introduced an app, called Microsoft Intune for Education, to enable schools to more easily set up and manage their Windows devices.\nGoogle, for its part,announcedlast month that it had worked with Asus and Acer to develop for schools new Chromebooks that can also convert to tablets."

Choose Get Info from the menu to see details about the drive, including format.\nLarger external drives designed for Windows users can sometimes be formatted asNTFS (New Technology File System), which Macs can only read, but not write unless youdo some extra fiddling. If you want to use an external NTFS drive with both computer platforms, you can reformat with a FAT32 system, but reformatting effectively erases all the data on the drive."

        "title": "WikiLeaks Will Help Tech Companies Fix Security Flaws, Assange Says",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden.\nBut on Thursday, fresh from revealing thelargest leak of classified documents in C.I.A. history, Mr. Assange tried to turn the tables on his critics, presenting himself as a defender of the United States\u2019 top technology companies from overreaching, double-dealing American spies.\nThe 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week \u2014 the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said \u2014 showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.\nSo Mr. Assange, speaking by video in anonline news conference, offered a lifeline to the companies, saying the antisecrecy organization was prepared to share leaked computer code that it has not yet published with Apple, Google and other technology companies to help them fix the flaws described in the leaked C.I.A. documents.\n\u201cWe have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,\u201d Mr. Assange said.\nThe companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code.\n\u201cI do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified,\u201d he said at a press briefing. \u201cIt remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not.\u201d\nMicrosoft suggested in a statement that it did not want to be seen as collaborating with WikiLeaks, declaring dryly that its \u201cpreferred method for anyone with knowledge of security issues, including the C.I.A. or WikiLeaks, is to submit details to us atsecure@microsoft.com.\u201d Microsoft, Apple and Google all said that some of the C.I.A. attacks had targeted old versions of their software and would be blocked by recent updates.\nWikiLeaks\u2019 reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyone\u2019s communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A.\n\u201cWhy has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?\u201d he asked.\nThe C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\u201d the C.I.A. statement said. \u201cDespite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.\u201d\nBy his offer, Assange was inserting WikiLeaks into a strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives believe their products\u2019 reputations are endangered by aggressive American espionage efforts.\nThe Obama administration addressed this conflict by setting up a formal review process for technical vulnerabilities that the government discovered \u2014 or purchased from hackers.\nWhen an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a company\u2019s technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm.\n\u201cThe default position was to disclose the vulnerability,\u201d said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry.\nBut there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a \u201czero day\u201d flaw \u2014 so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it.\nNot all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the \u201ctools,\u201d or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that \u201call the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process.\u201d That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval.\nA newRAND Corporation studyconcludes that these \u201czero day\u201d exploits, and the vulnerabilities they are based on, last longer than most thought. It found that the average vulnerability had a \u201clife expectancy\u201d of 6.9 years before it became useless to hackers.\nBrian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.\n\u201cIf you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked,\u201d he said.\nBut he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. \u201cThe likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications.\nWhile WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons.\n\u201cHe is trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. Granick said.\nShe said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies.\nPaul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry.\n\u201cThere are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of who\u2019s using them, is to help them get fixed.\u201d"

Did Apple do this on purpose? How am I supposed to watch movies on a plane?\nA.Asannounced last fall, Apple\u2019snew TV appconsolidates the purchased television shows, movies, iTunes Store rentals, home video and content from manystreaming servicesin one place. In the United States, the TV app replaces the old Videos app when an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch is updated to iOS 10.2.\nWhile the TV app brings benefits like the ability to sign into services from cable or satellite television that require a user name and passwordin just one place(instead of within each individual channel app), iOS users havecomplained onlinefor months about various bugs in the software. Theinability to watch videos without an internet connectionhas been a frequently mentioned grievance. You can file your own report on any issues you are having with the TV app onApple\u2019s official product feedback page.\nBefore you hit the road, you should make sure the videos you want to play on the iPad have been fully downloaded to the device and are not past purchases that are displayed as part of your iTunes in the Cloud library; on the iPad version of the app, tap the Library menu button in the upper-left corner and choose Downloaded to see the files currently residing on your tablet. If you want totake a previously purchased video with youfrom elsewhere in your library, tap the cloud-shaped download arrow to grab a copy. (As a quick check, flip on theAirplane Modesetting and test your videos to make sure they play before you leave.)\nIn some situations the TV app does require an internet connection. As the central hub for all video-related files in iOS, you do need to be online if you want to stream video on the iPad from a service like Showtime or HBO Now. Movie rentals and some purchased content you have downloaded often require a quick internet check-in with the iTunes Store first to confirm your right to play the files.\nDirectlytransferring video files to the iPad from the iTunes libraryon the computer may also let you avoid the internet-connection issue, butsome users have reportedthat the TV app has had problems playing homemade movies from recordings or converted from DVDs. For watching content that does not have copy protections built in, switching to a third-party video app likeVLC for Mobile(which has its own mixed reviews) might be a suitable workaround.\nMany iOS users have contributed their own observations and suggestions for using the TV app. TheApple Toolbox site has a collection of tips and anecdoteson the topic if you want to tinker at your own risk, but your results may vary based on your hardware or the type of video file you are trying to play. Future software updates from Apple may also smooth out issues with the software."
