        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Things change when a spaceship comes to town.\nTourists stroll by, whipping out their iPhones to get a photo. New businesses move in. And real estate prices go up even more.\nApple\u2019s new home in Cupertino \u2014 the centerpiece being a $5 billion, four-story, 2.8 million-square-foot ring that can be seen from space and that locals call the spaceship \u2014 is still getting some final touches, and employees have just started to trickle in. The full squadron, about 12,000 people, will arrive in several months.\nBut the development of the headquarters, a 175-acre area officially called Apple Park, has already helped transform the surrounding area.\nIn Sunnyvale, a town just across the street, 95 development projects are in the planning stages. The city manager, Deanna J. Santana, said she had never seen such action before. In Cupertino, a Main Street Cupertino living and dining complex opened in early 2016. This downtown enclave includes the Lofts, a 120-unit apartment community opening this fall; small shops; and numerous restaurants and cafes.\nOther local businesses are also gearing up in anticipation. A Residence Inn at Main Street Cupertino, expected to open in September, has been slightly customized to meet the needs of Apple employees. Guests will have access to Macs and high-speed internet connections, said Mark Lynn, a partner with Sand Hill Hotel Management, which operates the hotel and consulted with Apple about what its employees need at a hotel.\n\u201cAll the things we have, lined up with what they needed,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cThey will represent a large part of our business.\u201d\nTech companies are nothing new for Cupertino. Apple has called the city home for decades, and Hewlett-Packard had a campus in Apple\u2019s new spot, employing 9,000 people. The surrounding towns have been remade as well in the last decade, as giant tech companies have transformed Silicon Valley\u2019s real estate into some of the most expensive in the country.\nBut city officials and residents say this project is like nothing they\u2019ve seen before. It is even bringing tourists.\nOnlookers snap pictures of the spaceship from the streets. TV helicopters circle above. Amateur photographers ask residents if they can stand on driveways to operate their drones, hoping to get a closer look at Apple Park.\n\u201cI just say, \u2018Hey, go ahead,\u2019\u201d said Ron Nielsen, who lives in Birdland, a Sunnyvale neighborhood across the street from the spaceship. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nDrone operators want that coveted aerial shot while pedestrians want to get an eyeful of the curved glass building before the headquarters become hidden by a man-made forest.\nThe campus is one of the last major projects started by Steven P. Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple, who died six years ago. Just a few months before his death, he went before the Cupertino City Council and laid out his vision for a futuristic circular house of glass that would foster creativity and collaboration. Two years later, the Council unanimously approved the plans for the campus.\nThe main center features the spaceship ring, the Steve Jobs Theater, a 100,000-square-foot gym and a visitors center in a woodland setting with two miles of running and walking paths. An orchard, a meadow and a pond are inside the ring.\nThe entire project shows off Apple\u2019s obsession with details. The custom windows were made in Germany and are considered the world\u2019s largest panels of curved glass. One pair of glass doors is 92 feet high. The finish on the underground concrete garage, said David Brandt, Cupertino\u2019s city manager, is so shiny it is almost like glass.\n\u201cMind-blowing, mind-blowing, mind-blowing,\u201d the mayor, Savita Vaidhyanathan, said about her visit to the site. \u201cI saw the underground 1,000-seat theater and the carbon-fiber roof. The roof was made in Dubai, and it was transported and assembled here. I love that it\u2019s here and that I can brag about it.\u201d\nMany of the public views will soon be going away. Apple Park will eventually have 9,000 trees, filling in much of the big open spaces. The public will instead have access to a visitors center with a cafe, a store and rooftop observation views.\n\u201cIt will be a separate glass structure and be set in an old-growth olive tree grove,\u201d said Dan Whisenhunt, Apple\u2019s vice president of real estate and development.\nNot all of these changes have thrilled everyone. Residents of Birdland, an 877-home neighborhood, have been particularly vocal. They have complained about early-morning construction rigs that beep and rumble along major streets, unpredictable road closings, unsightly green sheeted barriers and construction potholes that result in punctured tires.\nWhen her car was covered with construction dust, Sheri Nielsen, Mr. Nielsen\u2019s wife, contacted Apple. The company sent carwash certificates.\nMr. Whisenhunt said the company strove to answer every complaint it received, \u201cand if the issue is serious enough, I will personally visit to see what is going on.\u201d\nIn the design phase, he said, Apple hosted more than 110 community gatherings for feedback. Birdland was addressed in late 2012 and early 2013 and was given information about what would be happening over the next three years of construction. Apple published community mailers five times and sent them to 26,000 households.\nHomestead Road, the thoroughfare that separates Apple Park from Birdland, became its own subject of debate. Cupertino officials wanted to construct a tree-lined median to calm traffic. Apple offered to cover the costs.\nBut homeowners objected. Residents complained that the island would eliminate one lane, backing up the heavy traffic even more. When 20 or so neighbors approached a Sunnyvale town meeting in solidarity, the city ended up siding with the residents.\nThe price of property in the neighborhood has also become a source of some worry. Sunnyvale and Cupertino, like many other Silicon Valley towns, have had an extended real estate boom, as the tech industry has expanded. Prices in the area really started to rise, real estate agents and residents said, after Apple released its plans.\nA three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,400-square-foot ranch-style house that cost $750,000 in 2011 has doubled in price. Since Apple said it was moving into the former Hewlett-Packard site, prices have moved up 15 to 20 percent year after year, said Art Maryon, a local real estate agent. Today, bidders usually offer 20 to 25 percent over the asking price.\nBirdland is already drawing Apple employees, replacing homeowners who have cashed out to move to quieter regions. Those who remain are realizing that life will not be the same when all 12,000 of the Apple workers go in and come out on a daily basis. People in the neighborhood dread the increased traffic and expect workers to park in front of their homes since there will be fewer available spaces in the company garage.\nApple\u2019s answers to concerned residents will continue, Mr. Whisenhunt said.\n\u201cWhen you tell people what is upcoming, some of the anxiety they have calms down a lot,\u201d he said.\nAnd yet, he acknowledged, \u201cyou don\u2019t make everyone happy.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.Why are some programs not available in the software app stores, even if I know they exist? If I find them anyway, are they safe to install?\nA.The \u201capp store\u201d approach to distributing software, which downloads the program directly to the device (or computer), is a convenience for consumers, but not every developer chooses to sell work that way. For one, the bigger electronic marketplaces run by Apple, Google and Microsoft place technical restrictions on what a program can and cannot do once it is installed, and some software creators do not wish to abide by those rules.\nOther developers may also balk at registration fees and the revenue-sharing policy of an online app emporium.Apple,GoogleandMicrosoftoften take a 30-percent cut of the sales in their app stores, although some in-app subscriptions now require only 15 percent of the overall price as payment.\nCertain programs you seek may not be available forother reasons, like regional restrictions or the creator pulling a program from the store. If you are looking for an app you know exists, make sure any parental-control settings on your device are not blocking you from seeing the software.\nApps approved for sale in Apple\u2019sApp Store(andMac App Store), theGoogle Playstore and Microsoft\u2019sWindows Storehave presumably been screened for quality and security, which is one advantage to buying programs there. While it often takes some extra work, manually installing third-party apps from unofficial sources is possible; the practice is also known assideloading.\nIn some cases \u2014 particularly with Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 you may need to\u201cjailbreak\u201d or \u201croot\u201dyour gadget to override the manufacturer\u2019s protections and install unauthorized software. Proceed at your own risk, however, as manufacturers warn this may lead tosecurity issues and possibly a voided warranty.\nLong before smartphones and tablets arrived, developers were selling their wares as downloads from their websites or offering them insoftware repositories(likethose used by many Linux distributions). You can still install many desktop programs this way. Just make sure that the seller is legitimate and that the security software on your computer is activated and up-to-date."

I don\u2019t sync my shows with other devices, either. Does this mean the space is getting tight on my iPhone?\nA.TheApple Podcasts apphas built-in tools to help you manage your subscriptions and the individual shows you download. The setting that automatically deletes an episode (within 24 hours after it has been fully played) is probably enabled. You can turn off the Podcast app\u2019s default control \u2014 or just have it stop deleting recently played episodes from specific podcasts.\nIf you do not want Apple Podcasts to dump any episodes you have played, open the Settings icon on your iPhone\u2019s home screen and scroll down until you see Podcasts.

If you have turned off the app\u2019s default control to delete episodes you have played, you can still make the shows you do not want to save automatically disappear. To do that, go to the Podcasts app, select a show from your My Podcasts list and tap the gear-shaped settings icon under the show\u2019s title.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent",
        "fulltext": "A year ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigation madean extraordinary demandof Apple. To get inside a dead terrorist\u2019s iPhone, law enforcement officials wanted the company to create a hackable version of the software that runs all iPhones.\nTo many legal experts, it wasn\u2019t obvious that Apple had a winning case against the request. But facing great legal and political opposition, Appletook a standanyway. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, argued that the company had a financial and moral duty to protect its users\u2019 privacy and security. He made clear that Apple would obey American law \u2014 but only after trying to shape the law.\nThe fight paid off. On the eve of a courtroom showdown, the F.B.I.rescinded its request. It is worth underlining this point: When Apple took a public stand for its users\u2019 liberty and privacy, the American government blinked.\nYet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.\nApplepulled down several VPN apps\u2014 programs that allow iPhone users to bypass the Chinese government\u2019s censorship apparatus \u2014 from its Chinese App Store. The developers behind the apps must register with the government under a cybersecurity law that went into effect in January. The law imposes criminal penalties on Apple and other companies that host unregistered apps.\nWhatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple\u2019s only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been \u201crequired to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d but noted that the \u201capps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.\nSearch Apple\u2019s website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China\u2019s intrusion into his customers\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression \u2014 you won\u2019t find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn\u2019t tested the public\u2019s immense love of its products. It hasn\u2019t publicly threatened any long-term consequences \u2014 like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.\nThe company\u2019s silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple\u2019s quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.\n\u201cApple\u2019s response is tremendously disappointing,\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just a blow for the liberties of Apple\u2019s customers in China. Authoritarian governments have a tendency to copy what works.Russia just passed a lawcurbing VPNs. Early this year, Applepulled down The New York Times appin the Chinese App Store, and both Apple and Googleremoved the LinkedIn appfrom their Russian app stores. In the United States, President Trump has called for greater legal measures against the press. And he took the F.B.I.\u2019s side in that fight over iPhones. What happens in China doesn\u2019t stay in China.\nIt may be na\u00efve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world\u2019s most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company \u2014 it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?\nWhat\u2019s more, Apple\u2019s silence isn\u2019t unusual. While American tech companies frequently criticize decisions by American officials, they appear loath to do so in China. This weekend,Amazon also began banning VPN servicesfrom the Chinese version of its cloud-computing platform, called AWS. Facebook,has been exploring ways of getting into the Chinese government\u2019s good graces. Google pulled many of its services out of the Chinese market in 2010, blaming censorship, but it has lately beenmulling ways to get back.\nThere is also a moral defense of Apple\u2019s decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple\u2019s own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple\u2019s texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.\nBut that may be of limited utility.\n\u201cIt will only get worse,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.\n\u201cThey should say something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a U.S. company, after all. And they\u2019re a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why \u2014 because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Dangerous Market Grab in China",
        "fulltext": "Apple announced last week thatit will open a data centerin Guizhou, China. This is a first-of-its-kind action by a major United States tech company since the passage last month of strict new Chinese digital commerce regulations that require foreign companies with operations in China to store users\u2019 data in the country. These events could threaten to disrupt the free flow of information over the internet.\nThe Chinese government claims its new rules willenhance domestic security efforts, providing privacy protections for Chinese nationals while also safeguarding \u201cnational cyberspace sovereignty and security.\u201d It would be na\u00efve, however, to think of these new regulations as anything but a severe restriction on the right to free information.\nChina\u2019s claim that the regulation is meant to enhance individual privacy rights is a facade. The government wants to quell international competition by raising the barrier to entry for outside players. In turn, China hopes to monopolize the market for technology services for its huge domestic consumer market. Consider the numbers: China\u2019s 1.4 billion people, many of whom are just now getting access to smartphones and the internet, present a major commercial opportunity for the digital sector. Twitter, Google and Facebook togetherhave billions of daily active users, and a hypothetical expansion into China could bring hundreds of millions more users to those platforms, raising their market values by many billions of dollars. But these and many other services arealready blocked in China, and this new security regulation will only create further hurdles for foreign entry into the Chinese market.\nRequiring that any \u201csensitive data\u201d \u2014 a heretofore undefined term \u2014 has to be stored on servers that are physically located in China is known as \u201cdata localization.\u201d China\u2019s localization efforts are hugely problematic for two main reasons. First, localization is a tremendously expensive exercise for companies that deal in data, so much so that only the world\u2019s richest firms can afford it. Second,a history of snooping by Chinese entitiesmeans not only that firms should be wary of the potential for industrial espionage, but also that the Chinese people should be worried about their right to privacy, because the Chinese government may now be able to gain access to their data whenever it desires. This is especially true because China has pronounced that if firms wish to transmit data out of China \u2014 for example, to other people, governments or overseas data headquarters \u2014 the transmittal must clear a security review by Chinese authorities, directly implicating individual privacy and free speech.\nChina may hope to replace its flailing manufacturing-based economy with one focused more on technology services to bring jobs and business to the nation\u2019s many struggling metropolises, but this is not the way to do it. First, as colossal as they may be, data centers rarely result in as many new jobs aslocals might expect. But perhaps even more critically, this kind of digital protectionism is unfair to the international community and to the people of China. The government\u2019s argument that the regulation will protect privacy is invalid. In the world of privacy, there are two threats: corporations and government. This regulation will create a system by which firms will try to serve China\u2019s regulators as efficiently as they can. The firms that rise to the top in such a system will necessarily have to be close to the Chinese government.\nWhy, then, was Apple so quick to announce the new Guizhou data center, in effect signaling its compliance with the aggressive new rules? It\u2019s simple: Apple hopes to protect its market share in China. Many internet companies \u2014 like Facebook \u2014 stand to be shut out forever under these rules, and smaller companies will avoid the market altogether because they lack the capital to stomach the compliance costs.\nThe internet is all about openness and seamless sharing. Restricting Chinese citizens\u2019 access to online information through arbitrary regulations is an attack on human rights and innovation, and it will disrupt digital commerce around the world. The people of China should take note and push for fairer standards. But placing a check on China\u2019s industrial policy will require more than just the outcry of Chinese activists. Indeed, the international community, and particularly the corporate sector, must stand up and hold China accountable. Unless we do so now, the government will continue to consolidate and centralize industry, jeopardizing the future of the global economy."

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 Software made by foreign companies to help Chinese users skirt the country\u2019s system of internet filters has vanished from Apple\u2019s app store on the mainland.\nOne company, ExpressVPN, posted aletterit received from Apple saying that its app had been taken down \u201cbecause it includes content that is illegal in China.\u201d\nAnother posted a message on itsofficial accountthat its app had been removed.\nA search on Saturday showed that some of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on Apple\u2019s app store there.\nExpressVPN wrote on its blog that the removal was \u201csurprising and unfortunate.\u201d\nIt added, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China\u2019s censorship efforts.\u201d\nSunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been removed from the app store.\n\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.\u201d\nIn a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license.\n\u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the country\u2019s leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.\nThe removals signal a new effort by China to control the internet. In the past, the country\u2019s so-called Great Firewall has used technology to disrupt VPNs, and Beijing has shut down Chinese VPNs and even aimed ahuge cyberattackat a well-known foreign site hosting code that circumvented the filters.\nBut the move by Apple is also the first example of China successfully using its influence with a major foreign tech platform to push back against the software makers.\nWhile internet crackdowns often peak every five years, ahead of a key Chinese Communist Party congress, the efforts this year cover fresh ground, a likely indication that stricter controls of things like VPNs will persist after the congress this autumn. China also began apartial blockof the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp this month.\nGreater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, is Apple\u2019s largest market outside the United States. That has made the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean the country off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.\nIn response, Apple has taken a number of steps to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.\nThe company said this month that it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in the country.\nApple has operated its app store in China for many years with only occasional run-ins with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store."

        "title": "Apple Opening Data Center in China to Comply With Cybersecurity Law",
        "fulltext": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers.\nThe move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users\u2019 data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.\nThe move is part of a worldwide trend regarding the security and sovereignty of digital data. Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are among the big American technology companiesplowing billions of dollarsinto building data centers in Germany, the Netherlands, France and other countries. While some of the expansion is for technical reasons \u2014 the online services operate faster when they are near customers \u2014 the companies are also reacting to growing pressure from European governments and customers to maintain some control over their data.\nAs is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.\nApple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\n\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.\nChina\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.\nThe iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.\nBut the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.\nApple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.\nIn 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.\nCareful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.\nThe opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.\nApple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.\nOther American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.\nForeign companies like Apple have had to adapt in other ways to stronger Chinese government scrutiny, often by helping to expand Chinese technological capabilities. For instance, Apple said this year that it would establish two research and development centers in China. Last year, it invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service. Apple has been far more profitable in China than most of its Western peers, but that success has led to pushback from the government. More than a year ago, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movieswere shut downin China, six months after they were introduced there.\nIn December, complying with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities, Appleremoved news appscreated by The New York Times from its app store in China. Apple did not specify what had prompted the request. The company also must undergo \u201csecurity audits\u201d on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell them in China.\nEven though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment."

        "fulltext": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.\nIn most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.\nJust in the past few weeks, Facebook had one of its most popular appsblocked by the Chinese government. LinkedIn, the globe-spanning social network of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, job recommendations and management essays, had its local boss step down amid tepid results in the country. And Apple announced a billion-dollar investment to comply with local law as it continued to watch Chinese demand for its iPhones fade.\nThis summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.\nTempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\n\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201d\nOver the years, internet companies like Twitter, Google and Snapchat have been blocked by censors. EBay was outmaneuvered by the local internet giant Alibaba. Groupon failed to stay afloat in the flood of copycats it inspired.Uber cut its lossesafter establishing a foothold and sold its local business to a Chinese rival.\nEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.\nAmerican start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.\nThere are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.\nFor those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201d\nMore so than the others, Facebook\u2019s problem in China is simple: Neither its website nor its app is accessible in the country. Both were blocked in 2009, shortly after ethnic rioting in western China. In the autumn of 2014, theumbrella protests in Hong Kongprompted the block of Instagram, which Facebook owns.\nAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.\nFor all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.\nAt least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.\nWhile Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.\nAn Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.\nYet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.\nIn a new tack for Apple in China, just last week it created a new position, general manager for greater China, and appointed a longtime manager,Isabel Ge Mahe, to the position. Ms. Ge Mahe was born in China, speaks Mandarin and has deep engineering experience. The company is also in search of a greater China policy head after its former head, Jun Ge, recently resigned, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nIf Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.\nIn 2014the company agreed to start censoring\u2014 much as Google had done almost a decade before it eventually left China \u2014 and formed a partnership with two influential Chinese venture capital investment funds to create a separate China operation. While the self-censorship drew complaints from users, other technology companies looking to get into China came to see LinkedIn\u2019s approach as a model.\nBy bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.\nThree years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.\nWhile in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.\nIn June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.\nHolding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.\nA business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.\nAlso, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.\nAs a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.\nWith the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\n\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.\nThat cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.\nA spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.\nSelling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.\nXu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.\nAs LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.\nAlthough it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.\nIn his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\n\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.\nStill, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.\nSimply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.\nUltimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\n\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.If Apple isditching 32-bit apps for its iOS systemthis fall, are they doing the same thing for 32-bit apps on OS X? How can I tell if I have any 32-bit apps on my Mac?\nA.Apple has been building operating systems and Mac hardware with 64-bit processors for years now, and is indeed moving away from 32-bit desktop software too. (The terms\u201c32-bit\u201d and \u201c64-bit\u201drefer to the more technical side of computing; a basic thing to remember is that 64-bit systems are newer and can process more data faster.)\nAt this year\u2019s World Wide Developers Conference in June,the company announcedthat all new programs submitted to the Mac App Store starting in January 2018 must have 64-bit support. Starting in June 2018, updates from developers for their existing programs must also provide 64-bit support. With all apps in its store written for 64-bit systems, Apple will begin to phase out its own support of 32-bit programs.\nApple also announced themacOS High Sierraoperating system previewed at the conference this summer will be the last system to run 32-bit apps \u201cwithout compromise.\u201d The final release of High Sierra is expected this fall.\nIn theSystem Informationarea of your Mac, you can see which of your installed apps are 32-bit versions and which ones are 64-bit. To get there, go to the Apple Menu in the top-left corner of the screen, select About This Mac and click the System Report button in the box. (As an alternative shortcut, hold down the Option key when you click the Apple Menu and choose System Information.)\nOn the left side of the box, find Software and click Applications. The Mac may take a few minutes, but it eventually rounds up a list of programs installed on your computer. Open the box until it is wide enough to see the \u201c64-bit\u201d column and then read down the list to see if each app is designated as \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d The \u201cNo\u201d apps are the 32-bit programs that you will need to eventually update or replace in macOS updates that come after High Sierra (probably beginning in 2019).\nMac desktops and laptops have used 64-bit Intel processors as the standard for about the past decade.Apple\u2019s site has a listfor those who want to check the type of processor they have."
