        "title": "Apple iPhone 6s Breaks First-Weekend Sales Record",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019siPhonejuggernaut is showing no signs of slowing down \u2014 at least where first-weekend sales are concerned.\nOn Monday, Apple said it had sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices since they became available for sale on Friday, a record for first-weekend sales. That was up from the10 millioniPhones sold last year during the first weekend that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold.\nAny increase in sales was most likely helped by the geography of the markets where the new iPhones became available. This year, the iPhones went on sale in a dozen countries and territories, including China, which is one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets. Last year,China was not among the countriesthat sold the iPhone on the first weekend, apparently because the devices had not received approval from Chinese regulators.\nAdding China to the product introduction more than doubled the initial market size, according to Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG Research. Jan Dawson, the chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said he also expected first-weekend sales to be higher than last year because the period for ordering the new iPhones before their sale date was longer than that for the previous generation of the device.\nThe sales numbers slightly outpaced some Wall Street estimates. Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital, projected that Apple would sell 13 million phones on the opening weekend, and he said that Wall Street had expected that Apple would sell about 12 million. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray had predicted sales of 12 million to 13 million.\nFirst-weekend sales help indicate overall iPhone demand, an important measure given that the device accounts for the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue. The initial sales also are a marker for how well the new smartphones may do during the end-of-year holiday season, which is typically the most significant sales period for consumer product companies.\nThis year, UBS estimates that Apple will sell 78.4 million iPhones in the December quarter, up four million from last year, while FBR predicts the sale of 77 million iPhones.\nOver the weekend, people camped out in front of some Apple stores to buy the new iPhones, a trend that has become something of a tradition. To cut down on long wait times in line, Apple let people sign up online for time slots during which to pick up their phones in stores.\nMr. Ives said he was at the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan on Friday, where he saw about 1,100 customers in line for the 8 a.m. appointment slot and 500 more people walking in without appointments, which is more than he saw last year.\nAt the Apple store in the Grove mall in Los Angeles, customers stood in the 90-degree heat to collect their new phones. Store employees handed out free bottled water, packs of Capri Sun, fruit and granola bars and provided large umbrellas for shade.\nLate in the afternoon, the \u201cGlee\u201d TV star Lea Michele stopped by the Grove to pick up her phone: the iPhone 6s Plus in Apple\u2019s new rose-gold color."

        "title": "Decoding Steve Jobs, in Life and on Film",
        "fulltext": "Nearly four years afterSteve Jobsdied, a debate is still raging.\nDoes Jobs deserve to be so admired?\nThat\u2019s the underlying question that emerged in a newdocumentary releasedover the weekend by Alex Gibney in \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine.\u201d It is also a question that lies beneath the surface of the coming biopic by Aaron Sorkin, \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201dwhich had its premiereat the Telluride Film Festival this weekend and will open on Oct. 9.\nSteve Jobs was a complicated leader: brilliantly creative and obsessive about details yet so maniacal that he could make his colleagues cry and, yes, he created his own truth at times. (That\u2019s the polite way of putting it.)\nMr. Gibney, who directed the recent HBO documentary \u201cGoing Clear\u201d about Scientology, explained what appeared to be his rationale for pursuing a documentary about Jobs in a voice-over at the beginning of the film.\n\u201cWhen Steve Jobs died, I was mystified,\u201d Mr. Gibney said, as he showed images of people all over the world mourning his loss. \u201cWhat accounted for the grief of millions of people who didn\u2019t know him? I\u2019d seen it with John Lennon and Martin Luther King, but Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t a singer or a civil rights leader.\u201d He added: \u201cThe grief for Jobs seemed to go beyond the products he left behind. We mourned the man himself. But why?\u201d\nMr. Gibney, a talented and persuasive filmmaker, uses the next two hours to seemingly make the case that Jobs, the man, doesn\u2019t deserve the iconic status he attained. Through a series of interviews \u2014 including one with the mother of a child Jobs denied for years was his own \u2014 Mr. Gibney paints Jobs as \u201cruthless, deceitful and cruel.\u201d Mr.\u00a0Gibney goes through a laundry list of Jobs\u2019s sins: backdated stock options, factory conditions in China and secret agreements with Silicon Valley rivals to prevent employee-poaching.\nBut all these efforts to paint Jobs as a hero or a villain miss a larger truth: He can be both and still be worthy of acclaim. More than 700 million of his iPhones have been sold around the world, and a new version is to be announced on Wednesday. Hundreds of millions of people spend more time with their iPhones \u2014 and all the copycat and derivative devices \u2014 than just about anything else on any given day. He managed to create an emotional attachment between humans and a device.\nYou don\u2019t have to be an \u201cApploonian\u201d to appreciate that he has an\u00a0authentic claim on changing the world during this last generation.\nNot surprisingly, most people who have had a huge influence on the world have been flawed, some deeply so. Most people are flawed in one way or another.\nMr. Gibney held out John Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr. as somehow more worthy than Jobs of the wave of grief that took place after they died. But both Lennon and King were terribly troubled, too.\nLennon\u2019s son Julian told The London Telegraph in 1998: \u201cI felt he was a hypocrite. Dad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world, but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces \u2014 no communication, adultery, divorce?\u201d\nKing had his own personal demons: It is well chronicled that he was a serial adulterer.\nThat history is worth remembering not to cast judgment on their huge accomplishments, but to remind us that they are human. (Whether Jobs does or does not deserve to be compared to King is a different question.)\nSadly, it does appear that being flawed in one area may help in others. In an article in The Atlantic titled \u201cWhy It Pays to Be a Jerk,\u201d the author Jerry Useem quotes several studies that show that nice guys don\u2019t usually win. Donald Hambrick, a management professor at Penn State, told the magazine, \u201cTo the extent that innovation and risk-taking are in short supply in the corporate world, narcissists are the ones who are going to step up to the plate.\u201d\nNot everyone thinks Jobs was a jerk. Eddy Cue,Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services,wrote on Twitterthat he felt the Gibney film was \u201can inaccurate and meanspirited view of my friend. It\u2019s not a reflection of the Steve I knew.\u201d\nBut the black hat-white hat version of Jobs may be too confining.\nIn a fascinatinginterview last yearwith Graydon Carter of Vanity Fair, Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s famed designer and longtime friend of Jobs, recounted a telling story. He remembered a time when Jobs had been tough \u2014 too tough, in Mr. Ive\u2019s estimation \u2014 on his team. Mr. Ive pulled him aside and told him to be bit nicer. \u201cWell, why?\u201d Jobs replied. \u201cBecause I care about the team,\u201d Mr. Ive responded. \u201cAnd he said this brutally, brilliantly insightful thing, which was, \u2018No, Jony, you\u2019re just really vain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Ive recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just want people to like you, and I\u2019m surprised at you because I thought you really held the work up as the most important, not how you believed you were perceived by other people.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThat story and the documentary left me with me with two questions: Would you rather do something extraordinary that benefits the lives of millions of people? Or be liked by several hundred? And does it have to be an either-or question?\nThe answer, like Jobs, is complicated."

        "title": "Apple and Other Tech Companies Tangle With U.S. Over Data Access",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In an investigation involving guns and drugs, the Justice Department obtained a court order this summer demanding that Apple turn over, in real time, text messages between suspects using iPhones.\nApple\u2019s response: Its iMessage system was encrypted and the company could not comply.\nGovernment officials had warned for months that this type of standoff was inevitable as technology companies like Apple and Google embraced tougher encryption. The case, coming after several others in which similar requests were rebuffed, prompted some senior Justice Department andF.B.I.officials to advocate taking Apple to court, several current and former law enforcement officials said.\nWhile that prospect has been shelved for now, the Justice Department is engaged in a court dispute with another tech company, Microsoft. The case, which goes before a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday and is being closely watched by industry officials and civil liberties advocates, began when the company refused to comply with a warrant in December 2013 for emails from a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft said federal officials would have to get an order from an Irish court, because the emails were stored on servers in Dublin.\nThe conflicts with Apple and Microsoft reflectheightened corporate resistance, in the post-Edward J. Snowden era, by American technology companies intent on demonstrating that they are trying to protect customer information.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become all wrapped up in Snowden and privacy issues,\u201d said George J. Terwilliger III, a lawyer who represents technology companies and as a Justice Department official two decades ago faced the challenge of how to wiretap phone networks that were becoming more digital.\nPresident Obama has charged White House, Homeland Security and cybersecurity officials, along with those at the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, with proposing solutions to the technology access issue. They are still hashing out their differences, according to law enforcement and administration officials.\nSome Justice and F.B.I. officials have been frustrated that the White House has not moved more quickly or been more outspoken in the public relations fight that the tech companies appear to be winning, the law enforcement officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversations.\nThe White House, after months of study, has yet to articulate a public response to the argument that a victory in the Microsoft case would provide authoritarian governments, particularly those of China and Russia, with a way to get access into computer servers located in the United States.\n\u201cClearly, if the U.S. government wins, the door is open for other governments to reach into data centers in the U.S.,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel, said in a recent interview. Companies and civil liberties groups have been sending in briefs of their own, largely opposing the government\u2019s surveillance powers.\nTensions between American technology leaders and the government over access are hardly new: The Clinton administration was forced to abandon plans to require technology manufacturers to build a small \u201cclipper chip\u201d into their hardware systems to allow the government to unlock encrypted communications.\nStill, the nation\u2019s phone companies ultimately supported legislation requiring them to build access points into their digital networks so they could comply with legal wiretap orders. (Tech companies like Apple and Google are not telecommunications firms and not covered by the wiretap law.)\nThe politics today are far different. Stung by Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations about how theNational Security Agencyhad secretly breached company networks \u2014 often without the companies\u2019 knowledge \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft are working to reassure customers around the world that they are fighting efforts to give the United States government access to their communications.\nThe businesses say they are seeing greater demand than ever for built-in encryption \u2014 including the new operating system Apple introduced last year for the iPhone, which James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and other government officials have denounced as endangering efforts to thwart criminals and terrorists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we do not let these technological innovations undermine our ability to protect the community from significant national security and public safety challenges,\u201d Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, told Congress this summer.\nAt issue are two types of encoding. The first is end-to-end encryption, which Apple uses in its iMessage system and FaceTime, the video conversation system. Companies like Open Whisper Systems, the maker of Signal, and WhatsApp have adopted such encryption for stand-alone apps, which are of particular concern to counterterrorism investigators.\nWith Apple, the encryption and decryption are done by the phones at either end of the conversation; Apple does not keep copies of the message unless one of the users loads it into iCloud, where it is not encrypted. (In the drug and gun investigation this summer, Apple eventually turned over some stored iCloud messages. While they were not the real-time texts the government most wanted, officials said they saw it as a sign of cooperation.)\nThe second type of encoding involves sophisticated encryption software on Apple and Android phones, which makes it all but impossible for anyone except the user of the phone to open stored content \u2014 pictures, contacts, saved text messages and more \u2014 without an access code. The F.B.I. and local authorities oppose the technology, saying it put them at risk of \u201cgoing dark\u201d on communications between terrorists and about criminal activity on city streets. The American military is more divided on the issue, depending on the mission.\nThe Justice Department wants Apple and other companies that use end-to-end encryption to comply with the same kind of wiretap orders as phone companies. Justice and some former law enforcement officials argue that consumers want investigators to have the ability to get wiretaps in the mobile, digital world if it means solving crimes.\n\u201cIf you ask about wiretap functionality in the broad privacy context, you get one answer,\u201d Mr. Terwilliger said. \u201cIf you ask it in the context of a guy with a loose nuke, or some kind of device, you get a different answer.\u201d\nOfficials say a court fight with Apple is still an option, though they acknowledge it would be a long shot. Some object that a legal battle would make it harder for the companies to compromise, the law enforcement officials said. They added that Apple and other companies had privately expressed willingness to find common ground.\nApple declined to comment on the case for this article. But company officials have argued publicly that the access the government wants could be exploited by hackers and endanger privacy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another attack on our civil liberties that we see heating up every day \u2014 it\u2019s the battle over encryption,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, told a conference on electronic privacy this year. \u201cWe think this is incredibly dangerous.\u201d\nEchoing the arguments of industry experts, he added, \u201cIf you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too.\u201d If criminals or countries \u201cknow there\u2019s a key hidden somewhere, they won\u2019t stop until they find it,\u201d he concluded.\nThe Microsoft case centers on whether the fact that data is stored around the world relieves American firms of turning it over. The government, which won in Federal District Court, has argued in its brief to the appeals court that where the data is stored is irrelevant because the company still has control of email records. The White House declined to comment because the case is in litigation.\n\u201cPeople want to know what law will be applied to their data,\u201d Mr. Smith of Microsoft said. \u201cFrench want their rights under French law, and Brazilians under Brazilian law. What is the U.S. government going to do when other governments reach into the U.S. data centers, without notifying the U.S. government?\u201d\nChinese firms already have plans to build facilities on American soil that would store electronic communications, so the question may be more than hypothetical. In its brief, Microsoft argues that Congress will ultimately have to weigh in on the issue, since it is as much a political matter as a legal one: \u201cOnly Congress has the institutional competence and constitutional authority to balance law enforcement needs against our nation\u2019s sovereignty, the privacy of its citizens and the competitiveness of its industry.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the industry. Mr. Manjoo is off this week, so Mr. Isaac is conversing with fellow tech reporter Quentin Hardy.\nMike:Hello, Farhad! How are you do ... \u2014 wait a minute. You aren\u2019t Farhad. You\u2019re my very intelligent colleague, Quentin Hardy! What are you doing here, and what have you done with Farhad?\nQuentin:The working theory is that we have reached Peak Manjoo, and from now on we must ration his wisdom wisely so it lasts longer. I will try to drop something like his wisdom bombs.\nMike:Okey-doke. So, it has been a strange week in tech, though I think I say that every week, so I guess it has been a normal week in tech.\nWe\u2019re all still on the lookout for who will take thechief executive position at Twitter, a process that seems to be moving about as fast as the Iran deal did. China\u2019s stock market is basically imploding, which I guess is alsobad for American tech start-ups.Oh, and McDonald\u2019s isnow serving breakfast all day, which is really much bigger news than any of this other tech stuff combined.\nBut as you are this week\u2019s substitute Farhad, I leave it to you to set the topics of discussion. What\u2019s tickling your fancy this week?\nQuentin:Like almost everyone, I\u2019m wiggling my toes in the wading pool and nursing an appropriate beverage as the Labor Day holiday calls an unofficial end to summer. Traditionally, college students pack off for school, new cars and fashions show up and we all get back to business.\nIn tech, it means we start a round of conferences and product announcements, maybe even a few big deals. Usually we ease into these events nice and calmly, but not this year \u2014 and not just becauseApple is having a bunch of product announcementsnext week.\nYou know, Apple has these big announcements, real rolling-thunder stuff. Amazon seems to like it the other way around. Out of nowhere on Tuesday, they announced that Prime members couldnow download (some) movies and TV shows to iOSand Android devices. In order to watch programming offline previously, you had to have an Amazon Fire tablet, so this gives Amazon a much bigger potential customer base. It\u2019s a pretty huge deal, if Amazon can negotiate a decent inventory of titles. And it brings the pain to Netflix, which hasn\u2019t been interested in offering offline media.\nMike:This is cool! If only I used Amazon to watch movies. At this point, I\u2019m basically beholden to Netflix \u2014 by the way, their new show \u201cNarcos\u201d is awesome. So even with all the cool little features, I only buy an Amazon flick every once in a while.\nAmazon\u2019s big problem is people like me: People who don\u2019t register \u201cmedia\u201d when they think of Amazon. They think about diapers and dog treats. Which reminds me, I need to buy moreGreeniesfor my dog.\nQuentin:I\u2019m just starting \u201cNarcos.\u201d Don\u2019t tell me how it ends!\nYour dog should be on Amazon Prime \u2014 not only would she get treats delivered free, she could download \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d or the excellent 1974 James Caan movie \u201cThe Gambler\u201d and watch it on your iPad, even if the dog park\u2019s Wi-Fi is down (you can see what I mean about needing more titles). It\u2019s all about selling more Prime subscriptions \u2014 you pay a fee and hang around Amazon more.\nBy the way, Netflix is coming back from the beach to more competition. Hulu, which many people think is a follower in the streaming-services arena,started a $12 a month commercial-free service. Subscriptions! It\u2019s something journalists like us should love.\nMike:Enough about tech media. What about plain old tech?\nQuentin:I guess Google is finding out a painful truth: When you\u2019re a global tech company that is basically into everything from advertising to computers to cars, you\u2019re going to get hassled. Possibly with good reason. Last week in Europe, the company faced a new online platform meant to help companies there sue for antitrust violations.In India,the authorities raised the same kind of charges about anticompetitive bullying.\nMike:But they havea new logo.You can\u2019t sue a company if it has an attractive logo. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a law.\nQuentin:Yeah, sometimes watching older tech companies try to cope with a changing world is like having your parents come down to your basement party to \u201crelate\u201d to your friends. Maybe it works, but it doesn\u2019t feel natural.\nMike:O.K., give me one more piece of tech news before I go celebrate Labor Day in the appropriate manner, by not working.\nQuentin:Here\u2019s something from the enterprise world. Last week, Cisco announced that it wasworking with Appleto sell more iPads and iPhones to businesses. It is similar to an Apple-IBM collaboration last year, only the Cisco-Apple deal is more vague about the details.\nFurther into the world of enterprise spending, VMware and Microsoft \u2014 which have disliked each other pretty much since VMware was created so that buyers wouldn\u2019t need as many Windows servers \u2014 smoked the peace pipe, figuratively, of course, onstage at a VMware user conference. Both companies are looking for ways to stay relevant now that their customers are buying fewer servers, opting instead to move over to cloud computing.\nMike:The only Enterprise I know anything about is the kind I rent a car from, so I\u2019ll trust that you know what you\u2019re talking about.\nO.K., that\u2019s enough, time for the weekend. Thanks for pinch-hitting for Farhad. I\u2019ll try to stump him with an enterprise question next week.\nQuentin:Sure thing. Let me know if you need a primer on virtualization."

        "fulltext": "Appleintroducednew iPhoneson Wednesday and will follow a week later by releasing iOS 9, its next mobile operating system. That may bring back some bad memories for consumers who felt chagrined by the last iOS rollout.\nLast fall, when Apple released iOS 8, the previous version of the operating system, iPhone owners reported some major bugs, including one that sometimesdisabled cellphone serviceand another that made the smartphone\u2019s fingerprint sensor stop working.\nThis time around, the rollout should be smoother. Apple let the public test drive and provide feedback on early versions of iOS 9 \u2014 similar to what Microsoft did with itslatest version of Windows\u2014 which should reduce the odds for nasty bugs to show up on day one.\nI tested preview versions of iOS 9 for two months on multiple Apple devices, and while I found a few minor bugs, there were no significant issues. To help you acclimate to iOS 9, we have included some of the new items in the operating system that stood out as the most important: better battery life, improvements to the voice assistant Siri and big changes for iPads.\nBATTERY POWERThe persistently annoying issue with all mobile products is the battery. Even if all you do is check email regularly and send text messages, you would be lucky to have more than 20 percent battery remaining on your device by the evening.\nWith iOS 9, Apple is taking multiple steps toward improving battery life. For one, if you put the iPhone facedown on a table, the phone will know not to light up with notifications because its sensors know that it isn\u2019t faceup. For another, Apple says it revised apps across the operating system to make them run more efficiently and consume less power. And Apple added what it calls a low-power mode, which can be activated to turn off battery-hogging activities like animated wallpapers and motion effects.\nFor all this, Apple says consumers should get an extra hour of battery life with iOS 9\u2019s under-the-hood improvements and three hours of extra juice with low-power mode on. In my experience testing the preview system on a new iPad Air 2 and a two-year-old iPad Mini, I didn\u2019t experience noticeable leaps in battery performance, but an Apple spokeswoman said to reserve battery testing for the full release of the system. Stay tuned for a full set of tests.\nOVERHAULED NEWS APPWith iOS 9, Apple has done away with Newsstand, a folder containing apps for reading news, and replaced it with the News app. The app works like Apple\u2019s Music app by creating lists of recommendations for articles you might like to read based on your preferences.\nWhen you first open the News app, you are invited to add some of your favorite publications or topics you like to read, like Bon App\u00e9tit magazine or general articles on politics or food. It reformats articles into a magazinelike layout, emphasizing photos over text.\nSMARTER SIRIWhen Apple introduced Siri, a virtual assistant that understood voice commands, four years ago, tech reviewers (including me) showered the feature with praise. But soon after consumers got their hands on new iPhones with Siri, many reported that the virtual assistant was unreliable and thatits ability to communicate was limited.\nApple has fixed the latter complaint by expanding Siri\u2019s capabilities significantly in iOS 9, though it is unclear whether the virtual assistant will survive the torrent of new requests it will inevitably receive. The assistant is, in short, better at understanding you, using the context of your data. It is also more tightly integrated into the system\u2019s search tool.\nHere is an example of a new Siri trick: You can search for photos on your device based on the date and location of the photo or the album name, saying, \u201cShow me photos taken in Barcelona last spring,\u201d or \u201cShow me photos taken at Danny\u2019s birthday.\u201d\nSiri is also now directly integrated into the search bar. Swiping to the left of the home screen brings you to the search bar. The same commands you would say to Siri can also be typed into the search bar to bring up the same results. What\u2019s more, the search system studies your patterns to make recommendations for apps you open most frequently or actions that you perform.\nMULTITASKING FOR IPADSThe customers who will be most affected by iOS 9 will be those who own iPads, especially the latest high-end models. Apple added iPad features to the operating system that make the tablet act more like a traditional computer.\nA major modification to the behavior of the iPad is the ability to run two apps side by side; before, a single app took up the entire screen. If you\u2019re browsing the web with the Safari app, for example, you can swipe toward the left from the right side of the screen to choose from a list of other apps; the second app takes up a portion of the right side of the screen.\nAlso new is the ability to run another app while watching a video. Tapping a button inside a video shrinks it and moves it to a corner. The video can then be moved to any corner of the screen.\nNot every iPad will get these features. Only the iPad Air 2, the more powerful and more expensive 9.7-inch model, can support using two apps at the same time for now. Users of less powerful iPads (the second- and third-generation iPad Mini tablets and the older iPad Air) can view two apps at the same time but interact with only one at a time. As for watching video while using another app, that can be done with all the aforementioned iPads, but not anything older.\nBOTTOM LINEShould you update to iOS 9?\nThe rule of thumb for upgrading to a new operating system is to wait a little while for early annoying bugs to be stamped out, then upgrade when the system is more refined. Also, always create a backup of the data on your device before upgrading in case things go awry.\nBased on my testing, I think it\u2019s safe for consumers with newer Apple devices, like iPhones and iPads released in the last two years, to get the iOS 9 update in the next few months. For customers with Apple devices that are at least three years old, it is still unclear whether iOS 9 will improve performance, so wait a little longer to see what the early adopters report."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Where are the controls for spell check and automatic correction in the Twitter app for Android?\nA.Like many other text-oriented programs, Twitter\u2019s apps make use of the spell-checking and auto-correction tools built into the operating system on your mobile device. If you want to make adjustments or turn the auto-correction feature on or off, go to the device\u2019s Settings area.\nIf you are using the Twitter app on a device running the current Android Lollipop system, open the Settings icon and tap Language & Input. On the Language & Input screen, you can select and adjust the settings for the Spell Checker. TapGoogle Keyboard(or whichever keyboard you are using) and choose Text Correction to change your auto-correction and correction-suggestion preferences.\nKeep in mind that if you adjust the settings here, those changes affect other apps using the spelling and correction tools on your Android device.\nQ.If you already have a cable subscription (and have to keep it), what is the point of getting anApple TV?\nA.You do not need to have a cable subscription to use an Apple TV, but having one expands your use of the set-top box. For example, the free user name and password you get from your cable provider can be used to watch archived shows on a TV network\u2019s app \u2014 programs you may not normally have access to unless you were also paying for on-demand services. You could also connect the Apple TV to a different television set (one without a cable box), but still use your account credentials to view, for example, theWatchESPN appand stream live sports to the connected television.\nTherecently announced fourth generationof the Apple TV bringsgames, apps andother contentbeyond cable programming to the screen as well. While the Apple TV is not a dedicated game console, you can geta third-party game controllerto use with the box if you want to play more complicated video games on it.\nEven without a cable subscription, Apple TV includes apps forNetflix,Hulu,HBO Nowand other streaming services. The current and future Apple TV models offer channels that do not require a cable account, likeYouTube,VimeoandPBS. You can also stream your own music and photos to the TV if you use compatible services likeiTunesandFlickr, or mirror the screens ofiOS devicesandcertain Apple computers.\nWhile you can make use of the Apple TV with or without a cable subscription, you doneed a broadband Internet connection. You alsoneeda high-definition television set with an available HDMI port and an HDMI cable to link the little black box to the big screen.\nTIP OF THE WEEKJust as with Windows 8, you cancreate a USB recovery drive in Windows 10to use when troubleshooting future problems that may arise with the PC. You just need a little bit of time and (at least) a 16-gigabyte flash drive that you can fully erase and dedicate to the cause.\nOnce you have the USB drive, go to the taskbar and enter \u201cCreate a recovery drive.\u201d Type any admin passwords requested, select \u201cBack up system files to the recovery drive\u201d and click the Next button. Once you connect the USB drive and click through the screens to start the process, Windows 10 copies system files and settings to the flash drive. When the recovery drive is finished, the system may also give you the option to delete the preconfigured recovery partition on the computer to free up more hard drive space for other things."

        "title": "New Apple TV Is Said to Focus on Games, Challenging Traditional Consoles",
        "fulltext": "Applestumbled into the games business almost by accident not long after it released theiPhonein 2007, igniting a new multibillion-dollar mobile games industry in the process.\nCould a new Apple device \u2014 one linked to the television \u2014 shake up the market for game consoles?\nThe idea no longer seems ridiculous to many people in the games business.\nApple is expected to make games a primary selling point of its new Apple TV product, which is scheduled to be announced on Wednesday in San Francisco, according to people briefed on Apple\u2019s plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nThis is a big change from Apple\u2019s previous versions of Apple TV, a device shaped like a hockey puck that for the first eight years of its existence has mainly been used to stream videos and music.\nIt\u2019s tough to know how compelling the games on Apple TV will be until the company reveals the system this week. Yet many of the components necessary for a satisfying game experience will come with the device, the people say \u2014 including more power for better graphics, a new remote that could double as a controller and, perhaps most important, an app store to buy and download games.\n\u201cI think Apple\u2019s going to create a big new category in gaming, one that others have tried and failed to create before,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research. \u201cWhat the Apple TV has the potential to do is to bring casual gaming to the living room and make it a much more social activity.\u201d\nMost game executives and analysts see little chance that Apple will be able to woo hard-core fans of the leading high-end game consoles, the Xbox One from Microsoft and the PlayStation 4 from Sony \u2014 both of which will most likely still have better graphics than the new Apple TV. Gamers who fancy big-budget games like Call of Duty and Destiny will probably not be easily persuaded to switch systems.\nThat still leaves a large market of casual gamers whom Apple could target with the new Apple TV: people who find traditional game controllers complicated and who enjoy lighter, less epic forms of content.\nThe new product is expected to have a starting price around $150, according to the people briefed on the product. While that is more than double the price of the least expensive Apple TV on sale today, it is significantly less than the latest traditional game consoles, which range in price from $300 to $500, depending on the maker and configuration.\nThe business opportunity for Apple could be huge. The company now takes nearly a third of the revenue from sales of any games and other software purchased in its app stores. Total revenue from console games is expected to be more than $27 billion this year, which is more than a third of the $75 billion global games business, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nNintendo most successfully tapped into the casual gamer market in the mid-2000s with its Wii console, which has an intuitive, motion-sensing game controller. The Wii attracted an older audience, stay-at-home parents and others who had never before played game consoles.\nNintendo struggled to hold on to casual gamers after Apple came out with the iPhone, which enabled mobile games that far exceeded anything available on phones before. Games also became the top category of apps for theiPad, which came out in 2010, helping to create huge hits like Clash of Clans and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft. Booming sales of smartphones and tablets running Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system, further increased the numbers of people who regularly played games.\nApple\u2019s success in games was unexpected for a company that always showed far more interest in creating products for other forms of creativity, including music, photos and films. The Mac was ignored by hard-core gamers for years in favor of Windows PCs. Initially, Apple didn\u2019t even plan to allow games and other apps written for the iPhone after it released the device.\nThe makers of game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation have sought broader audiences by adding video streaming services and other entertainment features. But those game consoles are overkill for many casual gamers.\n\u201cThese are very big, clunky devices,\u201d said Steve Perlman, an entrepreneur who worked at Apple in the 1980s and later founded WebTV, an early set-top box start-up that was acquired by Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019ve got fans, big power supplies.\u201d\n\u201cApple TV is really a modern computing device,\u201d Mr. Perlman said.\nRepresentatives from Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony\u2019s United States video game division and Apple declined to comment.\nJames Gwertzman, chief executive of PlayFab \u2014 a company that helps developers run the online operations behind their games \u2014 is skeptical that Apple will be able to persuade developers of the latest console games to move their titles to Apple TV, which will probably not be powerful enough to play them. At the same time, the mobile game developers that Apple has already won over create very different kinds of games.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different experience,\u201d said Mr. Gwertzman. \u201cXbox and PlayStation have been very successful at building those living room experiences, and Apple and Android have been very good at \u2018play a game on the bus\u2019 experiences.\u201d\nThe number of companies that make game-capable video streaming devices and are vying for a spot in living rooms is multiplying. Amazon Fire TV and Shield from Nvidia, for example, allow users to play games, but these systems don\u2019t appear to have taken sales away from traditional consoles. Another inexpensive game console, Ouya, suffered from disappointing sales.\n\u201cTime will tell what the impact is,\u201d said Matt Wuebbling, the general manager of Shield at Nvidia, referring to streaming devices like those from Nvidia and Apple. \u201cI think it\u2019s going after a different, more mainstream market.\u201d\nTrip Hawkins, the founder of Electronic Arts and 3DO, said the living room remained a confusing battleground that no technology company had yet conquered.\n\u201cNo company has done more for the digital man-machine interface than Apple,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThey\u2019ve warmed up to games and are a worthy candidate to win the family room in the next decade, though the competition and inertia are epic.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said businesses had civic duties that go beyond simply making money and selling products.\n\u201cBusiness has a very important responsibility to society,\u201d Mr. Cook said Tuesday. \u201cThat responsibility has grown markedly in the last couple of decades or so as government has found it more difficult\n                                        to move forward.\u201d\nMr. Cook made his remarks at the BoxWorks conference, an event hosted each year by the storage company Box that showcases software for businesses.\nMr. Cook\u2019s comments highlight one of the many ways that Apple has become more outspoken under his tenure. Last year,Mr. Cook came out as gay,\n                                        a move that was hailed as significant because he leads the world\u2019s most valuable company. This yearhe also opposed an Indiana lawthat was widely seen as permitting businesses to discriminate against gay couples.\nDuring a recent appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d Mr. Cook said that as he watched children being bullied and discriminated against, he felt \u201ca tremendous responsibility\u201d\n                                        to let the world know that he was gay.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cook reiterated that equality was something that Apple would \u201ccontinue to evangelize\u201d when he spoke at BoxWorks.\nMr. Cook said Apple was also focused on finding ways to improve the public education system and protect the environment. He told the crowd that businesses should work to help the environment and said Apple\u2019s\n                                        data centers in the United States are 100 percent powered by renewable energy. Outside the country, it\u2019s about 90 percent.\nMr. Cook also talked business during his interview with Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, specifically about Apple\u2019s push to be a company that served consumers and business people.\nMr. Cook said Apple needed to form partnerships with companies like IBM, Cisco and Box to make its devices useful to business people and corporations. That\u2019s because Apple doesn\u2019t have a deep knowledge\n                                        of what businesses like financial services firms and shipping and transportation companies need, he said.\nOn an annualized basis through 12 months ending in June 2015, Apple\u2019s sales to enterprises amounted to $25 billion. \u201cThis is not a hobby,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nMr. Levie kept Mr. Cook laughing during the interview, noting that Mr. Cook met last week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, asking, \u201cYou can\u2019t\n                                        get an interview with the pope? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being with Stephen Colbert again,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nA version of this article appears in print on 10/05/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Leader of Apple Discusses Its Duty."

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the industry.\nFarhad: Hey, Mike, how\u2019s it going? I was off last week. I bet you missed me. Well, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m back now!\nMike: I noted your absence in a brief moment of silence.\nFarhad: Thanks. So, tech news. It was Apple week, of course. Atan event in San Francisco, they announcedanew iPhone(faster, pink), a new iPad (huge, stylus) and a new Apple TV (Siri, not an actual television).\nMike:Apple Pencil, Farhad. Styluses are for squares and art students.One-hundred-dollar pencilsare the new hotness.\nFarhad:Right. I thought all of it was pretty nifty, though perhaps the best trick was what Apple did to the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, a cavernous San Francisco concert hall usually associated with hippie jam bands.Apple turned it into a gleaming palace of minimalist design, actually building its own theater of 1,500 seats, complete with a gleaming night sky, andredoing all of the signs in the placeinto Apple\u2019s own typographical style.\nMike:I saw Nick Cave play there once. The acoustics were awful. I hope it was better for a two-hour-20-minute product announcement.\nFarhad:In non-Apple news:Ellen Pao droppedthe appeal of her gender-discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Ms. Pao, the former chief executive of Reddit, will now owe the firm $276,000 in legal fees. And The Wall Street Journalhad a crazy storyabout the lengths that the firm RadiumOne and its investors went to to save Gurbaksh Chahal, the company\u2019s chief executive, who pleaded guilty to domestic-violence offenses. Man, tech sure is ugly sometimes.\nSo let\u2019s talk about something much more pleasant: Money!Android Paybegan this week \u2013 Google\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s wireless payment system. Except, weirdly, Android already had wireless payments that it scrapped. You cover the payments industry. What\u2019s going on here?\nMike: So, Google is basically swinging again on a project it completely whiffed on a few years ago.\nGoogle Wallet, whichwas introduced in 2011, worked with only one type of credit card, using one mobile carrier, and only on certain phones. Google pushed ahead without the blessing of getting banks, credit card companies, carriers and merchants on board. Surprise, surprise, no one used Google Wallet, and it tanked.\nEnter Apple Pay, years later. Apple lines up the banks, the card companies and does a huge marketing blitz to train merchants. The carriers\u2019 own project \u2014 theunfortunately named \u201cIsis\u201d\u2014 never took off, so they\u2019re not an impediment to making this work anymore.\nBasically, Apple Pay paved the way for mobile payments to actually work, and now Google \u2014 andSamsung\u2014 are trying to do the same thing in pretty much the exact way Apple has done it.\nAre you still awake?\nFarhad:I\u2019m still laughing about the Isis thing.\nMike:Ok, good. What I don\u2019t really get is why I would use Android or Samsung over Apple Pay, or vice versa. It seems to be basically companies bringing feature parity to their platforms, which makes the choice really about whether you\u2019re an Android loyalist or an Apple acolyte. And that\u2019s an age-old battle. Or, I guess, a five-year-old battle. It seems longer in Internet time.\nFarhad:This is the fundamental problem with all these payment systems \u2014 none of them has reached ubiquity on devices or at stores, so you\u2019re always left wondering what works where. The easiest thing to do: Use credit cards.\nThere\u2019s a similar mess in money-transferring apps, and since I\u2019ve got you here, let me ask you this: I owe our boss $10. Why isn\u2019t there a simple, easy way to send her money without a lot of negotiations in advance about which app to use? I know there are lots of apps, some of them quite popular, like PayPal, Venmo and Square Cash. But I can never be sure who has what, and some of them seem particularly tied to certain demographics. That is, I get the sense that Venmo is for hipsters in Brooklyn. With all these money services, we\u2019re in the same state we were in with social apps before Facebook. Nothing is huge, so nothing really works as well as it could. Who\u2019s going to fix this?\nMike:First of all, I didn\u2019t know I could borrow money from the boss, so I\u2019m making a mental note of that. Second, this very question proves you are not a millennial, the exact demographic that loves these peer-to-peer payment apps.\nAs of right now, most of the world is stuck in old-school ways of sending money: Bank transfers and wiring across borders, the ways we\u2019ve done it for decades. Apps like Venmo and Square Cash are growing popular because they\u2019re fast, easy and free. And I figure they\u2019ll catch on with young crowds and slowly trickle up to older users as time goes on.\nBut as you said: Not everyone has these apps, while many people have bank accounts. So it\u2019s sort of tough to find a technological, nontraditional standard that everyone is familiar with and able to use. For that reason, I have a little more faith in Facebook, which is sticking money transfers into its Messenger app. Facebook has 1.5 billion users, and that\u2019s quite a bit more than use Venmo or whatever else.\nThat said, Google tried sticking money transfers inside email a while back, and its revamped Google Wallet app will become yet another peer-to-peer payments app. The former never took off, and who knows how the latter will fare.\nIn sum, no one knows how to fix anything, and the traditional financial institutions will probably win because that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re all used to using. I hope you\u2019re still cool with your local Western Union guy.\nFarhad: O.K., I guess what you\u2019re saying is, there\u2019s just no good way to pay back the boss. I\u2019ll let her know you said I\u2019m off the hook. See you!"
