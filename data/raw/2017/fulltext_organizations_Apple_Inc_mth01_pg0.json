        "title": "Dumping a Bad App? Tips for a Painless Breakup",
        "fulltext": "EVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It\u2019s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable.\nChances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the productivity-killing bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one.\nTake Evernote, the note-taking app. After nearly a decade attracting millions of users, the company last year severely restricted free use of its software while raising prices for its plans by as much as 40 percent. This month, Evernote also released a redesign for its mobile app, which userscomplainedwas bloated with unnecessary features that have made note taking too complex.\nEven so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy.\n\u201dWe understand those kind of changes don\u2019t make everyone happy,\u201d said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years.\u201d\nPeople deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break.\nNo app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can\u2019t recognize the warning signs.\nAn obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple\u2019s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn\u2019t show up. (It wasn\u2019t the first time this happened, either.)\nBrian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still functioning, but you don\u2019t see any changes in it for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point.\u201d\nAnother sign that it\u2019s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app\u2019s audience is a ghost town \u2014 like Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile photo-sharing services like Instagram emerged \u2014 then it\u2019s probably time to leave.\nYahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr.\nThe hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs.\nAs a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive.\nSome companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can\u2019t take your furniture and your books with you,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.\nEvernote is a good example. It includes an \u201cExport notes\u201d feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. Microsoft\u2019s note-taking app OneNote, along with Apple\u2019s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.\nFlickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.\nWhen companies don\u2019t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.\nIf there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn\u2019t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t need five-year-old notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.\nOn the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app \u2014 which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.\nThe biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.\nDitching Apple\u2019s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple\u2019s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.\nAfter testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app.\nMr. Fitzpatrick recently decided to cut ties with Google Voice, the search giant\u2019s calling and texting service, because it had remained unchanged for years. So he made backups of his call history, text messages and address books usingGoogle Takeout, a web tool that he helped develop for easily downloading personal data stored on Google services. Then he switched toSignal, the encrypted messaging service, which has more modern features for messaging and phone calls, and disconnected his Google Voice.\nGoogle said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick.\n\u201cA lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "At Pearl Automation, former Apple employees are blending their old employer\u2019s high quality standards with less paranoia and more openness.\nByVindu Goel\nPhotographs byAnthony Cruz\nAt Apple, Brian Latimer was in charge of protecting some of the company\u2019s deepest secrets.\nAfter anengineer accidentally left a test version of the iPhone 4 at a barin 2010, Mr. Latimer set up a system to track, recover and destroy prototypes of coming products. Later, he taught overseas suppliers how to shield production lines and compartmentalize information to avoid leaks.\nUnder Apple\u2019s \u201cneed to know\u201d philosophy, he did not even have access to much of the information he helped to secure. And like all Apple employees, he was discouraged from talking about his job with co-workers.\nHis current employer, Pearl Automation, could not be more different.\nFounded in 2014 by three former senior managers from Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone groups, Pearl has tried to replicate what its leaders view as the best parts of Apple\u2019s culture, like its fanatical dedication to quality and beautiful design. But the founders also consciously rejected some of the less appealing aspects of life at Apple, like its legendary secrecy and top-down management style.\nThe start-up, which makes high-tech accessories for cars, holds weekly meetings with its entire staff. Managers brief them on coming products, company finances, technical problems, even the presentations made to the board.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Mr. Latimer, who left Apple in May to join Pearl. \u201cEveryone is contributing here, so everyone has a need to know.\u201d\nBest of all, Mr. Latimer is working with many of his old Apple colleagues.\nPearl, which is led by Bryson Gardner, has recruited heavily from Apple. More than 50 of Pearl\u2019s 80 or so employees worked for the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant at some point.\nAlthough Apple pays very well, many of the Apple recruits had gotten bored cranking out incremental improvements to the iPhone and the Mac, said Brian Sander, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. \u201cThey were vibrating. It was time for them to do something different,\u201d he said.\nPearl\u2019s pitch was appealing: Make the roads safer by giving tens of millions of older autos the same high-tech safety features that the newest models have.\nThe company\u2019s first product,a backup camera called RearVision, costs $500 and began shipping in September. Sales are off to a slow start. Although the camera has received rave reviews, it is much more expensive than competing models. The online retailers Amazon.com and Crutchfield temporarily cut the price to $400 in December.\nMr. Gardner declined to disclose specific sales figures but said Pearl had released the product too late to make it into physical retailers before the holidays. The company plans to expand distribution early next year.\nLike Apple, though, Pearl is playing the long game. Engineers are already testing self-parking technology and other driver-assistance features for future products. So far, the company has raised $50 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel, Shasta Ventures and Venrock, but Mr. Gardner said it would need to raise more money in 2017.\nPearl\u2019s headquarters \u2014 in an office complex between vast redwood groves and Santa Cruz\u2019s beaches \u2014 are a world away from Apple\u2019s campus in the busy technopolis of Silicon Valley.\nThe larger company\u2019s influence, however, is clear.\nApple, which has about 110,000 employees, breaks big projects down into smaller tasks. Those are assigned to small teams, and each subtask is given to a specific employee, who must get it done \u2014 what Apple calls the \u201cdirectly responsible individual.\u201d\nPearl has copied this system. \u201cIn leading small teams, that\u2019s very effective,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.\nPearl has also imported Apple\u2019s disciplined approach to engineering. Deadlines are regularly set, and flaws are relentlessly investigated. \u201cWhy did this fail?\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cYou really understand the full bounds of the problem.\u201d\nAnother Apple hallmark \u2014 elegant design \u2014 is also a core value. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that has an Apple-quality fit and finish,\u201d Mr. Sander said.\nUnlike competing models, the RearVision has two high-definition cameras to provide a better view, and one is tuned for night vision. The cameras peek out of a license-plate frame and are powered by a hidden solar panel. They transmit data wirelessly to an adapter that plugs into the car\u2019s diagnostic port near the steering wheel. The images are displayed on an app on the driver\u2019s smartphone. The setup allows the company to frequently update the software to fix bugs and add new features.\nChrissy Meyer, Pearl\u2019s director of hardware product development and another Apple alumna, said that her team tried 19 variations of the license-plate frame, including testing various shades of black, with and without aluminum flakes in the paint. (\u201cThey look really different in the sunlight,\u201d she said.)\nLike Apple, Pearl dealt with dozens of suppliers, mostly in Asia, to obtain the 400 unique components in RearVision.\n\u201cWe were used to doing this with the iPhone and iPad,\u201d said Joseph Fisher, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and head of engineering. Indeed, the Pearl team tapped many of the same suppliers they worked with at Apple.\nBut Pearl\u2019s leaders also consciously rejected Apple\u2019s view that only the top executives should have a view of the whole company.\nApple\u2019s longtime chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, exercised control over the smallest details about products. When he stepped down in 2011, his power was distributed among more of the company\u2019s executives, but decisions remained highly centralized.\nApple, for all of its success creating phones and computers, has spawned very few start-ups like Pearl in recent years, especially compared to peers like Google and Facebook.\nEswar Priyadarshan, who sold his mobile advertising company, Quattro Wireless, to Apple in 2010 and stayed for four years, said that he learned about design and aesthetics during his time there. But he noted that Apple\u2019s high compensation, focused product mission and top-down decision-making tended to damp the risk-taking necessary to start a company.\nMr. Priyadarshan, who is now chief executive of BotCentral, a six-person start-up, compared Apple to a community of warrior monks. \u201cWarrior monks don\u2019t talk and do whatever is asked,\u201d he said.\nNest Labs, the most successful company to have been founded by Apple veterans in the last few years, was born in part because its founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, were told that Apple had no interest in their smart thermostat.\n\u201cIt was a great place to work: superhigh growth, great product, lots of innovation,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who remained at Nest after its sale to Alphabet for $3.2 billion in 2014. \u201cBut Apple is very much, \u2018How do we ship our next iPhone for Christmas?\u2019\u201d\nNest has had its share of problems since the sale to Google, including management infighting, product delays and disappointing revenue growth beforeMr. Fadell\u2019s departurein June.\nBut Mr. Rogers, who worked with some of Pearl\u2019s founders at Apple and serves on its board, said that the start-up absorbed many of the positive lessons of Nest: Recruit top Apple people, control your hardware and software, establish a culture of openness and empowerment, and constantly upgrade the product.\nApple, for its part, appears to hold no hard feelings toward Pearl, despite the start-up\u2019s steady recruitment of its employees.\n\u201cPearl Auto is a great example of the creativity and innovation driving the iPhone ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. \u201cWe wish them great success with their new product.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices, following a similarmove in China to blockThe New York Times app on iPhones.\nThe demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks aftera court blockedthe professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation\u2019s borders.\nThe action is the equivalent of a nation banning \u201cCatcher in The Rye\u201d and then forcing booksellers to remove the title from their shelves. It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens.\nWhen LinkedIn\u2019s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps.\nDirect blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia,Turkeyand several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle.\n\u201cApps are the new choke point of free expression,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America.\nIncreasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country\u2019s internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebookhas been workingon a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google.\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores.\n\u201cIt denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn.\nApple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates.\nMore nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 acourt declaredits citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request.\nTech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations tocreate their owninternet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet.\n\u201cInternet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,\u201d said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. \u201cIt appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.\u201d\nLinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation.\nMost American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in adeclassified report released on Fridaythat the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign."

Thebattery defectis not as serious asthe problems with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 phoneslast year, and a note on Apple\u2019s site states, \u201cThis is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.\u201d\nIf you suspect your phone might be one of the affected models, go to Apple\u2019s site and search for the page titled \u201ciPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues.\u201dOnce there, you can type in your iPhone\u2019s serial number to see if the device qualifies for a free battery replacement. Should your phone be eligible, you canhave the work doneat one of Apple\u2019s retail stores, at an authorized Apple service provider or through Apple\u2019s mail-in repair facility.\nIf you have a different iPhone model (or an iPhone 6s unaffected by the battery problem), the unexpected shutdowns could be caused by a number of things. Make sure your phone isup-to-date with the latest version of the iOS softwareby opening the Settings app and tapping Software Update \u2014 or by connecting the phone to the computer and letting iTunes check for you.Update your appsas well.\nThe condition of the iPhone\u2019slithium-ion batterycould also be the culprit. Batteries do wear out after a period of regular use and recharging, and the power cell in an older model may need to be replaced.Apple charges $79for a battery swap, but can also diagnose different power issues (as can other repair shops) if the battery is fine. The weather may also be a factor: Using the iPhone in extremely cold temperaturescan temporarily decreaseits battery life."

        "fulltext": "In the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.\nThe dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.\nThen, in the last half decade, something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago,I arguedthat we were witnessing a new era in the tech business, one that is typified less by the storied start-up in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.\nTogether the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.\nIn 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.\nThe precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.\nThis is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.\nLet\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.\nMeanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.\nThe Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.\nStill, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.\nWhat has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people\u2019s skin for, among other things,making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores.\nBut generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?\nOver the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.\nSilicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people\u2019s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist\u2019s iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, buta majority of Americans thought Apple should give in.\nDuring the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.\nFor years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\n\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.\nThat describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.\nDuring Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.\nBut as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.\nBut there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.\nThat could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful."

        "fulltext": "Q.I thought the iPhone was supposed to transcribe voice mail messages, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening on mine. Is there a setting I need to turn on to make it work?\nA.The iPhone can display text transcriptions of your recorded voice mail messages \u2014 as long as you have an iPhone 6s model or later. The phone also needs to be running the iOS 10 system software, and your wireless carrier must support theVisual Voicemailfeature. (Most national carrierssupport it,although the transcription text is currently available only in American and Canadian English.)\nUnlike voice mail systems that require you to dial in to your account and listen to messages in the order they were received, Visual Voicemail displays a list of messages and allows you to listen to them in any order you wish.\nOn compatible iPhones, you can see transcriptions by opening the Phone app from the home screen, tapping the Voicemail tab at the bottom and selecting a voice mail message. The text of the message should appear between the caller\u2019s name and the Play button to hear the audio recording. The transcription feature is still in the testing stage and text accuracy may vary.\nIf your phone meets the system requirements but you do not see the transcriptions, try joining a Wi-Fi network and checking your voice mail from that connection instead of just using the cellular network. Apple says that thetranscription of a voice mail message may take up to 24 hoursbefore you see it, butsuggests using the Siri assistant to dictate some textand then rechecking the voice mail list.\nEven if you do not have a late-model iPhone (or any iPhone), you can still find apps and services that convert voice mail messages to text.Google VoiceandYouMailare among the alternatives offering voice mail transcription for Android and iOS phones, and some wireless carriers even havetheir own apps."

        "title": "What U.S. Tech Giants Face in Europe in 2017",
        "fulltext": "ByMark Scott\nFor American tech behemoths like Google and Facebook, Europe can be both a blessing and a curse.\nThe region and its 500 million consumers are one of the companies\u2019 most important overseas markets. And in cities from Lisbon to Ljubljana, people oftencan\u2019t get enoughYouTube videos, Amazon purchases and Twitter messages.\nYet policy makers in the 28-member European Union have also become some of themost ardent criticsof how Silicon Valley companies dominate much of the digital world. The criticisms include the companies\u2019 perceived failure to pay local taxes and their collection of reams of personal information.\nThese tensions took center stage in 2016: Apple wasordered to pay13 billion euros, or about $13.7 billion, in back taxes to the Irish government; Google wasaccused of unfairly favoringsome of its digital services over those of rivals; and Uber wasprohibited from operatingsome of its ride-booking services in the region. The companies deny wrongdoing.\nThe next 12 months are shaping up to be potentially even more painful. Many of the investigations that started in 2016 will be decided in the coming year. If Silicon Valley companies lose the battles, they could be forced to change how they operate not only in Europe, but also farther afield.\nHere is what awaits them in 2017.\nGoogle is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe related to some of its search services and Android, its popular smartphone operating system.\nThefirst set of charges\u2014 linked to accusations that Google unfairly promoted its shopping product over those of rivals \u2014 could be decided by early spring and might lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of the company\u2019s global revenue, or about $7.5 billion (though most penalties are significantly less).\nThe company hasrepeatedly deniedthat it favors its own services over those of others, and itis spendingclose to a half-billion dollars across Europe to endear itself to locals. Any appeal of the decision would take years.\nGoogle\u2019s European woes also extend to taxes, and French officials will most likelydecide this yearif the company must pay more than $1 billion in back taxes on its operations there.\nIt also has appealed a decision by France\u2019s data protection regulator that it must apply the\u201cRight to Be Forgotten\u201drule across its global domains, including those in the United States. The current right allows people with connections to Europe to ask search engines to remove links to online content about themselves, under certain circumstances. The appeal will be heard in 2017.\nOn the top of Apple\u2019s agenda in 2017 will be its appeal of the \u20ac13 billion tax bill. Lawmakers in Ireland are alsoappealing the decision, claiming that the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, overstepped its jurisdiction and that Apple did not receive preferential tax treatment.\nBoth appeals are expected to be heard by Europe\u2019s top courts in late 2017, at the earliest.\nThe cases will most likely take on an increasingly political angle. President-elect Donald J. Trumphas suggestedthat American companies with significant cash held overseas might be able to repatriate these nest eggs at a reduced tax rate. If Mr. Trump goes ahead with this plan, expect a standoff between American and European lawmakers over where such money \u2014 including from Apple \u2014 should be taxed.\nThe social media giant is becoming an increasing target for European officials because of its ever-expanding role in the region\u2019s economy.\nIn 2017, Facebook will face the outcomes of investigations in France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands about how it tracks both members and nonmembers who use the company\u2019s services and visit third-party websites with embedded Facebook \u201clike\u201d buttons. The companywon a similar caseon appeal in Belgium.\nFacebook also has until the end of January to respond to European charges that itmisled regulatorswhen it sought approval for its $19 billion takeover of WhatsApp, the internet messenger it now owns.\nAmid concerns that Facebook did not sufficiently clamp down on fake news during the American presidential election, the company has facedsimilar worries in Europe,where some officials have called for it to be held responsible for such content, and for hate speech.\nIn March, a German task forcewill reporton how Facebook and other social media companies have responded to these issues. Legislation could follow if lawmakers believe the companies have not done enough.\nThe ride-hailing company has been locked in a yearslong struggle to operate freely across Europe after some taxi associations and policy makers accused it of flouting local rules and promoting unfair competition.\nIn April, the European Court of Justice, the region\u2019s highest court, isexpected to ruleon whether Uber is a transportation service or a digital platform \u2014 a decision that will have far-reaching consequences.\nIf Uber is deemed a transportation service, it will have to comply with Europe\u2019s tough taxi rules and not be able to offer some of its low-cost services. If the court rules Uber is a digital platform, the company will have greater ability to expand aggressively in the region, still one of its more important international markets.\nThe e-commerce giant is awaiting the results of alengthy investigationinto whether it received unfair tax treatment from the authorities in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters.\nAmazon denies the charges and says it complies with the tax rules where it operates. An outcome is expected by early summer at the earliest, and will followsimilar tax casesagainst American companies like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks.\nIn a sign that it was trying to get ahead of the issue,Amazonannounced in 2015that it would start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all of its sales through Luxembourg.\n"

How can I get the correct charger?\nA.Apple has made a number of MacBook power adapters over the years and they vary by connection plug and wattage. To get a replacement power adapter that specifically fits your laptop, you should firstconfirm the modelyou are using. Apple\u2019s laptop family includes theMacBook, theMacBook ProandMacBook Airlines.\nYou can find this information by going to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and choosing About This Mac. When theSystem Information boxappears, you should see the exact model year and name of your MacBook displayed on the Overview tab.\nWhen you have found the name of your MacBook model, you can checkApple\u2019s list of power adaptersthat go with each of its laptops. You can also find out more information about your laptop (including power adapter wattage) by clicking the System Report button on the Overview tab, back in the MacBook\u2019s System Information box.\nApple gives its power adapters specific names, like \u201c60W MagSafe power adapter with \u2018T\u2019 style connector\u201d or \u201cApple 29W USB-C Power Adapter and USB-C Charge Cable.\u201d You can use this name to search for a replacement unit on Apple\u2019sonline store, in itsretail storesor at stores that sell Apple hardware, likeAmazonorBest Buy.\nIf you have access to another power adapter from a previous Mac notebook, keep in mind that you can use a compatible charger of a higher wattage than your MacBook, but using a charger with a lower wattage may not provide enough juice. The type of connection plug may be easier to visually identify than the wattage, but for those who still have their chargers and need to replace them, the technical information is printed in tiny type on the side of the square white power-plug end of the cord.\nFor those with PC laptops, check with your manufacturer about replacement power cords and where to buy them. Many third-party substitutes are available, but read the reviews and technical information before purchasing."
