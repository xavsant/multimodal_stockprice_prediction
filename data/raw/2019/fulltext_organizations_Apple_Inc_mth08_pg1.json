        "title": "How Should Big Tech Be Reined In? Here Are 4 Prominent Ideas",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department is investigating them, as is the Federal Trade Commission. Congress andstate attorneys generalhave their sights on the companies, too.\nThere is no shortage of people arguing that America\u2019s large technology companies \u2014 namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 have gotten too big and too powerful. That has helped spur the scrutiny by the government officials.\nBut what to do about the issue? On that, the industry\u2019s critics are split.\nSome would like to see the businesses broken up. Others want more robust regulation. And there are shades of gray on both sides. Here are four of the most prominent prescriptions being debated.\nThis is the most drastic surgery, splitting off large portions of the big tech companies.\nThe guiding principle is simple. If you own a dominant online marketplace or platform, you cannot also offer the goods, services and software applications sold on that marketplace.\nSo Amazon could not own the leading e-commerce marketplace and sell Amazon-label goods there. Or Google could not have both the dominant search engine and its Google Shopping service, which shows up in search results. Apple could own an app store that offers music services, but not also its own music service sold there. And so on.\nBundling businesses on top of a dominant platform invites conflicts of interest and discrimination against rivals, thwarting competition, proponents of this countermeasure say.\n\u201cThe world is going to be better off after we break up these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has embraced the idea of bright-line breakups in her presidential campaign.\nBut such a sweeping overhaul of the tech industry could bring unknown risks for the companies and shareholders. Many economists are leery of broadly prohibiting companies from entering new businesses, fearing potential losses of efficiency and consumer welfare.\nThe last big government-mandated breakup targeted AT&T in the early 1980s, and that was the dissolution of a government-granted monopoly.\nStill, the idea is not unthinkable. The remedy initially proposed in the government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, endorsed by three leading economists, was to split the Windows operating system business from Microsoft\u2019s Office productivity software business. After George W. Bush was elected president, his administration settled the case without a breakup.\nThis is a case-by-case approach to breakups rather than a broad rule applied to all the tech giants. A current example is a plan that would require Facebook to shed Instagram and WhatsApp. A detailed proposal on this, laying out the alleged anticompetitive conduct, wasdeveloped by two leading antitrust scholars, Tim Wu of Columbia Law School and Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School, along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. (Mr. Wu is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.)\nThe three have made their presentation to federal and state antitrust regulators and to congressional investigators. They explain that starting about 2010, when mobile computing and photo-sharing services were taking off and Facebook was lagging in those areas, the social network embarked on a yearslong campaign to buy nascent competitors.\nThe biggest purchases were of the photo-sharing service Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.\nTypically, regulators challenge mergers when they give a company a big share of an established market. That was not the case when Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, a start-up with 13 employees in an emerging field.\nInstead, the three argue, the strategy was to buy out budding threats. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the better perspective of what was going on \u2014 maintenance of monopoly in the social network market,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said.\nIn Facebook\u2019s case, Mr. Wu said, \u201cthe remedy is straightforward: Unwind the acquisitions.\u201d\nBut an issue in spinning off a unit like Instagram is whether doing so enhances competition. Would a stand-alone Instagram be a real rival to Facebook, or would consumers simply stay with the dominant social network, Facebook, and Instagram suffer?\nGetting breakups approved by the nation\u2019s courts, which are generally conservative on economic matters, would be a stretch. Besides, some experts argue, a more comprehensive way to police the big tech companies would be with a beefed-up force of regulators.\nOne idea is the creation of a new regulator, a Digital Authority. It would be an expert group to supplement traditional antitrust regulators in the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. It would be able to move faster and have the expertise to constantly track the tech markets and trends.\n\u201cIts mandate would be to protect competition,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.\nThe new regulator was the central recommendation ofa recent reportabout the digital platforms that was sponsored by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago. Ms. Scott Morton led a group of eight antitrust experts and technologists who worked on the study. Since the report was released in May, members of the group have made a series of presentations to policymakers.\nIn online markets, the flywheel of network effects \u2014 the more people who use a service, the more users, developers and advertisers it attracts \u2014 is especially powerful, creating dominant companies. Yet even in digital markets, the door to new entrants must remain open, said Ms. Scott Morton, a former senior official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\nIn traditional antitrust, regulators and courts move at a measured pace, slowly and often after the fact. The goal of a new digital regulator, she said, \u201cwould be to save the rival before it is killed.\u201d\nThe authority, Ms. Scott Morton said, could receive a complaint from a competitor and schedule a hearing two weeks later, when both sides would present testimony.\nA new regulator? It would be a tough sell in today\u2019s political environment. But we do have specialist federal regulators in many other industries, including banking, aviation, transportation, drugs and agriculture.\nReining in the big tech companies, Ms. Scott Morton said, is increasingly becoming a bipartisan concern. \u201cAt some point, society will say this is too much power without real oversight,\u201d she said.\nThere are also narrower, targeted regulatory proposals. Some of these involve rules that would loosen a dominant company\u2019s control of user data, by either forcing that company to share the data with a smaller competitor or giving users more ability to take their data from one service and move it to a competitor. The Stigler Center study cited those data moves in a list of potential regulations and enforcement actions.\nThe idea, broadly, is that data can be a barrier to competition, and that freeing up the personal information collected by the tech giants could lower that barrier.\nThe big online platforms are data monetization machines, collecting, analyzing and exploiting information from consumers, merchants, advertisers and others. And the network effect of data is formidable. The more data the companies have, the more fuel to feed the machine-learning algorithms that power their businesses.\n\u201cData is the real trump card these platforms have,\u201d said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and a member of the Stigler Center study team.\nMr. Melamed, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, favors a rule that would require dominant digital platforms to give other companies access to their user data for a fee. That would help level the playing field for new entrants and other rivals, he said, but wouldn\u2019t be free for them, either.\n\u201cYou let the competitors have access to their back rooms for a reasonable fee,\u201d Mr. Melamed said. Such a solution would require regulatory oversight to set guidelines for fair licensing terms. Data sharing would also entail some privacy risk, since no privacy-protection technique is foolproof.\nA related idea is to mandate that tech companies make user data portable. That means consumers could move their information from one service to another, forcing digital businesses to compete with superior offerings rather than data lock-in.\nThe regulator would need the technical skills to ensure that the consumer data was handed over in a way that would let a competitor use it easily.\n\u201cThe details are crucial, if you\u2019re really going to give consumers more choice and control,\u201d said Jamie Morgenstern, a computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who worked on the study."

        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, we\u2019re Pui-Wing Tam and Jim Kerstetter, tech editors filling in for Jamie Condliffe while he\u2019s on vacation. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nFacebook has connected the world, which brings many benefits for communication and the dissemination of information. But there\u2019s a downside that hasn\u2019t gotten much attention until recently:the love scamsthat proliferate on the social network.\nIn these scams, some Facebook users \u2014 often young men in Nigeria \u2014 steal the digital photos and identities of Americans in the Marines, Army, Navy and Air Force. Posing as the service members, the scammers sweet talk vulnerable and lonely women, forming an emotional connection \u2014 and eventually asking for their money.\nOur colleague Jack Nicasfollowed one military love hoax. He found Renee Holland, who had an online friendship with a person she thought was an American soldier named Michael Chris. She sent Mr. Chris $26,000 to $30,000, much of the life savings that she and her husband had socked away.\nBut Mr. Chris was not a real person. The photo that Ms. Holland saw was of Sgt. Daniel Anonsen of the Marine Corps \u2014 and he was contending with dozens of impostor Facebook and Instagram accounts, and had no idea who Ms. Holland was.\nIn December, Ms. Holland\u2019s husband, Mark Holland, killed her and her father before turning the gun on himself. Mr. Holland did not leave any indication of a motive.\nThe New York Times published her story last weekend and aired it in an episode of our television show, \u201cThe Weekly.\u201d\n\u201dIn some of her final conversations with me, Ms. Holland expressed how thrilled she was that we were covering her story,\u201d Jacksaid of the tragedy. \u201cShe said she wanted to raise awareness about the issue and prevent future scams.\u201d\nThe story caught the attention ofRepresentative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois. Mr. Kinzinger, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, is one of the many American service members who have been ensnared in these scams.\nFor years, Mr. Kinzinger said, impostors have been posing as him or using his image to trick people out of money. As much as he has complained, the problem has persisted.\nOn Wednesday, he sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, requesting more information on what the company is doing to prevent such fraud on its sites.\n\u201cThere needs to be accountability for this issue that can, quite frankly, destroy lives,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cFacebook has an immensely significant role to play in getting this situation under control.\u201d\nMr. Kinzinger said he was also in the early stages of preparing legislation to address the issue.\nFor financial institutions, it has become a way of life: fending off endless hacking attempts. Hundreds of thousands a day in some cases. But sometimes they get through, and the apologies begin.\nOn Monday, the federal law enforcement authorities said aSeattle woman who used to be an engineer at Amazonhad hacked into Capital One\u2019s computer systems and obtained thepersonal data of tens of millions of customers.\nIt appears that the bank made a fairly simple mistake that allowed the hacker to break in: a \u201cmisconfiguration\u201d in a firewall. A firewall, one of the oldest digital security tools, acts like a gate on a network, keeping most traffic out and a few things in. It is usually up to network administrators to decide what should be allowed in, and the authorities said the hacker had been able to take advantage of a mistake the administrators had made.\nNo doubt, it was embarrassing for the bank. But successful hacking attempts are shockingly common. Already this year,there have been 3,494 successful cyberattacks against financial institutions, according to reports filed with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, our colleagues Stacy Cowley and Nicole Perlroth reported.\nAnother big number to keep in mind: Mastercard, for example,combats some 460,000 intrusion attemptsin a typical day, up 70 percent from a year ago.\nSuccessful banking hacks? Be surprised it doesn\u2019t happen more often.\n\u25a0It appears that iPhone sales are still slowing.On Tuesday, Apple said that itsnet income had fallen 13 percentand that its revenue had risen 1 percent in the latest quarter, with iPhone sales continuing to decline. But there were gains in the company\u2019s services and wearables business.\n\u25a0Imagine a bicycle built for none.A team of researchers in China isrethinking autonomous transportationwith a souped-up bicycle that can navigate on its own. The demonstration is really a way to show how a new computer chip tailored for artificial intelligence can work.\n\u25a0 EBay accused three Amazon managers of illegally conspiring to poach its sellersin a federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday. EBay first raised concerns that Amazon was approaching its sellers last fall in another lawsuit that has since moved to arbitration.\n\u25a0Children as young as 11 have been added to a facial recognition databasemaintained by the New York Police Department. Elected officials and civil rights groups say the police have been doing this with little public scrutiny, and they worry about the frequency of false positives in young faces.\n\u25a0Uber is laying off about 400 people, or a third of its marketing department, as it tries to whittle down costs. Many observers were stunned that the ride-hailing company actually had 1,200 people on its marketing team.\nJamie Condliffe will be back to write the newsletter next Friday."

        "title": "The Joys of Being a Late Tech Adopter",
        "fulltext": "The best gadget that I bought this year cost less than a week\u2019s worth of groceries. After my smartphone, it\u2019s my most frequently used piece of tech. It was also released four years ago.\nCan you guess what it is?\nThe mystery gizmo is a used Kindle e-book reader from 2015, which I bought on eBay from a repair technician. It lacks frills that somenew e-readershave, like waterproofing, but I\u2019m not the type to read in the bathtub. So I decided to be a late adopter, and I couldn\u2019t be happier: The dated Kindle does its job well, and if I ever break or lose it, I\u2019ll be out 50 bucks and not $200.\nI\u2019m neither a Luddite nor a cheapskate. But after testing hundreds of tech products \u2014 and buying some along the way \u2014 over the last dozen years, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion: People will almost always get more joy from technology the longer they wait for it to mature. Cutting-edge gadgets can invoke awe and temptation, but being an early adopter involves risk, and the downsides usually outweigh the benefits.\nKeep this in mind when, starting next month, we enter the end-of-the-year tech frenzy. That\u2019s when companies like Apple, Samsung and Google will try to woo us with hot new gadgets, including premium smartphones, tablets and wearable computers.\nI will be reviewing some of these products and advising whether they are worthwhile purchases. But my default recommendation is to resist hitting the \u201cBuy\u201d button and to wait unless you absolutely need to replace your older tech.\n\u201cNew doesn\u2019t always necessarily mean better, or better in ways that will matter,\u201d said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer forWirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.\nHere\u2019s a look at when slow adoption was wise \u2014 and fast adoption a mistake \u2014 followed by a look ahead at brand-new tech to be cautious about.\nIn 2007, I caved and bought Apple\u2019s original iPhone.\nHaving a fully functional web browser on a mobile device was too tempting, and as someone with a lousy sense of direction, I wanted the maps. So that winter, I paid AT&T $600 for the iPhone with a two-year contract. For a while, I relished being among the privileged few to live in the future.\nThat special feeling faded about six months later when Apple released the second-generation iPhone. Not only did the new model connect with 3G, a much faster cellular technology at the time, but it started at just $200 with a contract. Ouch.\nI\u2019ve gone through a handful of iPhones since. But that experience taught me a valuable lesson about the cost of early adoption. Nowadays, whenever Apple makes major changes to iPhones, I wait at least a year for it to iterate the tech and release the S version. (For example, instead of buying the iPhone 5 in 2012, I waited till 2013 to buy the iPhone 5S, which was faster and more durable.)\nWirecutter took a similarly cautious approach with theiPhone X, Apple\u2019s first radically redesigned smartphone, with a $1,000 price tag. When the device was released in 2017, Wirecutter gave it a positive review butencouraged people not to upgradebecause Apple was likely to include the premium features in cheaper models the next year.\n\u201cWe said everything seems to work well, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth this price now,\u201d Mr. Guy said. \u201cIf you like the iPhone X, wait a year or two and see what happens.\u201d\nThe next year, Apple released the$750 iPhone XR, which was just as capable as (and in some ways better than) the iPhone X.\nKyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, which sells parts and publishes instructions on repairing devices, said people had previously upgraded to new phones every 18 months on average, but could now wait more than three years. That\u2019s because smartphones have reached a point where their improvements aren\u2019t as noticeable year after year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the golden age of smartphones,\u201d he said. \u201cYour smartphone from two years ago still works great and will continue to work for a while.\u201d\nMy waiting more than a decade to buy a Kindle is an extreme example of late adoption. There are other, newer examples highlighting the advantages to this approach.\nMy second-best gadget purchase this year was theApple Watch Series 3. When Apple released that watch in 2017, it cost $330. This year, retailers like Amazon and Best Buy slashed the price to $200. Apple sells the newest version of the watch,Series 4, for $400, and its main improvement is a bigger display \u2014 a feature I can live without because I don\u2019t often look at the watch screen.\nIn other words, by waiting and opting for a previous-generation model, I get to enjoy a fast, long-lasting watch that tracks my workouts and shows my calendar notifications, among other perks, for a steep discount.\nThe late adopter approach goes beyond tech, Mr. Wiens said. In the automobile industry, carmakers occasionally revamp models with new driving technology and chassis designs. Then they build on that same design for several years.\n\u201cWith cars you never want to buy the first car of a new generation,\u201d Mr. Wiens said. \u201cWhen they radically change it, there\u2019s all kinds of issues.\u201d\nA case in point: When I shopped for a car in 2013, I bought a used Toyota Prius hybrid from 2011, the year after Toyota released a redesign of the Prius. This generation also came with a price cut, so I got what had previously been a luxury vehicle for a modest price.\nThe question that I, as a tech reviewer, hear most often from friends and colleagues is whether they should buy the new (insert gadget name here). But using the approach I\u2019ve described, you can develop an intuition for when it\u2019s a smart time to upgrade \u2014 and when it\u2019s risky.\nLet\u2019s say that in the coming weeks, Apple releases a new entry-level iPhone and Google releases a new Pixel smartphone.\nSince Apple did its last big redesign of the iPhone in 2017, the next one is likely to be an incremental update. As for Google, its Pixel phones are usuallymodest upgradesthat focus on software enhancements.\nIf your current iPhone or Google Pixel is on the fritz, this year may be a good time to upgrade, assuming the new phones get positive reviews. (Or, if you\u2019re like me, you could consider last year\u2019s models when their prices drop after the new ones come out this year.)\nIn contrast, a brand-new Samsung phone coming out in September screams, \u201cBuyer, beware.\u201d That is the Galaxy Fold, which is the first smartphone that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase its screen size. Samsungpostponedthe release after early samplesbroke in reviewers\u2019 handsin April.\nSamsung said it had since improved the Fold\u2019s design and construction. But with a tarnished reputation and a nearly $2,000 price, it is likely to become a hallmark example of a risky bet for early adopters.\nThe wisest thing we can do is pay attention to foldable screens and how they may benefit us in a few years \u2014 but probably not tomorrow."

        "title": "Russia Opens Antitrust Inquiry Into App Restriction at Apple",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Russian officials opened an antitrust investigation into Apple forrestricting and removing parental control apps from its App Storeshortly after the company released its own competing service, the latest sign of the growing scrutiny of Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\nRussia\u2019s Federal Antimonopoly Servicesaid late Thursday that it would investigatewhether Apple had violated Russian competition law when it rejected a parental control app made by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, from the iPhone App Store. The Russian agency said that after reviewing Kaspersky\u2019s complaint, it concluded that Apple had rejected the app, which it had previously approved, and set unclear requirements for app developers.\nThe New York Timesreported in Aprilthat shortly after Apple introduced tools to help people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones, the company removed or restricted popular apps that offered similar services. Applesaid the apps improperly used technologiesthat gave them too much access to users\u2019 data.\nIn June, Applereversed itselfand allowed the apps to return with the same technologies, as long as they promised to not \u201csell, use or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose.\u201d Many of the apps have since returned to the App Store.\nApple said in a statement on Friday that Kaspersky had not submitted a new version of its app for review.\n\u201cApple respects the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service and we are confident their review will confirm that all developers have an equal opportunity to succeed on the App Store,\u201d Apple said in the statement. \u201cWe treat all developers the same, and invest a lot in creating a safe and trusted place for our customers to discover and download apps.\u201d\nKasperskysaid in a blog postthat despite Apple\u2019s policy reversal, the Silicon Valley company has still put parental control apps at a disadvantage. As part of its complaint, Kaspersky said that Apple\u2019s rules for returning to the App Store were vague, that Apple prohibited the apps from sharing data with third-party analytics firms to improve their services and that Apple did not allow the apps to use the same technology it did to help parents control their children\u2019s phones.\nKaspersky has previously faced scrutiny for how it handles users\u2019 data. United States security officials have said Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software has beena tool for Russian intelligence authorities, an accusation that Kaspersky has rigorously denied.\n\u201cThe company has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,\u201d Kaspersky said in a statement.\nThe Russian investigation is another front for Apple in a widening clash with regulators over how the company oversees the App Store, which distributes millions of apps to customers\u2019 iPhones.\nTwo other developers of parental control apps, Kidslox and Qustodio, have complained to the European authorities that Apple unfairly blocked their apps. At least one American company has lodged similar complaints in conversations with Justice Department officials, according to a person close to the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private.\nThe Justice Department is considering other antitrust complaints against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, while the House Judiciary Committee is alsoinvestigating possible anticompetitive behaviorby the four companies. Most of the antitrust scrutiny of Apple has focused on its control of the App Store.\nAmid the increasing attention, Apple in May publisheda web page defending its approach to the App Store. It said it strove to create \u201ca safe and trusted place for customers\u201d and \u201ca great business opportunity for all developers.\u201d"
