        "title": "Apple Replaces Phil Schiller as Its Top Marketing Executive",
        "fulltext": "Appleannouncedon Tuesday that its long-serving chief marketing officer, Phil Schiller, would step down and be replaced by Greg Joswiak, a prominent product marketing executive at the company.\nThe company said that Mr. Schiller would continue to work at the company as an \u201cApple Fellow\u201d and oversee the Apple App Store and the company\u2019s communications, among other duties. He will continue to report to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\n\u201cPhil has helped make Apple the company it is today and his contributions are broad, vast, and run deep,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a statement. He added that Mr. Joswiak\u2019s many years of leadership at the company made him \u201cperfectly suited to this new role.\u201d\nThe move follows the departure of some prominent company leaders in the last few years, including Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s former head of design, and Angela Ahrendts, who once served as the company\u2019s head of retail.\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep working here as long as they will have me,\u201d Mr. Schiller, 60, said in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cI also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.\u201d\nMr. Schiller\u2019s title as head of marketing was, in some ways, an understatement for his actual role at the company. The Apple executive was involved in the conception and design of the company\u2019s most important products, including the iPhone and iPad, working closely with Steve Jobs, Mr. Ive and Scott Forstall, the former head of software. Mr. Schiller has worked at Apple since 1987.\nIn aninterviewlast October, Mr. Schiller reflected on the development of the original iPad. Around 2005, he and other Apple executives watched a demonstration from Bas Ording, an interface designer, on multitouch technology, in which he pretended to scroll on the screen and the screen moved up and down, mimicking realistic physics. The team decided to table the development of a tablet and focus on bringing multitouch technology to a smartphone, which would eventually become the iPhone. The iPhone\u2019s success, followed by the introduction of the App Store, laid a foundation for Apple to develop the iPad.\n\u201cWe all got excited because when you think of all of the best products from Apple through history, usually the user interface model is essential to that departure from the past \u2014 whether it\u2019s the mouse and the Mac, the click wheel on the iPod \u2014 this was going to be one of those moments,\u201d he said.\nWhen Mr. Jobs took a leave of absence from the company before his death, Mr. Schiller hosted the company\u2019s marketing events to introduce new products. Some believed Mr. Schiller was among those who could succeed Mr. Jobs, though it eventually became clear that Mr. Cook would take over.\nMr. Schiller has long overseen the App Store, which faces scrutiny for taking a 30 percent cut of app sales and in-app purchases.Lawmakers questioned Mr. Cookabout the store last week on Capitol Hill, arguing that the policy was anti-competitive and asking whyApple ranked its own apps ahead of rivals\u2019 offerings. Among other issues, they noted that Apple tried to collect its commission on the sales from businesses like ClassPass and Airbnb when theybegan selling virtual classesduring the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr. Joswiak, 56, another longtime Apple veteran known for his gregariousness, oversaw marketing for the iPhone and the iPod. He has worked more often behind the scenes, giving presentations of new products to media professionals. He made few onstage appearances but became more actively involved in events over the last few years."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIt feels awesome to get a good deal. Unless you realize that it\u2019s a bad deal.\nMany of us are happy to pay one price to scarf at Netflix\u2019s unlimited buffet of entertainment. (Many, thankfully, feel the same way about news organizations \u2014 including, ahem, The New York Times.)\nMembership programs like Amazon Prime let us feel like winners by paying up front to get a string of deliveries and other goodies for no extra charge.\nA good product offers us some stuff we like in an easy-to-buy package. A selfish product offers us some stuff a company wants to sell us in an easy-to-buy package. This is an important distinction.\nCable television is a product that might have started as the first, but has morphed into the second. Paying cable TV companies for 500 channels \u2014 even if you watched only nine of them \u2014 felt marvelous, until millions of American households wondered why they were paying so much for 500 channels when they watched nine. Our sentiment about good value for money can flip in a flash.\nI wonder now about our tolerance for the many 21st-century versions of the old cable TV bundle or other product combinations.\nNetflix is essentially cable TV, but a collection of individual TV series and movies instead of channels. (It\u2019s far cheaper, which is an important factor.) Apple seems to be trying almost every bundle it can imagine \u2014 tossing in its Apple TV Plus streaming video service with new iPhones, or potentially offeringtwo or more Apple digital services at a discounted price. Walmartwants to do Amazon Prime, but from Walmart.\nBundled things like this can be a great deal, or at least we can feel like we\u2019re getting a great deal. But other times, people grow resentful that they\u2019re paying for something they don\u2019t want or need. The key is finding the right products at the right price and for the right reasons.\nWhat happens if that iPhone owner who got a year of Apple TV Plus forgets to turn it off after her free membership ends? Her credit card will keep getting charged into perpetuity. If you pay for that Costco membership and never shop there, you might be angry with yourself and build resentment against Costco, too.\nOne thing to ask is why companies are selling some bundles but not others.\nApple pundits have been talkingfor yearsabout the possibility of paying a single monthly price for an iPhone, maybe an add-on product like AirPods headphones, an AppleCare warranty and some digital subscriptions.\nThis has not happened (yet) even as Apple starts to try every other conceivable bundle. That might be because it costs Apple almost nothing to toss in some video subscriptions, but the company could take a real hit by discounting its physical products.\nThe challenge for Netflix, Amazon, Apple and the rest is figuring out what collections of products we love \u2014 and at what price \u2014 and which we\u2019ll grow to hate. There is a fine line between feeling like we\u2019re getting a steal, and feeling like we\u2019re getting ripped off. The cable TV bosses didn\u2019t think that we would resent their bundles, until we did.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nYou should read my colleagues\u2019great articlethat traced how an observable fact from protests in Portland, Ore. \u2014 a few people burned one or possibly two Bibles \u2014 became a false narrative that mass numbers of people burned a stack of Bibles and American flags.\nMy colleagues wrote that the original incident was exaggerated by a Russia-backed news organization, spread on Twitter by someone who didn\u2019t confirm it, and picked up online by news outlets, politicians and commentators who already believed that the protests (and liberals) were out of control.\nMy question from this \u2014 and from my colleague Kevin Roose\u2019sreporting on the QAnon conspiracy\u2014 is whether Americans are so divided that we don\u2019t trust anything \u2014 and conversely aren\u2019t willing to disbelieve anything. Matthew Rosenberg, one of the reporters on the Portland story, gave me a (discouraging) answer:\nAbsolutely, and I think we\u2019ve been seeing this phenomenon unfold over years. It\u2019s why nonsense likebirtherismorQAnoncan take hold. I\u2019m not suggesting people shouldn\u2019t treat what they hear from news organizations or authorities with skepticism. But maybe don\u2019t be so quick to believe that apricing glitch on Wayfairis evidence of children being trafficked.\nWe spend a lot of time worrying aboutinterferencefrom Russia, China or Iran. But disinformation needs to have a receptive audience to work. If Americans weren\u2019t so divided \u2014 if most political arguments were over a shared set of facts, not wildly conflicting worldviews \u2014 it would be hard for a foreign power to meddle.\nThe Portland Bible burnings illustrate the problem. Sure, Russian state-backed media flagged what was going on and blew it out of proportion. But it was Americans who made it an issue, and used it to score political points. Ultimately, it is us doing this to ourselves.\nYour tween might be angry about this:A dispute over money and control of app distribution has led to Apple and Google kicking the video gameFortnite out of their app stores. (Already downloaded games should work fine, butthey might not soon.) The latest example of app developers\u2019 anger at these tech giants might eventually be resolved in court, but it\u2019s currently mostly a public relations war.Fortnite is winning that war.\nTikTok had steered clear of trouble for five minutes:Many digital services willfully ignore that many of their users are younger than 13, violating a U.S. child privacy law unless the young users have parental permission to use the sites. My colleagues Raymond Zhong and Sheera Frenkel reported that TikTok may have known and not acted on information thata large share of its U.S. users were likely too young to sign up. That could get TikTok into more hot water, particularly because its predecessor company waspreviously finedfor breaking the child privacy rules.\nNo, no, no, no, Zoom, no, no:\u201cPretty much every face-lift patient that comes in says: \u2018I\u2019ve been doing these Zoom calls and I don\u2019t know what happened but I look terrible.\u2019\u201d Apparently lots of people think the pandemic is aperfect time to surgically tinker with their faces or tummies, my colleague Matt Richtel wrote.\nHave you seen those twinshearing a decades-old Phil Collins song for the first time?

        "title": "Fortnite Creator Sues Apple and Google After Ban From App Stores",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s spats with app developers over their cut of revenues exploded into a high-stakes clash on Thursday when the tech giants kicked the wildly popular gameFortniteout of their app stores and the game\u2019s maker hit back with lawsuits.\nThe fight began on Thursday morning with a clear provocation.Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, started encouraging Fortnite\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that they handle all such app payments, so they can collect a 30 percent commission, a policy that has been at the center ofantitrust complaintsagainst the companies.\nHours later, Apple responded, removing the Fortnite app from its App Store.\n\u201cEpic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.\u201d\nWithin an hour, Epic opened a multifront war against Apple that appeared months in the making.\nFirst, it sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.\n\u201cApple\u2019s removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the\u201d market for in-app payments on iPhones, Epic said in its 62-page lawsuit.\nThen Epic rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign that depicted Apple, one of the industry\u2019s most image-conscious companies, as the stodgy old guard trying to stifle the upstart. To do so, it used Apple\u2019s own imagery against it, mimicking Apple\u2019s iconic \u201c1984\u201d ad from its own fight against IBM 36 years ago. This time, Fortnite characters were defying Apple\u2019s totalitarian regime. Within hours, #FreeFortnite was the top trend on Twitter.\nLater on Thursday, Google also removed the Fortnite app from its official Android app store, the Google Play Store, saying the app violated Google\u2019s policies. Epic replied with a similar lawsuit.\nApple\u2019s confrontation with Epic has much higher stakes than Google\u2019s because Fortnite remains available for Android devices. Google\u2019s Android software allows people to download apps outside Google\u2019s app store, unlike Apple\u2019s approach with iPhones, and Epic hadadded Fortnite to the Play storeonly in April.\nIn Epic, Apple has met arguably its toughest adversary in years. The game maker has calculated exactly how to hit Apple where it hurts: by making iPhones less attractive and Apple less cool.\nEpic, a North Carolina company that is valued at roughly $17 billion and is partly owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, now appears poised to sacrifice millions of dollars in revenue in a fight that will keep Fortnite off iPhones. That immediately makes Apple\u2019s flagship devices far less attractive to millions of people across the world \u2014 just ahead of Apple\u2019s most prominent iPhone introduction in years.\nApple, on the verge of a $2 trillion valuation as its stock has soared in recent weeks, now faces a battle with one of its most lucrative partners over a crucial issue for antitrust regulators investigating the power of Big Tech.\nHow Apple polices the App Store has drawn intense scrutiny over the past year. App developers have complained that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business while, in many cases, also competing with their apps with its own offerings.\nEuropean regulators, Justice Department officials and state attorneys general are all investigating Apple\u2019s control over the App Store, and House lawmakers interrogated Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, on the issue in a hearing last month. Google has faced more scrutiny for other issues, in large part because of its more liberal app policy on Android.\nFor Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, there are few easy options. Apple has largely staked its future on its services business, which has become its second-largest source of revenue after sales of the iPhone, at $51.7 billion over the past year. But that business is mostly built on its cut of other apps\u2019 sales, so enforcing its 30 percent commission is crucial to keeping its business growing.\nAs a result, backing down to Epic would set a dangerous precedent for Apple, while standing up to the gaming company would prolong a fight that risks shrinking its iPhone sales and damaging its carefully crafted image.\nIn practical terms, kicking Fortnite out of the App Store means that new users will not be able to download the app, but it will continue to work on iPhones that already have the app installed. Yet Epic now cannot update the Fortnite app, meaning it will eventually become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.\nFor Android users, there will be much less of an impact; they can still download Fortnite from Epic\u2019s website. As a result, hordes of Fortnite fans could now favor Google\u2019s devices over Apple\u2019s.\nSuing Apple, in particular, serves two goals for Epic: winning in legal court and winning in the court of public opinion, said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School. Epic is more likely to succeed in the latter, she said. \u201cThere is growing business pressure against Apple,\u201d she said, noting an antitrust case would be more complicated and difficult to win.\nFortnite has become an enormous enterprise, andannounced in Maythat it had more than 350 million registered players. The game generated $1.8 billion in revenue last year, according toanalysis firm SuperData.\nSince March 2018, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission, Sensor Tower said.\nOn Android devices, people have been much more likely to download Fortnite from outside Google\u2019s Play Store. Since April, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded 11 million times on the Play Store and generated about $10 million in sales, according to Sensor Tower. Google took about $3 million of that.\n\u201cEpic could likely have worked out a privileged deal with Apple \u2014 as other big tech companies have,\u201d said Matthew Ball, the managing partner at Epyllion Industries, which operates a venture capital fund. \u201cInstead, it is fighting for the marketplace.\u201d\nApple has had aseries of recent spatswith app makers. The music service Spotify has complained to regulators in Europe and the United States. Blix, which makes an email app that competes with Apple's service, also sued Apple on antitrust grounds last year. And last week, Microsoft ended a pilot of its mobile gaming app and Facebook watered down its gaming app on iPhones because of Apple\u2019s rules.\nApple has said that all app developers are subject to the same rules, and that its commission is fair. Apple has argued that it spends billions of dollars on the App Store and iPhone technology, creating business opportunities for companies like Epic.\n\u201cEpic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem, including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\u201d\nIn past disputes that led to bad publicity, Appletweaked its rulesto letcomplaining app developers back into the App Store. But Epic\u2019s fights appears to be about more than just its app.\nIn 2018, Epic released its own app store, and began charging developers 12 percent. Tim Sweeney, the chief executive and founder of Epic, said in an interview last month that the Epic Games Store had processed more than $1 billion in transactions. Even with the lower fee, he said, Epic still makes a profit of 5 to 7 percent.\nMr. Sweeney said that he felt obligated to \u201cmake this industry a better and fairer place.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to the future of humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise you have these corporations who control all commerce and all speech.\u201d"

        "title": "Big Tech Makes Inroads With the Biden Campaign",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been critical of Big Tech,admonishing Facebookfor mishandling misinformation and saying internet companiesshould lose a central legal protection.\nBut his campaign has quietly welcomed onto its staff and policy groups people who have worked with or for Silicon Valley giants, raising concerns among the industry\u2019s critics that the companies are seeking to co-opt a potentialBidenadministration.\nOne of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest aides joined the campaign from Apple,while others held senior roles at firms that consulted for major tech companies. And a nearly 700-person volunteer group advising the campaign, the Innovation Policy Committee, includes at least eight people who work for Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Other committee members have close ties to the companies, including economists and lawyers who have advised them, and officials at think tanks funded by them.\nThe group\u2019s members also include some prominent progressives arguing for stiffer regulation of tech. But the presence of the industry\u2019s allies inside Mr. Biden\u2019s policy apparatus and campaign and transition teams \u2014 and his campaign\u2019s effort to ensure the confidentiality of its policy process \u2014 has alarmed an increasingly influential coalition of liberals who say the tech titans stifle competition, disregard user privacy and fail to adequately police hate speech and disinformation.\nThey are hoping to dissuade Mr. Biden, who has not made tech issues a major focus of his campaign, from following the example of his former boss, President Barack Obama, whoseembrace of tech companieshelped turn them into darlings in Washington.\nToday the tech giants are trying to fend off new regulations or antitrust lawsuits. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have spent more than a year investigatingGoogle,Facebook,AmazonandApplefor possible violations of competition law. During a House hearing last month, lawmakers from both partiesgrilled the chief executivesof all four companies about accusations that their dominance had hurt consumers, rivals and small businesses, as well as what they were doing to police false information.\n\u201cThe environment is very different now,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of a think tank that has been funded in part by Google, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. \u201cWhen Obama took office, you know, tech was like a bromance kind of thing. Everybody loved it, and people didn\u2019t see the issues that some people see now.\u201d\nA co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business,\u201d a 2018 book, Mr. Atkinson is among the allies of Big Tech on the Innovation Policy Committee. While he said the members represented \u201ca fairly diverse set of views,\u201d he predicted that a potential Biden administration would face significant pressure from the left to clamp down on the major tech companies.\nMatt Hill, a spokesman for Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, said in a statement that the former vice president would not take it easy on Big Tech.\n\u201cMany technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power but misled the American people, damaged our democracy and evaded any form of responsibility,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cAnyone who thinks that campaign volunteers or advisers will change Joe Biden\u2019s fundamental commitment to stopping the abuse of power and stepping up for the middle class doesn\u2019t know Joe Biden.\u201d\nThe tech policy committee,which is broken down into smaller specialty groups, is part of a vast network of thousands of policy advisers assembled by the campaign. The policy teams do not have ultimate authority over the campaign\u2019s proposals or advise Mr. Biden directly. But lobbyists and activists are watching them closely for signs of Mr. Biden\u2019s approach to issues and his possible hiring pool if he is elected.\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign and transition team include advisers with ties totech companies and other industries that worry liberals. Avril Haines, a former Obama national security and intelligenceofficial who is helping to lead Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team, was a consultant for the data-mining company Palantir and WestExec Advisors, a firm that represented a major tech company it hasn\u2019t identified.\nA WestExec co-founder and Obama State Department official, Antony J. Blinken, is running the Biden campaign\u2019s foreign policy operation. WestExec has worked with the philanthropy started by Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, andwith Google\u2019s in-house incubation unit, Jigsaw. But Mr. Blinken and Ms. Haines did not participate in that work, according to the Biden campaign, which said both advisers stepped away from WestExec this month.\nCynthia C. Hogan, a former White House lawyer for Mr. Biden who ishelping to leadhis vice-presidential selection process, was alobbyistand government affairs executive at Apple. She tendered herresignationfrom the company in April, according to the Biden campaign.\nA spokeswoman for Google said in a statement that employees worked with campaigns in their personal capacities and not as representatives of the company. Apple said an employee participating in the Biden policy process was doing so on his own time during nights and weekends. Facebook declined to comment on the committee butpointed to a policythat allows employees to engage in political activities on their personal time. Amazon declined to comment.\nAmong the participants in the large tech policy committee are Facebook\u2019s director of global competition policy, Anant Raut, and Matt Perault, who testified as director of public policy for the company during a congressional antitrust investigation last year before departing for academia.\nAnother member is Howard Shelanski, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk who represents Facebook in the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust investigation into the company. He is not working with the group of committee members dealing with questions about the tech platforms, said a person familiar with his involvement, who would speak only anonymously.\nStill more members work for organizations, like Mr. Atkinson\u2019s, that receive funding from the companies or are economists who have consulted for Amazon, Google and Apple. Mr. Atkinson himself is not a member of the antitrust group.\nThe committee is divided into smaller groups that focus on issues like antitrust policy, artificial intelligence, broadband access, disinformation and data privacy. The antitrust group includes people with tech ties like Mr. Perault, Mr. Raut and Mr. Shelanski. But it also includes some people who have pushed for more scrutiny of the tech giants, including employees at rival companies as well asthe activist Sarah Millerand Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School,prominent criticswho have called formore vigorous antitrust enforcement. (Mr. Wu is also a contributing opinion writer at The Times.)\nThe Biden campaign identified two aides, Bruce Reed and Stef Feldman, as more directly counseling the former vice president on technology issues. The campaign said Mr. Blinken was not advising the campaign on domestic technology policy. It stressed that members of its policy committees were not there to represent their employers or clients, and that lobbyists \u2014 except those who represent labor unions \u2014 were barred from participating.\nAfter The Times asked members of the tech policy volunteer group about their work, some of them received a message \u201cto remind everyone that the work we are doing here is for the purpose of developing policy positions that are sound and in the best interest of the candidate and his election as president.\u201d\nThe message noted that there were \u201ca variety of rumors floating around\u201d about how \u201cthe campaign is managing conflicts of interest and lobbying by corporate and other interests.\u201d And it acknowledged that while \u201cit is sometimes hard to separate one\u2019s personal views from those of one\u2019s employer or clients,\u201d members should do their \u201cabsolute best to ensure that the ideas that you offer up and the contributions that you make are consistent with what is best for the candidate and not what is best for you or your clients or your employer.\u201d\nAlist of rulesprovided to members of the policy groups, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, instructs participants not to disclose their participation \u201con social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn or in your professional bio.\u201d It also warns them not to discuss or distribute names of other committee members, contents of committee conversations, emails from the committee or to talk to the news media.\n\u201cSimply put, do not talk to the press,\u201d the document reads, emphasizing \u201cdo not talk to the press\u201d in boldface.\nSeveral members of the tech committee followed that guidance, declining to discuss their involvement and referring inquiries to the campaign. But some members of the antitrust subgroup expressed optimism that a Biden administration would usher in more rigorous approaches to the law.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really at the crux of needing some very, very strong leadership on antitrust and competition, and some strengthening of the laws,\u201d said Diana L. Moss, a member of the antitrust subgroup and president of the American Antitrust Institute, whose think tank has accepted funds from Amazon and Google.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 40 years of lax enforcement and all the damage to prove it,\u201d she said, stressing that she was speaking for herself and not the Biden policy committee."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nYour tween might be freaking outthat she can\u2019t play a new Fortnite video gameon her iPhone. Or maybe you\u2019ve heard thatSpotify,Tinder,Facebookand asmall email companyare fuming about how Apple treats their apps.\nApple has an iron gripon what apps people can download on their iPhones, and some app makers arecomplaining loudlyabout this arrangement as well as thefees that Apple collectsfrom some apps.\nThis feels like an intractable standoff, with app users caught in the middle. But there are nuts-and-bolts changes that Apple could make to tackle the bureaucracy, unpredictability and unfairness of the app world.\nThese changes won\u2019t end all of these conflicts, which are starting to deprive people of apps ormake them confusingand expensive to use. But the app system could be made better even without a truce.\nI asked for ideas on how Apple could improve the app store fromJacob Eiting, a founder of RevenueCat, which helps app makers design in-app purchases and knows what drives developers crazy.\nSpecify how developers can fix rejected apps:Apple says yes or no to each new iPhone app or app update, based on the company\u2019s 12,700-word app rule book \u2014 not including addendums. (The United States Constitution plus all the amendments runs for 7,600 words.)\nEiting said developers sometimes get rejection letters that simply recite a portion of Apple\u2019s rules. He said it would be more helpful if Apple\u2019s staff offered specific suggestions for what developers could change \u2014 sometimes as minor as tweaking a menu \u2014 to get the app approved.\nImprove Apple\u2019s payments technology:Eiting said it could take weeks or longer for app makers to write software that links their app to Apple\u2019s proprietary system for people to pay for stuff with a fingerprint or face scan. Creating software hookups with other payments technology is much simpler, Eiting said.\nClarify the gray zone:Apple has two categories of app purchases: When you buy something virtual, like an e-book, Apple collects from the app maker a fee of up to 30 percent on the purchase. When you buy something to use in the real world, like a physical book or an Uber ride, Apple doesn\u2019t charge a fee.\nBut an increasing number of apps offer services that are somewhere between real and virtual \u2014personal training or cooking classes conducted over an app, for example.\nEiting said Apple needed to clarify when the company will assess commissions on apps that offer these hybrid activities. Confusion over this question is stopping some apps before they even start, he said.\nConsider an independent app review:There are inevitable questions about conflict of interest between app makers andApple\u2019s own apps that compete with them.The founders of Blix, an email app maker that hasfought with Apple, suggested to me that Apple create an independent app review process to make sure it isn\u2019t unfairly punishing rival apps.\nApple hasin the past made changes to its app systemto respond to developers\u2019 complaints, and the company told me it\u2019s always open to more. Any tweaks, though, won\u2019t go as far as some app makers want: essentially, toblow up Apple\u2019s control over what apps are allowedon people\u2019s iPhones.\nBut it\u2019s still possible to revamp the app system in ways that could bring more calm for Apple, developers and our smartphone-dependent lives.\nBrian X. Chen, the consumer technology columnist for The New York Times, offers these helpful tips to tame the apps that nag us too much or bog down our phones:\nApps can make our lives better. But some pester you with too many notifications, and others hog too much battery life or device storage.\nHere are four steps you can take to minimize app nuisances:\n1) Declutter:Purge all the apps you haven\u2019t used for a long time.\n2) Find and eliminate the storage hogs:On iPhones, go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage to see a list of the apps that are taking up the most space on your device. Select each one of them and follow the recommendations to reduce their load.\nOn Android devices, use Google\u2019s tool calledFiles, which has an option to sort apps on your device by the biggest storage hogs.\n3) Minimize notifications:On iPhones, go to Settings > Notifications to see a switchboard of apps that send notifications. OnAndroids, do the same thing by opening Settings > Apps & Notifications > Notifications.\nFrom there, turn off notifications for all but the most important apps such as messaging and email.\n4) Find the battery suckers:Be on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods, even when you\u2019re not using them, as this can drain your battery life.\nOn iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app, and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.\nOn the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap on an app to reveal information about how much of your battery life it is consuming when you\u2019re actively using it (\u201con screen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackground\u201d).\nOn Android devices, the most useful information is the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time it has been chipping away at your battery even when you haven\u2019t been using it.\nWhen you find a battery-sucking culprit, go to the app\u2019s individual settings and turn off some features to minimize its power usage.\nWe have no clue what\u2019s happening with TikTok: The app might be shut down in the United States soon, or get sold and stay alive, or face something else entirely. The latest twist my colleagues reported: The government of China, the home country of TikTok\u2019s current owner, ByteDance, revised its rules in ways that might \u2014 as the U.S. government has done \u2014dictate who gets to own TikTokbased on national security guidelines.\nEpisode 4 zillion of tech companies\u2019 reality contradicting their idealism:Erin Griffith, who writes about young tech companies for The Times, takes us inside the conflicts at Carta. This start-up was built to give workers more power at their companies and help close gaps in pay and workplace treatment for women. But Erin reported that some of Carta\u2019s employees \u2014 many of them women \u2014said that they were mistreated and underpaid by their own employer, and that their complaints were ignored or worse.\nVirtual school might mean missing out on special education:With many school districts in the United States restarting at least in part online this fall, it\u2019s not clear whether children with disabilities will be able to receive physical or occupational therapy or other forms of specialized instruction that they often get in school, The Wall Street Journalreported.\nI recently learned that a shore bird called theWilson\u2019s Phalaropespins in the water to create a vortex that sucks in insects and other tasty treats. A whole marsh of these spinning birds,as this 2013 video shows, is quite a sight.\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.

        "title": "Profits Rebound at Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway",
        "fulltext": "The strong recovery in the stock market \u2014 and a surge in the value of Apple\u2019s stock, in particular \u2014 drove a rebound in profits for Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter.\nBerkshire on Saturday said it earned $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a turnaround froma $49.7 billion lossin the first quarter, when a plunge in the stock market, prompted by the coronavirus outbreak, caused huge paper losses in Mr. Buffett\u2019s giant stock portfolio. In the second quarter of last year, Berkshire earned $14.2 billion.\nThe weak economy, caused by the pandemic and business interruptions, weighed on many of the companies that the conglomerate owns. Berkshire warned that the pandemic could lead to changes in the economy that could hurt its operations. \u201cWe cannot reliably predict when business activities at our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve,\u201d it said in its second-quarter filing.\nAside from its stock holdings in companies like Apple and Bank of America, Berkshire owns outright a wide array of large businesses \u2014 in the insurance, railway, energy, retail and manufacturing sectors \u2014 that provide a snapshot of the health of the American economy.\nIn the quarter, Berkshire reported a $26.7 billion increase in the value of its stock holdings, powered by a $27.7 billion surge in the value of the company\u2019s investment in Apple\u2019s stock, whose price has soared this year even as the global economy sputtered badly.\nBerkshire\u2019s stock gains don\u2019t become cash profits until the company sells an investment, which was typically an uncommon occurrence. But in the second quarter, itsold its stakes in airline companiesas Mr. Buffett soured on their prospects in the virus-afflicted economy. Overall, Berkshire sold $13.6 billion of equity securities in the second quarter, a jump from $2.1 billion in the first quarter.\nThough Mr. Buffett has a long record as a savvy investor, Berkshire\u2019s stock has performed worse than the broader stock market this year, falling 7.4 percent, versus a 3.7 percent increase for the S&P 500 stock index.\nIn a sign that Mr. Buffett might believe Berkshire\u2019s shares are undervalued, the company spent $6.7 billion buying back its own stock in the second quarter, a record amount, and up from $1.7 billion in the first quarter.\nDuring and after the 2008 financial crisis, Berkshire made big investments and acquisitions that ended up producing big returns. But the company has so far only announced one large acquisition during the coronavirus crisis \u2014 a$4 billion deal to buy natural gas pipelineassets that was agreed to last month. Berkshire said on Saturday that it expected the deal to close in the fourth quarter.\nBerkshire\u2019s holdings of cash and short-term Treasury bills \u2014 money it can, in theory, use to make big acquisitions in the future \u2014 rose to $146.6 billion in the second quarter from $137.2 billion in the first quarter.\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe, Berkshire\u2019s large North American railway operation, reported a fall in revenue in the second quarter as the pandemic contributed to a decline in the volume of goods it transports. Berkshire\u2019s manufacturing and retail businesses were also hit by the disruptions to the economy. The company also took a roughly $10 billion write-down on intangible assets related to Precision Castparts Corporation, a metal components manufacturer that it bought in 2016 for $32.7 billion.\nBerkshire\u2019s giant energy business reported a decline in pretax earnings in the second quarter but net profits were up because of a large tax benefit.\nThe company\u2019s insurance operations showed the mixed effects of the pandemic. Berkshire said its Geico unit received fewer claims because its customers were driving less frequently during the pandemic. But the company said it expected claims to increase as driving picks up, and added that a program that gives renewing customers a 15 percent premium credit would weigh on future financial results."
