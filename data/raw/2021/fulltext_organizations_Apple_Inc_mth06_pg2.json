        "title": "Buyers of Amazon Devices Are Guinea Pigs. That\u2019s a Problem.",
        "fulltext": "About four years ago, Paul Hollowell found out that Amazon was making a gadget he desperately wanted: a camera whose sole purpose was to photograph his clothes.\nThe oval camera, called theEcho Look, worked by photographing several clothing combinations and using artificial intelligence to highlight which outfit looked best. Mr. Hollowell, an entrepreneur and a frequent traveler from Dallas, usually spent hours picking clothes to pack for a trip and believed the camera would help him decide. He ordered one for $200.\nHe was correct \u2014 the camera saved time. But what he didn\u2019t predict was thatAmazonwould send an email three years later with sad news: The product and its app would soon cease to work. The company said it had included some of the Echo Look\u2019s features, like giving style advice, in more popular Amazon products, so it was time to put the digital fashionista to rest.\nMr. Hollowell, 39, was angry. \u201cYou can sunset the service, but at least let me use the camera,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just did nothing.\u201d\nMany have learned a hard lesson about what it means to be an Amazon customer. Even when you\u2019re paying lots of money, you are a guinea pig at the whims of a company endlessly striving to innovate. At any moment, the company could surprise you with an unwelcome change to an Amazon product you own or decide to kill it altogether.\nLast week, many people who own Amazon devices were automatically enrolled inSidewalk, a new internet-sharing program that drew intense scrutiny. Basically, the program lets owners of newer Amazon products share their internet connections with others nearby. If a neighbor\u2019s Ring camera has a spotty internet connection and yours has a strong one, you can share your bandwidth with your neighbor.\nThat all sounds nice if everything works as expected, but security experts have raised concerns that device makers could have inappropriate access to people\u2019s data. They advised that people opt out of the program to avoid becoming part of Amazon\u2019s experiment because there are still many unknowns.\nThis high-risk, high-reward approach to innovation is woven into Amazon\u2019s culture. Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, has said Amazon\u2019sfailures cost it billions of dollars. He once told investors that his company was \u201cthe best place in the world to fail (we have a lot of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins.\u201d\nIndeed, Amazon\u2019s unbridled embrace of failure has included high-profile flops in consumer electronics. For about four years, it sold millions ofAmazon Dash Buttons, which you could push to replenish items like toilet paper. Amazon killed the Dash in 2019, after orders placed through the buttons significantly decreased. In 2014, the companyaggressively marketed the Fire, its first smartphone, and shelved it just a year later amid lukewarm reviews and sluggish sales.\nAmazon continues to experiment with kitschy ideas. Last year, it unveiled anautonomous drone that flies around your home and shoots videoto catch intruders. The drone, which was widely panned by the press because of privacy concerns, has yet to be released. Halo, a fitness product that Amazon claims can tell you precisely how fat you are, received mixed ratings fromprofessional reviewersandearly customers, including complaints that the gadget could give people body dysmorphia.\nWhy does Amazon, a brand that probably knows more about what we want to buy than any other company, need to sell us experimental products just to figure out what it\u2019s doing? Tech companies big and small typically do their research and development in house before releasing products to us.\nWhat\u2019s more, when Amazon fails like this, you, the guinea pig, lose your hard-earned cash and a product you may enjoy. There is also an environmental impact: The electronic device could end up in a landfill, and even if you recycle it, only a small portion of its materials can be reused.\nLisa Levandowski, an Amazon spokeswoman, said that internal teams tested the company\u2019s inventions extensively but that, because they were novel and ambitious, customer feedback could help improve them. This approach allows Amazon to make products like the Echo andAlexawhat they are today, she said.\nDesign veterans with experience creating products for big tech brands like Apple and Samsung confirmed that Amazon\u2019s method was atypical. My general recommendation is to think twice before buying cutting-edge tech products made by Amazon \u2014 and if you do, be aware of the risk.\nA television, no matter how thin, makes an ugly centerpiece in a living room once it\u2019s turned off. With this in mind, Yves B\u00e9har, a Swiss designer, teamed up with Samsung to design a TV that could blend into the room like an art piece, he said.\nThey took a slow and patient approach.\nMr. B\u00e9har said he and Samsung designers had started with making observations about consumers: Homes were getting smaller, and tastes were becoming more eclectic. With that insight, the product developers worked with curators in museums and galleries to assemble art that could be shown on the TV.\nAfter a few years of testing prototypes and forming partnerships to procure artwork, the collaboration resulted in the 2017 introduction ofthe Frame TV, a Samsung television that resembled a picture frame. It used motion sensors to show art when people were present and shut off when nobody was around. The TV has become a best seller.\nMr. B\u00e9har, who founded Fuseproject, an industrial design firm, said he understood Amazon\u2019s approach as a retail company to rapidly test ideas \u2014 like when it measures how customers respond to different prices in its stores. But \u201cwith hardware, people end up being left with stuff that\u2019s useless or doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the world that we live in today, with global warming and plastics and waste, I do think it\u2019s something to be very careful about.\u201d\nDon Norman, who founded the Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego, and wrote the book \u201cThe Design of Everyday Things,\u201d said that throughout his career, he had seen some other companies use approaches similar to Amazon\u2019s.\nIn the 1990s, when Mr. Norman worked with Apple as a user experience architect, the company collaborated with Sony on a product. He said Apple had planned to spend years doing market research and testing prototypes before shipping it.\n\u201cSony laughed at us and said: \u2018What a stupid way of doing things. We just build a product, and we sell it. We get the feedback, and we kill it and do a better one. It\u2019s much more efficient and faster than your method,\u2019\u201d Mr. Norman said.\nThis on-the-fly approach to development is unpopular, he said, because most companies recognize that customers get angry when gadgets are quickly killed. \u201cThere\u2019s some logic to it but also a complete disrespect to what it might mean to your customers or environment or the world,\u201d Mr. Norman said.\nKyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts for people to repair gadgets, said there were better ways than Amazon\u2019s to discontinue products. When Pebble, a smartwatch maker, shut down in 2016, the company said the softwarewould continue to work. People continued to enjoy the productyears after the company\u2019s death.\nMr. Norman\u2019s advice for consumers is simple: Protest. Amazon is more likely to change its ways if people complain when they are treated as guinea pigs and steer clear of experimental gadgets like surveillance drones until they are proved to be lasting products.\nMr. Hollowell is an example of how tough it can be to pacify unhappy customers. When Amazon was announcing the death of the Echo Look, the company sent two emails. The first included a promotional code to get a newer product, the Echo Show 5, for free. Mr. Hollowell took the offer but found that the Echo Show was a poor substitute: The camera was subpar and lacked software to organize his closet, he said.\nThe second email was a reminder that the Echo Look would soon be dead and that it could be recycled. Mr. Hollowell missed the part about recycling. \u201cI very distinctly remember putting it in the trash one day because it just wasn\u2019t working,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Justice Dept. Watchdog to Investigate Seizure of Democrats\u2019 Data",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 TheJustice Department\u2019sindependent inspector general opened an investigation on Friday into the decision by federal prosecutors to secretly seize the data of House Democrats and reporters as investigators hunted down who was leaking classified information early in the Trump administration.\nAt the same time, top Senate Democrats demanded that the former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and William P. Barr testify publicly before Congress about the leak investigations, including aboutsubpoenas issued to tech companiesin 2017 and 2018 for the records of at least a dozen people tied to the House Intelligence Committee. The senators vowed to \u201cvigorously investigate\u201d and called on Republicansto join them.\nApple, which complied with a subpoena for information related to more than 100 email addresses and phone numbers in February 2018, said on Friday that it did not realize that the records belonged to Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and his associates. Microsoft said it was also subpoenaed by a grand jury as early as November 2017 for data related to an email account for an aide to the panel.\nDemocrats and privacy advocates denounced the exceedingly unusual seizures related to Congress,reported on Thursday by The New York Times, as an abuse of power. Some called on lawmakers to pursue legal changes to crack down on the kind of gag orders used for years to keep companies from disclosing the subpoenas. Others urged the Justice Department to punish investigators who sought the records.\n\u201cI hope every prosecutor who was involved in this is thrown out of the department,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, a Democrat on the intelligence panel whose records were also seized. \u201cIt crosses the line of what we do in this country.\u201d\nThe episode added fuel to accusations of politicization in the Trump-era Justice Department, where federal prosecutors seemingly gave lenient treatment to some of the former president\u2019s allies and targeted reporters and Democrats he reviled as the administration sought to stop leaks about Trump associates and Russia.\nThe Biden Justice Department had disclosed in recent weeks that the same investigators secretly seized phone records of journalists atThe Washington Post,CNNandThe New York Times. Related fights over email data spilled over into the early Biden era, including the imposition of gag orders on CNN and Times executives and lawyers that were only recently lifted.\nThe White House vowed again on Friday to put an end to those practices, while also saying that President Biden was adamant that the Justice Department must be free of political influence.\nAndrew Bates, a deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement that \u201cthe reported conduct\u201d of the Trump-era Justice Department was \u201cshocking, and clearly fits within an appalling trend that represents the opposite of how authority should be used.\u201d\nIn aninterview with Politicoon Friday, Mr. Barr sought to distance himself from the tactics. He said he was \u201cnot aware of any congressman\u2019s records being sought in a leak case\u201d while he was attorney general. The subpoenas to Apple and Microsoft for congressional records were issued before his tenure.\nCongressional Democrats welcomed the assurance from the Biden administration but signaled that they were unwilling to take the Justice Department at its word. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the department had a \u201cvery short window to make a clean break from the Trump era on this matter\u201d before his panel would step in.\n\u201cWe expect the department to provide a full accounting of these cases, and we expect the attorney general to hold the relevant personnel accountable for their conduct,\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \u201cIf the department does not make substantial progress toward these two goals, then we on the Judiciary Committee will have no choice but to step in and do the work ourselves.\u201d\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, might stand the best chance of piecing together a full picture of what took place. He said on Friday that he would review the department\u2019s use of subpoenas and other legal maneuvers to secretly seize communications records associated with both Congress and reporters.\n\u201cThe review will examine the department\u2019s compliance with applicable D.O.J. policies and procedures, and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said.\nHis announcement followed a referral by the deputy attorney general, Lisa O. Monaco, according to a senior Justice Department official; Attorney General Merrick B. Garland directed her to take that step, the official said. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an inspector general investigation.\nMr. Schiff welcomed the inquiry but said it was insufficient. He called on Congress to take a broader look at \u201cthe systemic politicization of the department and its mission, and other flagrant abuses.\u201d\nAn investigation by Senate Democrats could provide that broader perspective. But it might be hampered by Republicans\u2019 willingness to participate in an evenly divided Senate, complicating the ability of investigators to issue subpoenas for information or to compel testimony.\n\u201cThis issue should not be partisan; under the Constitution, Congress is a coequal branch of government and must be protected from an overreaching executive, and we expect that our Republican colleagues will join us in getting to the bottom of this serious matter,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\nBut Republicans did not appear eager to take part. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, issued a skeptical statement suggesting that the Trump administration had reason to investigate whether lawmakers or their staff were leaking information, and that he would prefer to simply let Mr. Horowitz\u2019s work play out.\n\u201cInvestigations into members of Congress and staff are nothing new, especially for classified leaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Justice Department has specific procedures for such sensitive investigations, and the inspector general is already working to determine if they were followed.\u201d\nThough leak investigations are routine, seizures of reporters\u2019 information is fraught \u2014 and, according to current and former officials at the Justice Department and in Congress, seizing data on lawmakers outside the context of a corruption investigation is nearly unheard-of.\nSecretly seizing communications-related data about members of Congress and their staff and families for a leak investigation was \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d said David Kris, who led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division during President Obama\u2019s first term.\n\u201cYou likely wouldn\u2019t do this at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely fraught. It would definitely get high-level review and approval; it\u2019s unthinkable to me that it would go anywhere short of the attorney general.\u201d\nThe Times also reported that prosecutors had struggled to develop information tying members of the Intelligence Committee or their aides to the leaks, but Mr. Barr, after he was sworn in in 2019, objected to closing the inquiry. The case was ultimately closed without charges.\nA person close to Mr. Sessions said that he, too, did not know that the Justice Department had subpoenaed data belonging to members of the House Intelligence Committee and their staff and family. At the time, investigators were trying to identify the source of leaks about the Russia investigation; Mr. Sessions was recused from most matters related to Russia after he had spoken with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 campaign.\nRod J. Rosenstein, Mr. Sessions\u2019s deputy, who handled matters from which the attorney general recused himself, declined to comment.\nIn this case, affiliates of the Intelligence Committee learned the full extent of the scrutiny only in May, after a gag order on Apple expired and the company notified individuals whose data had been turned over pursuant to the subpoenas.\nBut there were earlier signs of activity as well. The F.B.I. questioned Michael Bahar, a former House Intelligence Committee staff member, in the spring of 2020, according to current and former government officials.\nA copy of the subpoena to Microsoft reviewed by The Times shows that the department was seeking records going back to April 2016 that might have tied the committee official to particular accounts, like information about who was using the account, with what devices, how they were logging on, from where and when, and other subscriber information given to Microsoft when the account was set up.\nA Microsoft spokesman confirmed on Friday that it had received the subpoena but had also been subject to a gag order for more than two years that prevented the company from informing the aide about the seizure.\nKatie Bennercontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple Is Said to Have Turned Over Data on Trump\u2019s White House Counsel in 2018",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for information in February 2018 about an account that belonged to Donald F. McGahn II, President Donald J. Trump\u2019s White House counsel at the time, and barred the company from telling him about it, according to two people briefed on the matter.\nApple told Mr. McGahn about the subpoena last month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Mr. McGahn\u2019s wife also received a similar notice from Apple, the person said.\nIt is not clear what F.B.I. agents were investigating, whether Mr. McGahn was their specific focus or whether he was swept up in a larger net because he had communicated with someone who was under scrutiny. As the top lawyer for the 2016 Trump campaign and then the White House counsel, Mr. McGahn was in contact with numerous people who may have drawn attention either as part of the Russia investigation or a later leak inquiry.\nStill, the disclosure that agents had collected data of a sitting White House counsel, which they kept secret for years, is extraordinary.\nAnd it comes amid a political backlash after revelations that the Trump administration secretly seized the personaldata of reportersandDemocrats in Congressfrom phone and tech companies while investigating leaks.\nDemocratic leaders on Capitol Hill on Sundayratcheted up pressure on the Justice Departmentand former officials to provide a fuller accounting of events. They called on the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division,John C. Demers, and the former deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to testify before Congress along with the former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and William P. Barr.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. McGahn. An Apple representative did not respond to a request for comment.\nApple told Mr. McGahn that it had complied with the subpoena in a timely fashion but declined to tell him what it had provided the government, according to a person briefed on the matter. UnderJustice Department policy, gag orders for subpoenas may be renewed for up to a year at a time, suggesting that prosecutors went to court several times to prevent Apple from notifying the McGahns earlier.\nIn investigations, agents sometimes compile a large list of phone numbers and email addresses that were in contact with a subject, and seek to identify all those people by using subpoenas to communications companies for any account information like names, computer addresses and credit card numbers associated with them.\nApple told the McGahns that it had received the subpoena on Feb. 23, 2018, according to a person briefed on the matter.\nUnder federal law, prosecutors generally need to obtain permission from a federal judge in order to compel a company like Apple to delay notifying people that their personal information has been subpoenaed, said Paul M. Rosen, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at Crowell and Moring.\n\u201cThere is a lot here we don\u2019t know, including the facts and circumstances surrounding the request for the delay and what was presented to the judge,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. But, he added, prosecutors typically need to prove that either notifying the person \u201cwould endanger someone\u2019s safety, risk the destruction of evidence or intimidation of witnesses, or seriously jeopardize an investigation.\u201d\nThe subpoena was issued by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, the other person familiar with the matter said.\nIt is not clear why prosecutors obtained the subpoena. But several notable developments were unfolding around that time.\nThe federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia was the center of one part of the Russia inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that focused on Paul Manafort, a former chairman of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.\nBecause Mr. McGahn had been the top lawyer for the Trump campaign in 2016, it is possible that at some earlier point he had been among those in contact with someone whose account the Mueller team was scrutinizing in early 2018.\nNotably,Mr. Manafort had been hit with new fraud chargesunsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia the day before the subpoena. Subsequentdevelopmentsrevealedthat Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators were closely scrutinizing some of his communications accounts in the following days.\nOn the other hand, the Manafort case was largely handled in the District of Columbia, where he faced separate charges. Still, the Mueller team was also working with federal prosecutors in Virginia during that period on an unregistered foreign agentcase related to Turkey and a business partner of Michael T. Flynn\u2019s, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who had also advised him during the 2016 campaign.\nIt was also around that time that Mr. McGahn was involved in another matter related to the Russia investigation, one that included a leak.\nIn late January 2018,The New York Times reported, based on confidential sourcing, that Mr. Trump had ordered Mr. McGahn the previous June to have the Justice Department remove Mr. Mueller, but Mr. McGahn had refused to do so and threatened to resign. The Washington Post confirmed that account soon after in a follow-up article.\nThe Mueller report \u2014 andMr. McGahn in private testimonybefore the House Judiciary Committee this month \u2014 described Mr. Trump\u2019s anger at Mr. McGahn after the Times article and how he had tried to persuade Mr. McGahn to make a statement falsely denying it. Mr. Trump told aides that Mr. McGahn was a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201cleaker,\u201d according to former Trump administration officials. In his testimony, Mr. McGahn said that he had been a source for The Post\u2019s follow-up to clarify a nuance \u2014 to whom he had conveyed his intentions to resign \u2014 but he had not been a source for the original Times article.\nThere are reasons to doubt that Mr. McGahn was the target of any Justice Department leak investigation stemming from that episode, however. Information about Mr. Trump\u2019s orders to dismiss Mr. Mueller, for example, would not appear to be a classified national-security secret of the sort that it can be a crime to disclose.\nYet another roughly concurrent event was a Justice Department investigation into unauthorized disclosures of information about the Russia inquiry. As part of that investigation, prosecutors sent Apple a subpoena on Feb. 6, 2018, for data on congressional staff members, their families and at least two members of Congress. Apple only recently informed those targeted because it had been prohibited from disclosing the subpoena at the time.\nAmong those whose data was seized were two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee: Representatives Eric Swalwell and Adam B. Schiff, both of California. Mr. Schiff, a sharp political adversary of Mr. Trump, is now the panel\u2019s chairman.The Times first reportedon that subpoena last week.\nMany questions remain unanswered about the events leading up to the subpoenas, including how high they were authorized in the Trump Justice Department and whether investigators anticipated or hoped that they were going to sweep in data on the politically prominent lawmakers. The subpoena sought data on 109 email addresses and phone numbers.\nIn that case, the leak investigation appeared to have been primarily focused on Michael Bahar, then a staff member on the House Intelligence Committee. People close to Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein, the top two Justice Department officials at the time, have said that neither knew that prosecutors had sought data about the accounts of lawmakers for that investigation.\nIt remains unclear whether agents were pursuing a theory that Mr. Bahar had leaked on his own or whether they suspected him of talking to reporters with the approval of lawmakers. Either way, it appears they were unable to prove their suspicions that he was the source of any unauthorized disclosures; the case has been closed, and no charges were brought.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday called for Mr. Barr, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein to testify before Congress about the subpoenas. She said that what the Justice Department did under Mr. Trump went \u201ceven beyond Richard Nixon\u201d but declined to say whether a congressional committee would compel their testimony.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope they will want to honor the rule of law,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Justice Department has been rogue under President Trump.\u201d\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, called for anyone potentially involved in the subpoenas, including Mr. Demers, to testify before Congress. \u201cThe sins of the Trump administration just continue to pile up,\u201d he said at a news conference in New York.\n\u201cThis was nothing less than a gross abuse of power, an assault on the separation of powers,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, warning that if the men would not testify, lawmakers would subpoena them.\nHe also called on Senate Republicans to join Democrats in voting for congressional subpoenas to compel testimony.\nOn CBS, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, called the allegations \u201cserious\u201d but said only that she was backing aninvestigationinto the matter by the Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector general that was announced on Friday.\nKatie Benner,Adam GoldmanandLuke Broadwatercontributed reporting."

        "title": "Biden Names Lina Khan, a Big-Tech Critic, as F.T.C. Chair",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014President Bidennamed Lina Khan, a prominent critic of Big Tech, as the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, the White House said on Tuesday, a signal that the agency is likely to crack down further on the industry\u2019s giants.\nEarlier in the day, the Senate voted across party lines, 69 to 28, to confirm Ms. Khan as a commissioner. The president may name any commissioner to lead the agency, which investigates antitrust violations, deceptive trade practices and data privacy lapses in Silicon Valley and throughout corporate America.\nMs. Khan, 32, was sworn in on Tuesday, making her the youngest chair in the F.T.C.\u2019s history. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the public from corporate abuse,\u201d she said in a statement.\nIn her new role, Ms. Khan will lead efforts to regulate the kind of behavior highlighted for years by critics of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. Shetold a Senate committee in Aprilthat she was worried about the way tech companies could use their power to dominate new markets. The agency is investigating Amazon, which Ms. Khan has been highly critical of, andfiled an antitrust lawsuitagainst Facebook last year.\nHer appointment was a victory for progressive activists who want Mr. Biden to take a hard line against big companies. He alsogave a White House jobto Tim Wu, a law professor who has criticized the power of the tech giants. The president has yet to appoint someone to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, another top regulator of the industry.\nThe decision to make Ms. Khan the agency\u2019s chairwoman gives her control over its agenda, staff and proceedings. The four other commissioners \u2014 two Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 vote on major matters and produce statements, but the chairwoman is essentially the agency\u2019s chief executive. All five commission members are appointed by the president for seats with seven-year terms, although agency leaders often leave along with the president who appointed them. (The term for Ms. Khan\u2019s seat expires in September 2024.)\nMs. Khan signaled at her April confirmation hearing that she intends to carry her concerns about the tech giants into her role at the agency. She told lawmakers she saw a \u201cwhole range of potential risks\u201d around the tech companies.\n\u201cOne that comes up across the board is that the ability to dominate one market gives companies, in some instances, the ability to expand into adjacent markets,\u201d she said. She also said regulators should apply more scrutiny to mergers involving the companies.\nAmazon, Google and Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Biden\u2019s unexpected decision. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Biden\u2019s decision caps an unusually rapid ascent for Ms. Khan. She was born in London to Pakistani parents who emigrated to the United States when she was 11. She first rose to prominence while a law student at Yale, where she wrote a paper laying out how modern antitrust laws had failed to check the power of Amazon. The paper attracted notice from policymakers, other lawyers and the press.\nQuiet and generally averse to the spotlight, she has played a critical role behind the scenes in recent years as a senior aide to the House judiciary committee on its 16-month investigation of competition among digital platforms. She also served as a counselor to the F.T.C. commissioner Rohit Chopra. She joined the faculty at Columbia Law School last year.\nMs. Khan is replacing Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a former Democratic Senate staff member who was named the agency\u2019s acting chairwoman in January. Ms. Slaughter\u2019s office said she would remain at the agency as a commissioner.\n\u201cIf she chose to be a doctor, she would have been a star doctor. If she\u2019d chosen to go to Wall Street, she\u2019d be running a very powerful fund,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a think tank, and Ms. Khan\u2019s former boss. \u201cI am thrilled that she chose this path because she has the ability to transform America\u2019s political economy.\u201d\nHer appointment was also hailed by many Democratic lawmakers.\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of a Senate subcommittee overseeing antitrust and a regular critic of the tech industry, said Ms. Khan\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of competition policy will be vital as we strengthen antitrust enforcement.\u201d\nMs. Klobuchar noted Ms. Khan\u2019s new role in an afternoon hearing on competition, before any announcement from the White House.\n\u201cWe need all hands on deck as we take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world,\u201d she said.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, \u201cWith Chair Khan at the helm, we have a huge opportunity to make big, structural change by reviving antitrust enforcement and fighting monopolies that threaten our economy, our society and our democracy.\u201d\nRepublican lawmakers were largely silent about Ms. Khan\u2019s becoming chair. Several of them who work on antitrust, like Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, declined to comment.\nCarl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at NetChoice, a tech industry lobbying group, said after the Senate vote that Ms. Khan would make the independent agency more political.\n\u201cKhan has a strong career in persuading the American left of her proposed reforms to antitrust law,\u201d Mr. Szabo said in a statement, \u201cbut the job of an F.T.C. commissioner is to enforce antitrust laws as they are, not as the commissioner wishes they would be.\u201d\nAdam Kovacevich, chief executive of Chamber of Progress, another tech industry group, said: \u201cThe key question ahead is whether the F.T.C. focuses on helping consumers or on redesigning tech products and services that most people are pretty happy with.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nApple paid its chief executive,Tim Cook, $1.4 billion in total since 2007. Oracle\u2019s chairman, Larry Ellison, racked up stock and cash valued at nearly $1.9 billion over the same period. And Mark Zuckerberg has pulled in $5.7 billion from Facebook since the company went public in 2012.\nThese are among the billion-dollar men of the technology industry. The cumulative paychecks of a half dozen executives topped $13.2 billion, according to a new analysis of the past 15 years. Those are years in which tech companies became powerful forces in the economy, our lives and world affairs. The mood about technology has soured more recently, but the tech bosses\u2019 paychecks mostly remained unscathed.\nThe New York Times published on Fridayan analysis of the most highly paid chief executivesof America\u2019s publicly traded companies in 2020. During the pandemic, the executives received some of the richest pay packages ever, my colleague Peter Eavis reported.\nTo get a picture of what companies paid their bosses over a longer period of time, the executive compensation consulting firm Equilar ranked the 10 executives with the most cumulative total pay, going as far back as 2006 when there was a change in corporate compensation disclosures. Tech bosses took six of those 10 spots, largely because of the value of stock that their companies gave them.\nThe billion-dollar-plus paychecks of a handful of men \u2014 and yes, they\u2019re all men \u2014 bring up a big and unanswerable question: How do we know if they\u2019re worth the money?\nBaseball stat geeks know about a measure calledwins above replacement, which tries to quantify the value of a player by estimating how many more or fewer wins a team has with him compared with a replacement who might be cheaper. Even in the tech industry, which obsesses over data, there is little attempt to apply a wins above replacement stat for the corner office.\nMaybe a hypothetical replacement leader of Alphabet would do a better job thanSundar Pichai, and for less than the $1.1 billion in stock and other compensation that Google\u2019s parent company has paid him since 2015, according to the Equilar analysis. Boards of directors don\u2019t typically try to find out. Chief executives are paid what they\u2019re paid.\nLet me dig deeper into a couple of the C.E.O. pay figures. Calculating what corporate chiefs are \u201cpaid\u201d is a complicated and contentious exercise. In some cases, the tech bosses\u2019 compensation is even larger than the mind-boggling numbers initially suggested.\nWhen Cook took over for Steve Jobs in 2011 as Apple\u2019s chief executive, the company pledged to give him as many as 28 million shares, after adjusting for stock splits, over the next decade. Back then, Cook topped The Times\u2019s annual ranking of highest paid C.E.O.s, based largely on thepotential $376 million value of that stock.One expert called Cook\u2019s stock award \u201chistoric to such a degree that it skews the numbers.\u201d\nBut Cook would take home all the shares only if he stuck around for 10 years and if the company\u2019s stock price rose faster than that of most other large companies. So what will happen? Cook is likely to collect all or nearly all of the shares, with a final batch due in August. Those shares, by one calculation, are now worth $3.5 billion, or nearly 10 times that \u201chistoric\u201d number a decade ago.\nCompanies typically justify top-dollar executive paychecks by saying that the bosses are irreplaceable and that they only get rich when shareholders do, because they are paid largely in stock. Cook\u2019s wallet has gotten fatter since 2011 from Apple\u2019s climbing stock price, right alongside anyone who happened to buy Apple stock.\nBut again, it\u2019s hard to assess how much of Apple\u2019s financial or stock performance is Cook\u2019s doing. Maybe you would do 80 percent as well as Cook at a fraction of the cost.\nApple doesn\u2019t disclose the $3.5 billion figure directly. I tallied it from Apple\u2019s annual statements to shareholders. Equilar calculated that Cook\u2019s cumulative compensation since 2007, when he was Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, is $1.4 billion. Equilar\u2019s figure assessed the value of Cook\u2019s stock in each year that it was released to him, not the current value of those shares. Like I said, there are many ways to slice and dice C.E.O. pay.\nThe figures might seem light years (or a handful of zeros) away from most people\u2019s financial situations, but they also have a heartening message for anyone who feels clueless about money.\nZuckerberg topped the Equilar ranking of longer-term C.E.O. pay, almost entirely from stock options on 120 million shares that Facebook handed him shortly after the company was founded. Zuckerberg sold about one-third of those shares for $2.3 billion more than a year after Facebook went public. If he\u2019d held onto those shares instead, they\u2019d be worth nearly $14 billion now.\nBut don\u2019t lose sleep worrying about Zuckerberg\u2019s poorly timed stock sale. He\u2019s stillworth $124 billion.\nAbout that discounted internet service \u2026Emergency government funds are supposed to help lower-income Americans reduce their monthly internet bills by up to $50.

        "title": "Congress Faces Renewed Pressure to \u2018Modernize Our Antitrust Laws\u2019",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the nation\u2019s antitrust laws were created more than a century ago, they were aimed at taking on industries such as Big Oil.\nBut technology giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple, which dominate e-commerce, social networks, online advertising and search, have risen in ways unforeseen by the laws. In recent decades, the courts have also interpreted the rules more narrowly.\nOn Monday, a pair ofrulings dismissing federal and state antitrust lawsuits against Facebookrenewed questions about whether the laws were suited to taking on tech power. A federal judge threw out the federal suit because, he said, the Federal Trade Commission had not supported its claims that Facebook holds a dominant market share, and he said the states had waited too long to make their case.\nThe decisions underlined how cautious and conservative courts could slow an increasingly aggressive push by lawmakers, regulators and the White House to restrain the tech companies, fueling calls for Congress to revamp the rules and provide regulators with more legal tools to take on the tech firms.\nFor months, Congress has debated whether the monopoly laws need changes. At a hearing in March, RepresentativeDavid Cicilline, a Democrat of Rhode Island, said the country needed a \u201cmassive overhaul of our antitrust laws and significant updates to our competition system\u201d to police the biggest technology companies.\nMoments later, Representative Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican, agreed. He called for lawmakers to adapt antitrust laws to fit the business models of Silicon Valley companies.\nThis week\u2019s rulings have now put the pressure on lawmakers to push through a recently proposed package of legislation that would rewrite key aspects of monopoly laws to make some of the tech giants\u2019 business practices illegal.\n\u201cThis is going to strengthen the case for legislation,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \u201cIt seems to be proof that the antitrust laws are not up to the challenge.\u201d\nThe legislation, which is made up of six bills, wasintroduced this monthandpassed the House Judiciary Committee last week. The bills would make it harder for the major tech companies to buy nascent competitors and to give preference to their own services on their platforms, and ban them from using their dominance in one business to gain the upper hand in another.\nThe bills are far more expansive than traditional antitrust doctrine. Under current norms, which have been solidified by decades of business-friendly court rulings, companies tend to be judged to have violated competition laws if their behavior has hurt the welfare of consumers. The main measure of that harm has been whether companies have charged people higher prices.\nBut tech companies like Facebook and Google provide most of their services free. (They are instead paid by advertisers.) Many tech and legal experts \u2014including Lina Khan, a scholar whom President Biden named this month to run the F.T.C. \u2014 have argued that a broader definition of consumer welfare, beyond prices, should be applied. Consumer harm, they have said, can also be evident in reduced product quality, like Facebook users suffering a loss of privacy when their personal data is harvested and used for targeted ads.\nIn one of his rulings on Monday, Judge James E. Boasberg of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Facebook\u2019s business model had made it especially difficult for the government to meet the standard for going forward with the case.\nThe government, Judge Boasberg said, had not presented enough evidence that Facebook held monopoly power. Among the difficulties he highlighted was that Facebook did not charge its users for access to its site, meaning its market share could not be assessed through revenue. The government had not found a good alternative measure to make its case, he said.\nHe also ruled against another part of the F.T.C.\u2019s lawsuit, concerning how Facebook polices the use of data generated by its product, while citing the kind of conservative antitrust doctrine that critics say is out of step with the technology industry\u2019s business practices.\nThe F.T.C., which broughtthe federal antitrust suit against Facebookin December, can file a new complaint that addresses the judge\u2019s concerns within 30 days. State attorneys general can appeal Judge Boasberg\u2019s second ruling dismissing a similar case.\nThe F.T.C. is \u201cclosely reviewing the opinion and assessing the best option forward,\u201d said Lindsay Kryzak, a spokeswoman for the agency.\nThe rulings were another instance of Facebook\u2019s ability to evade the harshest consequences to its business. Though the F.T.C.fined Facebook $5 billionin 2019 for privacy violations, there were few significant changes to how the company\u2019s products operate. And Facebook continues to grow: More than 3.45 billion people use one or more of its apps \u2014 including WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger \u2014 every month.\nThe decisions were particularly deflating after actions to rein in tech power in Washington had gathered steam. Ms. Khan\u2019s appointment to the F.T.C. this month followed that of Tim Wu, another lawyer who has been critical of the industry, to the National Economic Council. Bruce Reed, the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff, has called for new privacy regulation.\nMr. Biden has yet to name anyone to permanently lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, which last year filed a lawsuit arguingGoogle had illegally protected its monopolyover online search.\nThe White House is also expected to issue an executive order targeting corporate consolidation in tech and other areas of the economy. The order is still being drafted, and officials said Mr. Biden had not yet reviewed it. White House officials have declined to discuss it in detail until he signs it, most likely next week.\nThe officials said that without action by Congress, a president\u2019s powers to deal with antitrust issues were limited. One official, who requested anonymity, said that after the court decisions to throw out the Facebook suits, Mr. Biden was \u201cconcerned about anticompetitive behavior in a number of industries, including the tech sector,\u201d and that he was encouraged by the bipartisan work in Congress to address the problems.\nActivists and lawmakers said this week that Congress should not wait to give regulators more tools, money and legal red lines to use against the tech giants. Mr. Cicilline, along with Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that the judge\u2019s decisions on Facebook show \u201cthe dire need to modernize our antitrust laws to address anticompetitive mergers and abusive conduct in the digital economy.\u201d\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of Minnesota who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust, echoed their call.\n\u201cAfter decades of binding Supreme Court decisions that have weakened our antitrust policies, we cannot rely on our courts to keep our markets competitive, open and fair,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe urgently need to rejuvenate our antitrust laws to meet the challenges of the modern digital economy.\u201d\nBut the six bills to update monopoly laws have a long way to go. They still need to pass the full House, where they will likely face criticism from moderate Democrats and libertarian Republicans. In the Senate, Republican support is necessary for them to overcome the legislative filibuster.\nThe bills may also not go as far in altering antitrust laws as some hope. The House Judiciary Committee amended one last week to reinforce the standard around consumer welfare.\nEven so, Monday\u2019s rulings have given the proposals a boost. Bill Baer, who led the Justice Department antitrust division during the Obama administration, said it \u201cgives tremendous impetus to those in Congress who believe that the courts are too conservative in addressing monopoly power.\u201d\nFacebook and the tech platforms might like the judge\u2019s decisions, he said, \u201cbut they might not like what happens in the Congress.\u201d\nMike IsaacandDavid E. Sangercontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "ByJack NicasJune 17, 2021\nApple has long centered its sales pitch on protecting its users\u2019 data. But I had a hunch that it couldn\u2019t be that simple in China, where the company is deeply entrenched. So I began investigating.\nWhat I found was striking \u2192\nTo understand Apple\u2019s relationship with China, you should first know thatApple now assembles nearly all of its products in the countryand sells $55 billion a year there.\nIts Chinese supply chain is so large and complex that Apple has concluded it cannot replicate it elsewhere, according to current and former employees.That has left Apple stuck in China.\nThe relationship got trickierin 2013, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s new leader. He began leaning on Western companies in China to strengthen the Communist Party\u2019s grip. Few were more vulnerable than Apple, and it was forced to make compromises.\nLast month in Guizhou province, a building opened with the flags of Apple and China flying out front. Inside,Apple stores the emails, photos, documentsand other dataof its Chinese customers. The facility is owned and run by a Chinese state-owned company.\nApple has said the data is safe. My colleagues and I found thatit had largely ceded control to the government.\nState employees physically manage the servers. Apple stores the encryption keys in the data center. And it ditched the encryption it uses elsewhere after China wouldn\u2019t allow it.\nFour security experts who reviewed internal documents for us said that Apple\u2019s compromises made it nearly impossible for the company to stop the government from accessing the data.\nI also found that Apple has built a system toproactively remove iPhone apps in Chinato avoid upsetting Chinese officials. Apple has created a list of banned topics there, including independence for Tibet and Taiwan, and the Dalai Lama.\nApple said thatit follows the laws of the countries in which it does business,even though it doesn\u2019t always agree with them.\nApple added that it does everything it can to keep its customers\u2019 data safe.\n\u201cWe have never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate,\u201d the company said.\nSee Apple\u2019s statement in response to our reporting.\nListen to my interview on The Daily.\nOr read more about Apple\u2019s compromises in China:"
