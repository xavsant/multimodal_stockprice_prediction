        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nIn the quest to clean up the web, the gray area between good and bad will be hard to handle.\nAs the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris burned last Monday, a YouTube effort to fight misinformation failed. The platform\u2019s automated fact-checking feature \u2014 a box that shows facts to help viewers contextualize footage \u2014 incorrectlydisplayed information about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacksalongside live streams of the fire.\n\u201cThese panels are triggered algorithmically, and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,\u201d YouTube said in a statement. The company said it had no further details about what went wrong.\nThe failure raises a question: If a platform can\u2019t provide facts reliably, how can we trust it to take down bad content correctly?\nFacebook, YouTube and other Big Tech companies say malign content will have to be policed automatically, because it\u2019s too big a job for humans. But algorithms will struggle against our subjectivity.\nThis is a hard problem. In a profile by my colleague Daisuke Wakabayashi, YouTube\u2019s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, said borderline content \u2014 material that is potentially harmful but does not break rules \u2014 wasparticularly hard to police.\nRasmus Nielsen, a professor of political communication at Oxford University who studies misinformation, said, \u201cThe problem will never be solved, if solving it means getting rid of all the bad stuff, because we can\u2019t agree on what the bad stuff is.\u201d\nAccept that, and a hard question follows. \u201cKnowing that things won\u2019t be perfect, what do we feel is most desirable?\u201d Mr. Nielsen asked. \u201cA system that errs on the side of caution, or one that errs on the side of being permissive?\u201d\nDecisions on that appear set to be shaped by regulation, such as draft legislation approved by the European Union on Wednesday that would require platforms totake down terrorist contentwithin one hour of notification from the authorities, or this month\u2019s proposals from Britain to fine tech companies if theydon\u2019t remove \u201charmful\u201d contentquickly.\nThis quickly descends into the thorny issue of potentially infringing rights of free speech to ensure that platforms remain clean. Lawmakers will have to wrestle with what kinds of algorithms they want deployed to enforce their regulation, and there is no easy solution.\nFor years, Apple and Qualcomm were locked in bitter patent battles across three continents. The iPhone maker sought $27 billion in damages; its former chip supplier wanted $15 billion.\nMy colleagues Don Clark and Daisuke Wakabayashireported on Wednesdaythat the companies had agreed to dismiss their litigation. The settlement includes a multiyear agreement for Qualcomm to supply chips to Apple, and an undisclosed one-time payment to Qualcomm from Apple.\nWhy the change? Playing a big role were two small characters: 5G.\nBoth companies care deeply about it. AsThe Wall Street Journal noted, Qualcomm \u201ctrained its focus on the future promises of 5G\u201d for more than two years, concentrating its efforts on developing standards and new chips that enable smartphones to access the networks. The new 5G technology will provide far faster data speeds, and is expected to be widely adopted in the coming years.\nApple has worried about its source for those chips. While it was locked in battle with Qualcomm, the chip maker\u2019s components \u2014 which are already fit for inclusion in phones \u2014 were not an option. That left some unpalatable options:\n\u25a0 Go with Intel, its 4G supplier. But rumors of delays at Intel suggested that could have pushed back the release of a 5G iPhone by a year.\n\u25a0 Team up with Huawei, which said Tuesday that it was \u201copen\u201d to selling 5G chips to Apple. But that could look bad for the iPhone maker, given Washington\u2019s concerns about national security risks posed by Huawei.\n\u25a0 Build its own. But Apple\u2019s chip design team is relatively new, so that could have taken a long time.\nAgainst that backdrop, the desire for $27 billion in damages faltered.\nApple will probably still want to work with another modem supplier, but for now the situation appears to be mutually beneficial for the two companies.\nLess so for Intel, perhaps: Just hours after the settlement was announced, the company said it would no longer work on 5G smartphone chips, citing \u201cno clear path to profitability.\u201d\nLast weekend, OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research organization, gave one of its algorithms a tough challenge: It had to play the strategy video game Dota 2 against a team of the world\u2019s most proficient human players.\nDota 2 is difficult. Two teams of five players battle each other, but have incomplete information (they can\u2019t see the whole game arena), lots of complexity (each player can make dozens of actions across a large playing area) and must think in advance (games last around 45 minutes).\nOpenAI\u2019s algorithm uses five so-called artificial neural networks, each controlling a player, that learn by playing games against themselves. The ones that played last weekend boasted the equivalent of 45,000 years of total game play experience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost an evolutionary scale,\u201d Greg Brockman, the chief technology officer of OpenAI, said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly honed for its environment.\u201d\nHow did the algorithms do? They won, taking the first two games in a best-of-three competition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant milestone,\u201d Shimon Whiteson, a professor of computer science at Oxford University, said. And it \u201cshows that we still haven\u2019t reached the limits of what we can achieve when using existing algorithms,\u201d he added.\nOpenAI faces another test this weekend, when it takes on teams worldwide over the internet. Mr. Brockman says there is a \u201c50-50 shot that we\u2019ll win every game.\u201d\nBut the news highlights a problem facing A.I.: its astonishing demand for computer power to master a single task. The 45,000 years of experience took 10 months to acquire on thousands of powerful computer processors, and the algorithms would need other training to master a new skill. Overcoming that is one of the biggest challenges in A.I.\n\u25a0 China is using A.I. to profile a minority group.Hundreds of thousands of face scans and new algorithms have enabled the government totrack members of a largely Muslim group.\n\u25a0 Google\u2019s huge data cache is being used as a dragnet.Its user tracking is being employed by investigators tofind suspects and witnesses near crimes, but it could snare the innocent.\n\u25a0 Insurance doesn\u2019t necessarily cover cyberattacks.Big companies thought they were covered for losses resulting from the 2017 NotPetya attack.They were wrong.\n\u25a0 Samsung\u2019s $2,000 foldable-screen smartphone is already breaking.Some gadget reviewers found that its screen failedafter several days of use.\n\u25a0 Silicon Valley is giving second chances to #MeToo culprits.Executives fired for misconduct are finding itrelatively easy to get new jobs, reports BuzzFeed News.\n\u25a0 Apple\u2019s gaming service has a big budget.The FT reports that it\u2019sspending $500 millionon titles for its launch.\n\u25a0 Want to relive Facebook\u2019s troubled 15 months?Wired\u2019s 12,000-word essaywill help.\n\u25a0 Google quietly disbanded another ethics board.A panel overseeing the ethics of its health care A.I.split up over tensionsabout information access and independence.\n\u25a0 Alibaba\u2019s co-founder celebrated a 72-hour workweek.Jack Ma said that working from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m., six days a week, was a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d"

Your Monday self will be better for it.\nAPRIL 7-13\nYour ride is (almost) here, but how much is it worth? Uber\u2019s widely anticipated initial public offering,on track for early May, is said toaim for a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion. That\u2019s significantly lower than the $120 billion that many investors had expected, although it would still be the largest I.P.O. since 2014. Why the falling numbers? For one thing, the ride-sharing company lost $1.8 billion last year, and its growth is slowing. Plus, everyone has been taking note of what happened after the recent I.P.O. of Uber\u2019s smaller rival Lyft. Its shares have already dropped roughly 20 percent below their offering price.\nThe National Enquirer, the checkout-line mainstay known forpeddlingheadlines aboutaliens on the moonand, more recently,aiding President Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy, is for sale. The tabloid is led by David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, andthere\u2019s word of a surprising potential buyer: the billionaire Ron Burkle, a Democratic donor with ties to former President Bill Clinton. The publication came under scrutiny for helping Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise by buying the rights to a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him and then never publishing it \u2014 a tabloid practice known as catch-and-kill. The Enquirer is now under federal investigation for claims that itthreatened Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, with \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d after exposing details about his extramarital affair.\nJust what no one wanted: Six more months of Brexit drama. European Union leadersagreed on Wednesdayto extend Britain\u2019s withdrawal deadline \u2014 again \u2014 this time to Oct. 31. Now, British lawmakers will have more time to argue over their long-overdue departure plan, which they\u2019ve already had three years to discuss. While they haggle, businesses will continue to plan for the worst until Brexit trade policies are settled,compromising the country\u2019s economic growth. On the upside, Britain did not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a deal, which could have wreaked economic havoc. But is the extension just prolonging the inevitable?\nAPRIL 14-20\nThursday is the deadline for Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out their differences on Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter practices. A federal judge in New Yorkhas asked both partiesto submit a joint letter with clear guidelines about Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets \u2014 namely, when Mr. Musk must get approval from a Tesla lawyer before posting. The S.E.C. sought more oversight of Mr. Musk\u2019s communications after he tweeted erroneous information about Tesla more than once, first about taking the company private and later about its production numbers. (Presumably, he will be allowed to keep tweeting aboutcheese-related flatulenceandmulticolored squirrelswhenever he pleases, as he recently did.)\nA jury will get to decide whether Apple owes money to the chip manufacturer Qualcomm, which might sound dull if not for the cast of tech stars involved. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Steve Mollenkopf, his counterpart at Qualcomm, are both expected totake the stand at the trial, which begins in San Diego this week. Top brass from other technology companies, like the manufacturing giant Foxconn, are also expected to testify. The showdown is a culmination of atwo-year global fightbetween tech giants, with Qualcomm seeking back payment for chips used in iPhones and Apple disputing Qualcomm\u2019s claims to certain technology.\nMore big banks will release their first-quarter earnings this coming week, and the results may be stronger than expected ifJPMorgan\u2019s reporton Friday was any indication. Analysts hadlowered their projections for bank profitsin recent months for a mix of reasons, including the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve\u2019s changing stance on interest rates. Banks\u2019 performances are often seen as a litmus test for overall economic health, and the latest numbers may offer clues to how much we should be worried about a recession \u2014 or whether we\u2019re overly paranoid.\nDisneyunveiled plansto take on Netflix with its own streaming service, which will cost $7 a month when it becomes available on Nov. 12.

        "title": "It\u2019s Your iPhone. Why Can\u2019t You Fix It Yourself?",
        "fulltext": "A giant John Deere tractor and a pocket-size Apple iPhone have something important in common: The cost of repairing either one is too high.\nThe two companies, and many of their peers, use a variety of aggressive tactics, including electronic locks and restrictive warranties, to push customers with broken equipment to seek help from their authorized repair facilities \u2014 or to give up and buy a replacement.\nThis is unfair to consumers who might be able to obtain, or perform,lower-priced repairs.It\u2019s unfair to independent businesses that might do the work. And it\u2019s bad for the environment, because the high cost of repairs leads people to toss devices that might have been fixed.\nLate last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposeda national right-to-repair law for farm equipment. The idea is based on a 2012 Massachusetts law that requires carmakers to provide the information necessary to perform repairs and to sell any special tools needed to do the work. The law also phased in a requirement that new cars be compatible with generic diagnostic tools.\nMs. Warren has the right idea, but she did not go far enough. The owners of consumer electronic products deserve the same protection as farmers.\nThe potential savings are considerable. A 2011 study found that customers who used independent auto repair shopsspent about 24 percent less on repairs each year. Similarly, Apple charges $279 to fix the screen of aniPhone X, while a repair store in downtown Washington, D.C., quoted a price of $219 \u2014 although the lack of Apple support makes such repairs riskier.\n\u201cRight-to-repair\u201d is a bit of a misnomer. The owner of a device generally has the legal right to repair it. The issue is whether the manufacturer allows people and independent businesses to obtain the necessary information, tools andpartsto do the repairs.\nUntil recently, cars, tractors and even most consumer electronic products were relatively easy to fix, without any help or permission from the manufacturer. Parents taught their children to make basic auto repairs; teenagers built their own computers.\nThe growing complexity of electronic devices, however, means that people need help from manufacturers. And companies have taken advantage of that shift in power.\nSome obstacles are passive. Companies can impede people from repairing modern electronic devices simply by declining to publish the necessary schematics.\nCompanies also take active measures to discourage tinkering. Like many modern machines, John Deere\u2019s tractors are a marriage of mechanical and electronic technology. And the company requires replacement parts to be verified electronically \u2014 a process akin to clearing passport control.\nIn addition to the high cost of repairs, farmers complain about having to wait for a certified technician during harvest season, when every minute of daylight is precious.\nApple and JohnDeereboth have made some concessions. Apple no longer threatens to void phone warranties if screens are repaired by other companies. Last year it paid to install screen-repair machinery at 30 stores owned by an independent retailer, Simply Mac, in parts of the country not previously served by authorized Apple technicians. Deere has agreed to offer its manuals and diagnostic software for sale by 2021.\nThere is still a clear need for a national and enforceable standard.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is showing interest in the issue, and plans to hold a hearing in July on \u201cNixing the Fix: A Workshop on Repair Restrictions.\u201d\nBut solving the issue may not require national legislation. After Massachusetts passed its auto repair law in 2012, major carmakersagreedto nationalizethose standards in asigned agreement with trade groupsrepresenting independent auto repair shops.\nA single state law could prove a dam buster for other kinds of products, too. Information and parts available in one state, after all, are effectively available in every state.\nLegislators in 20 states have introduced some version of right-to-repair legislation this year. The front-runner is a bill in Minnesota, where similar legislation has been proposed for several years. This bill is expected to reach the floor of the Minnesota Housethis month.\nApple and John Deere, among other companies, have lobbied vigorously, and so far with success, against proposals for state right-to-repair laws. Companies say that they are seeking to ensure the quality of repairs, protecting both their customers and their own reputations.\nThey also have raised more sensational concerns. Lydia Brasch, a Nebraska state senator who proposed such a law in 2017, said an Apple lobbyist warned her thatNebraska would become a hot spot for hackers, and that it was dangerous to play with lithiumbatteries.\nThe company is welcome to persuade people to patronize its own repair facilities, or to buy new iPhones. But there ought to be a law against forcing the issue.\nAn open marketplace for repairs benefits consumers, independent retailers and the environment. Modern devices are increasingly complicated; that concept is not.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple and Qualcomm Settle All Disputes Worldwide",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the past two years, Apple and Qualcomm have dueled on three continents over the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits and even how much consumers pay for their phones.\nOn Tuesday, just as atrial had begun in a federal courtroomin San Diego over a suit Apple had filed against Qualcomm, the two companies said they had essentially made up.\nThe companies, one the maker of iPhones and the other the largest provider of mobile chips, said they had agreed todismiss all litigationbetween them worldwide. They added that they had reached a six-year agreement for Apple to pay unspecified royalties on Qualcomm\u2019s patents.\nThat deal, which was effective as of April 1, included a two-year option for an extension, plus a multiyear agreement for Qualcomm to supply chips to Apple. In addition, Apple will make an undisclosed one-time payment to Qualcomm.\nAt the heart of the disputes was a disagreement over how Qualcomm charges royalties on patents that it holds on mobile chips. The company, based in San Diego, had pioneered a type of cellular communications in the 1990s that later became a mainstay of mobile devices. That allowed it to charge royalties on nearly every smartphone sold \u2014 even if the phone did not actually use Qualcomm chips. Apple eventually objected to that arrangement.\nThe provisions of the deal announced on Tuesday suggest at least a partial victory for Qualcomm and its patent-driven business model, which has also attracted harsh scrutiny from regulators like the Federal Trade Commission. Qualcomm\u2019s shares, which have been hurt by the two-year dispute with Apple, jumped 23 percent on word of the settlement.\nThe chip maker said it expected the settlement to yield incremental revenue of $2 a share as shipments of Apple handsets affected by the settlement grow. At roughly 1.2 billion Qualcomm shares outstanding, that would translate to around $2.5 billion in additional revenue from a combination of royalties and chips, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\nIn agreeing to settle the case, Apple tacitly acknowledged it was able to live with Qualcomm\u2019s business model \u2014 assuming the price of Qualcomm\u2019s royalties is more to Apple\u2019s liking. A slide the companies distributed on Tuesday said the deal \u201creflects value and strength of Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property.\u201d\nJust how much the deal might affect people\u2019s phone prices will not be clear until more financial details of the settlement are disclosed. But the effect on the price of individual handsets is not likely to be large.\nAn Apple spokesman and a Qualcomm spokeswoman said no further details of the settlement were immediately available. Qualcomm said more information might be disclosed when it releases financial results on May 1.\nApple may have been under pressure to strike a deal with Qualcomm because one of its current chip suppliers, Intel, said late Tuesday that itplanned to stop selling wireless modem chipsfor smartphones \u2014 including the chips withfaster 5G connectivitythat Apple had been expected to use next year. Qualcomm is already selling chips that can support 5G wireless technology to Apple\u2019s rivals, such as Samsung Electronics. Samsung is expected to have 5G handsets using Qualcomm chips this year.\nAn Intel spokesman declined to comment further.\nThe battle between the two companies began in January 2017 whenthe F.T.C. filed a case against Qualcommthat partly leaned on Apple\u2019s contentions. The F.T.C. alleged that Qualcomm was able to charge unfairly large royalties because handset makers had no leverage to negotiate, especially because Qualcomm supplied two key types of chips and could cut off shipments if the buyers balked at paying royalties.\nThree days after the F.T.C. filed its case,Apple separately sued Qualcomm. In its suit, Apple objected particularly to Qualcomm\u2019s basing its royalties on a phone\u2019s total price. That formula, Apple argued, meant that Qualcomm earned more money as handset makers added innovations like displays, touch sensors and data storage unrelated to wireless technology.\nThe case dragged on with four Asia-based contract manufacturers that assemble iPhones and iPads, whose suits against Qualcomm were eventually merged with Apple\u2019s. They argued that they had collectively overpaid Qualcomm roughly $9 billion in royalties over the years \u2014 a figure that could have been tripled under antitrust laws to $27 billion. Apple also had said Qualcomm should repay $3.1 billion associated with patents whose rights Apple said have been exhausted.\nQualcomm then sought to pressure Apple to settle by filing a series of patent suits, including cases in China and Germany and through the United States International Trade Commission. It also persuaded courts in some countries to ban sales of some iPhone models, though Apple was able to keep selling its handsets with tactics that included tweaking some of its software.\nMuch of the world-spanning fight appeared to be coming to a head this week in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, where a jury was selected on Monday for a trial on Apple\u2019s lawsuit and Qualcomm\u2019s counterclaims. Opening statements started Tuesday morning and were set to continue in the afternoon when the settlement was announced.\nAmong the top executives who had been expected to take the stand were Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive. Settling the litigation helped avoid those spectacles.\nThe deal between Qualcomm and Apple caught the technology industry by surprise. In the past, Apple had refused to settle an intellectual property fight with Samsung, pursuing the case for seven years all the way to the Supreme Court beforecalling a truce last year. The case with Qualcomm had become so ugly and so personal that observers thought Apple would be even less likely to settle quickly.\n\u201cI\u2019m floored,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analysis firm. \u201cQualcomm got the bigger win because it had the most to lose and the most to gain. And it ended today.\u201d\nMr. Moorhead said that both sides had incentive to wrap up the proceedings. For Apple, the deal opened the door for future iPhones to be able to use Qualcomm\u2019s 5G wireless chips. For Qualcomm, the industry\u2019s biggest brand is no longer threatening to upend how it makes money.\nYet the settlement with Apple does not end all of Qualcomm\u2019s legal troubles. The F.T.C. case went to trial in January and is awaiting the ruling of Judge Lucy Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, who could challenge key elements of Qualcomm\u2019s business model. She had issued a preliminary ruling before the trial indicating that Qualcomm should issue patent licenses to rival chip makers as well as phone makers, a position opposed by the company."

All the growth is coming from the retail banks,\u2019 said Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.\u201d\n\u2022 The big question, Mr. Armstrong writes, is how long this will last.

Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT looks athow its C.E.O., Susan Wojcicki, is coping.\n\u2022 \u201cIn an industry that celebrates eccentricity, Ms. Wojcicki presents as exceedingly normal, bordering on boring, even as elements of her digital realm burst into the real world in forms that are increasingly grotesque and sometimes dangerous.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cPolitical figures and tech luminaries alike are castigating YouTube for not doing enough to rein in the crooks, crackpots, racists, Russian agents and charlatans who call the platform home. New horrors are ceaseless.\u201d\n\u2022 Now, \u201cYouTube wants to remove the content that violates its policies more quickly and effectively; promote better, more authoritative material and limit the spread of videos that are potentially harmful but does not break the rules.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI know we can do better, but we\u2019re going to get there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI own this problem, and I\u2019m going to fix it.\u201d\n\u2022 Ms. Wojcicki is unlikely to be unseated anytime soon.

Other figures suggest shoppers are back at the tills, factory output is ticking up and the world, after several tough months, is buying more Chinese goods.\u201d\n\u201cBeijing needs such hopeful signsas it tries to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration while under pressure to lift conditions at home.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a caveat.The improvement probably has more to do with all that stimulus cash than with any sudden increase in business confidence. And it\u2019s unclear how long the cash can keep flowing.\nMore:As unlikely as it sounds, some business leaders and intellectuals in China see President Trump \u2014 one of Beijing\u2019s toughest critics \u2014 as akind of savior for the nation.\nAs a lawmaker, Mick Mulvaney tried to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And when the Trump administration made him its acting director, hesteadily undercut it from within, Nick Confessore reports in the NYT Magazine.\n\u2022 \u201cWhen Mulvaney took over, the fledgling C.F.P.B. was perhaps Washington\u2019s most feared financial regulator: It announced dozens of cases annually against abusive debt collectors, sloppy credit agencies and predatory lenders.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat he left behind is an agency whose very mission is now a matter of bitter dispute. \u2018The bureau was constructed really deliberately to protect ordinary people,\u2019 says Lisa Donner, the head of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cHe\u2019s taken it apart \u2014 dismantled it, piece by piece.\u2019 \u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSome career employees saw a kind of strategic ambiguity at work, designed to muddle decision-making and insulate Mulvaney as he neutered the agency\u2019s enforcement work.\u201d\n\u2022 The deconstruction \u201coffers a case study in the Trump administration\u2019s approach to transforming Washington, one in which strategic neglect and bureaucratic self-sabotage create versions of agencies that seem to run contrary to their basic premises.\u201d\n\u2022 This \u201cwasn\u2019t just one of the Trump era\u2019s most emblematic assaults on the so-called administrative state,\u201d Mr. Confessore writes.

Or just want a quick rundown of the top headlines in business and tech, plus the big stories to watch in the week ahead? Catch up here.\nAPRIL 14-20\nPinterest Inc., the digital pinboard where you can collect pictures of the life you wish you led, is now providing a new type of inspiration with itshighly successful initial public offering. It joined another tech company, Zoom Video Communications, in going public on Thursday, and both finished their first day of trading well above their initial valuations. This is heartening news in Silicon Valley, where a number of other corporations are poised for their own I.P.O.s this year. It also eased fears thatthe lackluster performanceof the ride-hailing company Lyft, the first of its cohort to go public, had scared off would-be tech investors. But Pinterest and Zoom may turn the tide.\nWhat forced Apple, one of the world\u2019s biggest companies,to throw in the towelon a multiyear legal battle on Tuesday? Perhaps it had no other choice. The back story: Qualcomm, which holds the patent on the tiny chips that make your iPhone work, was charging royalties on nearly every smartphone sold. Apple objected and refused to pay while continuing to use the chips, so Qualcomm sued. Then, a plot twist: Just as the case went to court this week, Qualcomm\u2019s rival Intelannounced its exit from the chip-making business\u2014 putting Apple in the awkward position of being totally dependent on Qualcomm for its 5G technology. It was a surprising turn of events (and a great one for Qualcomm), but more important: What\u2019s the future of smartphones if Qualcomm has no competitors?\nThe ubiquitous tabloid The National Enquirerwas sold this past weekto James Cohen, a son of the founder of Hudson News, the equally ubiquitous airport chain that hawks magazines and gum. The publication has struggled with a string of legal issues stemming from its connections to President Trump (namely that its former chief executive, a longtime ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s,used its resourcesto bury embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 campaign). More recently, it has been under federal investigation forclaims that it threatenedto publish lewd photographs of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Cohen, who has previously done business with The Enquirer\u2019s parent company, reportedly paid $100 million for it, a steep price for the deeply indebted enterprise. Hesayshe plans to use its archive in podcasts and documentaries.\nAPRIL 21-27\nTesla will show off its new self-driving cars to investors at its headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., on Monday andannounce a \u201croad map\u201dfor future developments. Although the technology is still in progress, autonomous vehicles will be available for attendees to \u201ctest drive\u201d (or test sit, assuming the cars do what they\u2019re supposed to). Is it a coincidence that this event, which will also be webcast for maximum coverage, is taking place two days before Tesla releases its first-quarter earnings, whichmay not be so great? Probably not.\nYes, the United States and China are still hashing out their overdue trade deal. But Washington didwin one victoryover Beijing on Thursday, when the World Trade Organization sided with the United States in a dispute over China\u2019s restrictions on American grain imports. (The case was filed by the Obama administration in 2016.) China wasn\u2019t happy with the ruling, but the trade talks drag on. Officials are planning two more rounds of face-to-face meetings at the end of April and beginning of May as they try to reach an agreement. Under the most optimistic circumstances, a presidential signing ceremony could happen as soon as next month. But the talks could also fall apart at any moment.\nThis coming Friday, the Commerce Department will release its first-quarter economic growth data. The Federal Reserverecently loweredits growth estimates for 2019 to 2.1 percent \u2014 a full percentage point below the Trump administration\u2019s forecast \u2014 and the new report may shed light on who\u2019s got the more accurate picture. Either way, both parties acknowledge that the United States economy is slowing down. And amid concerns of an impending recession, the numbers will either assuage or stoke fears.\nSoylent, the Silicon Valley-based company that makes drinkable \u201cmeals\u201d so that you never have to leave your desk, isexpanding into square-shaped chewable food. In other news, Samsung\u2019s cool new Galaxy Fold phones are turning into a P.R. disaster after early usersreportedthat the screen, which opens and closes like a book, also tends to stop working. And finally, France\u2019s billionaires have donated hundreds of millions of euros to rebuild Notre-Dame \u2014 nice, but yet another reason forcritics to point outthe severe economic inequality that\u2019splagued the countryin recent years."

        "title": "Gary Stewart, Master of the Reissue Compilation, Dies at 62",
        "fulltext": "Gary Stewart, a scholarly music fan whose enthusiasm and attention to detail helped make Rhino Records the much-emulated gold standard for reissue compilations of the great, the faded and the forgotten, died on April 11 in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 62.\nHis death was ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles County medical examiner\u2019s office. His younger brother, Mark, said their family had a history of depression.\nMr. Stewart, as senior vice president for artists and repertoire, wedded his deep knowledge of rock, pop, soul and other genres to the idiosyncratic Rhino label\u2019s mission of producing definitive boxed sets and anthologies, including lengthy liner notes and high-quality artwork. Unlike major labels, whose reissues contain mostly music from their own catalogs, Rhino licensed material from many labels, allowing it to produce more inclusive packages.\n\u201cHe loved deep cuts \u2014 little-known songs that were as good as the hits but were never pushed as singles,\u201dDavid Gorman, a colleague of Mr. Stewart\u2019s at Rhino, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf we did a boxed set or anthology, he\u2019d always sneak in little B-sides that he loved.\u201d\nMr. Stewart\u2019s best-known projects included \u201cHave a Nice Day,\u201d a series devoted to pop songs from the 1970s, mainly by one-hit wonders;\u201cHey! Ho Let\u2019s Go!,\u201d a Ramones anthology; and\u201cFarewells & Fantasies,\u201da collection of the work of the 1960s singer-songwriter Phil Ochs.\nHe also played a major role in Rhino\u2019s reissues of Elvis Costello\u2019s Columbia and Warner Bros. catalogs in 2001.\n\u201cWith his help, I was encouraged to tell a broader tale,\u201d Mr. Costello wrote on Facebook after Mr. Stewart\u2019s death, \u201caugmenting the original albums with every outtake, sketch and mistake that I could find, all annotated until I\u2019d run out of paper and ink. Our work together was clearly superior to both prior and subsequent editions.\u201d\nMr. Stewart recalled in aninterview in 2005 with Jewish Journal,a weekly newspaper in Los Angeles, that his colleagues had lobbied him to include songs by the Bangles and Squeeze on a collection of alternative rock from the 1980s, but he resisted, he said, because they weren\u2019t alternative enough.\n\u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no thank you\u2019 kind of bully,\u201d Stewart told the newspaper. \u201cIn the end, I\u2019ll say this is how it\u2019s going to be, which I think is a necessary ingredient for good art.\u201d\nGary Lee Stewart was born on Feb. 10, 1957, in Chicago and moved with his family to Los Angeles when he was about 5. His father, Ralph, was a mechanical engineer, and his mother, Charlyne (Jaffe) Stewart, was an artist and art teacher.\nHis brother said in an interview that Gary had been bullied in school, but that collecting records and displaying his knowledge of music had helped make him popular.\n\u201cMusic saved his life,\u201d Mark Stewart said.\nGary built his record collection during shopping sprees at Los Angeles shops, including Rhino Records, which opened in 1973 and began its own label in 1978.\n\u201cWhat drew him to the store is, we were turning him on to music and he wanted to soak it all up,\u201dHarold Bronson, who managed the store and founded the label with Richard Foos, said in an interview. \u201cWe were all so knowledgeable.\u201d\nMr. Stewart began working at the store in 1977 as a salesman. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing, he replaced Mr. Bronson as store manager. He shifted to the Rhino label in 1981 and worked his way up to senior vice president for artists and repertoire.\nMark Pinkus, the president of Rhino, described Mr. Stewart in a statement as \u201cthe architect and guiding spirit of Rhino\u201d and said that he \u201cdefined what it meant to be a catalog label.\u201d\nIn addition to his work on reissues, Mr. Stewart signed some new acts to Rhino, includingthe singer-songwriter Cindy Lee Berryhill, a key figure in the so-called anti-folk movement, in 1987.\n\u201cHe was a \u2018convincer,\u2019\u201d Ms. Berryhill said in an email. \u201cIf Gary liked your music, he could probably talk others into it, including the guys that signed the checks.\u201d\nA memorial to those who lost their lives in 2019\nMr. Stewart remained at Rhino until 2003, several years after its full acquisition by the Warner Music Group, and the next year began a seven-year stint at Apple, where he curated music for the expanding digital market. He was hired by the company\u2019s chairman, Steve Jobs, as the chief music officer, with a mandate to organize the vast iTunes catalog into playlists for a download market. He left in 2011 and returned in 2016, to help organize the catalog for streaming.\nIn an interview in 2015on the podcast \u201cThe Music Biz Weekly,\u201d Mr. Stewart said he did not believe in relying on an algorithm or on personal preferences to produce a strong playlist. Asked how he created a playlist, he said he was guided by many factors, including airplay, concert set lists, greatest hits and how they charted, and what hard-core fans and music bloggers say about the artist.\n\u201cCuration, at its best,\u201d he said, \u201cis not just how you like something, which is the most dangerous place to go, but what the music means to the band, what it means to the fans and whether it should be part of how someone first connects\u201d with the artist.\nAfter leaving Apple last year, Mr. Gorman said, Mr. Stewart was \u201cfeeling lost career-wise and wondering what his place in the music economy was.\u201d\nMr. Stewart\u2019s brother is his only immediate survivor.\nOn Mr. Stewart\u2019s final afternoon, he spent four hours at his home with Leo Diamond, the 18-year-old son of a friend, Sandra Itkoff, a documentary producer.\n\u201cThey talked about \u2018Born to Run\u2019 and how Gary\u2019s discovery of music was propelled by his love of \u201950s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d Ms. Itkoff said in an interview, referring to the Bruce Springsteen song. \u201cAnd he gave him a boxed set of \u201950s music,\u2018Loud, Fast & Out of Control\u2019\u201d \u2014 which Mr. Stewart had produced.\nLess than 12 hours later, Mr. Stewart took his life."

        "title": "These Funds Rode Small Companies to Big Returns",
        "fulltext": "Three of the first quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds won big by favoring small- and midcap growth stocks, toting up quarterly returns of 25 percent or more.\nTheVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative Growth Stock Fundbuys shares of companies of all sizes \u2014 its largest holding lately has been Amazon \u2014 but its big winners, so far this year, have been smaller fare such as WayFair, an online seller of home furnishings, and the Trade Desk, an online advertising marketplace.\nNancy A. Zevenbergen, the fund\u2019s lead manager, said her interest in growth stocks dates to the \u201980s. She worked then in the trust department of a Seattle bank and followed \u2014 and was fascinated by \u2014 the 1986 initial public stock sale of a homegrown outfit named Microsoft. (Microsoft is based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Wash.) A year later, she started Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle. Her mutual fund began in 2004.\nBeing on the West Coast has proved an advantage, she said. Not only has Seattle birthed tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, but \u201cSilicon Valley is a day trip for us,\u201d she said.\nThroughout her career, she has sought stocks she thinks can keep increasing revenue by at least 15 percent a year. Her mantra is: \u201cRevenue growth, revenue growth, revenue growth,\u201d she said.\nFavorite holdings can stay in the fund for years: Mercadolibre, an Argentine e-commerce outfit, has been there for a decade. That stock was lately one of only 31 in the fund, compared with 157 for the average actively managed United States stock fund tracked by Morningstar.\nMs. Zevenbergen says she prefers companies that are run by their founders. As an example, she pointed to Microsoft. The stock soared while one of the founders, Bill Gates, steered the company but languished under his successor, Steven A. Ballmer. What\u2019s more, boards of directors are typically not as patient with outsider C.E.O.s, and long-term investments require patience, she said.\nHer liking for founder-led outfits is part of the reason her fund has owned Tesla, the electric-car maker led by Elon Musk, since its 2010 initial public stock offering. Despite Tesla\u2019s recent operational problems, she said: \u201cElon Musk is doing things people said couldn\u2019t be done \u2014 and he\u2019s up against an old, established industry and organized labor.\u201d\nMs. Zevenbergen added: \u201cYou can often get a C.E.O. with an M.B.A. from Harvard, but do they have the passion to run the business that the founder had?\u201d\nThe Virtus Zevenbergen fund, whose A shares have a net expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 25.24 percent in the first quarter, compared with a total return of 13.65 percent for the S&P 500 stock index.\nMatthew A. Weatherbie, one of the managers of theAlger SMid Cap Focus Fund, has been chasing growth stocks even longer than Ms. Zevenbergen. His investment career began in the \u201970s, andhe ran Putnam Voyager, then a well-known fund, starting in 1983. He left Putnam to start his own investment company in 1995, and he has managed the Alger fund since 2017. (Alger Associates acquired Mr. Weatherbie\u2019s company in 2017.)\nLike Ms. Zevenbergen, he said his investment philosophy has remained consistent. \u201cThere have been some tweaks over time, but the basic process is the same,\u201d he said. He and his co-managers seek companies in a growth sweet spot, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in business long enough to survive the perils of infancy, but they\u2019ve got a long runway of growth ahead of them.\u201d\nHow three of the better performers of the first quarter of 2019 fared against the market \u2014 and against their peer groups of funds.\nVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative\n+\n30\n%\n+\n20\n+\n10\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\n0\nJ\nF\nM\nFIRST-QUARTER RETURNS\nVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative\n+25.2%\nLarge-cap growth\n+16.0%\nAlger SMid Cap Focus\n+\n30\n%\n+\n20\n+\n10\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\n0\nJ\nF\nM\nFIRST-QUARTER RETURNS\nAlger SMid Cap Focus\n+30.6%\nMid-cap growth\n+19.1%\nLord Abbett Developing Growth\n+\n30\n%\n+\n20\n+\n10\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\n0\nJ\nF\nM\nFIRST-QUARTER RETURNS\nLord Abbett Developing Growth\n+27.1%\nSmall-cap growth\n+18.1%\nVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative\nAlger SMid Cap Focus\nLord Abbett Developing Growth\n+\n30\n%\n+\n30\n%\n+\n30\n%\n+\n20\n+\n20\n+\n20\n+\n10\n+\n10\n+\n10\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\nS. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.\n0\n0\n0\nJ\nF\nM\nJ\nF\nM\nJ\nF\nM\nFIRST-QUARTER RETURNS\nVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative\nAlger SMid Cap Focus\nLord Abbett Developing Growth\n+25.2%\n+30.6%\n+27.1%\nLarge-cap growth\nMid-cap growth\nSmall-cap growth\n+16.0%\n+19.1%\n+18.1%\nBy The New York Times | Source: Morningstar Direct\nHoldings also must have \u201ca competitive moat around the business, a strong balance sheet, high inherent profitability and a high-quality management team,\u201d he said.\nTo assemble the portfolio, the fund\u2019s managers and analysts collaborate to identify 50 holdings that meet these criteria. Mr. Weatherbie and his co-portfolio managers \u2014 H. George Dai and Joshua D. Bennett \u2014 next take an unusual step.\nThey divide the portfolio into three baskets. The managers then independently evaluate the 50 stocks, each determining the portion of the fund\u2019s assets dedicated to each stock in his basket. As a result, the fund\u2019s largest stakes are the stocks most favored by all three.\n\u201cWhy is Chegg or FirstService a top five holding?\u201d Mr. Weatherbie asked. \u201cBecause each of us has determined that those are high-conviction names.\u201d\nChegg is an education-services company, while FirstService is a property manager and service provider for condos and cooperatives.\nMr. Bennett said both companies exemplify something the managers hunt for: They\u2019re fast growers in \u201cmundane markets\u201d not associated with zippy stocks in the way, say, consumer electronics and online entertainment are. Mr. Weatherbie added: \u201cOur process enables us to identify hidden gems in mundane industries.\u201d\nThe Alger fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.33 percent, returned 30.58 percent in the first quarter.\nF. Thomas O\u2019Halloran, the lead manager of theLord Abbett Developing Growth Fund, seeks companies that show bothdisruption and momentum. For example, he has won lately with such well-known names as Yeti Holdings, the maker of insulated cups and coolers, and Roku, the video streaming outfit.\nThese companies are disrupting their industries, he says, and their shares have lately trended upward.\nTake Roku and its streaming devices, which compete with ones sold by such tech behemoths as Apple and Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that one form of streaming is better than another,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Halloran said. \u201cIt\u2019s that streaming is better than cable and regular TV, and Roku is the only Swiss-neutral platform.\u201d Other devices are interwoven with technologies or business models peddled by their sellers.\nMr. O\u2019Halloran said he often finds promising picks among consumer stocks for the simple reason that consumer purchases drive growth in the United States. \u201cThat\u2019s where 70 percent of spending in U.S. economy is,\u201d he said.\nWhen considering what to wager on, Mr. O\u2019Halloran said, he prefers companies with hefty potential markets \u2014 like Yeti. \u201cThe whole planet likes its food and beverages at the right temperature,\u201d he said.\nHe differs from some portfolio managers in that he bars members of his analyst team from writing reports on the companies they follow, relying instead on quick emails and frequent meetings. Churning out reports can lead to delays and self-defeating behavior, he said. \u201cBy the time you get a report done, a quarter to half of the stock move may be over. And when the stock peaks, you don\u2019t want to let it go, because you wrote the big report on it.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Halloran\u2019s fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 0.93 percent, returned 27.13 percent in the first quarter."

        "fulltext": "Do you ever find yourself scrolling madly through your phone\u2019s camera roll, looking for that one fabulous vacation shot you\u2019re describing to a friend \u2014 and you can\u2019t find it in the river of 4,000 photos? Or do you want to collect all the pictures of a child, scattered through the years, for a slide show but don\u2019t have time to find them?\nHerding pictures into sensible albums on the phone can be tedious if you bother at all, but here\u2019s the good news: If you\u2019ve been using the current versions ofGoogle Photoson your Android or Apple device orApple\u2019s Photos for iOS, there\u2019s a good chance thatthe apps havebeen organizing your images for you.\nIt can be a little unnerving to see how these apps have analyzed your pictures. But the software can save you hours and is simple to use. Here are ways to use the programs \u2014 and how to tweak them to adjust to your needs.\nIf your phone\u2019s location services setting was enabled when you took the pictures, the geographical coordinates were likely embedded into the image file; this is also called \u201cgeotagging.\u201d Tap the Albums tab in Google Photos or Apple\u2019s Photo app to see the Places album, with pictures labeled and grouped by location. Tap a thumbnail to see all the photos taken in that spot, regardless of the date.\nNo GPS information in the photo file? You can add locations manually in the desktop editions ofGoogle Photosand Apple\u2019sPhotos. Open the photo you want to tag, click the Info icon \u2014 which looks like an encircled \u201ci\u201d \u2014 and choose the option in the information box to edit or assign a location.\nIf you\u2019re not set to sync photos with the desktop viaGoogle\u2019s backup and sync optionor Apple\u2019siCloud, you can import them from the phone. Third-party apps can also edit photo location data.\nUnless you\u2019ve disabled the feature, Google Photos automaticallygroups similar facesin your photo library together with its facial recognition software. To see the groupings andlabel them, tap the Albums tab and go to People & Pets. Select a thumbnail to open the group and add a name. The pictures then show up when yousearch for that person by namein Google Photos.\nPhotos for iOS also collects faces found in the picture library and displays them in the \u201cPeople\u201d area on the Albums screen. You can label each group with a name by tapping a photo and using the Add Name option. Toadd new people in Photos for iOS, open a photo of someone, swipe up to see a thumbnail of the person in the People area and tap to enter a name.\nBoth apps include settings to remove someone from the People album. Tap the three-dot Options menu in the top-right corner of a person\u2019s album to get to the controls.\nGoogle\u2019s and Apple\u2019s picture programs both include a search box where you cantype in keywordsfor people, places and things \u2014 or a year, month or date. If you have names in your People album and geotagged photos, use the app\u2019s search box to round up results, like \u201cMary in Louisville in 2019.\u201d\nEven without having to add or confirm photo tags yourself, you can also search for items within images, like \u201cwedding dress\u201d or \u201cconcerts,\u201d thanks to basic object and scene recognition in both apps. Keywords like \u201cmountains\u201d and \u201cocean\u201d also bring up corresponding outdoor shots.\nTired of typing? Tell theGoogle AssistantorApple\u2019s Sirito find your tagged photos.\nThe object-recognition function sorts your pictures into numerous general categories, even without your having to use the search function. On the Albums tab in Google Photos, tap the \u201cThings\u201d thumbnails at the top of the screen to see photos grouped under general headings like \u201cFireworks\u201d and \u201cMonuments.\u201d\nNeed to quickly find other types of content in your library, like videos, animated GIFs or panoramic photos? Select the Albums tab in either app and scroll to see those file types already sorted.\nWhen you tap the Search tab, Apple\u2019s Photos app reveals a \u201cCategories\u201d area. To findother groupings, tap the For You tab. Here, you can see collections including\u201cMemories\u201dof multiple-photo events like museum visits."

        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nApple got there first, then Amazon, and on Thursday, Microsoft became the third American company to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion.\nIt was a brief achievement (Microsoft was valued at about $990 billion by the end of the day), but it underscores the remarkable recovery in technology stocks since their precipitous decline late last year.\nIt isn\u2019t just Microsoft.Appleand Amazon are both close to the $1 trillion mark again (they were last there in August) after rising 30 percent and 27 percent this year. Among the other tech giants, Netflix\u2019s shares have gained more than 35 percent, and Facebook\u2019s stock, the most battered among the big tech companies last year, has surged nearly 50 percent in 2019. Shares of Alphabet have been the laggard of the group, up just 21 percent this year. The six companies have now recovered all of the nearly $940 billion in value they lost over the final three months of 2018, and then some.\nUnderpinning the rally has been a shifting view of the investing landscape.\nFor years, investors, starved for returns, had piled into shares of big tech companies, pushing their value and the broader stock market up. That reversed sharply at the end of last year. As fears of a recession rose, investors in big tech faced a fundamental question: Could those companies keep adding users and generating more sales in a slowing global economy?\nBut since the start of the year, concerns have faded, and tech shares beckoned again.\nThe Federal Reserve has put a pause on interest rate increases, and China and the United States have moved slowly toward a trade agreement. That has tamped down recession fears and left investors believing that the American economy will continue to grow slowly and that interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future.\nThough earnings expectations have fallen, Wall Street still expects the tech giants\u2019 profits to grow faster than the broader markets.\nFirst-quarter results have so far supported that faith.\nMicrosoft reached its trillion-dollar mark a day after it reported a 19 percent jump in earnings from a year earlier, confirming that itstransformation into a cloud computing leadercontinues unabated. The company beat almost every one of Wall Street\u2019s performance expectations.\nAfter trading ended on Thursday, Amazon reported results that easily exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations as well. The e-commerce giant\u2019s earnings doubled from a year earlier.\nNetflixadded 7.8 million customersthrough the end of March, and its earnings rose 19 percent, with revenue up 22 percent. And new users continued to flock toFacebook, and its revenue jumped 26 percent during the first quarter compared with a year earlier."
