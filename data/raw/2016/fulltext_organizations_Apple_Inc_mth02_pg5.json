        "fulltext": "PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. \u2014 The political backlash against Apple forrefusing to helpthe F.B.I. hack an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers escalated on Friday with Donald J. Trump calling for a boycott of the company.\n\u201cWhat I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said, admitting it was a spur-of-the-moment thought. \u201cHow do you like\n                                                that? I just thought of it: Boycott Apple.\u2019\u2019\nHe accused the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, of grandstanding by resisting a court order to provide access to the phone, which has built-in encryption the company says was designed not to\n                                                be cracked in order to protect users\u2019 private information.\n\u201cTim Cook\u2019s looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said.\nOther Republican presidential candidates this week sided with the F.B.I., but did not go as far as Mr. Trump. Senator Ted Cruz said law enforcement was right in this case, but he agreed that Apple should not\n                                                be forced to put a \u201cbackdoor on every cellphone everyone has.\u2019\u2019\nSenator Marco Rubio said it was \u201ca very complicated issue,\u2019\u2019 calling for a solution that would give law enforcement access in some cases but protect the privacy of everyday Americans.\nMr. Cook, on the Apple website, said: \u201cWhile we believe the FBI\u2019s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we\n                                                fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201d\nMr. Trump has previously offered tough talk on Apple, promising that if elected he will force the company to make its phones in the United States rather than China. (One estimate of the retail price of an entirely-made-in-America\n                                                iPhone:$2,000.)\nMr. Trump called for a boycott in response to a question from an audience member about how to create jobs for young people. He promised to bring back jobs from China, then said it was important for law enforcement\n                                                officials investigating the mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif., in December to be able to trace the contacts of one of the shooters.\n\u201cI like the idea of boycotting Apple until such time as they get that information,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said.\nAfter the rally, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post that his own personal boycott was underway.\n\u201cI use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn\u2019t give info to authorities on the terrorists I\u2019ll only be using Samsung until they give info,\u201d he wrote.\nFind out what you need to know about the2016 presidential racetoday, and get politics news updates viaFacebook,Twitterandthe First Draft newsletter."

        "fulltext": "LEGAL COSTS CREATE A LOSS FOR R.B.S.|The Royal Bank of Scotland reportedanother multibillion-dollar lossin the fourth\n                                                    quarter of 2015, largely the result of having to put aside 2.21 billion pounds, or about $3 billion, for legal and regulatory matters,Chad Bray reports in DealBook.\nThe bank posted a loss of \u00a32.74 billion, compared with a loss of \u00a35.79 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nIt had to make a provision of\u00a31.5 billion for mortgage-backed securities litigation in the United Statesand \u00a3500 million related to payment protection insurance, an insurance product that\n                                                    was sold to customers when taking out mortgages, applying for credit cards or seeking other loans. British banks have had to pay billions to compensate customers over improper sales of the product. Including\n                                                    the latest charge, the bank has set aside about \u00a34.3 billion to cover customer redress related to payment-protection insurance.\nThe bank is also in the process of restructuring \u2014 dismantling its global investment bank and focusing on retail and corporate banking in Britain.\nEwan Stevenson, the chief financial officer of R.B.S., warned that the bank expected\u201cfurther substantial conduct costs to come.\u201d\nFor the full year,the bank reported an annual loss of \u00a31.98 billion, from a loss of \u00a33.47 billion in 2014. The full-year results included restructuring costs of \u00a32.93 billion.\nR.B.S has not posted a full-year profit since 2007.\n\nNIGHTMARE IN THE PIPELINE|Shares in Williams Companies plunged on Thursday after The New York Times reported that Energy Transfer\n                                                    had consideredoffering a payment of more than $2 billion for it to walk away from a deal,Reuters reports.\nThe plunge in oil prices created plenty of problems for energy companies, but Energy Transfer has also had to struggle withbuyer\u2019s remorse after striking a $38 billion deal to buy Williams Companies,Leslie Picker and Julie Creswell report in DealBook.\nKelcy Warren, Energy Transfer\u2019s chief executive, pursued Williams Companies doggedly for months, but the deal seems to have soured just five months after signing.\nShares of both companies had plummeted more than 60 percent even before the Times report, shedding a combined $37 billion in market value. This was partly because of the decline in energy prices, butinvestors are also quavering about the complicated merger.\nThe value of the deal took another hit on Thursday after Energy Transfer published disappointing earnings.\nNowEnergy Transfer is frantically searching for a way out, although it never presented the offer of a $2 billion payment for walking away.\nIt also has another looming problem.Under the terms of the deal, Energy Transfer has to pay $6 billion in cash to Williams as part of the cash-and-stock acquisition. It will have to either raise\n                                                    additional debt or sell assets, but cascading energy prices have made both options unattractive. One of Williams\u2019s biggest customers is also facing bankruptcy.\nShort of filing for bankruptcy itself,Energy Transfer is stuck buying Williams, people involved in the transaction say. Williams shareholders, however, could still vote down the merger.\n\nCOMPANIES REQUIRED TO REPORT LEASES|The Enron accounting scandal happened nearly 15 years ago, but a new accounting rule announced\n                                                    on Thursday shows that its effect is still being felt in corporate America.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issueda rule that changes how companies account for most of their leases,\nPeter Eavis reports in DealBook.\nLeases are similar to loans, but companies have been allowed to exclude leases, and thus their true financial obligations, from their financial statements.\nThe new rules requires that the most common type of lease be included on a company\u2019s balance sheets.\nRegulators started considering this change after Enron collapsed in 2001. Its executives made the company look stronger by keeping some of its financial obligations \u201coff-balance sheet.\u201d\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board estimates that the rulecould add more than $1 trillion of obligations to liabilities on the balance sheets of public companiestraded in the United States.\n                                                    This compares with $26 trillion of total liabilities.\nCompanies had criticized the rule because of the possibility that it might make them look more indebted, but the lease obligations would be offset by corresponding assets and would not erode a company\u2019s\n                                                    net worth.It would also make it easier for investors to compare the strength of several companies in one sector.\n\nON THE AGENDA|A revised estimate ofeconomic growthin the fourth quarter of 2015 will be released at 8:30 a.m. Data onconsumer spendingduring January will be released at 10 a.m.\n\nSHARP SAYS FOXCONN TALKS ARE CONTINUING|After confusion on Thursday over whether the deal for Foxconn to buy Sharp was going ahead,\n                                                    Sharp said on Friday that talks were continuing,The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\u201cSharp is in talks with Foxconn to seal a deal, including cross-checking various of our business conditions, including potential risks including contingent liabilities,\u201d Sharp said in a statement\n                                                    to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been appropriately disclosing contingent liabilities through financial reports, based on accounting rules.We recognize no more such risks that need to be disclosed.\u201d\nSharp announced on Thursday that it had agreed to a takeover by Foxconn, butFoxconn unexpectedly balked just before the deal was to be completed, asJonathan Soble and David Barboza report in DealBook.\nFoxconn had delayed because Sharp had said the day before that it could be liable forclose to $3 billion in potential liabilities, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Foxconn said\n                                                    it needed to review \u201cnew material information\u201d from Sharp before committing.\nThe decision raises questions about what might be lurking in Sharp\u2019s books.\nIt was not meant to be like this,Quentin Webb writes in Breakingviews.\nWhen Foxconn became the leading bidder,it seemed like a promising sign of change in corporate Japan. A victory would mean the board picked the most compelling pitch, not the establishment favorite.\nIn truth,Foxconn\u2019s bid is far more respectful of the status quothan Innovation Network\u2019s breakup proposal, and softer on creditors, too.\nFailure at this stage would embarrass all concernedand the communications breakdown does not bode well for any deal in the future.\nSharp now looks either desperate in leaving it so late to share important data points, or confused in failing to understand Foxconn.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nCanadian-Led Consortium to Buy London City Airport|The group was said to have agreed to pay $2.8 billion for the company that\n                                                    operates the airport, which is close to the center of London.NYT \u00bb\n\nMerger Plans Fall Apart for Oi, Troubled Brazilian Telecom|Telecom Italia\u2019s Brazilian operator said it was ending talks\n                                                    with Oi on a merger proposed by a Russian oligarch.NYT \u00bb\n\nChinese Suitors Said to Plan Offers for Ausgrid|State Grid Corporation of China, the nation\u2019s biggest electricity distributor,\n                                                    and the billionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings are among the suitors planning to submit bids for the Australian power network Ausgrid, Bloomberg News reports, citing people\n                                                    with knowledge of the matter.bloomberg news\n\nSamsung Said to Be Restarting Talks to Buy Tidal|According to The New York Post, a source close to the talks said, \u201cSamsung\n                                                    is re-engaging; they are working on something really big, and they\u2019re keeping it very quiet in case it leaks.\u201dnew york post\n\nWanda Group Sets Its Sights on France\u2019s Europa City|The Chinese real-estate and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda\n                                                    Group is in advanced talks to invest in a retail and cultural development known as Europa City near Paris, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the situation.the wall street journal\n\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Timed London Stock Exchange Bid to Exploit E.U.

        "fulltext": "THE BACKLASH OVER CHINESE TAKEOVERS|Wariness over Chinese acquisitions of American tech companies has grown enough to thwart an\n                                                    attempted takeover of Fairchild Semiconductor International,Keith Bradsher and Paul Mozur report in DealBook.\nFairchild decided to remain in the hands of a United States companyby favoring a smaller bid from ON Semiconductor over a $2.5 billion deal led by Chinese state-backed buyers.\nAnd it is not just tech purchases\u2014 moves into areas like heavy equipment, aerospace and financial services are drawing attention from both ends of the American political spectrum.\nMembers of Congress wrote to the Treasury Department, demanding an investigation of abid by a Chongqing-based company to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius,has also attracted attention \u2014 it can recommend against foreign deals made for American companies or companies connected\n                                                    to the United States for security reasons.\nMany in the semiconductor industry are watching to see whether Cfius will investigate a bid by the Chinese chip maker Tsinghua Holdings for a stake in Western Digital. Chinese interest in the semiconductor\n                                                    industry has attracted the most attention in Washington because chips are the cores of a number of military systems.\nChinese bids seem likely to increaseas the economy in China slows and companies based there move money out of the country before the renminbi can weaken any further.\nIngram Micro, a company based in California that distributes technology, agreed to be bought by Tianjin Tianhai, a Chinese shipping company, and merged into HNA, the shipping and logistics conglomerate,Amie Tsang reports in DealBook.The $6 billion deal was agreed upon even in the face of increasing concern from Washington.\nEven if these deals are completed, the companies will still be haunted by past failures,Quentin Webb writes in Breakingviews.\nMost of China\u2019s big overseas takeovers to date have fared poorly\u2014 large oil, mining and finance deals have been the victims of terrible timing.\nOil prices have more than halved since those deals were struck and this was compounded by operational headaches such as a civil war in Yemen and a struggle to extract in crude oil from Canada\u2019s oil\n                                                    sands.\nThe record is not much better in commodities.\nThe list of value-destroying deals being racked up is worryinggiven the rush for outbound deals. Chinese buyers may have learned some lessons, but they can struggle to run new overseas outposts effectively\n                                                    and piles of debt raise the stakes even further.\n\nEX-DEUTSCHE BANK ANALYST TO PAY $100,000 OVER RATINGS|The Securities and Exchange Commission settled with a former stock analyst\n                                                    over accusations that he hadfailed to tell investors what he really believed about the company whose shares he was promoting,\nLiz Moyer reports in DealBook.\nThe former analyst, Charles P. Grom, who worked for Deutsche Bank, will pay $100,000 to settle charges that his recommendation to buy shares in the retailer Big Lots was inconsistent with his own negative\n                                                    view of the stock, which he privately expressed to a few colleagues and hedge fund clients.\nThe S.E.C. said Mr. Grom did not downgrade his buy recommendation on Big Lots shares in March 2012 because hewanted to maintain rapport with the retailer\u2019s management.\nMr. Grom, who neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, will be suspended from the securities industry for one year.\nRegulators have been looking at theissue of analyst conflictsfor a number of years. Ten big banks paid $1.4 billion more than a decade ago after prosecutors said they had lured investors into buying\n                                                    billions of dollars\u2019 worth of stocks in companies they knew had issues.\nThis was supposed to radically change the way banks handle stock research, but the changes did not erase the need for Wall Street executives to cultivate client relationships.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Walmartwill hold a conference call on its latest quarterly earnings at 7 a.m.John C.

Snowden in 2013 started a shift astech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor. And if that confrontation has been crystallized in\n                                                    this latest battle, the tech companies could be headed toward a victory.\nThe government is fighting for data of the most sympathetic sort, while Apple argues that it is fighting to preserve a principle that most owners of a smartphone can defend \u2014 weaken one iPhone and\n                                                    you risk weakening all phones for any government intruder, anywhere.\nUnderlying this is a simple dynamic:companies like Apple, Google and Facebook hold most of the cards. They have the data and their businesses depend on the belief that they will do everything they\n                                                    can to protect that data.\nAny crack in that front could be fatal for global tech companies. And who would be responsible if a hacker got hold of the code for the phone of the attacker in the San Bernardino attack and broke into other\n                                                    devices?\nThe tech companies also hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. The government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new\n                                                    code.\nEven if Apple ultimately loses this case,it has plenty of technical means to close a backdoor over time.\nJonathan Zdziarski, a digital forensic expert who studies the iPhone and its vulnerabilities, pointed out that the judge\u2019s order required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d\n                                                    to unlock the attacker\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security of future iPhones that that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201dreasonable assistance\u201d would not be able to crack a device\n                                                    when compelled by the government, the precedent set by the legal case might lose its force.\nEven if the F.B.I. wins this case, it loses in the long run, Mr. Manjoo writes.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nAffinity to Buy Burger King\u2019s South Korean Operation|The Asian private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners has reached\n                                                    a deal to take full control of the Burger King franchise in South Korea for about $170 million, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing a person familiar with the situation.the wall street journal\n\nSpanish Unit of China\u2019s ICBC Raided in Money Laundering Case|The Madrid branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of\n                                                    China is accused of helping Chinese and Spanish criminal syndicates commit financial fraud.NYT \u00bb\n\nA New Worry for Bank Investors|Holders of the bonds of the biggest banks used to benefit from the assumption that such firms were\n                                                    \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d meaning taxpayers would ride to the rescue if they ran into trouble.

        "fulltext": "UNITED TECHNOLOGIES DECLINES HONEYWELL OFFER|United Technologies has rejected an offer from Honeywell International worth about\n                                                    $108 a share in stock and cash,Leslie Picker and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.Honeywell would have paid a 25 percent premium to where United Technologies\u2019 stock traded at the time.\nUnited Technologieshad already  broken off talks about a mergerwith Honeywell International over regulatory concerns and worries about who would run the combined company.\nHoneywell had believed that regulators would only require a small divestiture and that its chief executive, David Cote, should run the combined company, while its shareholders would own about 60 percent\n                                                    of the merged operation.\nUnited Technologies said publicly on Monday that regulators would probably reject any deal.\nThe decision has for now halted the creation of what would be a nearly $150 billion industrial giant, producing thermostats, Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevator equipment. Both companies supply\n                                                    parts to Boeing and Airbus.\nShares in United Technologies gained 4.7 percent after CNBC earlier reported that the companies had been in talks. Honeywell\u2019s stock slipped 2 percent.\n\nYAHOO EXPOSES A WEAK BOARD|Yahoo is still a contender for America\u2019s worst corporate board,\nSteven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.\nWhen Yahoo announced that it was exploring a sale, itconfirmed that the board is still stumblingand refusing to take a stand as Marissa Mayer flounders.\nOnly a few months ago,the board had decided that a spinoff of its Alibaba stock was too risky. Instead, it said that \u201cmarket perceptions\u201d dictated that it make another transaction \u2014\n                                                    spinning off Yahoo itself. This \u201creverse spin\u201d was seen as a sop to the market and an attempt to buy time for Ms. Mayer to enact another turnaround plan.\nNow it has shifted course again\u2014 this time initiating a full-fledged sale, setting up an independent committee of the board as well as hiring lawyers and bankers.\nThe company says that this is only one option, but with an independent committee, this is likely to end with a sale.And it is nearly impossible to turn around a company while exploring a sale and contacting bidders.The talk of a sale being \u201conly an alternative\u201d is cheap, Mr. Solomon argues. And it is exactly what a weak board would do \u2014 throw its hands up, despite the possible value of waiting.\nAnd this is not the end of the story. Some hedge funds, like SpringOwl, are likely to oppose a sale as insufficient. Others, like Starboard, are salivating for it.\nSo the next fight will be over whether the company is selling too cheaply.\nIt all brings to mind a truism on Wall Street, Mr. Solomon writes. Once you are at the mercy of financial engineers and schemes,it is over.\n\nON THE AGENDA|JPMorgan\u2019sinvestor day starts at 8:30 a.m.Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal\n                                                    Reserve, will deliver the keynote speech on the future of the global economy at 7:30 p.m. at CERAWeek.\n\nA NEED BREED OF WALL STREET TRADER|Markets may be feeling grim, butpeople are still partying in the booming world of exchange-traded funds,Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook.\nJane Street, a secretive E.T.F. trading firm, recently threw a party for the $2.8 trillion industry, which some referred to as spring break for the E.T.F. crowd. The message was clear. Jane Street barely\n                                                    existed 15 years ago, but it now trades more than $1 trillion a year andit is ready to take on the big boys.\nJane Street, which is privately held, has increased its shareholder\u2019s equity, or net worth, tomore than $1 billion today from $228 million in 2007.\nMuch of what it does is not known. It deploys specialized trading strategies to capture arbitrage profits by buying and selling large amounts of E.T.F. shares using its own capital.\nWhen China devalued its currency in August, some of the largest E.T.F.s sank by 50 percent or more. Traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror.\nAt Jane Street, however, Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F.s had retraced their sharp falls.\nOther firms, like Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have also capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion.\nThe growth in these firms has generated more demand for Wall Street traders who can build financial models, write computer code and also also have the guts to spot market anomalies and bet big with the firm\u2019s capital.\nIt is not unusual for banks and hedge funds to harness Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy, but Jane Street takes this high tech, high intellect marriage to a new level.\nWriting computer code, or at the very least being conversant in the firm\u2019s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders.\nThe firm hires only a handful of new employees each year and candidates have to ace brain-twisting math riddles and game theory test.\nSandor Lehoczky, a star trader who oversees the firm\u2019s hiring process, says he also looks forintellectual humility\u2014 where really smart people can accept being wrong and own up to mistakes.\nLarger banks are now also looking for their own E.T.F. hotshots.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nSysco to Acquire Brakes Group, a Food Distributor in Europe|Sysco agreed to pay $3.1 billion in the deal, which will be subject\n                                                    to review by European Union competition authorities.NYT \u00bb\n\nChina Reform Said to Be Near Joining Syngenta Purchase|China Reform Holdings, an investment firm charged with revamping state-owned\n                                                    enterprises, is in advanced talks to join China National Chemical\u2019s proposed $43 billion purchase of Syngenta, Bloomberg News reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.bloomberg news\n\nAustralia Approves Sale of Country\u2019s Largest Dairy to Chinese Buyer|Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison said the\n                                                    $202 million sale of the Van Dieman\u2019s Land Company in the island state of Tasmania to a Chinese businessman, Lu Xianfeng, and his Australian arm Moon Lake had been approved.bloomberg news\n\nRivals Consider Joint Bid for Asciano of Australia|In another twist to the $6.5 billion takeover battle for Asciano, a port-and-rail\n                                                    operator, rival suitors Brookfield Infrastructure Partners and Qube Holdings are considering a joint offer for the Australian company.the wall street journal\n\nStandard Chartered Posts a $2.36 Billion Loss for 2015|The Asia-focused British bank said it had been hit hard by weakness in\n                                                    emerging markets, as well as by the fall in commodity prices.NYT \u00bb\n\nWhile HSBC Stays Upbeat, Investors Worry About Rates and China|The lender\u2019s executives have made it clear that they think\n                                                    these worries are more imagined than real, but investors fear the worst is yet to come, Peter Thal Larsen writes in Breakingviews.Breakingviews \u00bb|HSBC Posts 4th-Quarter Loss and Comes Under S.E.C.
