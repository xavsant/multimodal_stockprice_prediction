        "title": "Rail Crossing Warnings Are Sought for Mapping Apps",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Following directions from Google Maps on a smartphone last year, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez turned a Ford truck, hauling a trailer, where he thought the app was telling him to go. But he ended up stuck on the railroad tracks at a poorly marked California crossing.\nSoon after Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez abandoned the truck, a commuter train barreled into it, killing the engineer and injuring 32 others.\nOn Monday, after investigating the crash for almost two years, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a safety recommendation asking technology and delivery companies to add the exact locations of more than 200,000 grade crossings into digital maps and to provide alerts when drivers encounter them.\nThe crash involving Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s truck \u2014 on Feb. 24, 2015, in Oxnard, Calif. \u2014 was one of the more than 200 fatalities that took place at a grade crossing, where road and railway lines are at the same level, in the United States last year. What made this crash stand out was the possible role of digital mapping technology in taking a driver down a wrong path. This was the first time the safety board has targeted navigation apps as a factor in a major accident.\nThese days, drivers count on mapping apps for more than getting from one place to another. The apps serve as in-car bulletin boards, alerting drivers in real time about their surroundings.Navigation apps such as Wazeprovide warnings for traffic jams, broken-down vehicles, roadway debris or even lurking police officers.\nThe accuracy of mapping data is becoming more important asdriverless cars start taking to the road. It will be up to navigation apps to guide cars onto the safest routes and to warn passengers \u2014 who may not be paying attention \u2014 about potential hazards.\n\u201cThe safer car in the future isn\u2019t going to have a better bumper; it\u2019s going to have better navigation,\u201d said Eric Gundersen, chief executive of Mapbox, a digital map provider.\nThe Federal Railroad Administration has lobbied technology companies for 18 months to add alerts for grade crossings. The rail agency said it had contacted 11 technology companies, including Apple and Microsoft, to integrate its location data of grade crossings.\nIn this year\u2019s lineup of GPS devices, Garmin included safety warnings for potential hazards like sharp turns and railroad crossings, the company said, although it does not use the federal rail location data.\nSeveral months after the Oxnard crash, the railroad agency said Google had agreed to add audio and visual warnings to Google Maps, the world\u2019s most popular mapping app, based on grade-crossing location data. But Google has not yet included that feature, even though it has updated the app more than two dozen times for the iPhone since then.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said Apple and three other companies had also agreed to add crossing data, but the board was uncertain when the companies would do so.\nA spokeswoman from Google said the company was aware of the safety board\u2019s recommendation and was looking at ways to add safety features. Apple said it was working to add the rail data to its maps but would not elaborate on implementation specifics. Microsoft and MapQuest said they were also reviewing the data used in their maps.\nIn a speech on Sept. 15, Sarah E. Feinberg, administrator of the railroad agency, said many of the recent deaths at rail crossings were not from drivers trying to \u201cbeat the train\u201d but were \u201csituations where the driver lost situational awareness, or there weren\u2019t sufficient protections in place to protect the vehicle or provide adequate warning to the driver.\u201d\nShe chided technology companies for procrastinating on integrating data into mapping applications that \u201cwill save many lives.\u201d\nOn Monday, Ms. Feinberg praised the safety board\u2019s recommendation, saying she hoped it \u201cwill raise this to the top of technology companies\u2019 priority lists.\u201d\nThe N.T.S.B.\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the board can use them to pressure technology companies to take action. It can also try to persuade Congress to offer funds to provide incentives to the companies, said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the safety board.\nThe board has issued map-related safety recommendations in the past, urging utility companies to update their maps with accurate locations of abandoned gas lines.\nDigital maps started replacing paper maps about a decade ago, when stand-alone GPS devices from companies like Garmin and TomTom became more affordable and car companies started offering built-in navigation systems. But the breakthrough came when Google and Apple added turn-by-turn directions into mapping apps on smartphones, putting the technology into millions of devices already in people\u2019s pockets.\nGlobally, an estimated one billion people use a mapping app or service every week, according to the technology research firm Berg Insight.\nIn the Oxnard crash, the driver was using Google Maps in Spanish on a smartphone borrowed from his wife. Investigators believe the map was one of a number of factors, including driver fatigue.\nMr. Sanchez-Ramirez was on a 350-mile drive from his home in Yuma, Ariz. What was supposed to be a six-hour trip had stretched to 21 hours because his truck broke down along the way and he was involved in a minor crash. He came upon the rail crossing before sunrise, having not slept substantively in more than 24 hours, the safety board\u2019s report said.\n\u201cThe N.T.S.B. concludes that had the driver\u2019s navigation application included information on the upcoming grade crossing, he would have been less likely to misinterpret the visual cues and mistakenly turn onto the railroad tracks,\u201d the safety board wrote in its report.\nAt the time, the crossing had no grade separation, and there were no cones or markers warning drivers from turning onto the rails. Since 2008, there have been five accidents at that crossing, including one in 2010 when a confused driver turned onto the tracks and was struck by a train. The driver was injured, but there were no fatalities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand how in the dark, a sleep-deprived driver unfamiliar with the area can turn at the wrong place if a navigation app says, \u2018Turn here,\u2019\u201d said James McGillis, who lives near Oxnard, in Simi Valley, and has written extensively on his website about the crash.\nThe police found Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez a mile from his truck. He had abandoned it on the tracks with the headlights and hazard lights on and the driver\u2019s door open. Ron Bamieh, Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s lawyer, said his client was trying to get help. Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez was charged in February of this year with vehicular manslaughter and is awaiting arraignment.\nAt some grade crossings, there are no gates or blinking lights to warn drivers of an oncoming train \u2014 just a crossing sign or a crossbuck, a white \u201cX\u201d marked with the words \u201crailroad crossing.\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, said grade crossings could be especially dangerous because drivers often do not take the proper precautions, especially with all the other distractions in the car.\n\u201cSometimes we want to distract while they are distracted,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said, praising the safety board\u2019s move. \u201cThat level of technology can be a game changer.\u201d\nThe need for a recommendation speaks to the dependence some drivers feel toward navigation apps, choosing to follow directions from the app even in the face of contradictory information.\nIn February, after a rockslide closed Interstate 70 in Colorado, directions from Google Maps sent drivers over a mountain pass near Aspen as an alternative. But that road was closed for the winter.\nA spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Amy Ford, said many drivers ignored road signs informing them that the road was closed and followed the apps instead. The most determined drivers became stranded and needed assistance from law enforcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become integral for many drivers,\u201d said Jake Nelson, AAA\u2019s director of traffic safety advocacy and research. \u201cThe risk is when we become over-reliant on these technologies.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Among the many terrible things you can call someone in the tech industry, one of the most damning is \u201cpatent troll.\u201d\nSo it\u2019s unlikely that Apple is misunderstanding the significance of the term when it says Nokia is employing the tactics of a patent troll in a long-running licensing fight now heading to courts all over the world, asVindu Goel and Mark Scott write.\nA patent troll is a term for a company whose business is solely based on licensing the use of patents to other companies. Sometimes these licensing deals are negotiated amicably, and sometimes they\u2019re settled in a protracted legal battle.\nTrolls have been around for some time, and a few years ago, many in Silicon Valley argued that trolls were a crippling drag on the industry, particularly on start-ups that don\u2019t have the financial resources to fight. But there was thought by people in the tech industry that the most egregious examples of their patent exploitation had eased in recent years, which brings us back to Apple and Nokia.\nThere is little dispute that most of the Nokia patents are legitimate. Before the company came undone mostly because of competition from outfits like Apple, Nokia was a pioneer in mobile phones.\nThe issue, as is usually the case, is money. For the last five years, Apple has licensed a portfolio of Nokia products. But the two companies have not been able to negotiate a new deal.\nAdding another wrinkle is Nokia\u2019s intellectual property partners. Nokia has divided its portfolio and transferred parts of it to Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management: Both companies find ways to make money from the patents, and then share the proceeds with Nokia.\nApple says Acacia and Conversant have filed 52 cases against it around the world, many of which assert violations of Nokia patents. Apple also says that\u2019s an attempt to unfairly increase costs; it has filed an antitrust suit to stop Nokia. But it seems unlikely the fight will be over anytime soon."

        "title": "Apple Music: Platform? Promoter? Both.",
        "fulltext": "By all modern metrics, Drake was far and away the most listened-to artist of 2016, a year when music consumers further abandoned CDs and paid downloads, and turned increasingly to streaming services.\nThe rapper saw staggering numbers from FM radio to Spotify, where songs from his album \u201cViews\u201d were streamed more than three billion times since their April release, but it was Drake\u2019s exhaustive synergy with Apple Music, where \u201cViews\u201d was played another few billion times, that best illustrated the recent paradigm shifts in the music industry \u2014 and signaled where things may yet be headed. (According to Nielsen Music, on-demand streaming now accounts for a larger share of total business \u2014 38 percent \u2014 than physical sales, digital album sales or track downloads.)\nEven 10 years ago, long after the MP3 had changed everything, the pop industry was fairly diffuse: Major labels serviced music to stores and radio while also handling additional marketing. Music videos, paid for by those labels, had their premieres on MTV or, increasingly, on free online platforms; late-night shows and glossy magazines did interviews around long-planned release dates (remember those?); and the lucrative business of touring was largely a separate concern.\nSince its debut in the summer of 2015, however, Apple Music has separated itself from Spotify, the industry\u2019s streaming leader, by trying to become a one-stop shop for major artists \u2014 part platform and part promoter.\nIn the case of Drake, the service\u2019s marquee musician so far, that has meant unveiling new songs on his OVO Sound show for Apple\u2019s Beats 1 internet radio station while making his music exclusive to the service for a set window of time. Zane Lowe, the Beats 1 host, was granted Drake\u2019s only interview around his album release. The rapper\u2019s Summer Sixteen tour was sponsored by Apple, as was his promotional mini-movie,\u201cPlease Forgive Me,\u201dwhich remains available only to subscribers. (Unlike Spotify, Apple does not offer free streaming; a monthly subscription is $9.99, though three-month trials are available.)\nThen there were Drake\u2019s commercials with Taylor Swift.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could argue against the incredible value of Apple marketing,\u201d said David Bakula, a senior music analyst for Nielsen. \u201cThere are artists they latch onto and say, \u2018This is something we are going to heavily promote.\u2019 It makes one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world a sort of tastemaker.\u201d\nDrake wasn\u2019t the only one to benefit. Albums this year fromTravis Scott, Future and DJ Khaled all debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart as Apple Music exclusives, as did \u201cBlonde\u201d byFrank Ocean, whorattled the industrywhen he ditched his label to work directly with the streaming service. Chance the Rapper\u2019s Grammy-nominated mixtape,\u201cColoring Book,\u201dwas not sold at all and was available to stream only via Apple for two weeks.\nAnd while it wasn\u2019t just Apple aligning itself closely with top talent this year \u2014 Tidal, the smaller music service owned in part by Jay Z, raised its profile with exclusives from Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye West and Rihanna \u2014 it was relentless in pursuit of such collaborations, even with more obscure artists, such asJamie xxandLil Yachty, that nonetheless added to its creative credibility.\nThis strategy was not driven so much by Silicon Valley thinkers as record label veterans \u2014 namely the Apple Music executives Jimmy Iovine, a former producer who was a founder of Interscope and Beats by Dr. Dre, and Larry Jackson, a onetime A&R man who signed acts like Chief Keef and Lana Del Rey.\n\u201cWe have real understanding of what these artists are trying to accomplish both aesthetically and commercially,\u201d Mr. Iovine said. At Apple, \u201cWe\u2019re really getting there in merging these cultures \u2014 tech and the arts,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to prove that we are the best place for an artist to fulfill their vision.\u201d\nIn interviews this month, Mr. Iovine and Mr. Jackson, the quietly influential pair behind the delivery of some of pop music\u2019s most notable 2016 moments, discussed Apple\u2019s place in the music ecosystem and what the future of streaming may hold. These are edited excerpts from those conversations.\nWhat did you learn in 2016 that you didn\u2019t realize at the beginning of the year?\nLARRY JACKSONOn an overall philosophical level, it was about finding our footing with regards to how you can deconstruct genre classifications, making these certain odd juxtapositions work that shouldn\u2019t. A year ago, I don\u2019t think anybody would have expected Taylor Swift and Drake to work with each other. What we\u2019re trying to do is create a clubhouse where these artists can come and play together in the same sandbox and take advantage of each other in a mutually beneficial way. It\u2019s been tough to do that at certain other places.\nWhy have we seen such a huge surge in streamingfor hip-hop and R&B artists, and how does that affect who Apple Music chooses to work with?\nJACKSONThe shift happened before our arrival in the marketplace. It was something that I\u2019d definitely taken note of when I was working as an A&R at Interscope, with artists like Chief Keef, who was doing so well [streaming]. It\u2019s almost blasphemous for me to say it, but rap has almost taken the place of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll for a young audience. With hip-hop assuming a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll brashness and attitude, it just made it more of a powerful juggernaut.\nFrom my perspective and from Jimmy\u2019s, we\u2019ve always had a very strong knack for signing and nurturing hip-hop and R&B acts. The thing I find more interesting now is: What\u2019s the new pop? Pop has always been considered to be one thing, if you know what I\u2019m saying. But when I look at the top albums of the year \u2014 it\u2019s Drake, Beyonc\u00e9, J. Cole, Frank Ocean and the Weeknd \u2014 all black artists. How is that not pop? You don\u2019t really hear Frank Ocean or J. Cole on pop radio, but streaming has ushered in what the new pop is.\nThere was an idea this year, especially after Frank Ocean released \u201cBlonde\u201d independently through Apple, that you were stepping in where traditional labels may have fallen behind.\nJIMMY IOVINEIt\u2019s an interesting dynamic. We all have to reinvent ourselves now that paid streaming is starting to lock in. There\u2019s going to be a lot of new technology, and everyone\u2019s going to be reforming their roles. We have no interest in being a label. But we do have interest in making our platform the one that\u2019s best to communicate with the audiences.\nWe do a different thing than labels. They manage hundreds of groups. We don\u2019t, nor could we. We are a platform that works between the artist, the label and the consumer. The day I met Steve Jobs and [the Apple executive] Eddy Cue, I immediately harnessed it for Interscope. I wasn\u2019t threatened by it. The labels need to have people who know how to harness these things and not just say, \u201cPut me on a playlist,\u201d and pray for rain.\nHave the labels successfully harnessed your platform this year?\nJACKSONMonte Lipman [of Republic Records] has been fantastic. He\u2019s really cracked the Rubik\u2019s Cube of what we\u2019re trying to do. L. A. Reid [of Epic Records] has decoded it perfectly \u2014 we\u2019ve had three No. 1 albums this year between Travis Scott, Khaled and Future. I\u2019d look to them as examples. No one is out to embarrass anybody else.\nSome see Apple Music as benefiting only the artistic 1 percent. What\u2019s the best use of the platform for those not on the tier of a Drake or Chance?\nJACKSONWe have well over 20 million paid people on the service and a few more million in trials. A lot of those people have come here because they are fans of those few individuals. But once you have all those people congregating in one place \u2014 roughly 60 percent of them are under the age of 35 \u2014 inherently, discovery is going to happen. It\u2019s just part of the process, especially with our editorializing and curating.\nWere A-list exclusives the most effective way to add subscribers?\nIOVINEThere\u2019s a lot of reasons we have over 20 million subscribers. One of the things they get is some music early. Fantastic. Do we see spikes when we do exclusives? Yes. Is that the only reason we get subscribers? No.\nJACKSONIt\u2019s still consistently a very powerful messaging tool, just marketing for the concept of streaming. With all of the biggest artists of the year \u2014 namely Beyonc\u00e9, Drake, Frank [Ocean] \u2014 a big part of their rollout was really driven by streaming. If those artists are releasing music that way, how could it not be a public education as far as what streaming is all about?\nIs there a concern that the fragmentation of the streaming market, and especially exclusives, incentivizes people to download music illegally?\nJACKSONI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve used the BitTorrent a time or two in my life. We\u2019ve all come across something that we just had to have then and there. But there\u2019s one thing that you know if you\u2019ve ever gotten music that way: It\u2019s incredibly inconvenient. It\u2019s such a drag to navigate, and there\u2019s a certain level of peril involved. The ease and simplicity and design of what we and other services have been able to do has made piracy probably more of an inconvenience and less of an appealing idea than it once was, perhaps 10 years ago.\nDo you regret how the Frank Ocean situation played out, given the perception that you were party to a fast one being pulled on Def Jam and Universal Music?\nIOVINEWe wanted to work with Frank Ocean. We had a deal \u2014 we were working with Frank Ocean, and he controlled where his music came out. Why would it be in our interest to be part of a fast one, a slow one or any one? We were getting the record no matter what. Whatever happened with him and Universal is really between him and Universal. It has nothing to do with us. Nothing.\nWhy would an artist like Drake ever sign a record contract again given what he\u2019s getting from Apple? Or even someone at the beginning of their career, like Chance?\nJACKSONRight now, you really are competing for mindshare. There\u2019s a cacophony of information that consumers are assaulted with on a daily basis from so many different angles. How do you cut through? You don\u2019t cut through in a very subtle, laid back way. You have to lean into it to create what you want to create. And it\u2019s very tough to do that with crumbs and peanuts. Everything comes and goes in a 48-hour news cycle, even if you\u2019re lucky, so we\u2019re trying to create moments that have really big long cultural tails. But it\u2019s not one or the other. You can say two is better than one.\nWhat do the labels do best right now that Apple Music can\u2019t?\nJACKSONArtist development. Pretty much all the artists that are breaking right now have deals. The record labels play such an incredible role in that. Breaking an artist is much bigger than getting on whatever fancy playlist of the week. Terrestrial radio is still an undeniable, massive powerhouse and they know that terrain better than anyone. And physical [releases] are still a big part of the market, especially in countries like Germany and Japan.\nWas Kanye\u2019s \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d close to happening with Apple before he ultimately went exclusive with Tidal?\nJACKSON[Kanye\u2019s] a good friend of mine. He talks about our relationship on the song\u201cSaint Pablo.\u201dWe\u2019ll always work together \u2014 not everything has to be business. Jimmy and I went to the studio two times to hear the album and give feedback, not for any reason other than we love him as an artist and we just wanted to help.\nIOVINEHe was part of Jay\u2019s thing and chose to make a deal with his friend, and I respect that. I kind of felt like it was going to happen before it did. Jay Z and Kanye \u2014 that\u2019s a very natural thing for them to work together. Everybody moves on. You try to do the best with what you\u2019ve got and ignore everything else. That\u2019s why horses get blinders in horse racing: You look at the horse next to you, and you lose a step.\nAre there albums or artists that you feel like you missed out on?\nIOVINEI would have loved to see Adele launch through the streaming service. But it wasn\u2019t in the cards. It just wasn\u2019t in our realm.\nIs there any sort of blood feud between Apple, Spotify and Tidal?\nIOVINENot even one speck of it. I see Jay all the time. I want him to do great. There was never one record company. When I produced records, I used to ask Quincy [Jones] to come in and help me. We are competitors, yes. But as far as anything more, absolutely not.\nDo you think we\u2019ll eventually see a consolidation of these services, or will we continue to see an expansion?\nIOVINEI think you look at history: There\u2019ll be two or three, like there are two or three of everything else.\nHow important is it for you to have a creative relationship with artists in addition to a business relationship?\nJACKSONThe thing that has been most disheartening for me to hear or read is that what we do is transactional in a cold, callous way. The process is so much more collaborative than just sitting in some ivory tower and doing some silly banking deal. Taylor brought me the idea of her running on a treadmill and falling down \u2014 that was a concept she\u2019d emailed me, and we built upon it, along with [the director Anthony Mandler]. There was no filter, nobody in the middle, and we were able to do great work that way. We did aviral commercialfor Travis Scott, with Brian McKnight, that me and my brother directed. Whatever it takes to get the win."

        "fulltext": "ZHENGZHOU, China \u2014 A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China.\nGovernment officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes \u2014 counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations.\nThe state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world\u2019s most valuable company and one of China\u2019s largest retailers.\nThe well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple\u2019s best-selling and most profitable product.\nIt all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as \u201ciPhone City.\u201d\nThe local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants.\nIt helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.\nAll of it in support of iPhone production.\n\u201cWe needed something that could really develop this part of the country,\u201d said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in China: \u2018If you build the nest, the birds will come.\u2019 And now, they\u2019re coming.\u201d\nAmerican officials have long decried China\u2019s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China\u2019s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.\nLocal and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.\nIn this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.\nBut the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate \u2014 and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.\nChina\u2019s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world\u2019s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn.\nWhile Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China\u2019s importance to American technology companies \u2014 and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple\u2019s consumer sales.\nA 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.\nIt is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren\u2019t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren\u2019t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn\u2019s negotiations.\nThe confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their \u201csupport\u201d for iPhone production, calling the benefits a \u201cpreferential policy.\u201d The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.\nAs China\u2019s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company\u2019s size and scale \u2014 and the sway that they afford in China \u2014 is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple\u2019s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn\u2019s largest customer.\nThe two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn\u2019s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world\u2019s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.\nIn response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government\u2019s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner.\nFoxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was \u201cno different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.\u201d\nA growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China.\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas,threatening punitive tariffson the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to\u201cbuild their damn computers and things in this country.\u201d\nChina, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping,is growing less tolerantand more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the \u201cguardian warriors\u201d that have \u201cseamlessly penetrated\u201d China and may pose a threat to national security.\nChina, no longer content with just being the world\u2019s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny.\nRegulators shut downApple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giantfor failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country.\nApple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. Trump in New York, part of an effortto build bridgeswith the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in China in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country\u2019s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government\u2019s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing\u2019s Imperial City.\nThe two countries are playing a high-stakes game.\nApple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages \u2014a complexity that is often lostin the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States.\nAs China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs.\nAs the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store.\nFoxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone.\nThe bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.\nThe Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn\u2019s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.\nThe customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.\nApple was late to China.\nIn a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company\u2019s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated.\nRather than close plants, Apple decided to build them \u2014 in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.\n\u201cThis is a machine that is made in America,\u201d Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.\nFinances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.\nUnder the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths \u2014 design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.\n\u201cThey have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple\u2019s growth,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.\nWhen Apple\u2019s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn\u2019s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.\nFoxconn\u2019s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.\n\u201cThe reason Foxconn\u2019s so big is Terry Gou,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. \u201cHe said he\u2019d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.\u201d\nAfter the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China \u2014 unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.\n\u201cThese have become like Olympic competitions,\u201d said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\nThe Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China\u2019s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.\nCity officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.\nThe city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.\n\u201cWe know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,\u201d said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.\nThe city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.\n\u201cI was impressed,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. \u201cThey were very focused.\u201d\nWhen Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.\nBut Apple initially had to take the \u201cHong Kong U-turn\u201d to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.\nSince China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government\u2019s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.\nMost products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports \u2014 hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.\nIn 2005, Apple\u2019s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country\u2019s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China.\n\u201cThis was really a legacy of China\u2019s old export-oriented economy,\u201d said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. \u201cBack then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.\u201d\nApple and other multinationals wanted a better system.\nBy the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.\nIn discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city\u2019s airport, to expedite Apple\u2019s global shipments.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturing facility.\nA bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.\nAs the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy.\nIn the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.\nThe process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company\u2019s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China.\n\u201cU.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cIn doing so, they create stateless income \u2014 income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.\u201d\nAccording to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the \u201choly grail of tax avoidance.\u201d The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.\nApple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.\nIn Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city\u2019s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.\nIn August 2014, the city\u2019s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss \u201cdeepening collaboration\u201d with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the \u201cbiggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.\u201d\nThere were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation\u2019s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city\u2019s tax revenue was rapidly rising.\nOfficials had a name for it all: \u201cZhengzhou Speed.\u201d\nA crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.\nThey file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones \u2014 up to 350 a minute.\nApple\u2019s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.\nAs part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers.\n\u201cEvery city\u2019s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,\u201d said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou.\nThe government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. \u201cIf the demand is high, then they will pay more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.\u201d\nCities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don\u2019t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China.\nAs the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology.\nTo advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China\u2019s State Council, the country\u2019s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.\nThe threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.\nBut the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals \u2014 in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called anew form of \u201ctechno-nationalism.\u201d\n\u201cThe government wants to know what you can give to China,\u201d said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. \u201cAnd they have the market and the muscle. They\u2019re not playing around anymore.\u201d\nChinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.\nChina is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increasedoversight of the internetwith new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused.\nApple has agreed to the government\u2019s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo \u201csecurity audits\u201d on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product.\nBeijing also expects American companies to help develop China\u2019s own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It hasinvested $1 billionin the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies.\nMr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple\u2019s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country\u2019s top leaders, including Mr. Xi.\nIn an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a \u201cpillar of its environmental strategy.\u201d He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple\u2019s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing.\nAt the Hall of Purple Light in the government\u2019s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company\u2019s first research and development center in the country and to support the government\u2019s big focus on high-end manufacturing.\nOpposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan."

        "title": "Supreme Court Gives Samsung a Reprieve in Apple Patent Case",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A unanimous Supreme Courtruledon Tuesday that Samsung may not have to give up $399 million in profits for copying parts of the distinctive look of Apple\u2019s iPhone.\nA federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the quoted phrase.\nWriting for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers \u2014 here, Samsung\u2019s phones \u2014 and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent.\nApple\u2019s patents covered specific design elements of the iPhone, including its black rectangular front face with rounded corners and its colorful grid of 16 icons. A juryfound in 2012 that Samsung had infringed those patents.\n\u201cAll told,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, \u201cApple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung\u2019s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.\u201d\nDesign patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century.\nLast year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals,ruledthat the federal law \u201cexplicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.\u201d\nThe appeals courtappeared to acknowledge the possibilitythat \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\n\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the appellate court said.\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that \u201cthe relevant \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 must always be the end product sold to the consumer.\u201d\n\u201cIn the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote. \u201cIn the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration, drawing out the final resolution of a case that has transfixed Silicon Valley since it was filed in 2011.\nTechnology companies often imitate innovations made by their rivals and incorporate hundreds or thousands of patented ideas in a new product. The largest companies often cross-license their patents to one another to minimize infringement claims.\nThe Supreme Court battle between Apple and Samsung centered on what happens when the infringement involves just a few features of a product\u2019s design.\nApple \u2014 backed by dozens of independent designers as well as fashion-focused companies like Nike and Tiffany \u2014 argued that design is central to many products and that a patent violator should be forced to turn over the full profits it made from infringing designs.\nSamsung \u2014 whose position was backed by Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, eBay and HP \u2014 argued that any penalties should be proportionate to the importance of the infringing features to the overall product.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, while not decisively resolving the case, found that liability in design patent cases is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition. But the justices declined to offer more specific guidance. So now Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the smartphone market, will go back to court to wrangle over the appropriate amount of damages for Samsung\u2019s infringement.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, \u201cOur case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\u201d\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. \u201cAn \u2018article\u2019 is just \u2018a particular thing,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing two dictionaries. \u201cAnd \u2018manufacture\u2019 means \u2018the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\u2019 and \u2018the articles so made.\u2019\n\u201cAn article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\u201d\nPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\n\u201cThe court basically punted,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. \u201cIt seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tell you what the right rule is.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated."
