        "title": "F.B.I. Error Locked San Bernardino Attacker\u2019s iPhone",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I. acknowledged on Tuesday that his agency lost a chance to capture data from the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers when it ordered that his password to the online storage service iCloud be reset shortly after the rampage.\n\u201cThere was a mistake made in the 24 hours after the attack,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers at a hearing on the government\u2019s attempt to force Apple to help \u201cunlock\u201d the iPhone.\nF.B.I. personnel apparently believed that by resetting the iCloud password, they could get access to information stored on the iPhone. Instead, the change had the opposite effect \u2014 locking them out and eliminating other means of getting in.\nThe iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the assailants in the Dec. 2 attack in which 14 people were killed, is at the center of a fierce legal and political fight over the balance between national security and consumer privacy. Many lawmakers at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the House Judiciary Committee seemed torn over where to draw the line.\n\u201cThe big question for our country is how much privacy are we going to give up in the name of security,\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Mr. Comey. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no easy answer to that.\u201d\nWhile some lawmakers voiced support for Apple\u2019s privacy concerns, others attacked the company\u2019s position, saying it threatened to deprive the authorities of evidence in critical cases involving newer iPhones.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to create evidence-free zones?\u201d asked Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who once served as a federal prosecutor. \u201cAm I missing something?\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell you can\u2019t access a phone, I just find baffling,\u201d he said.\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, told committee members that the F.B.I.\u2019s demand for technical help to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c \u201cwould set a dangerous precedent for government intrusion on the privacy and safety of its citizens.\u201d Apple has said that in many cases investigators have other means to gain access to crucial information, and in some instances it has turned over data stored in iCloud.\nMr. Sewell reacted angrily to the Justice Department\u2019s suggestion thatApple\u2019s branding and marketing strategywas driving its resistance to helping the F.B.I., an assertion that he said made his \u201cblood boil.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t put up billboards that market our security,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do this because we think protecting security and privacy of hundreds of millions of iPhones is the right thing to do.\u201d\nF.B.I. officials say that encrypted data in Mr. Farook\u2019s phone and its GPS system may hold vital clues about where he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, traveled in the 18 minutes after the shootings, and about whom they might have contacted beforehand. While investigators believe that the couple was \u201cinspired\u201d by the Islamic State, they have not found evidence that they had contact with any extremists overseas.\nA judge last month ordered Apple to develop software that would disable security mechanisms on Mr. Farook\u2019s phone so that the F.B.I. could try multiple passwords to unlock the phone through a \u201cbrute force\u201d attack, without destroying any data. Once the systems were disabled, it would take only about 26 minutes to find the correct password, Mr. Comey said.\nHe rejected an idea expressed by several lawmakers that the F.B.I. was trying to force Apple to build a \u201cback door\u201d to decrypt its own security features. He used a different analogy to explain the government\u2019s demands.\n\u201cThere\u2019s already a door on that iPhone,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re saying to Apple \u2018take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.\u2019 \u201d\nBut the F.B.I. did not help its case with lawmakers when Mr. Comey acknowledged the mistake of changing the iCloud password.\nWhen the dispute over Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone erupted two weeks ago, the Justice Department blamed technicians at San Bernardino County, which employed Mr. Farook as an environmental health specialist and which owned the phone he used. But county officials said their technicians had changed the password only \u201cat the F.B.I.\u2019s request.\u201d\nMr. Comey acknowledged at the hearing that the F.B.I. had directed the county to change the password.\nMr. Sewell, the Apple lawyer, explained to the committee that before F.B.I. officials ordered the password reset, Apple first wanted them to try to connect the phone to a \u201cknown\u201d Wi-Fi connection that Mr. Farook had used. Doing so might have recovered information saved to the phone since October, when it was last connected to iCloud.\n\u201cThe very information that the F.B.I. is seeking would have been available, and we could have pulled it down from the cloud,\u201d he said.\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the password change drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans at the hearing.\n\u201cIf the F.B.I. hadn\u2019t instructed San Bernardino County to change the password to the iCloud account, all this would have been unnecessary, and you would have had that information,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York.\nMr. Chaffetz leveled a similar criticism during the more than two and a half hours of testimony from Mr. Comey.\n\u201cWith all due respect to the F.B.I., they didn\u2019t do what Apple had suggested they do in order to retrieve the data, correct?\u201d Mr. Chaffetz asked the director. \u201cI mean, when they went to change the password, that kind of screwed things up, did it not?\u201d\nBut Mr. Comey said that even if the F.B.I. had not mishandled the password, he did not think the bureau could have gotten everything it wanted from the phone and would still have needed Apple to help disable the security features in the phone.\n\u201cWe would still be in litigation,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the experts tell me there\u2019s no way we would have gotten everything off the phone from a backup.\u201d\nMr. Comey stressed that the fight with Apple was about trying to get as much information as possible about the San Bernardino attack \u2014 not about gaining a powerful law enforcement tool elsewhere.\nBut when he was asked whether the F.B.I. would seek to unlock other encrypted phones if it prevailed in the San Bernardino case, he responded, \u201cOf course.\u201d\nIn the audience were relatives of a Louisiana woman, Brittney Mills, who was shot to death at her doorstep last year when she was about eight months pregnant.\nMr. Comey said the data in her phone could help investigators determine whether she was shot by someone she knew, but they had been unable to break the passcode."

        "title": "Apple May Be Willing to Risk Contempt Charge",
        "fulltext": "Parents are known at times to deliver an ultimatum to a recalcitrant child by saying, \u201cDo this, or else!\u201d The question is what that the frequently undelivered punishment may actually be.\nWhen a case is in court, the judge can hold a party in contempt as the \u201cor else\u201d for refusing to comply with an order. But how far can a court go in imposing sanctions for contempt?\nThat question may arise for Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of Backpage.com, an advertising website that has been identified for its connections to possible sex trafficking. Mr. Ferrer is in a fight with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for not complying with a subpoena.\nIt may also become an issue for Apple if a judge orders it to help unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the terrorist attack in San Bernardino last December. The company may be willing to defy the order, and even if it wants to comply, there is a chance that its engineers would refuse to provide that assistance, asThe New York Times reported, perhaps making compliance impossible.\nIn Mr. Ferrer\u2019s case, the Senate voted 96-0 topass a resolutionon Thursday authorizing its legal counsel to file an action in the Federal District Court in Washington to hold him in civil contempt for refusing to turn over corporate records about the company\u2019s advertising review procedures and appear before the subcommittee to testify last November. The company\u2019s lawyerissued a statementthat it \u201clooks forward to a proper consideration of the important First Amendment constitutional issues by the judiciary \u2013 the branch of government charged with protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.\u201d\nA judge\u2019s power to punish someone for misconduct that takes place inside the courtroom is broad, as any fan of the movie\u201cMy Cousin Vinny\u201dwill recall when the protagonist is summarily ordered to jail for his antics. For conduct outside the judge\u2019s presence, the power to impose a penalty is more limited, and depends on whether it is intended to punish the person, which would be a criminal case, or coerce compliance with an order, which is civil.\nThat distinction is crucial because if the contempt is deemed criminal, then the person receives the usual array of constitutional protections afforded in any prosecution, such as a right to a jury trial and the requirement that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, before any punishment can be imposed.\nCivil contempt, on the other hand, entails fewer procedural requirements, so that a judge can sanction a person who refuses to comply without undertaking a full-scale trial. That can result in being incarcerated for an extended period, with no finding of guilt.\nThe reason for allowing an expedited process for civil contempt is that thecontemnor, as the person in violation of the order is called, is said to \u201chold the key to the jail cell\u201d by deciding whether to comply, so it is considered remedial rather than punitive. Witnesses who have spent months behind bars for refusing to testify before a grand jury include Greg Anderson, the personal trainer for the home run leader Barry Bonds, and Susan McDougal, a friend of President Clinton who participated in the Whitewater investment.\nThe Senate chose to useits authorityto seek a civil contempt against Mr. Ferrer because that gives it greater control over the case, and an increased likelihood of actually securing the documents and testimony the subcommittee seeks.\nIf the Senate wanted to pursue a criminal contempt, it would have to refer the case to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute, something that has not happened in recent cases. Federal prosecutors did not act in response to referrals regardingLois Lerner, a former I.R.S. official involved in claims of scrutinizing the tax-exempt status of conservative political organizations, and formerAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., for refusing to disclose internal documents related to the botched gun-smuggling investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious.\nBackpage.com asserts that the First Amendment protects it from having to submit all the documents subpoenaed by the subcommittee because it engages in advertising, which is a category of commercial speech. Mr. Ferrer may be willing to defy a court order to vindicate the principle of free speech, as other journalists have done.\nThat could mean a trip to jail for contempt, however, because federal courts generally do not recognize the First Amendment as a basis to resist a subpoena. The length of any incarceration could be considerable, as happened in one case when an investment manager spent more than seven years in jail for refusing to comply with a court order ina civil securities fraud case.\nApple is scheduled to be in court on Tuesday to challenge an order that it help unlock the iPhone. If it loses the fight, the question is whether the company will decide to be held in contempt to uphold its position that cooperating would create a dangerous precedent.\nIn its most recent brief filed last week in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California, the company argued that \u201cthe government seeks to commandeer Apple to design, create, test and validate a new operating system that does not exist, and that Apple believes \u2013 with overwhelming support from the technology community and security experts \u2013 is too dangerous to create.\u201d That does not indicate any willingness to do the government\u2019s bidding, even if the judge tells Apple to do so.\nWhether the company\u2019s engineers, responsible for creating the high level of encryption in its devices, would be willing to design the workaround that would unlock the phone could present an additional hurdle to compliance. If they will not, then the company may have no choice but to defy an order. Then the court would have to decide whether Apple can be held responsible for the conduct of its employees.\nUnlike an individual who can be sent to jail, if Apple were it to be held in civil contempt, it would face only a fine. Coming up with a monetary penalty large enough to have any real impact on a company as big and profitable as Apple could be difficult to achieve.\nIn 2015,Apple reportednet income of more than $53 billion. So a penalty of $10 million a day for the next year would take away only about 7 percent of its annual profit, an amount the company may be willing to pay to advance its position regarding the privacy of customer data. And any penalty might be tax deductible as a business expense.\nA large fine like that would be much more likely to fall in the criminal rather than civil contempt category, requiring a full-scale trial to establish that Apple should be punished, rather than taking the more expedited civil route. InUnited Mine Workers v. Bagwell, the Supreme Court found that a $52 million fine assessed against a union for violating an injunction related to a strike constituted a criminal sanction, so there are limits on how much the court can assess against Apple as part of a civil contempt.\nWhatever the merits of the Justice Department\u2019s argument to unlock the iPhone, there will be an issue about whether the court can effectively coerce Apple into providing the assistance demanded.\nIt may be that there is no effective \u201cor else\u201d when taking on the world\u2019s most valuable company, especially one that is willing to take a defiant position that enhances its popularity."

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration argued on Thursday that \u201cno single corporation\u201d \u2014 even one as successful as Apple \u2014 should be allowed to flout the rule of law by refusing to help the F.B.I. unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.\nThe administration\u2019s sharp tone in a new court filing drew an angry and emotional rebuke from lawyers for Apple, who accused the government of \u201ca cheap shot\u201d and were particularly upset about what they said was an unfair and inaccurate suggestion that the company has a special relationship with China to protect its corporate interests there.\n\u201cThe tone of the brief reads like an indictment,\u201d Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, told reporters. \u201cIn 30 years of practice, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a legal brief that was more intended to smear the other side with false accusations and innuendo.\u201d\nThe unusually intense sparring between the two sides signaled an escalation in tension over a case that had already drawn attention worldwide because of the high legal and corporate stakes. The fight has beenbrewing since mid-February, when Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ordered Apple to create and deploy an alternative operating system that would help law enforcement agents break into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case.\nApple publicly opposedthe order, igniting a standoff with the F.B.I. and the Justice Department. The fight has fueleda debate over privacy and civil liberties versus security, becoming a flash point in the growing tension between technology companies and the government over who can have access to private customer data and under what circumstances.\nIn its filing on Thursday in United States District Court in Los Angeles, the Justice Department said that Apple should be compelled to help the F.B.I. break into the iPhone and that the company should not be allowed to hide behind what prosecutors said were diversionary tactics in the court of public opinion.\nApple and its supporters \u201ctry to alarm\u201d the court by invoking bigger debates over privacy and national security, the Justice Department said. \u201cApple desperately wants \u2014 desperatelyneeds\u2014 this case not to be \u2018about one isolated iPhone.\u2019 \u201d\nThe government\u2019s filing was a point-by-point rebuttal ofa motion that Apple filed two weeks agoopposing the federal court order requiring it to break into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple had argued that the court order violated the company\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights, and said the government\u2019s request oversteps a law called the All Writs Act.\nIn the filing on Thursday, prosecutors argued that they have sought a \u201cmodest\u201d step in the case and that the courts, the executive branch and Congress \u2014 not Apple \u2014 share the power to decide how best to balance public safety and privacy.\n\u201cThe rule of law does not repose that power in a single corporation, no matter how successful it has been in selling its products,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nThe Justice Department also offered a robust defense of the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. The statute, used to gather evidence in thousands of cases, is an \u201cintegral part of our justice system,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nApple has tried to characterize that statute \u201cas an obscure law dredged up by the government to achieve unprecedented power,\u201d the Justice Department said. \u201cThat premise is false.\u201d\nAt the same time, prosecutors played downthe significance of a rulingthat went against them last week in a separate but similar case in a Brooklyn courtroom. In that case, a magistrate rejected attempts by the Justice Department to force Apple to help unlock an iPhone in a routine drug case, saying that the government was using the All Writs Act so broadly that it might be unconstitutional.\nThe Justice Department noted in a footnote Thursday that it was appealing the Brooklyn ruling and that the order carried no weight as precedent in the California case.\nIn another footnote, the Justice Department\u2019s tone also turned more ominous, suggesting that it might seek access to Apple\u2019s source code and private electronic signatures if the company does not cooperate. That would go beyond what the government has previously requested, which is the company\u2019s help in weakening the iPhone\u2019s defenses rather than any direct access to the technology.\nIn a rebuttal to the government\u2019s filing, Mr. Sewell of Apple said in a conference call that a number of the government\u2019s charges in its latest brief were unfounded.\nMr. Sewell said it was the first time ever that Apple had seen the government assert that it made modifications to specifically block law enforcement officials\u2019 access to its devices. More disturbingly, he said, federal prosecutors used unidentified sources to raise the specter that Apple has a different relationship with China than with other countries.\nHe said such accusations showed that the Justice Department \u201cis so desperate at this point that it has thrown all decorum to the winds.\u201d\nMr. Sewell likened the Justice Department\u2019s comments on China to Apple arguing that the F.B.I. cannot be trusted because there are rumors that the bureau was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy and citing \u201cconspiracytheory.com\u201d as its source.\n\u201cEveryone should beware,\u201d Mr. Sewell said, \u201cbecause it seems that disagreeing with the Department of Justice means you must be evil and un-American.\u201d\nOn the actual merits of the dispute, Apple\u2019s lawyers reiterated that the government\u2019s interpretation of the All Writs Act was simply wrong and that the authority the government seeks \u201cis breathtaking,\u201d essentially arguing that courts can order any private citizens or companies to do what the authorities want so long as there is jurisdiction.\nApple will have another chance to rebut the Justice Department\u2019s case before a hearing scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Pym. No matter how she rules, the closely watched case is almost certain to be appealed to the district court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and perhaps even the Supreme Court."

        "title": "In Apple Debate on Digital Privacy and the iPhone, Questions Still Remain",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A furious legal battle over digital privacy in the age of the iPhone ended on Monday with no clear winner \u2014 only lingering questions over what will happen the next time the government tries to force Apple to help break into one of its own phones.\nTheJustice Department on Monday announcedthat it had gotten what it wanted most immediately in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist attack: a way to unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters to determine what evidence it might hold, even without Apple\u2019s assistance.\nBut that development forestalls a court ruling on the bigger legal questions that have been so hotly debated since the case erupted last month when a judge in California ordered Apple to unlock the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook.\nThe legal debate in that state offered what many legal analysts saw as a powerful test case for the Justice Department to establish its position. But that verdict will now have to wait for another day.\n\u201cThis might be a missed opportunity for the Justice Department,\u201d said Eric Berg, a former federal prosecutor who now works on electronic surveillance cases at a private practice in Milwaukee. \u201cHaving this whole debate muted by this solution is probably a little bit disappointing for them.\u201d\nLikewise, the development represented an uneven result for privacy advocates. They could claim some measure of victory because Apple was able to hold to its position without giving in to the government, but an apparent flaw in Apple\u2019s vaunted encryption protocols was worrisome.\n\u201cUnfortunately, this news appears to be just a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the F.B.I. can force Apple to undermine the security of its own products,\u201d said Alex Abdo, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe Justice Department did not say whether it would seek to use the method discovered for accessing the San Bernardino phone in any other cases. Law enforcement officials have said they have been locked out of dozens of other phones as a result of encryption safeguards, and the unlocking method \u2014 a tightly held secret at the F.B.I. \u2014 could be valuable in many of those cases as well. But some law enforcement officials said it was too early to say anything about their ability to access other phones.\nWith the Justice Department moving on Monday to withdraw its motion forcing Apple\u2019s cooperation in the San Bernardino case, Apple is still on the winning side in a separate but related case in federal court in Brooklyn.\nIn that case, United States Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in the eastern district of New York ruled last month in a 50-page opinion that the Justice Department was not entitled to force Apple\u2019s cooperation in unlocking a drug dealer\u2019s iPhone. He said that prosecutors were taking too broad a ruling of a 1789 statute known as the All Writs Act in seeking to secure Apple\u2019s cooperation.\nThe Justice Department is appealing his decision.\nMr. Berg, the Milwaukee lawyer, said that although the San Bernardino fight might have ended without a court decision and a clear verdict, \u201cthis case has forced a national dialogue, and it really has brought this issue front and center. So the public won in the sense that this issue is now being debated.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad:How\u2019s it going, Mike? I just got back from South by Southwest, which everyone cool calls \u201cSouth By.\u201d But I\u2019m not cool. I call it \u201cSouth by Southwest.\u201d\nMike:I\u2019m incredibly cool, so I call it \u201cBy.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t understand.\nFarhad:On to this week\u2019s tech news.Sony unveileda virtual reality add-on for the PlayStation 4, making it the latest in a string of companies trying to get gamers to part with their money this year. The good news for gamers is that Sony wants less money than other virtual reality companies: The PlayStation VR will sell for $400 when it\u2019s released, and it works with the PS 4 that many gamers already have, while the Oculus Rift sells for $600 and requires a $1,000 PC. The bad news: Sony\u2019s ships in October, while the Oculus will be in gamers\u2019 grubby hands by the end of this month.\nMike:As with most new tech, I\u2019m pretty sure the first generations of all of these gadgets are going to be bad. I\u2019m doing my usual thing of waiting a few years for the hardware to get cheaper and the tech to get better. Meanwhile, I will bide my time in actual reality.\nFarhad:That\u2019s bad news for all of us. On another front, Google is giving its war robots the boot. You know those fearsome-looking bots you\u2019ve seen lifting weights and performing other tricks in a series of viral videos? Well, apparently they make for good videos but not good business.According to Bloomberg, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is looking to sell Boston Dynamics, the military robot subsidiary, because the company isn\u2019t likely to produce any revenue anytime soon. That was the reported reason, anyway; I wonder if Google execs\u2019 real worry was that these robots could one day turn against their masters.\nMike:Yeah,those definitely were freaky. Still, the \u201cisn\u2019t likely to produce revenue anytime soon\u201d reasoning sounds strange. Doesn\u2019t Google lose money on most of the wacky things it tries out? I\u2019m suspicious.\nFarhad:Also, a V.C. was sued by a woman claiming sexual abuse anda lot of unsavory details came spilling out in the legal documents. In other words, business as usual for the venture capital industry.\nBut hey, it\u2019s been at least two weeks since we talked about the Apple-F.B.I. case, so we\u2019re due for an update. Our Apple-obsessed colleagues had a blockbuster article this week \u2014according to their reporting, some of Apple\u2019s most prized engineers would rather quit their jobs than help the government break into the security systems guarding the iPhone.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised to hear this;security engineers tend to be a principled bunch. But I think nontechies will find this a bit hard to swallow. I bet a lot of people are going to accuse these guys of being divas or simply grandstanding. What do you think?\nMike:Honestly, this kind of idealism seems to jibe with my limited experience with security engineers. It seems as though if you\u2019re into information and computer security, it\u2019s not just a job, it\u2019s a way of life.\nThese people take the principles of keeping information safe incredibly seriously. Think about it: Their job is to make secure a product that holds our most intimate secrets \u2014 our texts to friends and family, our emails to co-workers and bosses, our frowny face emojis to our loved ones \u2014 and then offer that product to hundreds of millions of people.\nMoreover, it\u2019s not just another nifty feature on the phone, like 3D Touch or whatever. This is one of the marquee selling points of the newest generations of the iPhone under the leadership of Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief since 2011. As our colleagueshave written about at length, the idea of personal privacy and the right to hold our information safe against thieves is personally important to him. I imagine he instills that sense of duty in the teams responsible for this.\nFarhad:Right. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the principles they worry about, but it\u2019s also the practical effect on the security of Apple\u2019s devices. The security engineers who would be tasked with helping the F.B.I. break into this phone probably best understand the dangers of doing so \u2014 especially the danger that the code to break into this phone could slip into unwanted hands. It\u2019s like asking a locksmith to create a master key for every house in the neighborhood; sure, you\u2019ll probably be able to find a few who\u2019ll do it, but most will tell you that it goes against their professional code, for the very simple reason that it\u2019s very dangerous.\nMike:One other thing: I don\u2019t know how much of this is marketing (probably a lot), but from Apple\u2019s early days, the company under Steve Jobs styled itself as a countercultural influence \u2014 products made by and for the \u201crebellious\u201d lot.\nDo I think Apple\u2019s campus is flooded with a bunch of radical hippies? Probably not. It\u2019s a corporate behemoth \u2014 the most valuable company in the world \u2014 so it\u2019s sort of hard to argue for \u201ccounterculture\u201d when the iPhone is omnipresent in our society today. Still, that influence, or streaks of it, had to have to trickled down in the organization over the years. Maybe we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that.\nFarhad:This still leaves the puzzle of what happens if Apple\u2019s engineers refuse to comply. You could compare this situation to that of civil servants who refuse to carry out laws they find objectionable \u2014 like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who felt her religious views prevented her from signing gay marriage certificates. She wasjailed for contemptfor that refusal; the case was eventually resolved when Ms. Davis said she would not interfere with her deputies\u2019 signing gay marriage licenses.\nBut the Apple case is different because there aren\u2019t a lot of other people who can step in for Apple\u2019s security engineers. This isn\u2019t a matter of simply signing a piece of paper; the people who would have to carry out a court order would need very specific expertise regarding the security of Apple\u2019s phones. If they refuse to comply en masse, what happens? Things are likely to get pretty interesting.\nAnyway, we\u2019ll see \u2014 until then, I\u2019ll be perusing the schedule for next\u2019s year\u2019s \u201cBy.\u201d See, I\u2019m cool!\nMike:Uh, no. Bye!"

        "fulltext": "More than two dozen European countries will ask the Supreme Court on Monday to let them sue in an American court. They said R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company participated in an international money laundering scheme, using drug money to buy tobacco, in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.\nThe question for the justices, who are generally skeptical of suits based on activities outside the United States, is whether RICO applies to conduct abroad. Seven justices will hear the case, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor is recused. \u2014Adam Liptak\nSix former bank employees are expected back in court in London on Monday ahead of their trial next month on criminal charges that they conspired to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, a global benchmark interest rate. \u2014Chad Bray\nApple and the Justice Department will meet in Federal District Court in the central district of California on Tuesday to hash out whether the company should weaken its security features so the government can break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino mass shooting last year.\nMagistrate Judge Sheri Pym will preside over the popular hearing in a case that has divided the country and become a flashpoint in the debate over the trade-offs between personal rights to privacy and the needs of law enforcement. The hearing comes a day after the company is expected to unveil smaller versions of itsiPhoneandiPadPro.\u2014Katie Benner\nDebt-burdened Puerto Rico will be up against investors at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The island says it urgently needs to restructure its $72 billion in debt but cannot, because Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code \u2014 the chapter for insolvent local governments \u2014 specifically bars Puerto Rico.\nIt tried writing its own bankruptcy law, but ran afoul of another rule: Only Congress can enact bankruptcy laws. The island won an expedited review by the Supreme Court, arguing that its very future is in doubt and that Congress cannot possibly have intended to lock it out of bankruptcy court. But lawyers for investment firms said that was precisely what the bankruptcy code does. \u2014Mary Williams Walsh\nThe annual Boao Forum in China this week will attract the likes of the Alibaba Group\u2019s chairman, Jack Ma, and the basketball star Yao Ming. But all eyes will be on Premier Li Keqiang, left, whom many investors are looking to for assurances that the Chinese government can avoid a hard economic landing.\nMr. Li said this month that China could solve its overcapacity problem in the steel and coal industries without resorting to huge layoffs. But economists have expressed skepticism, and investors will be looking for details on the government\u2019s plan to reduce inefficiencies at state-owned enterprises, as well its efforts to ensure stability in unruly stock markets. \u2014Javier C. Hern\u00e1ndez\nAutomakers will take the wraps off a number of new vehicles, particularly luxury models, at media previews starting Wednesday for the annual New York International Auto Show. With sales of new cars, trucks and utility vehicles on pace for another record year in the United States, manufacturers are accelerating their introduction of new models to tap into the strong consumer demand.\nA variety of electric and hybrid cars, including Toyota\u2019s latest version of its top-selling Prius line, will be on display. Other carmakers are bolstering their luxury brands with new entries, including Ford\u2019s Lincoln division and Honda\u2019s Acura unit. \u2014Bill Vlasic\nOn Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will report the latest data on durable goods orders in February. After durable goods orders made a big jump in January, economists believed they would show a 3.3 percent drop for the month of February.\nBut that is the overall headline figure, which includes aircraft deliveries that can be volatile. Core durable goods orders are thought to have been flat last month, reflecting steady consumer demand for products including appliances and automobiles. If orders rose, it could be another sign that the economy is stronger than many experts thought earlier this year. \u2014Nelson D. Schwartz\nA federal judge overseeing lawsuits against Volkswagen will hold a hearing on Thursday at Federal District Court in San Francisco to discuss the status of settlement talks, as well as the carmaker\u2019s attempts to fix nearly 600,000 diesels that are polluting much more than allowed.\nJudge Charles R. Breyer told Volkswagen last month to present a plan at the hearing to bring the cars into compliance. But it appears that the company, which has admitted that the vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat emissions tests, has not yet been able to find a technical solution that would satisfy regulators. \u2014Jack Ewing"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Greetings, Farhad! Or should I say, \u201cSup, brah?\u201d I\u2019m trying to change my vernacular to a more local dialect, as I am now a Californian living in the Bay Area.\nFarhad:Yeah, say, \u201cSup, brah?\u201d That\u2019s how we all do it. Especially if you\u2019re interviewing important people, that\u2019s the best opener.\nMike:I \u201chella\u201d agree.\nOnto the news!\nTwitter turned10 years old this week, which gave me time to reflect on how much of my life I have spent marking tweets as favorites. It really makes you think. And wince.\nFacebook is testing an \u201cimpersonation tool\u201d that will alert you when someone is pretending to be you on Facebook. I got really excited about this, until I learned that no one is trying to be me on Facebook. Or off Facebook, really.\nAlso,TiVo is in merger talks with Rovi, mostly because they are practically anagrams of each other.\nThe Information publishedan excellent rundownof what\u2019s going on at Nest, the smart thermostat company owned by Google. Things are looking, uh, not so hot, according to some current and former Nest employees.\nFarhad:That story was amazing for its frankness. People in Silicon Valley have trouble criticizing anyone. Even when companies are in trouble, people tend to be gentle about what\u2019s going on. But in this story, people let loose, especially Greg Duffy, the co-founder of Dropcam, the camera company that Nest bought. In one scene, Mr. Duffy tells Tony Fadell, Nest\u2019s chief executive, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat and it\u2019s holding back all progress.\u201d\nThat kind of reminded me of dealing with you, to be honest.\nMike:Silence, plebeian. You have interrupted my creative process.\nMoving on, things are rocky over at Pebble, which justlaid off a quarter of its staff, blaming a rough funding environment. Personally, I have never liked watches or really anything on my wrist except for aslap bracelet.\nAnd let us not forget the latest in the Apple vs. F.B.I. saga, in which the F.B.I. said it hadfound a third party to potentially unlock the iPhoneused by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., slayings last year. Now, the court proceedings are apparently halted as the government figures out if it actually needs to try to force Apple to crack open this phone.\nFarhad:Boy, what a twist this was. Everyone was set for the legal battle of the century and then, at the last minute, it fizzled. I don\u2019t think the F.B.I. would fib, of course, but it\u2019s hard not to be a bit suspicious of the last-minute turnabout. Apple\u2019s lawyers had been arguing that this case could set a precedent that would pave the way for future intrusions into our phones. Perhaps the F.B.I. got worried about that at the last minute, too \u2014 like, wait, if we lose this, it might haunt us forever.\nMike:Or maybe they actually found a third party to do it when all of this went public? It\u2019s all so cloak and dagger, except far more nerdy.\nSo while I do want to talk about Apple, this time it won\u2019t be in relation to the F.B.I. Let\u2019s chat about theiPhone SE, the newest deviceto come out of Apple.\nIs it revolutionary? Is it spectacular? Is it any one of the umpteen superlatives that the Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller uses to describe the company\u2019s newest products?\nNah, not really. The big reveal here is that it\u2019s small and cheap.\nHere\u2019s my stance: It may not be curing diseases or wowing audiences with crazy new technology like 3-D Touch or whatever. But above all other things, small and cheap are basically two out of the top three things I\u2019ve wanted from an iPhone, aside from \u201cbetter battery life,\u201d over the last few years. If I can buy a new iPhone, without a cellular contract, for half the cost of every other new generation of iPhone, that\u2019s a big enough deal for me.\nFarhad:I agree. It\u2019s good to see Apple do something a little scaled-down once in a while. I resisted big phones for years, and I reluctantly converted when the iPhone 6 came around. But I still miss typing with one hand, something that\u2019s nearly impossible on the latest iPhone, the 6S, and its even larger sibling, the 6S Plus. I got to try the new iPhone SE at Apple\u2019s press event the other day and my hands really liked it, even though its screen was way too small for my aging eyes. I liked it enough that I may buy one someday.\nMike:Biggest first-world problem ever: I have legitimate thumb pain from stretching to type single-handedly using the iPhone 6. I\u2019m considering filing for workman\u2019s comp. My thumbs are my livelihood.\nFarhad:Wow, you\u2019re in more trouble than I thought. Anyway, it\u2019s kind of remarkable that nearly 10 years after the release of the first iPhone, the only real innovation we\u2019re seeing anymore regards size. People want big, then they want small, then we\u2019ll go back to big again. But beyond that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much else to get excited about regarding phone hardware. We seem to be at the end of the line in terms of interesting innovations in smartphones \u2014 each new one will get us faster processors and maybe slightly better battery life, but beyond that, these things seem to have reached the natural limit of how amazing they can be.\nOr is it just me? What\u2019s that thing people say \u2014 only boring people get bored?\nMike:I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s fair to say we can be bored. Last time a company tried to get fancy with crazy software features on a smartphone was Amazon with its Fire phone. And we allknow how that turned out.\nSo what next? Wait until the October iPhone event to continue being bored with the releases, yet buy new phones in record numbers in the meantime?\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is \u201cO.K., we\u2019re bored.\u201d And I\u2019m fine with that as long as my dumb phone works.\nFarhad:Take care of your thumbs, friend. They\u2019re all you\u2019ve got. See you!"

        "fulltext": "THE South by Southwest festival in March is always an exciting time for news about music, films and ideas.\nThe giant event in Austin, Tex., also features SXSW Interactive, which is dedicated to start-up companies and technology discussions.\nKeeping tabs on the sprawling start-up scene at the five days of SXSW Interactive and beyond is tricky, but apps can help you navigate the landscape.\nStartup News is a useful news roundup app that isfree on iOS. It aggregates news about start-up topics like innovation, entrepreneurship, mergers, acquisitions and venture capital.\nThe app has a clear, readable interface and does a good job of combining images, headlines and introductory paragraphs. As well as aggregating relevant news on one page, the app organizes news articles under topics you\u2019re interested in. Tapping on an article shows you a little more of its content; you can visit the source website to read the full article.\nThe app has a broad range of sources so it\u2019s great for scanning up-to-the-minute headlines.\nThis is an iOS-only app, however, and while it\u2019s good for quickly reading news snippets, it may not be the best app for finding in-depth articles about start-ups.\nThere is anAndroid app with the same namethat does a similar job. It has many of the same features as the iOS Startup News app, including a bright and readable interface and many news sources.\nThis app does show a bit more news content, without requiring a visit to the article\u2019s website. It is also free and a good way to follow developments in the start-up community.\nEntrepreneur Daily is a start-up app worth downloading for two reasons. First, it has a magazinelike design and contains longer articles.\nThe app also includes inspiration, advice and ideas. So if you are actually participating in a start-up or eager to gain a deeper insight into start-ups, it could be more useful than a news aggregator app.\nThe app\u2019s clear interface highlights images and makes it easy to filter articles by date, topic or popularity and share them on social media.\nThe app is free oniOSandAndroid, but because news is not its focus, it may be best used with other start-up apps.\nTwitter soared in popularity because of SXSW. But it can seem daunting or even pointless if you\u2019ve never tried it.\nDon\u2019t be afraid. Twitter is easy to learn, and it\u2019s a great source of news on the start-up scene (including fresh news from events like SXSW).\nThe whole point of Twitter is to be a continuous \u201clive\u201d source of discussions, links to articles and ideas shared by its users. To use Twitter you set up a simple profile and search Twitter\u2019s database for topics or people to follow \u2014 be they journalists, venture capitalists or even leaders of start-up companies.\nTwitter is a great way to learn about news developments very early, sometimes ahead of any other sources. And one of the most interesting things about Twitter is how many influential people from the start-up community use it regularly.\nTwitter is free oniOS,AndroidandWindows 10.\nThe news aggregator app Flipboard is one of my favorite ways to follow a topic because its gesture-based interface makes it very easy to browse articles.\nThe app can pull together news on many topics, including a subject like start-ups, venture capital and entrepreneurship. Flipboard is free oniOSandAndroid.\nFinally, if you\u2019re a devoted LinkedIn user, the Pulse app may be an interesting source of start-up news.\nLike its rivals, Pulse collects news articles from many sources with a business-related theme. The app learns your preferences as you swipe right to save articles or left to indicate your disinterest.\nThe app isn\u2019t specifically about delivering start-up news to you, but it\u2019s an interesting way of speed-reading each day\u2019s business happenings, including start-up-related articles. It\u2019s free oniOSandAndroid, but you need a free LinkedIn account to make it work.\nThe innovative email app Spark has been popular on iPhones for a while, not least because of its clever Apple Watch integration. Now the app hasmade the leap to iPad, bringing its smart notifications, natural language search and other powers to the larger more businesslike screen of Apple\u2019s tablet. Spark is free."

        "title": "In the Apple Case, a Debate Over Data Hits Home",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Three years ago, reeling from Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosure of the government\u2019s vast surveillance programs and uncertain how to respond,President Obamasaid he welcomed a vigorous public debate about the wrenching trade-offs between safeguarding personal privacy and tracking down potential terrorists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy for our democracy,\u201d hetold reportersat the time. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign of maturity.\u201d\nBut the national debate touched off this winter by the confrontation between the Justice Department and Apple over smartphone security is not exactly the one Mr. Obama had in mind.\nMr. Snowden\u2019s revelations produced modest changes and a heightened suspicion of the government\u2019s activities in cyberspace. Because the issue now centers on a device most Americans carry in their pockets, it is concrete and personal in a way that surveillance by the National Security Agency never was.\nThe trade-offs seem particularly stark because they have been framed around a simple question: Should Apple help theF.B.I.hack into aniPhoneused by a gunman in the massacre last December in San Bernardino, Calif.?\nLaw enforcement officials have been adamant they must be able to monitor the communications of criminals. They received a vote of confidence from Mr. Obama on Friday, when he said the\u201cabsolutist\u201d positiontaken by companies like Apple is wrong. But the pushback has been enormous.\nIn the month since a judgeordered Appleto comply with the F.B.I., the debate has jumped from the tech blogs to the front pages of daily newspapers and nightly newscasts. Supporters of the company\u2019s position have held rallies nationwide. Late-night comedians have lampooned government snoopers. Timothy D. Cook, the usually publicity-shy Apple chief executive, pleaded his case on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last December. On Twitter, \u201c#encryption\u201d fills the screen with impassioned debate on both sides.\n\u201cDiscussing the case with my friends has become a touchy subject,\u201d said Matthew Montoya, 19, a computer science major at the University of Texas, El Paso. \u201cWe\u2019re a political bunch with views from all across the spectrum.\u201d\nLike many of her friends, Emi Kane, a community organizer in Oakland, Calif., recently found herself arguing via Facebook with a family friend about the case. Ms. Kane thought Apple was right to refuse to hack the phone; her friend, a waitress in Delaware, said she was disgusted by Apple\u2019s lack of patriotism.\nAfter exchanging several terse messages, they agreed to disagree. \u201cIt was a hard conversation,\u201d Ms. Kane said.\nThe novelist Russell Banks, who signed a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on behalf of Apple, said he had spoken with more than a dozen people about the case just in the last week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just people in the tech industry talking about this,\u201d Mr. Banks, the author of \u201cAffliction\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens like myself.\u201d\nThat may be because the Apple case involves a device whose least interesting feature is the phone itself. It is a minicomputer stuffed with every detail of a person\u2019s life: photos of children, credit card purchases, texts with spouses (and nonspouses), and records of physical movements.\nMr. Obama warned Friday against \u201cfetishizing our phones above every other value.\u201d After avoiding taking a position for months, he finally came down on the side of law enforcement, saying that using technology to prevent legal searches of smartphones was the equivalent of preventing the police from searching a house for evidence of child pornography.\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be the right answer,\u201d he said at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, even as he professed deep appreciation for civil liberties and predicted both sides would find a way to cooperate. \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve.\u201d\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nBut polls suggest the public is nowhere near as certain as Mr. Obama. In surveys, Americans are deeply divided about the legal struggle between the government and one of the nation\u2019s most iconic companies. The polls show that Americans remain anxious about both the threat of terrorist attacks and the possible theft of personal digital information.\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released last week found that 42 percent of Americans believed Apple should cooperate with law enforcement officials to help them gain access to the locked phone, while 47 percent said Apple should not cooperate. Asked to weigh the need to monitor terrorists against the threat of violating privacy rights, the country was almost equally split,the survey found.\nThat finding may have seemed unlikely in the wake of terrorist attacks last year in Paris and San Bernardino. In December, eight in 10 people said ina New York Times/CBS News surveythat it was somewhat or very likely that there would be a terrorist attack in the United States in the coming months. ACNN pollthe same month found that 45 percent of Americans were somewhat or very worried that they or someone in their family would become a victim of terrorism.\nBut despite the fears about terrorism, the public\u2019s concern about digital privacy is nearly universal. A Pew Research poll in 2014 found more than 90 percent of those surveyed felt that consumers had lost control over how their personal information was collected and used by companies.\nThe Apple case already seems to have garnered more public attention than the Snowden revelations about \u201cmetadata collection\u201d and programs with code names like Prism and XKeyscore. The comedian John Oliver once mocked average Americans for failing to know whetherMr. Snowden was the WikiLeaks guyor the former N.S.A. contractor (he was the latter).\nNow, people are beginning to understand that their smartphones are just the beginning. Smart televisions, Google cars, Nest thermostats and web-enabled Barbie dolls are next. The resolution of the legal fight between Apple and the government may help decide whether the information in those devices is really private, or whether the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. are entering a golden age of surveillance in which they have far more data available than they could have imagined 20 years ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an in-your-face proposition for lots more Americans than the Snowden revelation was,\u201d said Lee Rainie, director of Internet, science and technology research at Pew Research Center.\nCindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \u201cEveryone gets at a really visceral level that you have a lot of really personal stuff on this device and if it gets stolen it\u2019s really bad. They know that the same forces that work at trying to get access to sensitive stuff in the cloud are also at work attacking the phones.\u201d\nFor the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies, the fight has become a high-stakes struggle to prevent what James B. Comey, the bureau\u2019s director, calls \u201cwarrant-free zones\u201d where criminals can hide evidence out of reach of the authorities.\nOfficials had hoped the Apple case involving a terrorist\u2019s iPhone would rally the public behind what they see as the need to have some access to information on smartphones. But many in the administration have begun to suspect that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department may have made a major strategic error by pushing the case into the public consciousness.\nMany senior officials say an open conflict between Silicon Valley and Washington is exactly what they have been trying to avoid, especially when the Pentagon and intelligence agencies are trying to woo technology companies to come back into the government\u2019s fold, and join the fight against the Islamic State. But it appears it is too late to confine the discussion to the back rooms in Washington or Silicon Valley.\nThe fact that Apple is a major consumer company \u201ctakes the debate out of a very narrow environment \u2014 the universe of technologists and policy wonks \u2014 into the realm of consumers where barriers like the specific language of Washington or the technology industry begins to fall away,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a grass-roots activist network.\nThat organization and other activist groups like Black Lives Matter have seized on the issue as important for their members. In February the civil liberties group Fight for the Future organized the day of protest against the government order that resulted in rallies in cities nationwide.\n\u201cWhen we heard the news and made a call for nationwide rallies, one happened in San Francisco that same day,\u201d said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. \u201cThings like that almost never happen.\u201d\nMs. Cyril says the public angst about the iPhone case feels more urgent than did the discussion about government surveillance three years ago.\n\u201cThis is one of those moments that defines what\u2019s next,\u201d she said. \u201cWill technology companies protect the privacy of their users or will they do work for the U.S. government? You can\u2019t do both.\u201d"
