        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nImagine if you had opened a box of Cheerios this morning and found a note from General Mills: Pending legislation about genetically modified corn would make your favorite breakfast unavailable or unaffordable.\nThat would feel odd and unwelcome, right?\nThat is essentially what app companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart are doing in California. State residents who open those apps are seeingblaring bannersor are getting email blasts pushing the companies\u2019 position on a state employment law.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to want their customers to know about laws that might affect how they operate and to ask people to take action. But there\u2019s a pattern by young companies \u2014 Uber in particular \u2014 of taking the lobbying a step too far.\nThe simple act of being a customer now makes people a target for inescapable corporate advocacy.\nThis is happening because Uber, Lyft, Instacart and other companies that hire large numbers of contractors have been fightinga law passed in Californiathat would force them to reclassify at least one million workers in the state as employees.\nCalifornia\u2019s argument is that app-based companies like Uber dictate how their drivers or other workers do their job, and therefore workers should count as employees with minimum wages and similar protections.\nThe companies have said the law doesn\u2019t apply to them andfought it in court. They\u2019ve alsobacked a ballot measurefor California voters next month that would exempt the app companies from the new law. The ballot proposal, known asProposition 22, would create something ofa middle groundbetween the state law and the companies\u2019 status quo.\nThere are complicated questions that voters have to consider, including whether it\u2019s better to have more jobs with less of a safety net, or fewer but arguably better jobs. (The Washington Post hasa good explanation of the details on Proposition 22.)\nBut the companies are not going for complexity or subtlety. \u201cYour ride prices and wait times are likely to substantially increase,\u201dUber warned in its appin California. People have to click on the message before they can ask for an Uber ride. Lyft and Instacart aredoing similar bombardmentsto get customers to vote their way.\nAgain, it\u2019s not wrong or unusual for companies to try to sway people in business disputes or legal fights. Television viewers regularly see warnings on their screens about contract disputes that threaten to make their favorite channels go dark. Netflix, Wikipedia and other popular websites, whenfacing internet policy changes, posted warnings that were impossible to ignore.\nWhat these app companies are doing is both more invasive and a regular tactic rather than a rarity. Uber has done versions of lobbying through its appoverandoverandoveragainin many parts of the United States.\nThe in-app messaging will probably win Uber and its friends some votes. They can get the word out to millions of potential voters in ways that seasoned politicians would envy. But the corporate propaganda risks turning people off, too. We should be able to take a ride across town or eat a bowl of cereal without becoming a target for self-serving corporate propaganda.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nThis week, Apple willshow off new models of iPhonesand declare that it made the best smartphones in history. Amazon, Walmart and other companies willtempt you with fake shopping \u201cholidays\u201dto buy something because \u2026 it\u2019s fall, I guess? I don\u2019t know why.\nThe point of Apple\u2019s annual iPhone unveiling and Amazon\u2019s Prime Day is to generate a Pavlovian reaction to buy something \u2014 now! I get it. If your phone is held together with electrical tape or you\u2019ve been waiting for a good price on a new blender, this week might be useful.\nBut mostly, these events serve the companies\u2019 interest, not ours. We don\u2019t have to buy stuff on a company\u2019s time frame. (Today\u2019s newsletter is grumpy. Sorry. I\u2019m going to blame the rain at On Tech HQ.)\nPrime Day exists partly to lure people into Amazon\u2019s shopping club and reinforce the habit of turning to Amazon as our default shopping destination. There is now apredictable banalityabout Apple\u2019s overhyped Tupperware party for iPhones but it draws a lot of attention to Apple\u2019s phones.\nYes, fine. The New York Times will write about those new iPhones. And Wirecutter, the product review site that\u2019s part of The Times, has aguide to the good dealsand therubbish \u201cdeals\u201dfor Prime Day andWalmart\u2019s versionof the shopping event.\nBut here\u2019s a reminder to myself and you:Your phone is probably fine! And are you buying a blender because you want one, or because there\u2019s acountdown clock on Amazonwarning that you\u2019ll miss out on saving 50 cents if you don\u2019t get it now? We don\u2019t have to do this!\nThe digital gap for schools and students:A surge in orders for laptops used in remote schooling has left some schools and their students \u2014 particularly those in lower-income districts \u2014without enough computers to keep up with lessons, my colleague Kellen Browning writes. And even in colleges, some lower-income students have dropped out becausethey don\u2019t have reliable internet access or computers for remote instruction, reported Dan Levin for The Times.\nA one-two punch in a cyberconflict:An arm of the U.S. military and a group of companies that included Microsofttook action against a network of cybercriminalsthat officials feared could disrupt the presidential election, my colleagues David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth reported.\nUnderstanding people better through their apps:The tech publication Rest of World asked health care workers from China, Lebanon, Brazil and elsewhereabout their favorite apps and other smartphone habitsduring the pandemic. It\u2019s a fascinating snapshot of people\u2019s lives.\nThis is a sweet essay about how a family of raccoons in a New York park isthe one predictable thing in a very unpredictable year.

        "title": "Amazon and Google\u2019s True Advantage",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nMy colleagues wrote about theeye-popping sales numbers coming from America\u2019s technology superstars, including Google, Facebook and Amazon. Their sales and profits this year, in the middle of a pandemic, are truly hard to fathom. It\u2019s so much money, you guys.\nBut these companies alsospendgobs of money, which in turn helps them make more money.\nThe ability to spend like crazy \u2014 because Big Tech has money and hardly anyone questions how the companies spend it \u2014 is one of the secrets to why the tech industry giants are so difficult to unseat.\nA few examples: Amazon hired 250,000 full- and part-time employees \u2014 on average roughly 2,800each dayin the 90 days that ended in September \u2014 and then about 100,000 more people in October, the company said. Google has spent nearly $17 billion this year on things like hulking computer equipment \u2014 that\u2019s about the same as Exxon\u2019s comparable spending figure for digging oil and gas out of the ground.\nFacebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg talked excitedly on Thursday about spending whatever it takes on futuristic projects like eyeglasses that overlay virtual images with the real world. Imagine walking down the street and seeing a virtual list of menu items for the taco shop on the corner.\nSome of this stuff, yes, can immediately help companies generate more of those eye-popping sales and profits that my colleagues wrote about. When Amazon hires people to work in its warehouses or to drive trucks, those workers help push more packages to your door this Christmas.\nBut a lot of this stuff, honestly, who knows. What the heck is Apple cooking up in its research labs, on which it spent $19 billion in the last year? Can Facebook get us to buy into a future of our world mixed with virtual images? Are Amazon\u2019s gazillions of new package warehouses, transportation depots and computer centers really justified? This is the kind of stuff that might never pay off.\nAnd that\u2019s one reason Big Tech is so different. Few large companies get mostly patted on the back for spending money in ways that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 pay off.\nThis is part of the ultimate dilemma about these technology giants that dominate our lives and often our leisure and work hours. They make tons of money, which means they have more money to stay on top. (Also, governments and competitors say these companies break the rules to advantage themselves at the expense of rivals, hurting consumers like us.)\nOne of the most cringe-inducing words in business is \u201cmoat.\u201d What this means is a company has some unique advantage \u2014 a globally recognized brand name for Coca-Cola, or a unique technology that helps Uber move cars around efficiently \u2014 that gives it an unbreachable border of water filled with monsters.\nIt\u2019s a terrible, overused piece of jargon. But the tech superstars have a moat. (Imagine me cringing as I typed that.) Their unique advantage is access to giant piles of money. And they\u2019re using it to dig that watery trench of monsters even deeper.\nSEND US YOUR QUESTIONS:We want to hear your election tech questions.

That means Black Friday and other preholiday sales have already started. The problem is, a lot of times when websites scream DEAL it\u2019snot actually a good deal.\nNathan Burrowfrom The New York Times\u2019s product review website, Wirecutter, has these tips to make sure we\u2019re not getting fooled by something that promises a discount but is a bad buy:\nComparison shop: The hot item that the website says you can\u2019t find for less anywhere else? Yeah, you probably can. Type the name of the product into a shopping search in your web browser. (If you\u2019re considering a \u201cflash\u201d sale online, first add the item to your shopping cart. Often you have up to 15 minutes to check out, enough time to check on the price.)\nRead the reviews: Customer reviewsaren\u2019t always reliable. So read up on a product that intrigues you from multiple publications \u2014may I suggest Wirecutter? This isn\u2019t a guarantee that you\u2019re getting a good price, but it will help you avoid getting excited by a sale and buying a junk product.\nUse (free!) shopping tools:Websites likeCamelCamelCamel.comorKeepawill give you a useful, albeit imperfect, idea of how much a given item has sold for on Amazon over time. That\u2019s a good indication of whether you\u2019re getting a good deal right now, or can wait.\nEven when you\u2019re not shopping on Amazon, you can check whether the retailer\u2019s price is a good deal by comparing it to how much the same product tends to sell for on Amazon.\nHave an informed plan:Don\u2019t believe the hype, be patient and know that there are good discounts to be found. You may just need to cut through the noise to find them.\nHe\u2019s a star on Facebook. He\u2019s not sure why:My colleague Kevin Roose talked to Dan Bongino, the right-wing commentator who said he can\u2019t really explain why he went from a B-list pundit toone of the most popular figures on Facebook. Kevin writes that it\u2019s both charming and terrifying that people like Bongino get big on Facebook, YouTube and TikTok because their \u201cpersonas happen to fit into the grooves of a platform\u2019s algorithm.\u201d\nListen to this to understand the antitrust case against Big Tech:Lina Khan helped reshape the legal views on how antitrust laws apply to big technology companies. On my colleague Kara Swisher\u2019s podcast, \u201cSway,\u201d Khan had aclear explanation of how she believed big technology companies hurt all of us, and she gave a glimpse inside Congress\u2019s recent investigation into Big Tech power.\nSigh. Math problems by emoji is not a good solution:Bloomberg Newswritesabout teachers in the Philippines improvising remote classes with printed handouts and lessons over Facebook Messenger, because a majority of the country\u2019s households have limited internet access. One teacher started texting her students a daily math problem using emojis in place of numbers.\nThe best moment of my week was readingthis articleabout people who are obsessed with the $300 12-foot Halloween skeleton sold by Home Depot.

        "title": "House Lawmakers Condemn Big Tech\u2019s \u2018Monopoly Power\u2019 and Urge Their Breakups",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House lawmakers who spent the last 16 monthsinvestigating the practices of the world\u2019s largest technology companiessaid on Tuesday that Amazon, Apple, Facebook andGooglehad exercised and abused their monopoly power and called for the most sweeping changes to antitrust laws in half a century.\nIn a 449-page report that was presented by the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic leadership, lawmakers said the four companies had turned from \u201cscrappy\u201d start-ups into \u201cthe kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.\u201d The lawmakers said the companies had abused their dominant positions, setting and often dictating prices and rules for commerce, search, advertising, social networking and publishing.\nTo amend the inequities, the lawmakers recommended restoring competition by effectively breaking up the companies, emboldening the agencies that police market concentration and throwing up hurdles for the companies to acquire start-ups. They also proposed reforming antitrust laws, in the biggest potential shift since the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 created stronger reviews of big mergers.\n\u201cOur investigation leaves no doubt that there is a clear and compelling need for Congress and the antitrust enforcement agencies to take action that restores competition, improves innovation and safeguards our democracy,\u201d Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and chairman of the judiciary committee, andDavid Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, said in a joint statement.\nThe House report is the most significant government effort to check the world\u2019s largest tech companies since the government sued Microsoft for antitrust violations in the 1990s. It offers lawmakers a deeply researched road map for turning criticism of Silicon Valley\u2019s influence into concrete actions.\nThe report is also expected to kick off other actions against the tech giants. The Justice Department has been working tofile an antitrust complaint against Google, followed by separate suits against the search giant from state attorneys general. Antitrust investigations of Amazon, Apple and Facebook are also underway at the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and four dozen state attorneys general.\nBut the House antitrust subcommitteesplit along party lineson how to remedy and corral the power of the tech companies, pointing to an uphill battle for Congress to curtail them.\nDemocrats proposed legal changes that could substantially restructure Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. They said Congress should consider making it illegal for the tech giants to provide preferential treatment to their own products, as Google does in search results. They suggested breaking up the companies in \u201cstructural separations\u201d and forbidding them from operating in similar businesses to those they were already dominant in. They also recommended adding to antitrust laws, including clearer rules that could block the tech giants\u2019 attempts to buy other companies.\nSome Republicans agreed with proposals to bolster funding for antitrust enforcement agencies, but balked at calls for Congress to intervene in restructuring the companies and their business models. Others have refused to endorse any of the Democrats\u2019 findings.\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the committee, said that the report was \u201cpartisan\u201d and that the committee had not tackled conservatives\u2019 anecdotal allegations that the online platforms were biased against their views. In a letter to Mr. Nadler, Mr. Jordan said that ignoring the topic \u201cultimately discredits the draft report\u2019s findings.\u201d\nRep. Ken Buck, a Republican of Colorado, joined three other Republican lawmakers in releasing a separate report in recent days \u2014 titled \u201cThe Third Way\u201d \u2014 outlining their mixed reception of the Democrats\u2019 proposals.\n\u201cI agree with about 330 pages of the majority\u2019s report,\u201d Mr. Buck said. But he said he could not agree with recommendations to embolden consumer lawsuits and the breakup of companies, calling them \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d\nThe House Judiciary Committee began its investigation into the four tech giants in June 2019, interviewing hundreds of rivals and business clients of the platforms. In July, the tech chief executives \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2014testified in a hearingto defend their companies.\nThe four companies, which have a combined market value of more than $5 trillion, largely operate in different digital businesses. But the report revealed monopoly abuses across them.\nAmazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had roles as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d in common and controlled prices and the distribution of goods and services, the report said. That made third-party businesses \u2014 like app developers on Apple\u2019s App Store and sellers on Amazon\u2019s marketplace \u2014 beholden to the companies\u2019 demands, the report said. The word monopoly appeared in the report nearly 120 times.\n\u201cWith no restrictions of tech companies to own and compete on their own platforms, which are the only options for so many small businesses, it takes away any real sense of competition,\u201d saidRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat of Washington, who has been a vocal critic of Amazon.\nEven without full bipartisan support, the report sets important groundwork, said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department. He said thebreakup of AT&Tin the 1980s was supported by policies set forth by Congress. Tuesday\u2019s report, he said, was \u201cthe foundation for legislation and regulation that enables antitrust cases against Google, Facebook and others to actually break markets open to more competition.\u201d\nGoogle disputed the findings and said its free service had been a boon to consumers. \u201cGoogle\u2019s free products like Search, Maps and Gmail help millions of Americans,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cand we\u2019ve invested billions of dollars in research and development to build and improve them. We compete fairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry.\u201d\nAmazon said the committee\u2019s recommendations could end up harming small businesses and consumers.\n\u201cThe flawed thinking would have the primary effect of forcing millions of independent retailers out of online stores, thereby depriving these small businesses of one of the fastest and most profitable ways available to reach customers,\u201d Amazonsaid in a blog post. \u201cFar from enhancing competition, these uninformed notions would instead reduce it.\u201d\nApple \u201cvehemently disagrees with the conclusions in this staff report,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe App Store has enabled new markets, new services and new products that were unimaginable a dozen years ago, and developers have been primary beneficiaries of this ecosystem,\u201d the company said.\nFacebook disagreed that its mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp were anticompetitive. \u201cWe compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAcquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people.\u201d\nThe report devoted most attention to Google and Amazon, then Apple and Facebook, based on the number of pages devoted to them.\nGoogle holds a monopoly in search and search advertising, the report said. The company used anti-competitive tactics, such as adding information without permission from third-party providers like Yelp, to improve the quality of features within its search results, lawmakers added.\nAmazon\u2019s market power was spread across several industries, the report found. The committee focused on the company\u2019s conduct in online commerce, where it sells products that compete with independent merchants who use its platform. The report said Amazon promoted its own smart-home products ahead of those of other makers, and alsodealt unfairly with open source software developersin its cloud computing business.\nIn total, about 2.3 millionthird-party sellers do business on the Amazon marketplaceworldwide, the report said, and 37 percent of them relied on the site as their sole source of income \u2014 essentially making them hostage to Amazon\u2019s shifting tactics.\nThe lawmakers also concluded that Apple had a monopoly on the apps marketplace for iPhones and iPads, forcing all developers to go through it to reach users of those devices. That setup has enabled Apple to takea 30 percent cutof many apps\u2019 sales. That fee, the subcommittee found, has led to higher prices for consumers.\nFacebook\u2019s monopoly power over social networking was also \u201cfirmly entrenched,\u201d the report said. The company had taken steps, like acquiring new competitors or copying their features, to maintain that power, the lawmakers found. In particular, they said, after Facebook acquired the photo-sharing site Instagram in 2012, the social network\u2019s executives had gone to great lengths to stop the service from overtaking its main product.\n\u201cIt was collusion, but within an internal monopoly,\u201d a former high-level Instagram employee told the committee during its investigation. \u201cIf you own two social media utilities, they should not be allowed to shore each other up. It\u2019s unclear to me why this should not be illegal.\u201d\nReporting was contributed by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Mike Isaac, Jack Nicas and Steve Lohr."

        "title": "Will Luxury Smartwatches Succeed?",
        "fulltext": "In 2015, TAG Heuer introduced the Connected, the Swiss watch industry\u2019sfirst luxury smartwatch.\nFive years later, the category it defined \u2014 and that now includes offerings from the likes of Montblanc and Hublot \u2014 has yet to really take off. But brands are still rolling out new models and predicting success.\nSales of wearable technology have grown this year, at least partly driven by consumers\u2019 interest in devices with health applications. TheApple Watch Series 6 sensor and app, for example, measures blood oxygenation,a possible indicator of coronavirusinfection.\nAccording to a reportpublished in September by the market research company International Data Corporation, the global market for wearables, which includes wristbands, watches, in-ear devices and the like, will grow by 14.5 percent this year, shipping a total of almost 400 million products. The report forecasts that the watch category will total 91.4 million units, rising to 156 million by 2024.\nSwiss smartwatch manufacturers hope their high-end models, priced at $1,000 and up, will help protect brand profitability. But there\u2019s a long way to go. Even TAG Heuer\u2019s sales have been far from earth-shattering.\n\u201cOver the last five years, we have sold between 100,000 and 150,000,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault,TAG Heuer\u2019s new chief executive, referring to the Connected. (The third-generation Connected, which runs Google\u2019s Wear OS operating system and retails from $1,800, was introduced in March.)\nVontobel, the Swiss private bank, estimates that TAG Heuer produced 600,000 watches in 2019 \u2014 which would mean that the Connected accounts for about 5 percent of the company\u2019s annual sales by volume.\nPrice is clearly a big factor in the luxury smartwatch sector\u2019s performance, especially now thatluxury sales have plungedsince the spread of the coronavirus.\nThe new Apple Watch SE, a lower-end model than the Series 6, retails from $279, and Samsung\u2019s top-end Galaxy Watch 3 starts at $399.\nIn contrast, Hublot\u2019s Big Bang e smartwatch costs $5,200, even though it uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor found in Fossil watches that cost a few hundred dollars (and in TAG Heuer\u2019s Connected). \u201cWe will sell around 5,000 pieces a year,\u201d said Ricardo Guadalupe, the company\u2019s chief executive.\nFor many outside the industry, it is no surprise that there are not more luxury smartwatches.\n\u201cTrue luxury objects should be free from obsolescence,\u201d said the Swiss-based designer Ini Archibong, who last yearworked with H\u00e8rmeson the Galop d\u2019Herm\u00e8s watch, which is not a smartwatch. \u201cTheir intrinsic value should come from something beyond their use value.\u201d\nA relatively short operating life is not the only threat: Switzerland still lacks the skill base to develop its own technologies. So even though some brands are owned by large, well-financed groups \u2014 TAG Heuer, Hublot and Louis Vuitton by LVMH; Montblanc by Richemont; Tissot by Swatch Group; Frederique Constant by Citizen \u2014 most rely on third parties such as Google and Qualcomm for hardware and software.\nSome, however, have developed proprietary applications in a bid to add value and desirability: TAG Heuer\u2019s sports and golf applications, for example, were developed by the Paris-based TAG Heuer Connected Team, a group that was acquired by the brand for an undisclosed sum in 2018.\nRetailers have also not lost faith. \u201cWe have been running waiting lists on the TAG Heuer Connected since launch\u201d of the third iteration in the spring, said Brian Duffy, chief executive of the Watches of Switzerland Group, which operates more than 130 showrooms in Britain and the United States.\nPeter Stas, co-founder of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9riqueConstant and the Geneva-based technology company MMT, went even further. He said it was essential for Swiss brands to develop smartwatches and that many entry-level names were struggling because they lacked them. \u201cSwatch Group always said they would never touch smartwatches, and now they\u2019ve come with the new T-Touch,\u201d he said \u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019ve seen the light.\u201d\nHe was referring to the Tissot T-Touch Connect Solar, a solar-powered touch-screen watch introduced in August and the Swatch Group\u2019s first rival to the Apple Watch.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s an opportunity to generate additional sales,\u201d said Sylvain Dolla, Tissot\u2019s chief executive, noting that the watch had been in development for four years at a cost of 35 million Swiss francs (about $38 million). \u201cTissot is the world leader in Swiss watches in the $500 to $1,000 segment. We don\u2019t really need this, but it\u2019s a good opportunity to generate new clients.\u201d\nTissot may need it. According to Vontobel\u2019s estimates, the brand\u2019s annual revenues fell below the one billion Swiss franc mark in 2019, dropping by 60 million Swiss francs year-over-year. But the watch, priced at $1,050, is not going to be available in the United States until next summer.\nThe luxury smartwatch sector has based some of its hopes on an understanding of human nature. As Richard Whitehall, a partner at Smart Design, a strategic design company based in New York, put it, \u201cThere are still going to be watch aficionados who want to use tech in a way that\u2019s going to help them show off.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s our obsession with sports. This month, Hublot announced the Big Bang e UEFA Champions League smartwatch, produced in partnership with world football\u2019s most-watched club competition, and a follow-up to itsBig Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia watch. The new watch has a dedicated application that sends updates on the competition\u2019s scores and matches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a competitor of Apple and I don\u2019t want to produce 50,000 smartwatches, because this will dilute our image of luxury,\u201d Mr. Guadalupe said. \u201cMy watch is very exclusive and very rare, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s successful.\u201d (The World Cup watch, a 2,018-piece limited edition, sold out in two months.)\nMontblanc, which has just released the third iteration of its smartwatch, the $1,170 Summit 2+, is taking a different approach.\n\u201cThere are people who want functionality but not the look and feel of a gadget,\u201d said Zaim Kamal, the company\u2019s creative director. \u201cWe wanted to bring across something that would feel like a mechanical watch.\u201d The Summit 2+ has dials that mimic the design of Montblanc\u2019s 1858 line, as well as a case, crown and pushers that are engineered to feel like those on a mechanical watch.\nIn the past, the marriage of luxury and consumer electronics has delivered mixed results. TAG Heuer\u2019sMeridiist phoneflopped, and Vertu, the one-time Nokia subsidiary, lives on as a cautionary tale.\n\u201cWe have these examples in mind,\u201d Mr. Arnault of TAG Heuer said. \u201cThe big mistakes of these phones was to just invest in diamonds on the phone and sell them four times more expensive.\u201d\nMr. Dolla of Tissot has his own approach. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fall into the risk of becoming a consumer electronic brand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe T-Touch Connect Solar is a fine watch, not a consumer electronic device meant to last two years.\u201d"

        "title": "The Wristwatch at 100",
        "fulltext": "Oh, how times have changed!\nWhen wristwatches \u2014 or \u201cwristlets\u201d as they were then known \u2014 came into vogue in the second half of the 19th century, they were delicate, bejeweled and wildly inaccurate status symbols for well-to-do women who rarely needed to know the time. The only masculine choice was a pocket watch.\nBeginning around 1920, however, soldiers returning from World War I popularized the style of wearing a watch strapped to a wrist. Many had learned its utility in a trench, where using a pocket watch was both clumsy and dangerous.\n\u201cWearing a wristwatch became a sign of manliness that other men began to emulate over time,\u201d said Aja Raden, the author of \u201cStoned: Jewelry, Obsession, and How Desire Shapes the World.\u201d \u201cTo the point that everyone forgot they started with women.\u201d\nIn her 2015 book, Ms. Raden maintains that the story of the first wristwatch \u2014 a gold bangle bracelet centered on a functioning clock that Patek Philippe made for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary in 1868 \u2014 is the story of modernity.\nA woman\u2019s desire for \u201ca strange, expensive bracelet,\u201d Ms. Raden said, led to the trench watch, which, in turn, spawned the entire wristwatch category, heralding nothing short of universal, synchronized time. (It also generated the never-ending debate about who actually made the first men\u2019s version: Girard-Perregaux in 1880 for the German Imperial Navy or Cartier in 1904 for the Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont.)\n\u201cWhen everyone had a wristwatch and they were affordable and you didn\u2019t need an institution, like the church or factory, to tell you what you were doing, the world changed enormously,\u201d Ms. Raden said.\nTo understand how those changes affected the way we value and understand timekeeping, we asked more than a dozen experts to identify the milestones and developments of the past 100 years of wristwatch history.\nTheir views diverged based on their personal interests, from precision to pop culture, but all agreed on one essential point: \u201cYou look at some watches and you don\u2019t really care what time it is,\u201d said Nicholas Manousos, executive director of the Horological Society of New York. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a beautiful piece of mechanical art.\u201d\nToday, wristwatches are very loosely categorized based on one question: dressy or sporty? At the start of the 20th century, however, that distinction didn\u2019t exist. Most timepieces were pocket watches \u2014 dress styles, by definition.\nThat changed in 1926 with the debut of the Rolex Oyster, the world\u2019s first water-resistant watch, which the company founder Hans Wilsdorf promoted the following year in a marketing stunt starring the English swimmer Mercedes Gleitze.\n\u201cThere is arguably no more important innovation,\u201d said Stephen Pulvirent, managing editor of the online watch platform Hodinkee. \u201cIt made watches everyday objects.\u201d\nBy employing a screwed-down crown, Rolex created whatit described in adsat the time as a hermetically sealed case that could withstand \u201cchanges of climate, dust, water, damp, heat, moisture, cold, sand or grease.\u201d\nIn 1931, the Geneva-based company followed up on the Oyster case with the Perpetual movement, the world\u2019s first self-winding mechanism with a rotor that spun 360 degrees. The combination of the automatic movement and water-resistant housing has served as a blueprint for virtually every sport model introduced since then.\nIt took until the dawn of the postwar leisure lifestyle, however, for the sport watch to find its footing. Before that, \u201cthe upper class didn\u2019t play sports, because it would mean getting tanned \u2014 to be pale was elegant,\u201d said Aurel Bacs, the celebrated auctioneer whose Bacs and Russo consultancy runs the watch department at Phillips. \u201cThen, people realized that the ultimate recreational activity after the war became sport, and you needed a watch that would be sporty and upper class.\u201d\nNo model epitomizes that combination better than the 1972 Royal Oak by Audemars Piguet, the first luxury watch to be encased in steel. Althoughit was initially mocked, the watch \u2014 and its much-copied integrated bracelet \u2014 has become part of the segment\u2019s foundation, as has its creator, the Swiss designer Gerald C. Genta. (Mr. Genta\u2019s equally sporty follow-up to the Royal Oak, the 1976 Patek Philippe Nautilus, is, arguably, the world\u2019s most coveted watch model today, withwaiting lists for some versions said to be as long as eight years.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the impact of Genta\u2019s design language on contemporary watches,\u201d Mr. Pulvirent said. \u201cTalk to any retailer about what sells: stainless steel watches between 42 and 44 millimeters, on a bracelet, with a chronograph and a date window. People want medium to large sport watches that are easier to read and they can wear with everything.\nOnce the sport watch category was established, a few makers, again led by Rolex, began to produce more robust models to aid in rugged outdoor activities like aviation, deep-sea diving, mountain climbing and scientific exploration. Broadly described as tool watches (a modern term of apocryphal origin), they included features such as chronographs, rotating bezels to allow the wearer to read elapsed time and luminescence to increase nighttime legibility.\n\u201cThe rotating bezel was pivotal,\u201d said Paul Boutros, head of watches for Phillips in the Americas.\nEarly examples showcasing the game-changing element were the 1953 Rolex Submariner, the first dive watch waterproof to 100 meters (330 feet) and the 1955 Rolex GMT-Master, one of the first watches with the ability to display the time in any two time zones, aimed at an emerging customer demographic: jet-setting business travelers.\nOver the decades, the tool watch category gradually came to dominate the wider sport segment by appealing to buyers\u2019 aspirational impulses. A testament to the enduring fascination for wristwatches geared to professionals is the number of midcentury models still in production, including the 1952 Breitling Navitimer, a navigational timer for pilots; the 1953 Rolex Explorer, inspired by Sir Edmund Hillary\u2019s and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s historic ascent of Mt. Everest; the 1953 Blancpain Fifty Fathoms, a dive watch developed for an elite squad of French underwater commandos; the 1955 IWC Ing\u00e9nieur, designed explicitly for engineers; and the 1957 Omega Speedmaster, a chronograph that many consider to be the ultimate tool watch because, in 1969,it accompanied the astronaut Buzz Aldrinto the moon.\nBut does a tool watch still serve a purpose in the digital era, when even personal devices have access to a broad array of information and applications.\n\u201cHillary was using his watch to time how much oxygen he had in his tank so he wouldn\u2019t die,\u201d said Geoffrey Hess, international watch specialist at Phillips and organizer of the annual Rolliefest gathering of Rolex collectors. \u201cNo climber would need that today, but he\u2019d still buy it. You buy it for the history.\u201d\nOn Jan. 3, 1957, the American watchmaker Hamilton welcomed journalists to the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City to announce the Electric 500, the world\u2019s first battery-powered watch. It was the opening salvo in a war that would ultimately reshape the watchmaking industry.\nIn the 1989 book \u201cThe Watch of the Future: The Story of The Hamilton Electric Watch,\u201d the watchmaker Ren\u00e9 Rondeau recounted the company\u2019s quest for precision in an era of jet-age optimism. But the Hamilton Electric\u2019s prominence was short-lived. In 1960, the watchmaker\u2019s main American rival, Bulova, introduced the Accutron, the first watch to employ a tuning fork as its regulating organ, replacing what in mechanical timepieces is known as the balance wheel or pendulum.\n\u201cIt was a space race,\u201d Mr. Manousos said. \u201cWe could see the trend was going toward wristwatches that used electricity. It wasn\u2019t just a marketing gimmick; it was a real effort to make the wristwatch more precise.\u201d\nIn 1969, the Japanese watchmaker Seiko settled the debate with the debut of the Astron, the first quartz-powered watch. Not only did the new technology out perform Hamilton\u2019s and Bulova\u2019s achievements, but it also set the stage for a crisis that put nearly 60,000 Swiss watchmakers out of business.\n\u201cOvernight, the perception of a mechanical wristwatch was that it was fragile, not particularly precise, very expensive and very complicated to repair,\u201d Mr. Manousos said. \u201cEveryone rushed to quartz technology.\u201d\nThe advent of cheap, accurate, Japanese-made quartz wristwatches augured a dark decade for the Swiss \u2014 not to mention the Americans, whose watchmaking industry was already on shaky ground following World War II. In 1969, Hamilton manufactured its last watch in Lancaster, Pa., marking the last time any company made a watch from start to finish in the United States, Mr. Manousos said.\nAt the height of the quartz crisis, the British watchmaker George Daniels introduced a mechanism called the coaxial escapement, which helped improve timekeeping performance by eliminating the need for oil. Hailed as the first major technical advancement in escapement technology in 250 years, the invention was acquired by Omega\u2019s parent company, the Swatch Group, in 1993, and used for the first time in 1999. It now is central to the brand\u2019s vast range of chronometers.\nThe coaxial escapement, however, is not why Mr. Daniels appears on this list.\n\u201cBefore Daniels, the wristwatch was a utilitarian thing \u2014 maybe you had a nice one in a fancy gold case, but there weren\u2019t a lot of collectors,\u201d Mr. Manousos said. \u201cWhat he did was prove that the mechanical watch can be considered an art form.\u201d\nIn 1985, the watchmakers Svend Andersen and Vincent Calabrese no doubt had Mr. Daniels\u2019 pioneering work in mind when they founded the Acad\u00e9mie Horlog\u00e8re des Cr\u00e9ateurs Ind\u00e9pendants, a nonprofit organization based in Zurich, Switzerland, and dedicated to perpetuating the art of independent watch- and clockmaking.\nThe community they nurtured has grown to include some of the greatest names in contemporary watchmaking, including Franck Muller,Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Journe, Vianney Halter,Philippe Dufour, Felix Baumgartner andMaximilian B\u00fcsser.\n\u201cThese watchmakers have shown that you don\u2019t have to have a workshop with 500 workers to make watches or make a living,\u201d Mr. Bacs said. \u201cThe academy made it clear to every graduate: If you are alone and you have talent, you can do it.\u201d\nSince the late 1990s, the success of the academy\u2019s vision has remade the industry, allowing independent, personality-driven brands \u2014 such as Akrivia, founded in 2012 by the latest horological wunderkind,Rexhep Rexhepi\u2014 to compete with those owned by deep-pocket luxury groups.\n\u201cThis group of watchmakers learned something from the art world,\u201d Mr. Pulvirent said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need millions of customers. You need 20 people who buy everything.\u201d\nThe 1980s get a bad rap in the Swiss watch industry. \u201cThey\u2019re really the Middle Ages for us,\u201d said Mr. B\u00fcsser, founder of the Geneva-based independent brand MB&F. \u201cIt was the era of darkness because nobody had any idea of what to do.\u201d\nWell, almost nobody. In 1983, Nicolas G. Hayek, a Swiss businessman born in Lebanon, orchestrated the merger of two financially troubled Swiss watch conglomerates to form SMH (Societ\u00e9 Suisse de Micro\u00e9lectronique et d\u2019Horlogerie), known as the Swatch Group. By consolidating a number of parts suppliers and movement makers, Mr. Hayek ensured not only their survival, but also the survival of the mechanical know-how in which they specialized.\n\u201cIf they were left to fend for themselves, so many would have died,\u201d Mr. Boutros said.\nThat same year, Mr. Hayek famously presided over the debut of the Swatch Watch, a plastic Swiss-made quartz timepiece available in a range of styles and colors, designed to beat the Japanese at their own game.\n\u201cWith a cheap quartz watch that cost 50 or 60 francs at the time, they were able to save the whole Swiss watchmaking industry,\u201d said Pascal Ravessoud, director of external affairs and watchmaking expert at the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva.\nFor all of Mr. Hayek\u2019s success in industrializing the Swiss industry \u2014 creating economies of scale, centralizing production and introducing large-scale automation \u2014 his true legacy may be the impact Swatch had on the nascent category of wristwatch collecting.\n\u201cWhen I see F.P. Journe collectors buy one watch in every color, for fun I ask them, \u2018Were you a Swatch collector?\u2019\u201d said John Reardon, a Patek Philippe expertwho owns the resale site Collectability. \u201cThe answer is always \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\nThe gradual introduction of computer-aided design, or CAD, into the watch industry, beginning around 1985, is often seen as a demarcation between vintage and modern timepieces.\n\u201cIt revolutionized the whole process because all of a sudden you could modify a design very quickly rather than having someone redo a 2-D drawing,\u201d Oliver R. M\u00fcller, founder of LuxeConsult in Aubonne, Switzerland, wrote in an email. \u201cIt allowed for shorter times to market and for more frequent and more numerous novelties.\u201d\nThe Swatch Group, under Mr. Hayek\u2019s leadership, is often cited as the driving force behind the industry\u2019s leap from a cottage trade to an industrial powerhouse. But the high end was embracing technology, too. Patek Philippe used a combination of hand techniques, CAD and CNC (computer numerical control) machinery to develop its Calibre 89, a pocket watch often cited as the poster child of the mechanical watchmaking renaissance taking root in the late 1980s.\nSome argue that what the industry gained in productivity and outputas a result of CAD, it lost in that ineffable quality often described as soul.\n\u201cWatches conceived before 1985 don\u2019t look the same,\u201d Mr. Ravessoud said.\nPerhaps not. But to an industry hungry to recapture its former glory, the promise of faster, cheaper supply was impossible to resist.\n\u201cIn the past, it was a human drawing the design, and the watchmaker would make it work,\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \u201cNow it begins with the movement, and the design follows. It\u2019s not about beauty, it\u2019s about making a watch to sell.\u201d\nFor all of its innovations, the 20th century is sometimes viewed by horologists as bereft of anything truly new in the way of complications, the term for any function on a watch that does more than indicate the time.\n\u201cNobody gave a damn about creating beautiful watchmaking; it was all about creating the cheapest, most reliable tool to give time,\u201d Mr. B\u00fcsser said.\nComplicated wristwatches \u2014 including Patek Philippe\u2019s now-grail-like Ref. 1518, the world\u2019s first serially produced perpetual calendar chronograph wristwatch (made from 1941 to 1954) \u2014 represented a sliver of the marketplace until 1986, when Audemars Piguet made 382 examples of its Ref. 25643BA, the first serially produced wristwatch featuring a tourbillon. French for \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d the tourbillon is a rotational device patented by the French watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1801 to counteract the effects of gravity on the gears of a mechanical watch. It has since become a mark \u2014 some might argue clich\u00e9 \u2014 of the horological elite.\n\u201cYou can do a tourbillon?\u201d Mr. Bacs said. \u201c\u2018We can do a tourbillon with a perpetual calendar.\u2019 \u2018We can dofour balance wheels(thank you, Roger Dubuis).\u2019 \u2018We can do an \u2018inclined tourbillon,\u2019 \u2018a multiaxis tourbillon\u2019 and on and on.\u201d\nThe tourbillon may be the showiest of watchmaking complications, but it\u2019s just one of six \u2014 including the moonphase calendar, perpetual calendar, split-second chronograph,minute repeaterand ultraslim model \u2014 now recognized as the building blocks of high horology.\n\u201cThe 21st century has seemingly been about all complications,\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the recycling bin of the brilliance of the past. Mechanically, almost everything has been done before.\u201d\nThroughout the 20th century, horology collectors focused on pocket watches and clocks. The Art of Patek Philippe sale in April 1989, by the auctioneer Antiquorum, was the turning point for wristwatches.\nConceived by the Antiquorum co-founder Osvaldo Patrizzi and held in cooperation with the Stern family, which has owned Patek Philippe since 1932, the thematic sale coincided with the watch company\u2019s 150th anniversary. In advance of the auction, the chief attraction, the Calibre 89 commemorative pocket watch, went on a global tour, including a stop in New York, where Tiffany & Co. hosted an event with great fanfare.\n\u201cI remember seeing ads saying \u2018Calibre 89 is coming,\u2019\u201d Mr. Boutros said. \u201cIt got so much press. The year prior, Rolex introduced its first self-winding chronograph, the new Daytona, and those two milestones, the 1988 Daytona and the Calibre 89 sale, really helped fuel the growth of wristwatch collecting.\u201d\nBy all accounts, the sale had an almost immediate impact on the watchmaker\u2019s bottom line.\nBefore the auction, \u201cPatek Philippe produced only 9,000 watches per year,\u201d Arnaud Tellier, director of the Asia-Pacific region for Antiquorum and a former curator of the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva, wrote in an email. \u201cIn the wake of the auction, the manufacture increased its production to 14,000 watches per year and continued to expand its output.\u201d\nIn step with these high-profile developments, watchmakers were beginning to incorporate subtle design changes to emphasize elements that might be of interest to collectors, such as transparent casebacks offering glimpses of the gears and bridges of a mechanical movement, as in Patek Philippe Ref. 3941, a perpetual calendar introduced in 1985.\n\u201cTo me, that marks the moment where the whole modern watch economy is born, or galvanized,\u201d Mr. Pulvirent said. \u201cAny watch lover who has ever shown a nonwatch lover the back of a Patek or Audemars Piguet will know. People are blown away.\u201d\nThe renaissance in independent watchmaking that began with Mr. Daniels reached its zenith around the early 2000s, when daring makers such asRichard Milleand Ulysse Nardin began creating bold, experimental timepieces that challenged conventional watchmaking wisdom.\nThese were the boom years in mechanical watchmaking, and scores of big and small brands eager for a piece of the action followed suit, designing flamboyant models for status-seeking buyers.\nThen came the 2008 financial crisis.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the music stopped and nobody knows what to do with all these watches,\u201d said William Rohr, former managing director of the online watch forum TimeZone and founder of Massena LAB, which designs and develops timepieces with a broad range of watchmakers. \u201cBut the Chinese started buying like crazy.\u201d\nThe torrent of traditional round watches that began to stream out of Swiss factories around 2010 reflected both Chinese demand for timepieces with clearly defined historical bearings and a renewed interest in heritage designs among a new generation of American and European buyers looking for understated, enduring classics.\nAround the same time, interest in historic yet affordable vintage timepieces signaled the emergence of a parallel market of pre-owned timepieces.\n\u201cYou have a new generation of buyers propelled by bloggers, who are discussing and promoting vintage watches because they can afford them and they\u2019re the watches their parents wore,\u201d Mr. Rohr said. \u201cAnd then you arrive in 2010 when everybody is talking about money and value, and people look at vintage and say, \u2018Ten years ago this watch was worthless and now look at what it\u2019s worth.\u2019\u201d\nEven though Rolex and Patek Philippe have never explicitly promoted their models as investments, their advertising subtly makes the point. Just look to Patek Philippe\u2019s seminal Generations campaign,introduced in 1996and still going: \u201cYou never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.\u201d\nWhen Apple introduced its first smartwatch in 2014, there was no shortage of news articles questioning the future of mechanical watchmaking. And in 2019, when the Apple Watchoutsold the entire Swiss watch industryin units, pundits issued more dire predictions.\nWhat many failed to recognize is that 2019 also markedthe Swiss industry\u2019s high point: Exports rose 2.4 percent over the preceding year, to reach a record $22.2 billion (2020 is, of course, another story).\nAlthough the Apple Watch competes with mechanical watches for wrist space, many people in the industry say the two are compatible.\n\u201cApple is educating the broader populace about watch fundamentals, and that\u2019s a great thing for the mechanical watch industry,\u201d Mr. Pulvirent said.\nDie-hard analog lovers also point out that, unlike smartwatches, mechanical timepieces can run in perpetuity.\n\u201cMechanical watches are eternal, whereas the Apple Watch \u2014 I got one for my birthday 10 days ago, my fourth \u2014 will become obsolete,\u201d Jean-Claude Biver, a longtime industry executive and most recently chief executive of TAG Heuer, said in late September. \u201cBut a Royal Oak or Submariner still works and has value. Obsolescence cannot compete with eternity. Who competes with eternity? God, maybe.\u201d"

        "title": "Manhattan Emptied Out During the Pandemic. But Big Tech Is Moving In.",
        "fulltext": "Facebook has just leased enough new office space inManhattanto nearly triple its current local work force, including atone of the city\u2019s most iconic buildings, the 107-year-old former main post office complex near Pennsylvania Station.\nApple, which set up its first office in New York a decade ago, is expanding to another building in Manhattan. AndGoogleand Amazon are stitching together corporate campuses in the city more quickly than anywhere else in the world. Amazon paid roughly $1 billion in March for the iconic Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue.\nDespite a pandemic that has ravaged New York, hollowed out many of its office buildings and raised fundamental questions about its future, the four companies collectively known as Big Tech are all significantly expanding their footprint in the city, giving it a badly needed vote of confidence.\nWith fears that the virus could spike again in the colder months, many companies are grappling with how, when and even if office workers will come back to buildings in Manhattan. And the tech giants have not brought their workers back yet, either.\nEven so, the giants have not only moved forward with previous growth plans, but have also increased their pace of hiring and office acquisition during the pandemic.\nThe industry\u2019s embrace of New York City comes despite the tumultuous reception that Amazon received last year when it proposed building a sprawling headquarters in Queens. Amazon abandoned the plans in the face of political and community opposition, but now has acquired more than 2 million square feet of office space for corporate workers, as well as warehouses from Staten Island to Queens to the Bronx.\nAfter Amazon bought the Lord & Taylor building, it announced in August that 2,000 employees would eventually work there, increasing by half its current tech work force of 4,000.\nAmazon now has eight office properties in New York, most of which are clustered in Midtown. The company recently expanded outside Manhattan, leasing space on the Brooklyn waterfront for its Amazon Music team.\n\u201cWe know that talent attracts talent, and we believe that the creative energy of cities like New York will continue to attract diverse professionals from around the world,\u201d said Ardine Williams, Amazon\u2019s vice president of work force development.\nEven with the uncertainty of the pandemic, the country's four biggest technology companies have leased or bought enough office space in New York to hold more than 22,000 employees.Squares on the map show where Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have leased or bought space.\nEven with Big Tech\u2019s expansion, the city continues to face a fundamental challenge: Most offices have been deserted since March, devastating the local economy and the ecosystem of transit, stores, restaurants and other business that depend on workers. Only about 12 percent of workers have returned to Manhattan offices managed by CBRE, a commercial real estate firm that manages 20 million square feet of office space in the city.\nMany people do not want to go back to offices until there is a vaccine. Even after that, there are mounting questions about whether the pandemic has fundamentally tarnished the allure of the office towers of Midtown and Lower Manhattan.\nWhat\u2019s more, a recent uptick in new cases in parts of Brooklyn and Queens has raised fears that a second wave looms and that restrictions on daily life could be reimposed.\nCollectively, Amazon,Google, Facebook and Apple have hired more than 2,600 employees in the city so far this year, bringing their total employment to over 22,000 people. Facebook alone has added 1,100 workers to bring its current work force up to 4,000.\nApple, Amazon and Facebook have gobbled up more than 1.6 million square feet of office space since the start of the year, most of which was leased or bought during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, Google added about 1.7 million square feet of office space as part of a corporate campus rising along the Hudson River in Manhattan.\nThe companies now have enough new office space to hire another 15,000 employees. When those workers will arrive at the new offices remains uncertain; all four companies have allowed their employees to work remotely and some, including Facebook, foresee a future in which up to half its employees work from home.\nExecutives at the companies said their investments even during one of the city\u2019s darkest periods reflect their belief that the features that set New York apart \u2014 its diversity, culture, regional transportation network and numerous colleges and universities \u2014 will keep luring people after the pandemic.\nTo a large extent, the companies are also wagering that current and future employees will be eager to return to shared workplaces that promote spontaneity and collaboration.\n\u201cThe big takeaway here is that New York will always be a tech hub,\u201d said William Floyd, director of external affairs for Google\u2019s New York offices, which has about 9,000 workers, more than half of whom are engineers.\nGoogle is on target to employ 14,000 people in the city in the coming years,fulfilling a 2018 pledgeto double its New York City work force. The company has pieced together a sizable corporate campus in and around the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan, including severalproperties that are under construction.\nThe tech sector first settled in New York more than two decades ago, a tiny player in the shadows of the city\u2019s traditional powerhouse industries like finance, media, real estate and health care. Google opened its first outpost outside California, a sales office in Manhattan with a lone employee, in 2000.\nBut in recent years, New York has blossomed into a bona fide tech hub, an East Coast rival to Silicon Valley that has become a second home to tech behemoths but has also given rise to thousands of start-ups.\nThe larger companies have established a tech corridor on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, stretching from West 34th Street in Midtown south to the World Trade Center area in Lower Manhattan.\nThe focus of the tech companies in New York has shifted from marketing and sales departments to teams that mirror those in Silicon Valley. They have recruited engineers and developers from local and regional universities and filled some roles with West Coast employees who want to decamp to New York City.\nFor every Big Tech company in the city, there are numerous smaller but still sizable firms, including Salesforce, LinkedIn, Spotify andZocDoc. Microsoft, another tech giant, has a modest presence in offices near Times Square.\nBefore the pandemic, the city\u2019s tech sector employed 150,100 people, and had added a total of 15,700 jobs in 2018 and 2019, according to the New York State comptroller\u2019s office. Most of the new jobs were in fields like software, data processing and internet publishing.\nThe pace of hiring is expected to keep climbing.\nIn August, when Facebook grabbed all the office space at theJames A. Farley Buildingnear Pennsylvania Station, it cemented Manhattan\u2019s West Side as its East Coast campus.\nThe company said it leased 730,000 square feet at the old post office in part because of its cavernous layout \u2014 a rarity among New York City buildings \u2014 which mimics the large open areas at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. When a renovation is completed next year, the building will be filled with engineers.\n\u201cThe floor plan will allow for multiple teams to be housed on those floors,\u201d said Jamila Reeves, a company spokeswoman, \u201cand we don\u2019t necessarily have to break folks up.\u201d\nAround the corner from the Farley Building, Apple signed a lease for 220,000 square feet at 11 Penn Plaza, a 1923 Art Deco tower near Madison Square Garden.\nBefore the deal, Apple, which has said very little about its plans in the city, had not expanded beyond an office building on Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron neighborhood that itmoved into in 2011.\nSmaller tech companies have also kept adding to their payrolls right through the outbreak.\nMongoDB, a cloud database platform whose headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, has hired 97 employees since the beginning of the pandemic, bringing its total work force in the city to 551.\nThe company, whose products are used by Verizon, eBay and Adobe among other companies, has more than 2,100 employees worldwide and is creating a hybrid work model to have employees work remotely some days and in the office on others.\n\u201cWhile there are questions about what the future of work post-Covid will look like, we plan to maintain office spaces in New York,\u201d said Dev Ittycheria, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe believe that being physically present with colleagues in an office can offer important opportunities for in-person interaction, collaboration, and connection that are important for the success of our company.\u201d\nOne of the company\u2019s newest hires, Farah Wahab, started in August as a product marketing manager after working for five years at tech companies in San Francisco.\nThough San Francisco has a far larger tech scene, she said the city felt more insular compared with New York.\n\u201cI love S.F. but it can feel a bit like a tech-centric bubble isolated from the real world,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wahab, 32, said. \u201cBeing around different industries and types of people, as well as greater access to the market, was important to me both personally and professionally.\u201d\nKia D. Floyd, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy for the east and Midwest regions, pointed out that the company set up shop in New York shortly before the 2008 great recession, another challenging period of uncertainty in the city.\n\u201cPeople fled the city then and didn\u2019t think it would come back,\u201d Ms. Floyd said. \u201cBut the city has grit and resilience and diversity, and it was always going to be inspirational for businesses like ours.\u201d"

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Professional Opponents Strike at Google",
        "fulltext": "Months before theJustice Department filed a landmark antitrust suitagainst Google this week, the internet company\u2019s adversaries hustled behind the scenes to lay the groundwork for a case.\nNonprofits critical of corporate power warned lawmakers that Google illegally boxed out rivals. With mounds of documents, economists and antitrust scholars detailed to regulators and state investigators how the company throttled competition. And former Silicon Valley insiders steered congressional investigators with firsthand evidence of industry wrongdoing.\nAn unlikely collection of lawyers, activists, economists, academics and former corporate insiders are now fueling the backlash against the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Bolstered by millions of dollars from high-profile sponsors like the financier George Soros and the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, they have coalesced to become a new class of professional tech skeptic.\nTo rein in Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, the tech opponents have employed a wide set of tactics. They have lobbied regulators and lawmakers about anticompetitive business practices, filed legal complaints aboutprivacy violations,organized boycottsand exposed the risks of disinformation and artificial intelligence.\nTheir potency was cemented on Tuesday when the Justice Department filed its suitaccusing Google of maintaining an illegal monopolyover internet search and search advertising. After years of making the same argument, the opponents claimed the action as a victory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of pride,\u201d said Cristina Caffarra, a London-based economist who advised state attorneys general on their Google investigation and worked on an earlier probe of Google in Europe that the Justice Department\u2019s case is similar to. \u201cWe did it.\u201d\nTheir rise underlines the growing sophistication of opponents to the more than $5 trillion technology industry. Even if the Justice Department\u2019s suit against Google becomes mired in legal wrangling, their swelling numbers and activity suggests that the tech behemoths will face years of scrutiny and court battles ahead. That could eventually lead to new regulations and laws that reshape people\u2019s digital experiences.\n\u201cThere is a counterweight growing in reaction to Big Tech similar to what we\u2019ve seen in relation to Big Oil over these past decades,\u201d said Martin Tisn\u00e9, managing director of Luminate, a foundation that has provided $78.3 million since 2014 to civil society groups and law firms focused on tech-accountability issues. \u201cI would hope the companies are concerned and watching.\u201d\nGoogle declined to comment beyond its statements on Tuesday that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit was flawed and \u201cwould do nothing to help consumers.\u201d\nGoogle, Amazon, Facebook and Apple have girded themselves for a long battle. Often outspending their critics, they have hired law firms, funded policy think tanks, built out their lobbying operations and started public relations campaigns. They have alsoarguedthat they behave responsibly and that consumers love their products.\nCarl Szabo, the vice president of NetChoice, a trade group that represents Google, Facebook and Amazon, dismissed the tech critics as \u201can industry for activists\u201d and an opportunity for rivals to \u201cput on the moniker of consumer protection.\u201d\nThe anti-tech professionals agree on many broad points: that the companies have too much power and have transformed commerce and communication. But they have sometimes found themselves at odds with one another and do not agree on the fixes. Some supportusing antitrust lawsto take on the companies, potentially breaking them up. Others said tougher regulations were better to rein in the firms.\nSarah Miller, executive director of American Economic Liberties Project, a group focused on corporate concentration, favorsbreaking up the companies. She said there was \u201cjockeying\u201d to put forward ideas, but that the movement was a \u201cfairly aligned, functional ecosystem.\u201d\nMany of the groups are increasinglywell funded. Billionaires including Mr. Soros and Pierre Omidyar, the eBay co-founder who backs Luminate and other groups, have poured tens of millions of dollars into opposing the tech industry. Mr. Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, isfundingthink tanks and activists who pressure the companies.\nInstitutions like the Ford Foundation are also funding civil society groups and research efforts to study tech\u2019s harms. And human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Anti-Defamation League have devoted more resources to tech-accountability issues.\n\u201cIf you compare today to five years ago, there is a much different awareness among policymakers and the public,\u201d said Vera Franz, deputy director of the Open Society Foundations\u2019 Information Program, an organization backed by Mr. Soros that has spent $24 million this year on groups focused on privacy, online discrimination and other tech topics. \u201cThe key question is how to translate that awareness to real change and real accountability.\u201d\nThe anti-tech movement\u2019s first signs of success came in the European Union about a decade ago when some of Google\u2019s rivals banded together to persuade regulators to investigate the company forantitrust violations. The resulting cases cost Google more than $9 billion in fines.\nIn 2016, the opponents scored another victory when the European Union passed a landmark data privacy law, theGeneral Data Protection Regulation, which many lawyers and activists now use against the tech companies.\nIn the United States, few were alarmed by tech\u2019s power until the 2016 presidential election, whenRussia used social media to spread disinformationand sow political discord. In 2018, theCambridge Analytica scandalexposed Facebook\u2019s weak privacy safeguards and added to the momentum.\nSince then, the influence of industry critics has swelled. Antitrust lawyers and economists focused on tech accountability are in demand at law firms and think tanks. Civil society groups eager to investigate the industry are hiring data scientists and researchers. Universities are adding programs looking at tech\u2019s harm.\nBookstores are also stocking titles like \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d by the Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, about how companies like Facebook and Google try to predict and control human behavior. Netflix films like \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d which is critical of social media, have become surprise hits.\nTristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist, said few shared his concerns about tech five years ago. Now he speaks with American and European authorities about regulating the tech giants as public utilities. Mr. Harris, who starred in \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d said he wanted to mobilize \u201ca global movement of regular people and citizens,\u201d akin to what Al Gore did for the environment after releasing \u201cThe Inconvenient Truth.\u201d\n\u201cIt took a long time to get here,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who in 2018 also co-founded theCenter for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that raises awareness about tech\u2019s dangers.\nOne clear impact of the anti-tech community was the 449-page report released on Oct. 6 by theHouse antitrust subcommittee, in one of Congress\u2019s deepest looks at the industry in years. House lawmakers concluded that Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook hadabused their power to block competitors.\nTech critics played a central role influencing the direction of the report.Lina Khan, an antitrust and competition law scholar, was a counsel for the committee that drafted the report. Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economist, and Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official, provided legal and economic background to investigators.Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor who later turned against the social network, also met so regularly with congressional staff members that he thanked several of them in his 2019 book, \u201cZucked,\u201d about the damage Facebook was doing to society.\nA similar coalition helped build momentum forthe Justice Department and state attorneys general investigations of Google. Lawyers at the Justice Department built the case off theories developed by economists including Ms. Caffarra. Google hascriticized Ms. Caffarra\u2019s involvementin an inquiry led by Texas because she has done work for prominent rivals of the company, including News Corp.\nThere was a \u201cconsensus that enforcement has not delivered,\u201d said Ms. Caffarra, who works at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of really putting on pressure. Too little has happened.\u201d\nBut their criticism varies by company. While Ms. Caffarra and Ms. Scott Morton have raised alarms about Google and Facebook, they have also done work on behalf of Amazon.\nGary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who has battled Microsoft and Google, said the political momentum could evaporate. Two decades ago, he said, the government filed alandmark antitrust case against Microsoft\u2014 but did not produce the safeguards to prevent misbehavior later.\n\u201cWe should have had a seminal moment 20 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething happened that caused the momentum to dissipate, and that\u2019s the risk here.\u201d\nFor now, the mood is largely celebratory. After this month\u2019s House report, Google\u2019s critics in Washington passed around a version of a meme that featured dancing pallbearers holding a coffin, essentially jubilant over the misfortune of the coffin\u2019s occupant.\nThe pallbearers were RepresentativeDavid Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the House antitrust subcommittee, and Representative Ken Buck, a Republican member of the panel who agreed with parts of the report.\nAnd the coffin? It bore Google\u2019s logo."

        "title": "Congress Agrees: Big Tech Is Broken.",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIt is stunning that members ofCongressmostly agree that four of America\u2019s most successful companiesare bullies that abuse their power to stay on top.\nThat was my thought reading the conclusions of a 16-month congressional investigation into whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple broke the law to squash competition. The assessment was, essentially, yup.\nThe Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have major points of disagreement, and only Democrats signed this report. But while the two parties are divided \u2014 possibly irreconcilably so \u2014 over how to fix the problem, they appear to mostly agree that those four companies should not be allowed to continue as is.\nIt\u2019s not unusual to hate on large companies; it was true of big banks and oil companies at the peak of their power. But still. This feels like a moment that reflects real discomfort and derision for big technology companies, and I\u2019m not sure there is a way to go back to the shinier, happier days.\nOn to some of my assessments of the report. (Youcan read all 449 pages for yourself here.)\nIt is so relentlessly negative. Where is the nuance?The House report was unequivocal that Google and Facebook are monopolies, and that elements of Amazon and Apple are as well. (My colleagues have more specifics.)\nOne thing that struck me is that the House Democrats saw almost everything that the big tech companies do as evidence of illegal anti-competitive activity. It felt overdone. And there was little recognition of what the U.S. economy and people have gained from the success of these tech giants.\nA small example: House members called out Google for preventing other companies that make digital maps from collecting data from people\u2019s Android phones. In the report\u2019s telling, Google\u2019s data advantage let Google Maps chart the planet, but no rival mapping companies had a shot.\nThat is true but also \u2026 Google\u2019s action helped secure people\u2019s digital privacy. Wouldn\u2019t it be bad if every creepy app had access to our location when we roamed around the world?\nThe proposed fixes are BIG IDEAS:The Democrats who signed this report are proposing nothing short of a rewriting of laws that govern corporations, and a reimagining of how lots of familiar businesses work.\nThe five-alarm-fire proposed fix from the Democrats is to force Big Tech to effectively break up \u2014 if not literally than at least by not letting one part of a company promote another, giving it an edge over competitors. Don\u2019t let Amazon sell its own products on its marketplace, for example, and don\u2019t permit Google to require Samsung to install Google apps on Android phones.\nThere\u2019s more. The House report suggests rewriting laws so people who believe a big tech company is unfairly crushing their business \u2014 merchants who sell products on Amazon, for example \u2014 can sue in court to force legal accountability for anticompetitive actions. (Right now, the tech superpowers force most complaints into arbitration, which doesn\u2019t impose punishments.)\nAnother one: Change the legal standard so companies like Facebook can\u2019t buy other companies without proving that doing so will enhance competition and help consumers.\nThese and other proposed changes are huge. I don\u2019t know if these ideas are all good \u2014 or if they will happen. And I am concerned that there is no recognition of the downsides to these fixes. But I want to give the lawmakers credit for not being afraid to think big.\nThe competition watchdogs need more teeth:House members said the government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission that are responsible for enforcing antitrust laws repeatedly failed. They too often left unchallenged Big Tech\u2019s pattern of getting more powerful by acquiring competitors, and they did not crack down when these companies broke the law and their word. To this I say, YES.\nThe House members recommended more funding for the F.T.C. and other antitrust enforcement agencies, requiring them to keep better data on industry consolidation and generally suggesting they stop being afraid to go after the biggest fish.\nI welcome more muscular enforcement of existing laws. I wonder how many transgressions by these companies in recent years \u2014 includingFacebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal\u2014 could have been avoided if government watchdogs kept Big Tech on a shorter leash. (Also, hello, the F.T.C.may want to look at Facebook integrating its apps.)\nHouse members did their homework. Also they are FURIOUS:Let this House investigationforever end the ideathat members of Congress are too clueless to effectively oversee big tech companies. Even if you disagree with their conclusions, these people showed that they get how these companies operate.\nAlso, they are so mad, you guys. Laced through the report is contempt at what House members saw as attempts by Big Tech to evade or sneer at lawmakers. One example: House members said they asked Amazon for a list of the company\u2019s top 10 competitors. Amazon gave them 1,700 names, including Eero (a Wi-Fi equipment company Amazon owns), a discount surgical supply distributor and a beef jerky company.\nNo one likes to be poked and prodded by Congress, but the members were right that these four companies are arrogant, and that blinds them to justified criticism. With this report, the tech giants have reasons to feel the House overreached. I hope this time they don\u2019t miss that there is also legitimate pushback.\nThe Republicans were divided:In aseparate draft reportby Republican members, they agreed that stronger antitrust enforcement was needed for Big Tech, but said that some of the Democrats\u2019 proposed legal changes \u2014 including eliminating arbitration clauses \u2014 were too drastic. They also criticized their colleagues for not tackling perceived conservative bias by big tech companies. Others have refused to endorse any of the Democrats\u2019 findings, my colleagues reported.\nI\u2019m still struck by how much agreement there was on the problem. That suggests that, if Congress actually does something \u2014 not a given \u2014 business as usual will be impossible for Big Tech.\nFacebook isn\u2019t thinking small, either:The company took sweeping action against the baseless QAnon conspiracy by saying it woulddelete anything that identified with QAnon from Facebook and Instagram, my colleague Sheera Frenkel reported.\nPeople concerned about the real-world harm from QAnon said Facebook was too tame in its prior crackdowns and cheered this approach. But one problem with banning the movement is that its ideas haveseeped into more mainstream ideas. Plus, believers have been adept at skirting Facebook\u2019s rules.\nWeren\u2019t we just talking about the overreach of Big Tech?Would you like to buy a Chromecast, the streaming TV device that recommends entertainment based on what Google knows about you? My colleague Brian X. Chen found the gadgetcomplicated, creepy and mostly pointlessbecause the Chromecast viewing recommendations were hit or miss.\nDating in a pandemic is weird:In the last few months, people using online dating apps have gotten less picky and more willing to fast track new relationships so they aren\u2019t alone in anxious times,wrotemy colleagues Jonah Engel Bromwich and Sandra E. Garcia. Special mention to the professional dating app ghostwriter (!!!) and the woman who deleted all her dating apps because \u201cit sucks to deal with the pandemicanda bad relationship.\u201d\nLOOK AT THEFLOOFY AND ADORABLE NEWBORN FLAMINGO.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "Forget Antitrust Laws. To Limit Tech, Some Say a New Regulator Is Needed.",
        "fulltext": "For decades, America\u2019s antitrust laws \u2014 originally designed to curb the power of 19th-century corporate giants in railroads, oil and steel \u2014 have been hailed as \u201cthe Magna Carta of free enterprise\u201d and have provedremarkably durable and adaptable.\nBut even as theJustice Department filed an antitrust suit against Googleon Tuesday for unlawfully maintaining a monopoly in search and search advertising, a growing number of legal experts and economists have started questioning whether traditional antitrust is up to the task of addressing the competitive concerns raised by today\u2019s digital behemoths. Further help, they said, is needed.\nAntitrust cases typically proceed at the stately pace of the courts, with trials and appeals that can drag on for years. Those delays, the legal experts and economists said, would give Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple a free hand to become even more entrenched in the markets they dominate.\nA more rapid-response approach is required, they said. One solution: a specialist regulator that would focus on the major tech companies. It would establish and enforce a set of basic rules of conduct, which would include not allowing the companies to favor their own services, exclude competitors or acquire emerging rivals and require them to permit competitors access to their platforms and data on reasonable terms.\nThe British government has already said it wouldcreate a digital markets unit, with calls for a Big Tech regulator to also be introduced in the European Union and in Australia. In the United States, recommendations for a digital markets regulator have also been made in expert reports and in congressional testimony. It could be a separate agency or perhaps a digital division inside the Federal Trade Commission.\nSignificantly, the leading proponents of this path in the United States are mainstream antitrust experts and economists rather than break-\u2019em-up firebrands. Jason Furman, a professor at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, ledan advisory group to the British governmentthat recommended the creation of a digital markets unit in 2019.\nBreaking up the big tech companies, Mr. Furman said, is a bad idea because that would risk losing some of the consumer benefits these digital utilities undeniably deliver. A regulator is necessary to police digital markets and the behavior of the tech giants, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m a small \u2018c\u2019 conservative, and I\u2019m not a fan of regulation generally,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s needed in this space.\u201d\nRegulators that focus on specific sectors of the economy are common in the United States. For financial markets, there is the Securities and Exchange Commission; for airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration; for pharmaceuticals, the Food and Drug Administration; for telecommunications, theFederal Communications Commission; and so on.\nThere is also precedent for picking out a handful of big companies for special treatment. In banking, the biggest banks with the most customers and loans are classified as \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d and subject to more stringent scrutiny.\nSeveral supporters of a new tech regulator were officials in the Obama administration, which was known for being friendly to Silicon Valley. But the advocates said that experience \u2014 as well as the conservative, pro-big business drift of court rulings in recent years \u2014 left themfrustrated with antitrust lawas the only way to restrain the growing market power and conduct of the big tech companies.\n\u201cThe mechanism of antitrust is not working to protect competition,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, an official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division in the Obama administration, who is an economist at the Yale University School of Management. \u201cSo let\u2019s do something else \u2014 use a different tool.\u201d\nMs. Scott Morton led an expert panel on antitrust ina report last year on digital platforms by the Stigler Centerat theUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. The report recommended the creation of a regulatory authority. (Ms. Scott Morton has been a forceful critic of Google, but also a consultant to Apple and Amazon.)\nSuch a regulatory approach carries the risk of government\u2019s meddling in a fast-moving industry that could hobble innovation, some antitrust experts warned. While antitrust law reacts to alleged anticompetitive behavior and can thus be slow, that shortcoming is preferable to prescriptive government rules and regulations, they said.\n\u201cI\u2019m very uncomfortable with the regulatory path, especially if it means things like getting government approval for product changes,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \u201cThe history of regulation shows that it is an innovation killer.\u201d\nA. Douglas Melamed, a former general counsel of Intel and a former antitrust official in the Justice Department, shared that concern. But Mr. Melamed, a member of the expert panel for the Stigler Center report, said the tech giants did pose a competition problem.\n\u201cI think regulation might make sense if it is narrowly focused, not running the industry,\u201d said Mr. Melamed, who is a professor at Stanford Law School.\nThe last major antitrust action against a big technology company wasthe landmark Microsoft casein the 1990s. The case began with a suit filed in 1994 by the Federal Trade Commission and a simultaneous consent decree.\nThe Justice Department and several states later picked up the pursuit, investigated anew, filed suit and conducted an exhaustive trial. Microsoft was found to have repeatedly violated the nation\u2019s antitrust laws, and the company then reached a settlement with the government, which a federal court approved in 2002.\nIn the Microsoft case, the antitrust legal process worked, in its way. Yet its impact is still debated. Without the suit and years of scrutiny, some observers said, Microsoft could have throttled the rise of Google.\nBut others said the technological shift toward the internet and away from the personal computer meant that Microsoft had lost the gatekeeper power it once held. Technology, not antitrust, they insisted, opened the door to competition.\nTriumph or not, the Microsoft case was two decades ago. Proponents of a new regulator said antitrust law was ill suited by itself to restraining today\u2019s faster-moving digital giants. In the internet economy, they said, the forces that reinforce and expand the power of a market leader \u2014 called network effects \u2014 are stronger and more rapid than in the personal computer era.\n\u201cAntitrust is not a fully adequate tool to deal with the companies that dominate these markets,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, who was on the Stigler Center panel and a co-author ofa recent report by the Shorenstein Centerat Harvard that called for the creation of a \u201cdigital platform agency\u201d in America.\nAnother argument for the regulatory option is that competition concerns now span four companies, not just one. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are in different markets, including search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks. Bringing separate antitrust cases against them would most likely be beyond the resources of the government.\n\u201cWhen the competition issues are larger than a single firm, regulation might be the better tool to use,\u201d said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University."

        "title": "Big Tech Continues Its Surge Ahead of the Rest of the Economy",
        "fulltext": "While the rest of the U.S. economy languished earlier this year, the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies seemed immune to the downturn,surging as the country worked, learned and shopped from home.\nOn Thursday, as the economy isshowing signs of improvement, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook reported profits that highlighted how a recovery may provide another catalyst to help them generate a level of wealth that hasn\u2019t been seen in a single industry in generations.\nWith an entrenched audience of users and the financial resources to press their leads in areas like cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising, the companies demonstrated again that economic malaise, upstart competitors and feisty antitrust regulators have had little impact on their bottom line.\nCombined, the four companies reported a quarterly net profit of $38 billion.\nAmazon reported record sales, and an almost 200 percent rise in profits, as the pandemic accelerated the transition to online shopping. Despite a boycott of its advertising over the summer, Facebook had another blockbuster quarter. Alphabet\u2019s record quarterly net profit was up 59 percent, as marketers plowed money into advertisements for Google search and YouTube. And Apple\u2019s sales rose even though the pandemic forced it to push back the iPhone 12\u2019s release to October, in the current quarter.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft, Amazon\u2019s closest competitor in cloud computing, also reported itsmost profitable quarter, growing 30 percent from a year earlier.\n\u201cThe scene that\u2019s playing out fundamentally is that these tech stalwarts are gaining more market share by the day,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018A Tale of Two Cities\u2019 for this group of tech companies and everyone else.\u201d\nThe results were strong despite increasing antitrust scrutiny from regulators. Last week, the Justice Department fileda lawsuitaccusing Google of cementing the dominance of its search engine through anticompetitive agreements with device makers and mobile carriers. Facebook facesa possible antitrust casefrom the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe companies\u2019 advantages are becoming more pronounced in an economy starting to dig out from the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the Commerce Department said U.S. economic outputgrew 7.4 percent last quarter, the fastest pace on record, but remained below where it was in the last pre-pandemic quarter.\nThat slow return to health is also providing momentum to companies that suffered early in the pandemic, like Twitter, which reported on Thursday that revenue rose 14 percent in the third quarter as advertisers started to return. Twitter\u2019s stock dropped about 14 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, a reaction that analysts attributed to slow user growth.\nBig Tech\u2019s third-quarter boom could look modest when compared with the final quarter of the year. For Apple, it\u2019s when consumers buy newly released iPhones. And the year-end shopping peak means lots of customers turning to Amazon for gifts, while advertisers rely on Google and Facebook for digital ads during the holidays.\nThe pandemic-fueled surge in online shopping pushed Amazon to a record for both sales and profits in the latest quarter.\nSales were $96.1 billion, up 37 percent from a year earlier, and profits rose to $6.3 billion.\nThe quarter did not include the usual boost from Prime Day, Amazon\u2019s yearly deal bonanza, which was delayed to October. And the profit increased during a building boom, with Amazon expanding its fulfillment infrastructure by 50 percent this year. The company added almost 250,000 employees in the quarter, for the first time surpassing more than a million workers.\nThe lucrative Amazon Web Services division grew 29 percent as companies continued their shift to cloud computing.\nAmazon said sales could reach $121 billion in the fourth quarter because of the confluence of Prime Day, the holiday shopping season and the turn to online spending.\nThe delay in the iPhone 12\u2019s release meant Apple would face a tough comparison with the same quarter last year, which included sales of the iPhone 11. As a result, iPhone sales dropped more than 20 percent in the quarter.\nYet Apple\u2019s overall sales still rose 1 percent to $64.7 billion, showing the increasing strength of other parts of the company\u2019s business.\nApple\u2019s services segment, which includes revenues from the App Store and offerings like Apple Music, increased 16 percent to $14.5 billion. Sales rose 46 percent for iPads, 29 percent for Mac computers and 21 percent for wearables.\nProfits fell 7 percent to $12.7 billion, partly because the company spent more on research and development.\n\u201cThere are lots going on here, and everything is going incredibly well,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview.\nFacebook\u2019srevenuefor the third quarter rose 22 percent from a year earlier, to $21.2 billion, while profits jumped 29 percent to $7.84 billion. The results surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates of $19.8 billion in revenue and profits of $5.53 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.\nFacebook had strong results despite a wide-ranging boycott by advertisers this summer over issues of hate and toxic speech on the site. Though the grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook toreduce their spending, the overall effects were brief.\nThe company continued gaining users as well. More than 1.82 billion people used the Facebook app every day, up 12 percent from a year earlier, it said. More than 2.54 billion people now use one or more of Facebook\u2019s family of apps \u2014 Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger or Facebook \u2014 daily, up 15 percent from a year earlier.\nAfter its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue in the second quarter, Alphabet rebounded with its highest-ever profit. The strength came from across Google, with search advertising revenue growing 6 percent and YouTube ad spending rising 32 percent. Google\u2019s cloud computing business grew 45 percent.\nWhen advertisers slowed spending with Google this year as Covid-19 started to spread, Alphabet\u2019s business took a significant hit. But as the economy has improved and businesses found their footing, advertisers have returned.\nAlphabet posted a net profit of $11.25 billion in the third quarter as revenue rose 14 percent to $46.1 billion. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said the improved profitability reflected efforts to cut costs during the economic downturn, including a hiring slowdown."
