        "title": "A First Try of Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro Headset",
        "fulltext": "I got a sneak peek into Apple\u2019s vision for the future of computing on Monday. For about half an hour, I worethe $3,500 Vision Pro, the company\u2019s first high-tech goggles, which will be released next year.\nI walked away with mixed feelings, including a nagging sense of skepticism.\nOn one hand, I was impressed with the quality of the headset, which Apple bills as the beginning of an era of \u201cspatial computing,\u201d where digital data blends with the physical world to unlock new capabilities. Imagine wearing a headset to assemble furniture while the instructions are digitally projected onto the parts, for instance, or cooking a meal while a recipe is displayed in the corner of your eye.\nApple\u2019s device had high-resolution video, intuitive controls and a comfortable fit, which felt superior to my experiences with headsets made in the last decade byMeta, Magic Leap,Sonyand others.\nBut after wearing the new headset to view photos and interact with a virtual dinosaur, I also felt there wasn\u2019t much new to see here. And the experience elicited an \u201cick\u201d factor I had never had before with an Apple product. More on this later.\nLet me start from the beginning. AfterApple unveiled the headseton Monday, its first major new release since the Apple Watch in 2015, I was permitted to try a preproduction model of the Vision Pro. Apple staff led me to a private room at the company\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters and sat me on a couch for a demo.\nThe Vision Pro, which resembles a pair of ski goggles, has a white USB cable that plugs into a silver battery pack that I slipped into the pocket of my jeans. To put it on my face, I turned a knob on the side of the headset to adjust the snugness and secured a Velcro strap above my head.\nI pressed down on a metal button toward the front of the device to turn it on. Then I ran through a setup process, which involved looking at a moving dot so the headset could lock in on my eye movements. The Vision Pro has an array of sensors to track eye movements, hand gestures and voice commands, which are the primary ways to control it. Looking at an icon is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to press a button, you tap your thumb and index fingers together, making a quick pinch that is equivalent to clicking a mouse.\nThe pinch gesture was also used for grabbing and moving around apps on the screen. It was intuitive and felt less clunky than waving around the motion controllers that typically come with competing handsets.\nBut it raised questions. What other hand gestures would the headset recognize for playing games? How good will voice controls be if Siri\u2019s voice transcription on phones currently doesn\u2019t work well? Apple isn\u2019t sure yet what other gestures will be supported, and it didn\u2019t let me try voice controls.\nThen came time for the app demos to show how the headset might enrich our everyday lives and help us stay connected with one another.\nApple first walked me through looking at photos and a video of a birthday party on the headset. I could turn a dial near the front of the Vision Pro counterclockwise to make the photo backgrounds more transparent and see the real world, including the Apple employees around me, or turn it clockwise to make the photo more opaque to immerse myself.\nApple also had me open a meditation app in the headset that showed 3-D animations while soothing music played and a voice instructed me to breathe. But the meditation couldn\u2019t prepare me for what was coming next: a video call.\nA small window popped up \u2014 a notification of a FaceTime call from another Apple employee wearing the headset. I stared at the answer button and pinched to take the call.\nThe Apple employee in the video call was using a \u201cpersona,\u201d an animated 3-D avatar of herself that the headset created using a scan of her face. Apple portrays videoconferencing through the personas as a more intimate way for people to communicate and even collaborate in virtual space.\nThe Apple employee\u2019s facial expressions looked lifelike, and her mouth movements synchronized with her speech. But because of how her avatar was digitally rendered, with the uniform texture of her face and the lack of shadows, I could tell it was fake. It resembled a video hologram I had seen in sci-fi movies like \u201cMinority Report.\u201d\nIn the FaceTime session, the Apple employee and I were supposed to collaborate on making a 3-D model in an app called Freeform. But I stared at it blankly, thinking about what I was seeing. After three years of my being mostly isolated during the pandemic, Apple wanted me to engage with what was essentially a deepfake video of a real person. I could feel myself shutting down. My \u201cick\u201d sensation was probably what technologists have long described asuncanny valley, a feeling of unease when a human sees a machine creation that looks too human.\nA technological feat? Yes. A feature I would want to use with others every day? Probably not anytime soon.\nTo wrap the demonstration with something fun, Apple showed a simulation of a dinosaur that moved toward me when I reached my hand out. I have seen more than my fair share of digital dinosaurs in virtual reality (almost every headset maker that\u2019s given me a VR demo has shown aJurassic Park simulationin the last seven years), and I was not excited about this.\nAfter the demo, I drove home and processed the experience during rush hour.\nOver dinner, I talked to my wife about the Vision Pro. The Apple goggles, I said, looked and felt better than the competing headsets. But I wasn\u2019t sure that mattered.\nOther headsets from Meta and Sony PlayStation were much cheaper and already quite powerful and entertaining, especially for playing video games. But whenever we had guests over for dinner and they tried the goggles on, they lost interest after less than half an hour because the experience was exhausting and they felt socially disconnected from the group.\nWould it matter if they could twist the dial on the front of the headset to see into the real world while wearing it? I suspect it would still feel isolating, because they would probably be the only person in a room wearing one.\nBut more important to me was the idea of connecting with others, including family members and colleagues, through Apple headsets.\n\u201cYour mom is getting old,\u201d I said to my wife. \u201cWhen you\u2019re FaceTiming with her, would you rather see her deepfake digital avatar, or a crummier video call where she\u2019s holding the phone camera up to her face at an unflattering angle?\u201d\n\u201cThe latter,\u201d she said without hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s real. Although, I\u2019d much rather see her in person.\u201d"

        "title": "Business Lessons From Blinken\u2019s Trip to China",
        "fulltext": "Worries about China\u2019s economic recovery sent stocks and U.S. futures lower on Tuesday morning, despite apromising meetingon Monday between the country\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing.\nThe discussions raised hopes that the world\u2019s two biggest economies might stabilize relations, but the market reaction points at the deeper challenges for policymakers and business.\nThe mood music was positive.Xi said the two sides had \u201cmade progress\u201d and President Biden told reporters in California that Blinken had done \u201ca hell of a job.\u201d But that just talking generated such excitement is a sign of how tense relations have become. There was no agreement or detail on the most contentious issues: restrictions on Chinese access to advanced technologies; accusations that the U.S. and its allies want to contain Beijing\u2019s ambitions; Taiwan; the war in Ukraine.\n\u201cDistrust remains high,\u201dsaid Noah Barkin, a specialist on China relations at the research firm Rhodium Group. \u201cFor international investors, this is not enough to trigger any sort of rethink with regard to the Chinese market.\u201dThe Biden administration, he said, would continue screening strategic investments into China and Beijing showed no signs of easing pressure on foreign firms operating in the country.\nBusiness is de-risking rather than decoupling.Raytheon\u2019s C.E.O., Greg Hayes, said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to break away entirely from China because of the complexity of supply chains and the level of U.S. trade with the country, while the pharmaceutical giantAstraZenecais reportedly looking to spin off its China unit, according to The Financial Times.\nChina has big domestic concerns, too.The country\u2019s central bankcut its prime lending ratetoday and Goldman Sachs lowered its growth outlook for the country over the weekend. \u201cFor business, the issue is not so much China-U.S. relations per se, but the very worrying state of the Chinese economy at present. Awareness of how challenged that is was probably one of the main issues that created a more communicative China, one that is willing to show just a bit of compromise at the moment,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies at King\u2019s College London and a former British diplomat in Beijing.\nYu Jie, a China expert at Chatham House, a British think-tank, added that Xi still hoped \u201cthat Western business could be part of his plan to generate much-needed growth and employment.\u201d\nWhat to watch next?China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, landed in Germany this week to start a European trip, his first overseas since becoming his country\u2019s second most senior leader earlier this year. China is Germany\u2019s biggest trading partner and, along with France, where Mr. Li will travel later this week, a U.S. ally that is trying to find a different path for its relations with Beijing and Washington.\nAnd for a view of how the Biden administration is trying to woo allies, in part to counter China: India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will travel to Washington on a state visit this week.\nIn other China news:\nAlibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares closed 1.5 percent lower after the e-commerce giant announced thatDaniel Zhangwould step down as C.E.O. and chairman. Earlier this year, the company said it would split into six divisions.\nBeijing is reportedlyplanning to build a military training facilityin Cuba, according to The Wall Street Journal, sparking alarm in Washington that Chinese troops could be stationed 100 miles off the coast of Florida.\nMore light is shed on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ties to Jes Staley and JPMorgan Chase.A 22-page document summarized emails between the convicted sex offender and Mr. Staley, the former JPMorgan executive who was his primary contact at the bank, showing how Mr. Epsteinadvised Staley on a number of issues, including meetings with Chinese officials and deals. JPMorgan has held Mr. Staley responsible for maintaining the firm\u2019s ties to Mr. Epstein.\nAdobe\u2019s $20 billion takeover bid for Figma reportedly faces E.U. scrutiny.European antitrust regulators are preparing tobegin a formal investigationinto the deal, according to The Financial Times. (Figma is a rival to Adobe in cloud-based design software.) The transaction has already drawn skepticism from American and British regulators.\nLazard is said to have discussed a sale with an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.The investment bankheld talks earlier this year with ADQ, a state-funded vehicle, The Financial Times reports. The talks, which are no longer active, reflect the ambitions of deep-pocketed Middle Eastern investors seeking to diversify their countries\u2019 economies beyond oil.\nBerkshire Hathaway doubles down on Japan.The conglomerate run by Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday that it has bought more sharesin Japan\u2019s five biggest trading firms, and suggested that it may go further. Nikkei-listed stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 and most other large indexes this year, thanks to investor enthusiasm over Japan\u2019s economic recovery.\nRescuers are stillsearching for a submersiblethat disappeared near the wreckage of the Titanic on Sunday, racing against time to find the vessel in the vastness of the sea.\nThe submersible\u2019s disappearance is a reminder of the risks associated with the extreme tourism business \u2014 especially as space exploration companies like Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin take flight.\nTime is ticking.Coast Guard officials estimated that the Titan submersible, which disappeared Sunday morning, theoretically had between 70 to 96 hours of air as of late yesterday afternoon. (That is, if its hull is intact.) Among the five people on board are Hamish Harding, a wealthy British adventurer and aviation executive, and Paul Henry Nargeolet, a French expert on the Titanic.\nAmerican and Canadian aircraft, as well as commercial vessels, were looking for the Titan, while sonar buoys had been deployed. Buthere\u2019s a good explainerabout how difficult it may be to find the vehicle and rescue its occupants.\nThe business of exploring the extremes is booming.OceanGate Expeditions, which operates the Titan, has beencharging up to $250,000a seat since 2021 to tour the undersea remains of the Titanic.\nWhile well-heeled vacationers have long paid to take glamorous risks \u2014 hiking up Mount Everest or swimming with great whites \u2014 the most wealthy have increasingly flocked to the frontiers offered by space travel. Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic (not to be confused with the failed Virgin Orbit) is selling tickets for suborbital flight for$450,000 apiece, while one ticket on a Blue Origin flight last year reportedlywent for $1.25 million. (Mr. Harding had previously flown on a Blue Origin rocket.)\nUnited Talent Agency, whose A-list clients range from the actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet to the singers Post Malone and Lizzo, is expanding further into media and sports by acquiring James & Co., an executive search firm specializing in the sector, for an undisclosed amount, DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch is first to report.\nTalent agencies have been diving into sports,echoing moves by technology giants to throw cash at one of the few sectors still driving eyeballs to live television. Last year, Creative Artists Agency, which represents Dwyane Wade, Steven Spielberg and Zendaya,bought its rival ICM, in part to push further into sports. CAA\u2019s clients include the football star Aaron Rodgers, basketball\u2019s Chris Paul and the Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo.\nUTA acquired a majority stake in 2019 in Klutch Sports Group, which represents the NBA\u2019s LeBron James. This year UTAnamedAndrew Thau, its chief operating officer, as its head of sports, alongside Klutch\u2019s founder, Rich Paul.\nUTA and its rivals are seeking scale to strengthen their negotiating power with streaming powerhouses like Amazon, Netflix, and Apple. UTAboughtthe literary agency Fletcher & Company in January after acquiring the London-based Curtis Brown last year. Those deals strengthened its roster of contemporary novelists and nonfiction writers, giving it more intellectual property that could be turned into films or TV series.\nJames & Co. was founded in 2002by Michele James, a former chief talent scout at Time Warner, and Roysi Erbes, a partner at the executive search firm Korn Ferry.

        "title": "Apple Is Stepping Into the Metaverse. Will Anyone Care?",
        "fulltext": "Mark Zuckerberg embraced a digital world known as the metaverse when he said in November 2021 that he was changing his company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta.\nA month later, Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft,wrotethat within two or three years, he believed most virtual meetings would transition from two-dimensional grids of video \u201cto the metaverse, a 3D space with digital avatars.\u201d\nSoon after, Microsoft announced that it would spend $70 billion to buy the video game giant Activision Blizzard and said the deal would \u201cprovide building blocks for the metaverse.\u201d\nBut since then, interest\u00a0in the metaverse\u00a0has stalled. Technology investors have moved on to new trends like artificial intelligence. And some metaverse projects have been shuttered at companies like Disney and Microsoft, despite that burst of enthusiasm.\nEnter Apple. At its Worldwide Developers Conference starting on Monday, the tech giant is expected to debut its virtual reality hardware product: high-tech goggles that blend together the digital and physical worlds.\nThe company is betting that it can tempt consumers with mixed reality products better than Meta, whose high-end Quest Pro headsets have not sold well, and that it can ignite mainstream interest in virtual reality in a way that other companies have not. The Apple headset is expected to cost about $3,000 and will look like ski goggles, according to current and former employees familiar with its development.\nApple has done this before. Eventual hits like the iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch started in niche markets that grew into big businesses. But even Apple executiveshave been skeptical about the company\u2019s prospectsin virtual reality, which, they say, may still not be ready for its mainstream moment.\nApple declined to comment.\nThe idea of an immersive, all-encompassing online universe made more sense to many investors when people weren\u2019t leaving their homes during the height of the pandemic. Metaverse-related start-ups raised about $664 million in venture capital in the first five months of 2023, a drastic drop from the more than $2.93 billion they raised in the same period in 2022, according to data compiled by PitchBook. That drop-off cuts recent metaverse start-up investment to about a quarter of its peak in the first half of 2022, PitchBook said.\n\u201cThe metaverse investment fad \u2014 it came and went, and now people are focused on A.I.,\u201d said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cThe people who were hopping on it because it was a sexy thing to talk about have hopped back off.\u201d\nThis year, Microsoft shuttered a virtual reality world, called AltspaceVR, that it acquired in 2017. The company also laid off some employees working on its HoloLens mixed reality headset and eliminated or reassigned teams that had been working on metaverse projects, according to a person familiar with the changes.\nIn a statement, Microsoft said it was still committed to the metaverse and pointed to the news that it was rolling out three-dimensional avatars for Microsoft Teams meetings.\nDisney also laid off about 50\u00a0employees who had been working on metaverse projects, according to a person familiar with the cuts. News aboutMicrosoft\u2019s and Disney\u2019s cutswas\u00a0reported earlier byThe Wall Street Journal.\nAt Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to\u00a0restructure the company around\u00a0metaverse-centric technologies has been costly. Meta\u2019s hardware\u00a0unit, Reality Labs,\u00a0which includes its Oculus headsets,\u00a0is responsible for a significant part of Meta\u2019s recent\u00a0big increase in spending.\u00a0That division lost about $4 billion in the first three months of this year.\nMr. Zuckerberg cautioned that building the metaverse would be a money-losing proposition with little promise of early returns. Still, it has taken muchlongerthan he anticipated. In recent months, Mr. Zuckerberg and his lieutenants have spent more time talking up Meta\u2019s expertise in A.I., though\u00a0he has bristled at the notion that the metaverse is no longer his focus.\n\u201cA narrative has developed that we\u2019re somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision,\u201d he saidin a call with investorsin April. \u201cSo I just want to say upfront that that\u2019s not accurate. We\u2019ve been focusing on both A.I. and the metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both.\u201d\nA Meta spokeswoman, Ashley Zandy, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that our metaverse vision is a long-term one, and nothing about that has changed. We are committed to our metaverse vision, and we\u2019re seeing good momentum.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Mr. Zuckerbergteaseda version of the Meta Quest 3, the company\u2019s latest VR headset, which will cost $499 and may come this year. Consumers have spent more than $1.5 billion on apps and games in Meta\u2019s Quest app store to date.\nFor Apple, its new headset could be the beginning of a long-term plan that eventually leads to a more popular virtual reality product, like a lightweight pair of glasses.\nSome analysts have suggested the company could take an experimental approach, gauging\u00a0how early adopters use it and then making changes before marketing a future version to a broader audience. That would be similar to what it did with the Apple Watch. It was initially marketed as a general purpose companion to the iPhone but was later reframed as a fitness gadget.\nDespite the decline in interest, many argue it\u2019s far too soon to write off the idea of the metaverse. Companies that had been preaching the metaverse well before Meta popularized it, like Roblox and Epic Games, are still committed to their long-term visions.\nMatthew Ball, a venture capitalist who has written a book about the metaverse, said the mainstream attention to the concept after Facebook changed its name had spurred outlandish predictions about how soon people would be spending their time in immersive online worlds.\n\u201cThis was more about timeline mismanagement,\u201d Mr. Ball said. \u201cThe intense focus on the metaverse within a short period of time, with some arguing it was here now or was about to be, was bound to disappoint many.\u201d\nWith their tens of millions of participants, user-generated content and digital economies, Roblox and Epic Games,\u00a0which produces the battle royale game Fortnite, could provide a more compelling vision of a metaverse.\nRoblox, a platform with millions of games often aimed at children, had 66.1 million daily users in the first quarter of 2023, a 22 percent jump from a year earlier. Craig Donato, the company\u2019s chief business officer, said that Roblox was working on expanding into\u00a0other immersive online experiences, but that a full-fledged metaverse was still far away.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much in the first or second inning,\u201d Mr. Donato said.\nIn March,Epic Games released new toolsdesigned to help Fortnite players create and make money from\u00a0their own games on the company\u2019s platform,\u00a0spurring the creation of an online economy in Fortnite\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a cornerstone of the vision of the metaverse preached by Tim Sweeney,\u00a0the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Sweeney said mainstream interest for the metaverse attracted people who weren\u2019t really invested in the space.\n\u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people tried to attach themselves to that trend without really delivering the goods,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at the trend, it\u2019s continuing to grow, and it continues to look like exponential growth.\u201d\nBrian X.

        "title": "Can Apple Take the Metaverse Mainstream?",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s here (or it will be \u201cearly next year\u201d): Apple unveiled its long-awaited entry into virtual reality, or what the tech giant calls \u201cspatial computing,\u201d in the form ofthe Apple Vision Pro, a $3,500 device that looks like exquisitely designed futuristic ski goggles.\nThe initial reviews were mixed andskeptics questionedwhether even Apple could make virtual reality anything more than a niche technology. But boosters say that if any company can make it mainstream, it\u2019s Apple with itsecosystem of two billioniPhone, iPad and Mac users.\n\u201cWe believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary product,\u201dTim Cook told developers and journalists on Monday. It certainlylookslike an Apple product: Unlike other virtual reality headsets, an external display shows your eyes to others, and the device is controlled using hand gestures, eye movements and your voice. A dial allows you to adjust how immersed you want to be in the virtual world, which is beamed to your eyeballs via two tiny 4K screens.\nYet what Apple demonstrated on Monday were mostly immersive versions of apps like FaceTime and Safari, as well as 3-D photos and video, rather than awholly VR experience. Here\u2019s what early testers had to say:\n\u201cAt the end of the demo, I took off the headset and felt two things: 1) Wow. Very cool. 2) Did I just do drugs?\u201d wroteJoanna Sternof The Wall Street Journal.\nThe device\u2019s eye-tracking \u201cis the closest thing I\u2019ve seen to magic,\u201d said the tech reviewerMarques Brownlee.\n\u201cThe most perfect headset demo reel of all time is still just a headset demo reel,\u201d wroteNilay Patelof The Verge.\nThese are tough times for virtual reality.Enthusiasm for virtual worlds, often called the metaverse, rose during the pandemic, but waned as lockdowns eased. Investors also appear to have moved onto shinier new technologies like artificial intelligence: Metaverse-related start-upsraised about $664 millionin the first five months of 2023, down 77 percent year on year, according to PitchBook.\nBut Apple has supercharged new product categories before.Remember that the market for portable digital music players was just 3.3 million units in 2000 before Apple released the iPod; four years later, it surged to 26.4 million.\nAnd Apple is often content to play the long game: \u201cThey know this is an evolution that\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d Jeff Fieldhack of Counterpoint Research told The New York Times. (Then again,not all Apple productsturn out to be hits.)\nOthers may profit from riding Apple\u2019s coattails.Shares in theUnity, a game development platform, jumped 17 percent on Monday on the news, while those in Disney shot up after the media giant said itsDisney+ service would be availableon the Vision Pro.\nEven Meta, which has invested \u2014and lost\u2014 billions in trying to make the metaverse go mainstream, may benefit: Could its lower-cost Quest Pro, whose newest versionwill start at $500, end up becoming the Android to the Vision Pro\u2019s iPhone?\nSequoia will break itself into three.The venture capital firm said on Tuesday that its China and India investment arms wouldbecome separate businesses, citing the complexities of running a \u201cdecentralized global investment business.\u201d The move comes amid deep geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, though Sequoia executives denied that was a motivation.\nA crucial dam in southern Ukraine is destroyed.Theattack on the Kakhovka dam and power plantput scores of nearby residents, grain elevators and ports at risk and raised safety concerns about a nearby nuclear power plant. Ukraine and Russia traded blame for the attack; Russian forces control the area.\nElon Musk lets Robert Kennedy Jr. push misinformation on a Twitter broadcast.The social network\u2019s owner on Mondayhosted Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, who pushed baseless claims such as the coronavirus being a bioweapon. His comments came as Twitter executives worried that controversial content would continue tohurt the company\u2019s advertising business.\nThe Hollywood actors union votes to authorize a strike.Roughly 98 percent of SAG-AFTRA members who voted haveauthorized a work stoppage, days ahead of negotiations with film and television studios. The move comes amid the writers\u2019 strike, now in its sixth week, and follows the Directors Guild of America agreeing to a tentative deal.\nTheS.E.C. accused Binance,the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, of mishandling customer funds and misleading investors and regulators about its operations. The case announced on Monday could shake up the sector on the eve of a congressional hearing into new regulations for the industry.\nBinance is accused of mixing billions of dollars of customer fundswith a separate company owned by its C.E.O., Changpeng Zhao. The S.E.C. also asserts that Binance soldunregistered securities, and its complaint quotes an executive admitting to a colleague that the company was operating an \u201cunlicensed security exchange in the USA bro.\u201d\nThe company denied the accusations, saying it had been trying to negotiate a settlement and that the case was \u201cmisguided.\u201d But the S.E.C.\u2019s latest actions add to a growing list of accusations against Binance after theCommodity Futures Trading Commission suedit in March, saying the company illegally served U.S. customers.\nThe latest case has echoes of FTX\u2019s demise.Binance helped expedite the collapse of its rival last fall after inspecting the company\u2019s books ahead of a potential acquisition and warning that there were issues. Soon after, federal agencies began investigating FTX\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and issued civil and criminal fraud charges against the one-time crypto industry wunderkind.\nNow, Mr. Zhao, Bankman-Fried\u2019s former mentor, is facing his own potential penalties \u2014 and industry insiders say the S.E.C. case may not be the last to hit Binance.\nCrypto will be debated in Congress on Tuesday.Two House committees jointly releaseddraft crypto legislationlast week and are holdinga hearing on Tuesdayon the future of the sector. The Binance case is poorly timed for the industry\u2019s champions, as they try to shift the narrative after the FTX scandal. Shares in Coinbase, a rival exchange, fell 10 percent after the case was announced.\nThe industry has been calling for clearer regulation and the new proposal addresses wonky issues, like when a digital asset transforms from a security to a commodity. \u201cWe think this is workable and long overdue,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer who will testify, told DealBook about the bill. But the latest accusations may dominate the discussion.\nBusiness leaders are closely tracking the battle between the Federal Trade Commission and Illumina, a gene sequencing company that acquired the cancer test maker Grail for $7 billion in 2021.\nThe case is viewed as a litmus test for vertical mergers, in which a company buys a business in a similar industry, and the fight became spicier on Monday when Illumina accused the F.T.C. of operating unconstitutionally.\nThe F.T.C. has ordered Illumina to divest Grail.But Illumina says the agency is applying a new standard to vertical mergers and exercising power that goes far beyond what Congress intended for unelected administrators. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear the case and might be inclined to agree, based on its record in two cases last year.\nThe appeals court sided with payday lenders in a case challenging the constitutionality of the C.F.P.B.; the Supreme Court will review it next term.\nThe appeals court agreed with a hedge fund manager charged by the S.E.C. for violating securities laws who said the agency\u2019s enforcement power was unconstitutional; the government is petitioning for review.\nA decision could come quickly.The Fifth Circuit recently granted Illumina\u2019s request for expedited review, and a hearing is set for August. The loser will probably appeal. But the Supreme Court has made some decisions that suggest it is not so friendly to regulators, either.\nIn April, the justices ruled unanimously tostreamline federal court challengesto the constitutionality of agencies, making it easier to sue administrators.\nThe high court last year found that the E.P.A. exceeded its congressional authority with a rule on emissions.\nSome lawyers think Illumina will eventually end up before the Supreme Court, which could rule in the company\u2019s favor. But everything depends on timing: Illumina is also facing opposition in Europe and the company has said that it would sell Grail if it loses on either continent. A decision on Illumina\u2019s appeal of a European Commission move to block the deal could come late this year, which may be why the F.T.C. has been asking the Fifth Circuit to slow down.\nPark Hotels & Resorts, operator of two of the most prominent hotels in San Francisco, is handing in the keys on the properties \u2014 and, in essence, giving up on a city that hasfallen on hard times.\nPark Hotel stopped making payments on a $725 million loan tied to the Hilton Union Square and Parc 55 San Francisco, thereal estate investment trustsaidon Monday. The hotels, a few blocks from the once-bustling Moscone Center conference hall, have a combined total of nearly 3,000 rooms.\nA slowing economy and a remote-work thunderclap have emptied offices across the country, with some warning of a ticking time bomb inthe commercial real estate market.

        "title": "As U.S. and Chinese Officials Meet, Businesses Temper Their Hopes",
        "fulltext": "Ina meetingin Beijing on Friday, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, traded warm smiles with Bill Gates and praised Mr. Gates as \u201cthe first American friend\u201d he had met this year.\nThe encounters in Beijing between Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and his Chinese counterparts, starting on Sunday, are likely to feel noticeably chillier.\nThe high-level meetingsare aimed at getting the U.S.-China relationship back on track, and many American business leaders have been pushing the Biden administration to try to restore some stability in one of the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationships.\nBut for business leaders, and for officials on both sides, expectations for the meetings appear modest, with two main goals for the talks. One is to restore communication between the governments, which broke down this year aftera Chinese surveillance balloonflew into U.S. airspace and Mr. Blinken canceled a visit scheduled for February. The other is to halt any further decline in the countries\u2019 relationship.\nThere is already evidence of the impact of the fraying ties. Foreign direct investment in China has fallen toan 18-year low. A 2023 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China showed that companies still see the Chinese market as a priority, but that their willingness to invest there is declining.\n\u201cThe economic relationship has become so dismal that any sign of progress is welcome, though expectations are low for any sort of a breakthrough,\u201d said Jake Colvin, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents multinational businesses.\n\u201cThe hope is that high-level dialogues like this can start to inject some certainty for business into an increasingly fraught and unpredictable trade relationship,\u201d he said.\nStill, as one of the world\u2019s largest consumer markets and home to many factories that supply global businesses, China exerts a powerful pull. This year, as it eased its travel restrictions after three years of pandemic lockdowns, a parade of chief executives made trips to China, includingMary Barra of General Motors,Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan ChaseandStephen Schwarzman of Blackstone.\nOn a visit to China this month, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of Twitter, described the American and Chinese economies as \u201cconjoined twins\u201d and said he opposed efforts to split them. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, traveled to China in March andlaudedthe company\u2019s \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationship with the nation.\nSam Altman, the leader of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot,appeared virtuallyat a conference in Beijing this month, saying American and Chinese researchers should continue to work together to counter the risks of artificial intelligence.\nThe tech industry, which has forged lucrative relationships with Chinese manufacturers and consumers, has warily watched Washington\u2019s aggressive approach to China. While industry groups acknowledge the importance of moves to safeguard national security, they have urged the Biden administration to carefully calibrate its actions.\nWendy Cutler, a former diplomat and trade negotiator who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the United States and China might announce some small steps forward at the end of the meetings. The governments might agree, she said, to increase the paltry number of flights between their countries or the visas they are issuing to foreign visitors.\nBut both sides will have plenty of grievances to air, Ms. Cutler said. Chinese officials are likely to complain about U.S. tariffs on goods made in China and restrictions on U.S. firms selling coveted chip technology to China. American officials may highlightChina\u2019s deteriorating business environmentand its recentmove to bar companiesthat handle critical information from buying microchips made by the U.S. company Micron.\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting any breakthroughs, particularly on the economic front,\u201d Ms. Cutler said, adding, \u201cNeither side will want to be smiling.\u201d\nAmerican officials hope Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit paves the way for more cooperation, including on issues like climate change and restructuring the debt loads of developing countries. Other officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, are considering visits to China this year, and Mr. Xi and President Biden may meet directly at either the Group of 20 meetings in Delhi in September or an Asia-Pacific economic meeting in San Francisco in November.\nIn recent months, Biden officials have tried to mend the rift between the countries by arguing for a more\u201cconstructive\u201d relationship. They have echoed European officials in saying their desire is for\u201cde-risking and diversifying\u201dtheir economic relationships with China, not \u201cdecoupling.\u201d\nBut trust between the governments has eroded, and Chinese officials appear to be skeptical of how much the Biden administration can do to restore ties.\nTheextensive U.S. restrictionson the semiconductor technology that can be shared with China, which were issued in October, continue to rankle officials in Beijing. The United States has added dozens of Chinese companies to sanctions lists for aiding the Chinese military and surveillance state, or circumventing U.S. restrictions against trading with Iran and Russia.\nBiden administration officials are weighing further restrictions on China, including a long-delayed order coveringcertain U.S. venture capital investments. And the White House facesintense pressure from Congressto do more to crack down on national security threats emanating from Beijing.\nNot all companies are pushing for improved ties. Some with less exposure to China have tried to reap political benefits in Washington from the growing competition with the country. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app that has proved a formidable competitor to Instagram.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a dispute over the degree,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHow accommodating are you? How confrontational are you?\u201d\nHow aggressively companies are resisting the tensions with China, Mr. Lewis said, is linked to their exposure to the country\u2019s market.\n\u201cI think a lot of this has to do with your presence in China,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "The White House is rolling out the red carpet for Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, with a state dinner on Thursday. High on the agenda: Talks to strengthen economic and security ties as the Biden administration cultivates partners tocounter China. Business is watching closely, too, as it pours money into one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economies despite the challenges of operating there.\nElon Musk is on board.The Tesla and SpaceX C.E.O. met Mr. Modi in New York on Tuesday and said India had more promise than any other big country. Enticed by the country\u2019s sustainable energy potential,Mr. Musk saidhe hoped his electric carmaker could start doing business there \u201cas soon as humanly possible.\u201d\nIndia is booming.Mr. Modi has cannily managed to stay in the good graces of the WestandRussia since the Kremlin declared war on Ukraine. It has been a huge beneficiary of cheap Russian oil, which, in turn, has made it a high-growth, (relatively) low-inflation standout on the world stage.\nInvestors haveflockedto the country, as havecommercial giants. And, its I.P.O. market is strong, thanks to a vibrant entrepreneurial scene and tech sector.\nBut Mr. Musk made no mention of India\u2019s pressure on one of his other companies.Twitter\u2019s co-founderJack Dorseyaccused India of trying to shut down the platform in the country in 2020-21 \u2014 before Mr. Musk bought it \u2014 for refusing to remove content critical of the government. The government has denied that accusation but India has plummeted indemocracy rankings.\nBig questions abound about India, Inc.Apple has expanded production in the country but the transition is reportedly off to a rocky start.According to The Financial Times, the iPhone maker was seeing factory defect rates soar this year compared with its manufacturing output in China.\nAnda short-seller attackby Hindenburg Research on Adani Group, a sprawling Indian conglomerate founded by a close ally of Mr. Modi, has raised concerns about crony capitalism and less-than-transparent accounting standards. The Adani Group denies the accusations.\nNone of this is hitting Mr. Modi\u2019spopularityat home.A secret to that is his iron grip on the flow of information. As The Times\u2019s Mujib Mashal reports, \u201cThis is particularly true of broadcast media \u2014 large parts of the nightly news consist of anchors declaring Mr. Modi\u2019s greatness and defending him against any criticism.\u201d\nA surveillance plane picks up underwater noises in the search for the missing submersible.Rescuers are searching for thesource of the sounds, while worrying about dwindling oxygen levels in the submersible, Titan. The company that runs the vessel, OceanGate, was warned years ago aboutpotentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d safety issues.\nBritain grapples with stubbornly high inflation.Consumer prices thererose 8.7 percent in May, holding steady as a cost-of-living crisis persists. On Thursday, the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a 13th consecutive time, to 4.75 percent.\nSamuel Alito is under scrutiny for a trip with the hedge fund mogul Paul Singer.The Supreme Court justicedid not disclose a 2008 flightto an Alaskan fishing trip on a private jet provided by Mr. Singer, whose Elliott Management has been involved in cases before the court, ProPublica reports. Mr. Alito took the unusual step of defending his behavior in aWall Street Journal opinion articlebefore ProPublica\u2019s article was published.\nThe TV super-producer Ryan Murphy is poised to jump to Disney from Netflix.Mr. Murphy, whose hits include \u201cMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,\u201d is in advanced talks torejoin a teamthat helped produce earlier successes of his like \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d five years after signing a $300 million production deal with Netflix five years ago. Separately, Netflix is reportedly in talks to license somecontent from Warner Bros. Discovery.\nFor months, Masa Son, SoftBank\u2019s voluble founder, kept quiet, as his tech conglomerate has struggled with huge investment losses.\nBut as the world races to embrace artificial intelligence \u2014 something that has long fascinated him \u2014 Mr. Son used his company\u2019sannual shareholder meetingon Wednesday to publicly, and memorably,restate his commitmentto becoming a leader in the cutting-edge technology.\n\u201cWe are ready to shift to offense mode,\u201dMr. Son told investors and analysts, adding: \u201cI want SoftBank to lead the A.I. revolution.\u201d Reviving the kind of grand presentations that he long favored \u2014 who can forget the\u201cvalley of coronavirus\u201d slidein 2020, featuring flying unicorns? \u2014 the SoftBank chief began by asking, \u201cWhat is Mankind?\u201d\nThe answer, apparently, is something that can benefit from the technology behind chatbots, which has already spurred aninvestment boom. (To be fair, the potential of A.I. wasone of several central thesesbehind SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion first Vision Fund.) \u201cWhen your grandkids are our age, I believe they will be living in a reality where the computer is 10,000 times smarter than the sum of all human wisdom,\u201d he said on Wednesday. Where SoftBank would fit in, he added, was to try and \u201cbecome an architect to build the future of humankind.\u201d\nMr. Son argues that SoftBank has better days ahead.While the company\u2019s Vision Funds have suffered big paper losses amid the decimation of start-up valuations, he said that SoftBank has since amassed over $35 billion in cash in \u201cdefense mode,\u201d and was ready to invest it. (The company also stands to benefit from the forthcoming I.P.O. of Arm, the chip designer it owns.)\nAnd Mr. Son said he\u2019s excited again, after lying low last year. \u201cThere were times when I felt so empty,\u201d he told investors. \u2018Is this enough? Is this it?\u2019 I cried and cried and couldn\u2019t stop crying for days.\u201d Now, he added, \u201cI\u2019m having too much fun.\u201d\nAfter the regional banking turmoil of the spring, Washington officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have suggested that the United Statesmay need consolidationto produce stronger banks that can withstand future crises.\nBut in a speech at the Brookings Institution on Tuesday, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, suggested that his division may cast a more critical eye on banking M.&A.\nThe Justice Department plans to change how it reviews bank mergers, including by resuming \u201ccompetitive factor reports\u201d to the main regulators who oversee such transactions, including the Fed and the F.D.I.C. (It had stopped sending those reports several decades ago.)\nMore important, the department will consider a broader range of potential effects from a deal beyond concentrations in deposits and overlap of branches, including on fees, interest rates and customer service.\nAnd if banks proceed with a transaction that Mr. Kanter\u2019s team opposes, the department could sue, as it did to blockPhiladelphia National Bank\u2019s effortto merge with Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank in 1963.\nThat could chill efforts to consolidate U.S. banking.While the country has fewer regional lenders than it once did \u2014 about 4,100, down from about 10,000 in 1990 \u2014 some in the industry believe that\u2019s still too many. Canada has about 30 banks.\nBank executives and deal makers have stressed that smaller banks will face more challenges in complying with capital requirements meant to head off the kind of runs that felled Silicon Valley Bank. (Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that regulatory pressures could subtract 3 percent to 6 percent from smaller banks\u2019 return on equity.)\n\u201cDo you even want us to exist?\u201d Ken Vecchione, the C.E.O. of Western Alliance, which was battered during the recent crisis, said he has recently been asking regulators.\n\u2014Jennifer Christie, the chief people officer of the software maker DocuSign. The company is planning to test tweaks to its hybrid-working system this summer, as corporate America pushes employees to return to the office full-time.\nLawmakers descended on Detroit on Tuesday for a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d that quickly turned political over the car companies\u2019 ties to China.\nAt a gathering with the C.E.O.s of Ford and General Motors, Jim Farley and Mary Barra, Congress members from the right and leftsent the messagethat decoupling from China was becoming an economic and security imperative.\nFord faced a grilling.Lawmakersasked about its plans, announced in February, to build a $3.5 billion factory in Michigan producing electric vehicle batteries with technology licensed from the Chinese manufacturer CATL, a deal that showsthe difficulty of decouplingsupply chains.\nFord could qualify for special tax credits.The Inflation Reduction Act aimed to incentivize domestic battery making, and Ford may stand to benefit even though its partner has close ties to the Chinese government.\nFord has insisted benefits won\u2019t accrue to CATL, adding that domestic manufacturing is good for the economy. But critics say the deal undermines the I.R.A. \u201cThe goal of the Inflation Reduction Act was to reduce dependency on China \u2014 we want to make sure we\u2019re advancing towards that goal,\u201d said, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the recently created House committee on competition with China.\nRaja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the top Democrat on that committee, left the meetings with similar concerns. He said the U.S. should be doing more to favor American businesses in this emerging sector, and investing heavily in innovation to shake dependence on Chinese supply.\nThe politicians said they didn\u2019t go to Detroit to pressure Ford, but the carmaker\u2019s CATL alliancehas become a hot political topic. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a longtime China hawk, introduced legislation in Marchto block tax creditsfor batteries produced using Chinese tech. He called for an immediate review of the Ford deal by the Treasury Department\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nNeither Ford nor the Treasury Department responded to a request for comment.\nDeals\nKKR will buy up to $44 billion worth ofbuy-now-pay-later loans from PayPal, as the investment firm works to expand its growing private-credit business.

        "title": "Apple Knows You Didn\u2019t Mean to Type \u2018Ducking\u2019",
        "fulltext": "Apple on Monday announced an updated autocorrect function that aims to more accurately reflect users\u2019 intended word choices, pleasing customers whose attempts to swear in texts have long been replaced with \u201cduck\u201d or \u201cducking\u201d (and freeing innocent waterfowl from their unfortunate association with an obscenity).\n\u201cIn those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering.\nThe update wasannouncedon the first day of Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company also introduced itsVision Proheadset. The company said the new keyboard features would be available as part of the iOS 17 software package expected to arrive later this year.\nAutocorrect will use atype of neural network called a transformer modelto recognize iPhone users\u2019 most frequently-typed words and offer predictive text,according to Apple. Transformer models, which are at the heart of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, analyze large amounts of text for patterns.\n\u201cDucking\u201d had become such a recognizable error caused by the iPhone\u2019s autocorrect function that The Wall Street Journal conducted an interview with the feature\u2019s creator, Ken Kocienda,at a duck farm.\nThat system drew upon both a \u201cstatic dictionary\u201d of common words and proper nouns as well as a \u201cdynamic dictionary\u201d of words that each user typed often, Mr. Kocienda said. But it also did not correct close misspellings of curse words, he said, with the goal of preventing users from accidentally inserting vulgarity into their messages.\nThe update will allow iMessage corrections to better consider a word\u2019s context in a sentence, said Yulan He, a professor of natural language processing at King\u2019s College London whose given name is usually changed by iMessage to \u201cTulane.\u201d\nPreviously, autocorrect matched the spelling of each word, in isolation, against the words in its dictionaries. \u201cNow, when they replace a word, they would ensure the replaced word will still maintain the original meaning of the sentence,\u201d Professor He said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a key difference.\u201d\nAutocorrect, which was developed in the 1980s to accompany word processing programs, has beencreating problemsfor as long as it has been solving them.\nIn 2014, Naomi Campbellcongratulated \u201cmalaria\u201don winning the Nobel Peace Prize. (She might have meant\u201cMalala.\u201d) According toWired, employees at Goldman Sachs were upset that Microsoft Word corrected their company\u2019s name to incorporate a profanity. The phrase \u201cautocorrect made me do it\u201d has become a way of explaining away embarrassing substitutions such as \u201csex\u201d instead of \u201csec.\u201d\nJillian Madison, who curated a website of autocorrect blunders, released the book \u201cDamn You, Autocorrect!\u201d in 2011. \u201cIf you say, you know, \u2018I\u2019m going to run and pick up the kids,\u2019 it often turns into, \u2018I\u2019m going to run and pick up the LSD,\u2019\u201d shetold NPR.\nIn Apple\u2019s presentation, Mr. Federighi said that the new system would make autocorrect \u201cmore accurate than ever.\u201d The update will also allow users to tap an autocorrected word to revert it back to what they had typed."

It\u2019s a sign that near-limitless oil money can\u2019t buy everything \u2014 but the complicated arrangements to bring Messi to Florida also hint at what it takes to trump Saudi riches.\nWhat Mr. Messi stands to get:Contract details haven\u2019t been released, but what\u2019s known about Inter Miami\u2019s offer to the Argentine star includes a roster spot free from the limits of M.L.S. salary rules and, highly unusually, an ownership stake in Inter Miami once his playing career ends.\nBut the commercial partnerships that Inter Miami crafted may have given the team a leg up on the Saudis, in the form of revenue-sharing agreements with Adidas and Apple, major M.L.S. commercial partners.\nWhile it\u2019s not unheard-of for sportswear companies tohelp pay for transfersof major soccer players, the iPhone maker\u2019s contribution is more unusual. Mr. Messi coming to the M.L.S. couldturbocharge subscriptionsto the Apple TV+ streaming service, which recently paid $2.5 billion for the rights to stream the league\u2019s matches for 10 years. (Apple also announced on Wednesday that it would produce a multipart documentary series about the soccer star.)\nInter Miami had to get extremely creative to trump Saudi Arabia,which reportedly offered Mr. Messi as much as $500 million to play in its homegrown soccer league and sees sports as part of its campaign to become a bigger geopolitical force.\nThe kingdom has already lured other top players in hopes of quickly making it a world-class competition. The Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, for instance, is playing on Saudi pitches for $100 million a year, while Karim Benzema of France just signed on as well. And it handedownership of four of the country\u2019s top clubsto its powerful sovereign wealth fund to boost their financial firepower as the kingdom looks to bid to host the men\u2019s World Cup in 2030.\nMr. Messi also already had ties to Saudi Arabia, in the form of a multimillion-dollar spokesman role for the country\u2019s tourism board.\nBeating Middle Eastern money isn\u2019t impossible, but it is hard.A driver of the proposed merger of the PGA Tour and LIV was the prospect of an extended legal battle between the golf circuits \u2014 one that Saudi Arabia has more than enough money to keep waging.\nSaudi Arabia and other Gulf States, including Abu Dhabi and Qatar, have bought and transformedbig European soccer franchisesby simply being willing to spend more money than anyone else possibly could.\nThat said, the PGA-LIV deal is far from done.Whileanalystsand high-profile golf fans like the financierHenry Kravispraised the proposed transaction, Senate Democratscalled for an investigation. And the Justice Department was still investigating the PGA Tour for potential antitrust violations. Andother golf aficionados\u2014 as well as some players, includingRory McIlroy, who begrudgingly accepted the deal \u2014 remain deeply skeptical, if not downright opposed, to LIV.\nHard-line Republicans paralyze the House.Members of the House Freedom Caucusmaintained control of the chamber\u2019s floor, forcing Speaker Kevin McCarthy to scrap votes for the rest of the week. The intraparty feud raised concerns about whether Mr. McCarthy, who enraged conservatives by agreeing to the debt ceiling compromise, can continue to govern.\nThe Eurozone falls into recession.The bloc\u2019seconomy contracted 0.4 percentin the three months to March, the second consecutive quarterly decline, according to the E.U. statistics agency, as surging inflation following the war in Ukraine hit household spending.\nSenators accuse TikTok of misleading Congress.Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee,questioned statements made under oathby top executives about how the Chinese-owned app handles and stores American user data. Separately, a former executive of ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent, accused ByteDance of helping the Beijing authoritiesspy on Hong Kong protesters.\nCNN\u2019s future is under scrutiny after its chief is fired.Chris Licht was dismissedas the news outlet\u2019s C.E.O., after a rocky 13-month tenure during which he lost support from top talent and, ultimately, his patron, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav. Shares in Warner Bros. Discovery rose 8 percent on Wednesday, but it\u2019s unclearwhom Mr. Zaslav will hireto reverse the network\u2019s falling fortunes.\nGameStop ousts its C.E.O. and elevates its top shareholder.The video game retailerfired Matt Furlong, while giving Ryan Cohen, the activist investor who became its chairman, a promotion to executive chairman. Shares in GameStop fell 19 percent on Wednesday; the company has been struggling to return to profitability amid a consumer shift to downloading game titles.\nDon\u2019t put away your masks just yet: Health alerts were extended on Thursday for wide swaths of the United States, from the Northeast to the Midwest and the South, as noxious wildfire smoke continues to drift down from Canada.\nThe F.A.A., which had slowed air traffic to and from New York on Wednesday, issued an alert on Thursday morning that inbound flights to La Guardia Airportwould be groundedbecause of low visibility. That order could be extended to Newark and J.F.K. International airports as well, the agency said.\nBusinesses and schools in scores of American cities have suffered from the haze of tiny particles, akin to car or coal plant fumes, illustrating how unprepared much of the country is for climate crises.\nNew York City had some of the worst air quality of any city in the world on Wednesday,according to reports, delaying flights and canceling outdoorandindoor events includingBroadway shows, \u201cHamlet\u201d in Central Park and a New York Yankees game. Al fresco dining was a no-go, too.\nMany businesses, including Google (which recently urged its workers to return to the office), suggested that employeeswork from home if possible.\nThe city may seesome improvementon Thursday. But the air quality in Philadelphia is hitting dangerous levels and haze is being seen as far south as Alabama. Meanwhile, the White House said the United States planned to send 600 firefighters and other specialists to Canada to help combat the blazes, which total nearly 250 fires.\nWildfire disruptions are becoming increasingly costly.The toll of smoke on the U.S. economy is nowabout $125 billion a year, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nExpect more of these kinds of emergencies.While no research has yet linked this week\u2019s events to climate change, the climbing global temperatures \u2014 driven in large part by human activity \u2014 are making parts of the earthmore prone to wildfiresand other catastrophes.\nAnd the expected arrival of the weather event known as El Ni\u00f1o later this year could exacerbate matters, creating even more wildfires.\n\u2014 Ken Griffin, on cheerleaders of new artificial intelligence services.Speaking to new interns of Citadel, his financial giant, he warned that while new advances would yield many benefits, they\u2019re years away from becoming reality.\nIt\u2019s now an open question whether the Fed next week will leave interest rates unchanged, a decision that investors have called a \u201cFed pause,\u201d or raise them.\nMarket futures on Thursday morning were pricing in a 35 percent chance of a rate increase at the June 13-14 meeting. That\u2019s far from a certainty, but the odds have grown more likely in recent days \u2014 and a ratecutlater this year looks to be off the table.\nInvestors believe that taming inflation will take longer than expected.The central banks of Canada and Australia surprised economists this week by raising interest rates, signaling that more aggressive monetary policy will be needed to slow consumer spending and bring down prices.\nThe upshot: Yields on sovereign debt across the globe have spiked, raising borrowing prices for consumers and businesses.\nA Treasury borrowing boom is also weighing on the markets.Now that the debt ceiling deal is law, the federal government will replenish its coffers by auctioning off roughly $1 trillion in Treasury bills this summer.\nThat coming tsunami of debt could push borrowing costs higher still and trigger a kind of liquidity crunch for lenders,Wall Street analysts warn.\nThat\u2019s making investors wary of rate-sensitive sectors.Tech stocks slumped on Wednesday and were under pressure again in premarket trading this morning. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been one of the biggest gainers this year as investors bet that the Fed is reaching the end of its rate-raising cycle, putting a ceiling on borrowing costs.\nStill, tech stocks have been lifted by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, and that rally may not yet have run its course. Analysts at Goldman Sachs calculate that widespread A.I. adoption during the next decade could lift G.D.P., boost corporate profits and drive a potentially substantial surge in the S&P 500 over that period.\nThe market\u2019s uplift from A.I. is coming fromjust a few companies\u2014 but that has been enough to push the entire benchmark index to its highest level since August.\nDeals\nToshiba\u2019s board recommended that shareholders of the Japanese electronics giantaccept a $14 billion takeover bidby an investor consortium.

        "title": "But Would You Wear It?",
        "fulltext": "They talked about the optics. They talked about the computer specs. They talked about the \u201clenticular glass\u201d and the \u201cnew spatial computing platform\u201d and the \u201caluminum alloy\u201d used in the \u201cprimary structural element.\u201d\nBut the one thing Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, and Mike Rockwell, the head of the AR/VR team, and the rest of the Apple executives involved in the introduction of the newApple Vision Pro, the long-awaited augmented reality headset, did not really discuss was the actual look of the thing.\nYet if they want people to believe that it will \u201cshift the way we look at technology and the role it plays in our lives,\u201d as Mr. Cook put it during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, how we will look when wearing it matters. After all, what they are talking about is not just something you may use every day. It\u2019s something that in order to use, you have to put on every day. And not just put on, but put on your face.\nThat\u2019s an incredibly personal act, one that isn\u2019t just about interacting with technology, but interacting with the world around us. It\u2019s about the messages we send to others about who we are and what we value, and the judgments others make about us in return. We know from wearing masks to combat Covid that any item that covers part of a face is an item that becomes an emotive lightning rod.\nSo what does the Apple Vision Pro, which many viewers said looks like pretty sleek gray and black ski goggles with a 3D-printed ribbed fabric band that circles the head, say about its wearer?\nMaybe, I\u2019m a supercool couch slalom master from a land far, far away. Or an evolved species of alien ant.\nThe truth is, it\u2019s a little hard to know \u2014 not just because I am assessing it from far away, but because none of the people involved in the Vision Pro demonstration modeled the headset. Not Mr. Cook or Bob Iger of Disney, who surprised the audience with an appearance to announce a deal to show Disney programming on the headset, or Mr. Rockwell. Which raised a question: Why didn\u2019t they wear it?\nMaybe they were concerned that they would look silly. (There is an unfortunate mouselike tail on the headset dangling down by one ear, which is the cable that connects the battery pack.) That the pictures of them looking silly in their new product would then be made into memes, and that \u2026 well, you know what happens next. Social media mockery!\nThere were pictures, of course, of the goggles looking very sleek against a black background. There was a neat video of assorted happy individuals using the product in the comfort of their pristine rose-tinted homes and anonymous hotel rooms.\nBut the lack of an actual person strutting the stage in Cupertino, Calif., wearing the product was a notable omission. As was the fact that no one talked about the design except in terms of its functionality \u2014 and the fact that the device allows others to see a wearer\u2019s eyes, a real step forward in the world of headset style. (They also didn\u2019t utter the word \u201cwearables.\u201d)\nYet, if any company should know how much aesthetics matter in transforming a piece of tech into an accessory for life, it is Apple. That has always been part of its distinction, beginning with the iMac in its many colors. It\u2019s how the iPod and the iPhone made the leap from consumer goods to markers of taste and identity. With their rounded corners and slim lines, they just looked so good; so sleek and cool. They spurred desire, the way a great handbag does, even before utility is taken into consideration.\nAnd there may be no device Apple has made where aesthetics will matter as much as on this one.\nThere\u2019s no hiding it. This may be why tech companies have struggled with glasses, an accessory they are seemingly convinced is some sort of next frontier in personal tech, but which no one has ever quite cracked: notGoogle with its glassesorMeta with its Ray-Ban collaboration or itsBalmain x Oculus. If the eyes are the windows to the soul, what you put around them matters in a sort of profound way.\nBy making the Vision Pro look like goggles, Apple is wading into the shoals of pre-existing stereotypes, personality clich\u00e9s and history. We choose glasses for all sorts of reasons: to look smart, to look cool, to look glamorous; to look like Gloria Steinem or Jack Nicholson or John Lennon. Most of all, to look individual. And walking around with half your face covered by glass, no matter how swirly the screen, is a signifier for pod people. (On the other hand, if you secretly harbor fantasies of looking like Eileen Gu, this may be for you.)\nTo be fair, maybe that will change. Maybe by the time the headset arrives in stores next year, priced at about $3,500, the headstraps will be available in a variety of colors and materials, and the device itself will come in a shade other than putty, allowing some form of self-expression. Maybe it will be possible to bedazzle the goggles (that would be fun) or add stickers or decorate the cord. Apple has clearly worked pretty hard on the fit, with all sorts of adjustable components, which is something. And it weighs only about a pound.\nMaybe Apple is betting that ultimately the tech appeal will trump fashion, though its experience withthe watchwould suggest that\u2019s an incorrect assumption. Or perhaps, like the watch, this is an acknowledgment that design, when it comes to Apple, is now a secondary consideration. Jony Ive, the man who, along with Steve Jobs, was most responsible for establishing its style vocabulary, stepped back from the company in 2019.\nThat may also be why the big Vision Pro reveal video featured people using the headset when they were by themselves or, at most, with their family around, as opposed to in any sort of public space. (OK, one person was on an airplane, though arguably that\u2019s a place where you want to pretend there\u2019s no one else around.)\nBecause the fact is, while no one wants to look like a fashion victim, no one wants to look like a victim of fashions in tech, either.\n"
