        "title": "When the A.I. Professor Leaves, Students Suffer, Study Says",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, big tech companies have used huge salaries, bonuses and stock packages to lure artificial intelligence experts out of academia. Now, a study released on Friday says that migration has hurt the post-college prospects of students.\nThe study, the first of its kind, was conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester. They found that over the last 15 years, 153 artificial intelligence professors in North American universities left their posts for industry. An additional 68 moved into industry while retaining part-time roles with their universities.\nThis migration has greatly increased in recent years, the study said. From 2004 to 2009, 26 university professors moved into industry. In 2018 alone, 41 professors made the move. The steep rise in departures over the last decade and a half indicates that the trend will continue.\nThe talent shift could accelerate the development of artificial intelligence inside tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple.\nBut at the universities the professors left, graduating students were less likely to create new A.I. companies. When they did, they attracted smaller amounts of funding, according to the study. The effect was most pronounced in the field of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d a technology that has become a crucial part of new A.I. systems.\nIn time, the brain drain from academia could hamper innovation and growth across the economy, the study argued. \u201cThe knowledge transfer is lost, and because of that, so is innovation,\u201d said Michael Gofman, a finance professor at the University of Rochester and one of the authors of the study.\nDeep learning is driven by \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of dog photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.\nUntil 2010, the tech industry largely ignored the idea. But as the internet generated more data andnew computer chips reduced the time needed to analyze it, the technique started to make more sense for the companies that had all that information.\nMachine learning helps A.I. systems perform tasks like recognizing photos, identifying spoken words and translating languages. It also helps self-driving cars recognize objects and make decisions.\nBig tech companies have hired many of the academics who specialized in the technique.Three longtime academics recently won the Turing Award\u2014 often called the Nobel Prize of computing \u2014 for their work on neural networks. Two have moved into industry, one to Google and the other to Facebook.\nThe tech and automobile industries have aggressively pursued the idea of a driverless car, drawing another wave of academics out of the universities. In 2015,Uber hired 40 peoplefrom a Carnegie Mellon robotics lab, including research professors.\nSince then, industry interest in artificial intelligence of all kinds has increased, according to the study. Google and DeepMind, both owned by Alphabet, have hired 23 professors. Amazon has hired 17, Microsoft has hired 13, and Uber, Nvidia and Facebook have each hired seven.\nTech companies disagree with the notion that they are plundering academia. A Google spokesman, for example, said the company was an enthusiastic supporter of academic research.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given over $250 million to academic research since 2005, and every year we host over 30 visiting faculty, dozens of Ph.D. students and thousands of interns,\u201d said the spokesman, Jason Freidenfelds. He said many professors went to work at Google and returned to their university positions.\nThe study found that students most affected by the departures were those who graduated four to six years later, meaning they probably had little interaction of the departing professors. At any given university, a significant increase in the number of departing professors reduced the number of A.I. entrepreneurs by 13 percent.\nThe impact was particularly notable at top 10 universities and with entrepreneurs who completed Ph.D.s.\nSome experts worry that as top professors move into industry, the education of the next generation of students will suffer.\n\u201cIf industry keeps hiring the cutting-edge scholars, who will train the next generation of innovators in artificial intelligence?\u201d Ariel Procaccia, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, said in arecent op-edpiece for Bloomberg.\nAt Carnegie Mellon, 17 professors, all of them tenured, have moved into industry, the study showed. Some were part of that mass hire by Uber. The University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley, each saw 11 make the move.\nThe Rochester study did not directly analyze the quality of the training students received after these professors departed. Instead, it focused on the start-up economy, showing that departures led to fewer student start-ups. When professors left universities and were replaced by professors from lower-ranked schools, students were even less likely to create a start-up, the study said.\nExperts are split on whether a decline in the start-up economy will harm the progress of A.I.\n\u201cJust because students are not starting their own firms does not mean they are not going to work in A.I.,\u201d said Joshua Graff Zivin, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThey just may be doing this in other ways.\u201d\nBut many agree that university funding should be increased to ensure that the next generation is properly educated.\n\u201cMachine learning and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting and rapidly expanding fields in science,\u201d said Scott Stern, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Business. \u201cWe need to make sure we are investing in the seed corn.\u201d"

        "title": "E.U. Court Orders Fiat Chrysler to Pay Back $33 Million in Taxes",
        "fulltext": "LUXEMBOURG \u2014 The second-highest court in the European Union ruled on Tuesday that the automaker Fiat Chrysler must pay back about $33 million in taxes that it saved by carving out a deal with Luxembourg, a decision that could have implications in cases involving other global corporations, including a multibillion-dollar suit against Apple.\nBut the European Union General Court upheld an appeal in a similar case in which Starbucks struck a tax deal with the Netherlands, allowing the American coffee giant to avoid repaying 25.7 million euros in taxes.\nBoth cases offered clues about what might happen with an enormous suit against Apple, which is accused by the European Commission of having unlawfully avoided $14.5 billion in taxes by striking a similar deal with Ireland. The cases solidify the commission\u2019s power to determine the legality of member states\u2019 tax deals with companies and, if they are ruled illegal, to order states to recoup those taxes.\nThe commission, the European Union\u2019s executive branch, has proved to be a formidable regulator and has claimed that some preferential deals breach the bloc\u2019s competition law.\nThe Apple case is seen as a consequential test for Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition. Ms. Vestager\u2019srole was expandedthis month, making her the world\u2019s most powerful regulator. She will continue as antitrust commissioner but will have additional powers as digital and technology regulator in issues like data privacy, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Starting Nov. 1, Ms. Vestager will be able to make rules that affect tech firms and initiate cases when she thinks those rules are being broken.\nOn Tuesday, the European Union court ruled for the first time that the commission has the power to verify whether tax rulings granted by member states to individual companies confer an advantage under national law and therefore are in breach of European competition law. If an advantage is proved, such tax rulings should be considered illegal state aid, the court ruled, incompatible with the rules of the bloc\u2019s internal market.\nThe court also upheld the commission\u2019s calculation of \u20ac30 million in illegal state aid granted to Fiat Chrysler, and cleared the way for Luxembourg to recoup the money immediately.\nFiat did not publicly respond to the ruling on Tuesday. It can appeal to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in the bloc. Luxembourg\u2019s Finance Ministry said it would take time to \u201canalyze the judgment.\u201d\nIn a similar case involving a deal Starbucks made with the Netherlands, the court again upheld the commission\u2019s jurisdiction over selective tax rulings. But it annulled a \u20ac25.7 million fine, saying that the commission did not sufficiently demonstrate any advantage for Starbucks under Dutch law.\n\u201cIt is good that we now have clarity,\u201d Menno Snel, a Dutch junior minister for finance, said in a response to the ruling.\nThe Netherlands \u201cdid not treat Starbucks any differently or more favorably than other companies,\u201d he said. But he conceded that illegal tax avoidance schemes must be tackled and that \u201cit is therefore appropriate that the commission should examine the tax treatment of individual companies as part of its state aid investigations.\u201d\nFiat had appealed a lower-court ruling of its case, which deemed its tax deal with Luxembourg illegal. In its appeal, it argued that the ruling may lead to a de facto retroactive fine for companies operating in what they consider to be a legal environment. The General Court rejected that argument, saying the recouped taxes do not \u201cbreach the principle of legal certainty or infringe the rights of the defense.\u201d\nBut Starbucks\u2019s appeal, which was upheld, also sets a high standard for the commission to prove that an illegal advantage has been granted by a national tax ruling.\n\u201cThe court rulings prove the strengths and weaknesses of using the E.U.\u2019s state aid rules to fight tax dumping,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament and spokesman for financial affairs for the Greens party.\n\u201cWe should not have to rely on lengthy commission investigations and court decisions to achieve tax justice,\u201d he said, adding that European state aid rules should be improved.\nThe commission started investigating Fiat Chrysler\u2019s tax deal shortly after the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2014 revealed thousands of pages of confidential information detailing secret tax rulings by Luxembourg for hundreds of multinational corporations from 2002 to 2010."

        "title": "How Apple\u2019s Apps Topped Rivals in the App Store It Controls",
        "fulltext": "ByJack NicasandKeith CollinsSept. 9, 2019\nIf you opened the App Store on an iPhone in May 2018 and typed\u201cpodcast\u201din the search box, you would have seen something like this.\nThe first result (after anad) would have been anapp made by Apple: Apple Podcasts.\nThe next result would have been Apple\u2019s Compass app.\nThen its Find My Friends app.\nThen more from Apple, all unrelated to podcasting.\nOn some days, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by a different publisher.\nThis, according to Apple, was how the App Store was supposed to work.\nTop spots in App Store search results are some of the most fought over real estate in the online economy. The store generated more than $50 billion in sales last year, and the company said two-thirds of app downloads started with a search.\nBut as Apple has become one of the largest competitors on a platform that it controls, suspicions that the company has been tipping the scales in its own favor are at the heart of antitrust complaints in the United States, Europe and Russia.\nApple\u2019s apps have ranked first recently for at least 700 search terms in the store, according to a New York Times analysis of six years of search results compiled by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Some searches produced as many as 14 Apple apps before showing results from rivals, the analysis showed. (Though competitors could pay Apple to place ads above the Apple results.)\nPresented with the results of the analysis, two senior Apple executives acknowledged in a recent interview that, for more than a year, the top results of many common searches in the iPhone App Store were packed with the company\u2019s own apps. That was the case even when the Apple apps were less relevant and less popular than ones from its competitors. The executives said the company had since adjusted the algorithm so that fewer of its own apps appeared at the top of search results.\nThe Times\u2019s analysis of App Store data \u2014 which included rankings of more than 1,800 specific apps across 13 keywords since 2013 \u2014 illustrated the influence as well as the opacity of the algorithms that underpin tech companies\u2019 platforms.\nThose algorithms can help decide which apps are installed, which articles are read and which products are bought. But Apple and other tech giants like Facebook and Google will not explain in detail how such algorithms work \u2014 even when they blame the algorithm for problems.\nPhilip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the App Store, and Eddy Cue, the senior vice president who oversees many of the Apple apps that benefited from the results, said there was nothing underhanded about the algorithm the company had built to display search results in the store.\nThe executives said the company did not manually alter search results to benefit itself. Instead, they said, Apple apps generally rank higher than competitors because of their popularity and because their generic names are often a close match to broad search terms.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the way we run search in the App Store that\u2019s designed or intended to drive Apple\u2019s downloads of our own apps,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cWe\u2019ll present results based on what we think the user wants.\u201d\nApple added its apps to the App Store in June 2016. Since then, it has been the top result for many popular search terms, according to the Sensor Tower data. Those Apple apps held on for years while top rivals remained stuck below, sometimes hundreds of spots down the list, the data shows.\nBefore Apple Music arrived in the App Store, Spotify was for years the first result in searches for \u201cmusic.\u201d\nShortly after Apple Music was added to the store in June 2016, it took the top spot. By then, Spotify had fallen to fourth place.\nIn Feb. 2018,Apple appssuddenly appeared in the top six results for \"music\"\nBy the end of 2018, there were eight, some of which were unrelated to music. At this point, Spotify was the 23rd result.\nSpotify complained to European regulators in March that Apple was abusing its role as the gatekeeper of the App Store. By April, all but two of Apple\u2019s apps disappeared from the top results for \u201cmusic.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the company could not verify the data because it did not keep a record of historical search results.\nThe company is facing the most direct legal challenge in the United States to the clout it has built up through its App Store. In May, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 toallow an antitrust class action against Appleto move forward, saying consumers should be allowed to try to prove that the technology giant had used monopoly power to raise the prices of iPhone apps.\nWhen multiple Apple apps packed the search results, such as in searches for \u201cmusic,\u201d the Apple executives attributed the results to a feature of the App Store search engine that sometimes grouped apps by maker. They tweaked that feature in July so Apple apps would no longer look as if they were receiving special treatment. Many Apple apps dropped as a result.\nStill, the executives denied that there had been a problem that needed fixing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not corrected,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s improved,\u201d said Mr. Cue.\nSeveral consultants who study the App Store algorithm to help companies rank higher said Apple\u2019s consistent success in the marketplace was suspicious. Algorithms are automated systems designed to largely run on their own. But it is humans who decide what algorithms measure. And those decisions can be subjective.\n\u201cI find it hard to believe that organically there are certain Apple apps that rank better than higher-reviewed, more downloaded competitors,\u201d said Todd Dunham, chief executive of the ASO Project, which consults app makers on how to rank higher in the results.\nSome of the search results found in The Times\u2019s analysis appeared \u201csteered,\u201d said Eric Enge, an App Store consultant for Perficient, a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s no question that the app universe is one of the major battlegrounds out there, and there\u2019s just a ton to be gained commercially by dominating,\u201d he said.\nThe average number ofApple appsat the\ntop of search results by month\n\u201cmusic\u201d\n#1\n5\n10\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201ctv\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cvideo\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cmaps\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\nThe average number ofApple appsat the top of search results by month\n\u201cmusic\u201d\n#1\n5\n10\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201ctv\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cvideo\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cmaps\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\nThe average number ofApple appsat the\ntop of search results by month\n\u201cmusic\u201d\n#1\n5\n10\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201ctv\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cvideo\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cmaps\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\nThe average number ofApple appsat the\ntop of search results by month\n\u201cmusic\u201d\n#1\n5\n10\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201ctv\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cvideo\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\n\u201cmaps\u201d\n#1\n5\nApr. \u201818\nJuly \u201818\nOct. \u201818\nJan. \u201819\nApr. \u201819\nJuly \u201819\nThe search algorithm in the App Store was built by a small team of engineers in Cupertino, Calif., some of whom said in a separate interview arranged by Apple that they hadn\u2019t noticed for months that Apple was dominating search results for music and other categories.\nOnce they did notice, they said, a single engineer decided to change the algorithm.\nThe engineers said they had to be vague when talking about how their algorithm worked, to avoid revealing too much to fraudsters looking to game it. The algorithm examines 42 different signals, they said, including an app\u2019s relevance to a given search, its ratings, and its popularity based on downloads and user clicks.\nApple introduced the App Store in 2008, and it quickly revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for people to download games, tools for work and social-networking services. More than two million apps are available on the App Store.\nApple\u2019s tight control of its App Store has led to a marketplace that appears to be less susceptible to fraud than the Play Store, the app marketplace on Android smartphones that is run by Google. Google\u2019s Play Store results are partly personalized, so each person might see a different set of results.\nCompanies like Facebook, Spotify and Yelp have thrived on Apple\u2019s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google\u2019s Play Store.\nTo get their apps discovered, companies try to push them up the ranks in the App Store\u2019s search results. There is an industry of consultants who charge for their expertise on setting the right title, description and other details to please the App Store algorithm.\nBut Apple\u2019s algorithm also appears to have been a boon for its own apps.\nOn Aug. 21, Apple apps ranked first in 735 of roughly 60,000 search terms tracked by Sensor Tower. Most of the tracked searches were obscure, but Apple\u2019s apps ranked first for many of the popular queries. For instance, for most of June and July, Apple apps were the top result for these search terms: books, music, news, magazines, podcasts, video, TV, movies, sports, card, gift, money, credit, debit, fitness, people, friends, time, notes, docs, files, cloud, storage, message, home, store, mail, maps, traffic, stocks and weather.\nAlgorithm\nchange \u2014\n1.2%\nShare of keywords for which\nApple apps have ranked first\n1.0\n0.8\niOS 12\n0.6\niOS 11\n0.4\niOS 10 beta released\nto developers\n0.2\n2017\n2018\n2019\n1.2%\n1.0\nShare of keywords for which\nApple apps have ranked first\n0.8\niOS 12\n0.6\niOS 11\niOS 10 beta released to developers\n0.4\nAlgorithm\nchange \u2014\n0.2\n2017\n2018\n2019\n1.2%\n1.0\nShare of keywords for which\nApple apps have ranked first\n0.8\niOS 12\n0.6\niOS 11\niOS 10 beta released to developers\n0.4\nAlgorithm\nchange \u2014\n0.2\n2017\n2018\n2019\n1.2%\n1.0\nShare of keywords for which\nApple apps have ranked first\n0.8\niOS 12\n0.6\niOS 11\niOS 10 beta released to developers\n0.4\nAlgorithm\nchange \u2014\n0.2\n2017\n2018\n2019\nThe Wall Street Journal also found thatApple apps regularly ranked first for many searchesin an analysis of 600 searches over two days in June.\nApple succeeded in some of the App Store\u2019s most hotly contested search results. At least four Apple apps led the results for \u201cTV\u201d from at least June 2018 to last month. Netflix has been stuck mostly in the hundreds.\nIf you searched for \u201cpodcast\u201d in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.\nWhile the Apple Podcasts app has held the No. 1 spot for \u201cpodcast\u201d searches since June 2016, other popular podcast apps have struggled in the rankings. A competitor named Stitcher, for instance, has been stuck in the hundreds of podcast search results since June 2018.\nThat has taken a toll on Stitcher\u2019s business. Amy Fitzgibbons, Stitcher\u2019s marketing chief, said people searching \u201cpodcast\u201d accounted for the majority of Stitcher\u2019s downloads on Google\u2019s rival Play Store. \u201cIn the Apple App Store, \u2018podcast\u2019 did not even rank as a source of downloads for us,\u201d she said.\nThe Times analysis uncovered other surprising examples of Apple apps\u2019 success. On March 25, the company unveiled an Apple-branded credit card that can be used via the Apple Wallet app. The next day, Apple Wallet was the No. 1 result in searches for \u201cmoney,\u201d \u201ccredit\u201d and \u201cdebit.\u201d The app had not ranked for those search terms before then.\nMr. Cue and other Apple executives speculated that the team marketing the Apple Wallet app had added \u201cmoney,\u201d \u201ccredit\u201d and \u201cdebit\u201d to the underlying description of the app, causing it to appear for those search results.\nThen people searched those terms, found the Apple Wallet app and clicked on it, telling the algorithm that it should be the first result.\n\u201cWe can just tell you that we\u2019ve not done anything to drive that \u2014 that is, other than launching a great wallet, an Apple Card and marketing the heck out of it,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.\nWhen search results were flooded with Apple apps, Apple executives said, the algorithm concluded that people were looking for a specific Apple app and decided to surface other apps by the same developer.\nThat wasn\u2019t always to Apple\u2019s benefit. For instance, they said, searching \u201coffice\u201d returns a series of Microsoft apps because the algorithm recognizes they are looking for Microsoft Office tools.\nApple engineers said the algorithm believed people searching \u201cmusic\u201d wanted just Apple Music because users clicked on the Apple Music app so frequently. Apple Music had a distinct advantage over other apps: It comes preinstalled on iPhones. Apple said some people used the search engine to find apps that were already on their phones.\nWhen people search \u201cmusic,\u201d the App Store reminds them that they already have Apple Music installed. Many people then click on the app, the engineers said, adding to its popularity in the eyes of the algorithm.\nOver the past several months, Apple engineers said, they began noticing how the algorithm was packing results with Apple apps. First, they stopped the algorithm from doing that for certain searches. In July, they turned it off for all Apple apps.\nOn July 12, many Apple apps dropped sharply in the rankings of popular searches. The top results for \u201cTV\u201d went from four Apple apps to two. \u201cVideo\u201d and \u201cmaps\u201d changed from three top Apple apps to one. And Apple Wallet dropped from the No. 1 spot for \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201ccredit.\u201d\nMr. Schiller and Mr. Cue said the algorithm had been working properly. They simply decided to handicap themselves to help other developers.\n\u201cWe make mistakes all the time,\u201d Mr. Cue said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to admit when we do,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d\nFollow Jack Nicas and Keith Collins on Twitter:https://twitter.com/jacknicas\">@jacknicasandhttps://twitter.com/collinskeith\">@collinskeith.\nNote: In the top graphic, the app images may not reflect the exact branding, ratings, numbers of reviews, and promotional images that would have been seen in May 2018. | Data source: Sensor Tower"

Some lawsuits against specific companies are joint efforts by officials in red and blue states; others are federal inquiries examining companies together. The growing scrutiny of the companies could ultimately result in them being broken up and in new laws that alter the balance of power in corporate America.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a web search to understand that unchecked corporate power shouldn\u2019t have disproportionate control over our data and information,\u201d Letitia James, New York\u2019s attorney general,said Thursdayin announcing a suit against Google.\nThis is what the companies are facing.\nagency\ncategory\noutcome\nJustice Department\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nState Attorneys General\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nState Attorneys General\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nHouse Subcommittee on Antitrust\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nFederal Communications Commission\nContent and Censorship\nRead more \u00bb\nGoogle has been under fire for the near stranglehold it has in internet search and whether it uses that power to the detriment of others. Government officials are focused on whether its huge digital ad business has been creating harm for certain groups of people.\nOn Thursday, more than 30 states, including New York,filed a lawsuitaccusing the company of illegally arranging its search results to push out smaller rivals. The action came one day after 10 other states accused Google ofabusing its dominance in advertisingand overcharging publishers, and two months after theJustice Department suedthe company over anticompetition issues.\nagency\ncategory\noutcome\nState Attorneys General\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nFederal Trade Commission\nPrivacy\nRead more \u00bb\nFederal Trade Commission\nData Practices\nRead more \u00bb\nHouse Subcommittee on Antitrust\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nSenate Judiciary Committee\nContent and Censorship\nRead more \u00bb\nFederal Communications Commission\nContent and Censorship\nRead more \u00bb\nThe world\u2019s largest social network has attracted government attention on a number of fronts, including its policies related to users\u2019 privacy, how it moderates content, and whether certain advertising tools enable discrimination.\nFacebook owns several of the world\u2019s largest messaging and social sharing apps, including WhatsApp and Instagram, making its market power even more formidable.\nThis month, the U.S. government and more than 40 statessued Facebook for illegally crushing competitorsand demanded the company undo its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.\nagency\ncategory\noutcome\nFederal Trade Commission\nData Practices\nRead more \u00bb\nFederal Trade Commission\nAntitrust\nRead More \u00bb\nState Attorneys General\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nHouse Subcommittee on Antitrust\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nConcerns about the retail behemoth have focused largely on how it treats so-called third-party sellers on its popular retail site. Given that Amazon controls the marketplace, some lawmakers have said, the company\u2019s own products have an unfair advantage over those from the third-party sellers.\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat whose district includes Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, has routinely questioned Amazon\u2019s power. Amazon has \u201caccess to data that far exceeds the sellers on your platforms with whom you compete,\u201d she said as she grilled Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, at a hearing this summer.\nHe responded that he was \u201cvery proud of what we have done for third-party sellers on this platform.\u201d\nagency\ncategory\noutcome\nJustice Department\nAntitrust\nRead More \u00bb\nHouse Subcommittee on Antitrust\nAntitrust\nRead more \u00bb\nThe principal concerns about Apple have centered on whether it is unfairly wielding the power of its App Store to hurt competitors.\nIn a scathing report by Congress earlier this year that recommended breaking up the tech giants, lawmakers accused Apple \u2014 along with Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 of serving as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d that made third-party businesses like app developers beholden to the companies\u2019 demands.The word monopoly appeared in the report nearly 120 times."
