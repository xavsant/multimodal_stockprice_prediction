        "fulltext": "Q.Can you tell me how Wi-Fi Assist works and does it use my iPhone data?\nA.Apple\u2019sWi-Fi Assistfeature is designed to keep your iPhone or cellular-model iPad connected to the internet even when the device\u2019s connection to a wireless network is weak or unstable. To keep the connection, the Wi-Fi Assist function (available on the iPhone 5 and later) automatically switches to your device\u2019s cellular connection. So, yes, the feature does consume part of the monthly data allowance you receive from your phone carrier.\nWi-Fi Assist does not use the backup connection from your cellular plan for everything. It does not kick in for apps that stream or download large files, and it does not enable itself automatically if you are traveling and data-roaming on other carriers\u2019 networks. Wi-Fi Assist is supposed to work for apps actively running, not programs that may periodically download new content in the background.\nWhen iOS 9 was released last fall, Wi-Fi Assist was turned on by default andcaused much dismay from users with limited data planswhose monthly allowances were chewed up when the device automatically switched to the cellular signal for extended periods. If you are worried about conserving the data allowance doled out by your cellular carrier,you can turn off Wi-Fi Assistand other bandwidth-hogging apps in the iPhone\u2019s settings.\nTo do that, open the iPhone\u2019s Settings icon from the Home screen, select Cellular and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see Wi-Fi Assist. Tap the button next to it to disable the feature. In iOS 9.3 and later, the Wi-Fi Assist setting shows how much cellular data it has used, which can be helpful if you want to use the feature to stay online but want to keep an eye on the data meter."

        "title": "Amazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers",
        "fulltext": "Just ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.\nMonday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\nCalled Amazon Inspire, the education site has features that may seem familiar to frequent Amazon shoppers. Search bar at the top of the page? Check. User reviews? Check. Star ratings for each product? Check.\nBy starting out with a free resources service for teachers, Amazon is establishing a foothold that could expand into a one-stop shopping marketplace \u2014 not just for paid learning materials, but for schools\u2019 wider academic and institutional software needs, said Tory Patterson, co-founder ofOwl Ventures, a venture capital fundthat invests in ed tech start-ups.\n\u201cAmazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,\u201d Mr. Patterson said.\nAmazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.\nLast year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.\nBecause its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks \u2014 the inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system \u2014 have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.\nEven so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.\nAlready, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems.\nIn a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms.\n\u201cEvery teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. He added: \u201cWe are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality.\u201d\nThe site for teachers is not Amazon\u2019s first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.)\nIn March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students.\nIn the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups.\nA number of popular platforms already offer instructional materials for teachers. Among them aretes.com, a site based in London with more than eight million users worldwide, andteacherspayteachers.com, a site based in Manhattan thatmore than two million teachersuse regularly.\nLike Amazon Inspire, these sites let teachers search for materials by subject matter, like fractions or mitosis, and by grade level. Like Amazon Inspire, tes.com lets teachers download lessons and edit them to suit their students. (Some resources onteacherspayteachers.commay also be edited.)\nMr. Agarwal said the company\u2019s new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features.\n\u201cWith the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,\u201d he said.\nAmazon timed its announcement to coincide withISTE, the annual conferenceof the International Society for Technology in Education, which about 16,000 teachers and school officials are attending in Denver this week. Other tech giants also unveiled new education ventures during the conference.\nOn Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX \u2014 a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches.\nOn Monday, Google said it was makingExpeditions, a free virtual reality appfor students that has been available on a limited basis to schools, generally available. More than one million students tried the app during its test phase, the company said.\nGoogle also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another."

        "title": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome",
        "fulltext": "PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.\nWorst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\n\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.\nFor all these reasons, support for Mr. Trump here is minimal. Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech maverick who backed Ron Paul\u2019s presidential bid in 2008 with millions of dollars in support, is a Trump delegate. Mr. Thiel, who was revealed last week asa secret backerof the wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker Media, is the candidate\u2019s first, and so far only, prominent enlistee in Silicon Valley.\nSupport for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.\nHours later, Intel said the event was canceled. It did not give an explanation. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not return a message for comment. He isholding a rallyin San Jose, Calif., on Thursday instead.\nThe Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\n\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.\nSilicon Valley technophiles cannot necessarily claim the same. In April, as Mr. Trump was wrapping up his quest for the nomination and beginning to look ahead to the general election, a handful of people who work in tech around the country gave a grand total of $5,395 to his campaign, according to figures that will be released Thursday byCrowdpac, a start-up that tracks donations.\nAdd that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.\nMr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\n\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201d\nWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.\nScott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201d\nIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Slinker, whose latest start-up,Paradata, uses big data to help brands find suppliers, said Mr. Trump was a candidate very much in the spirit of Silicon Valley: \u201cHe\u2019s a start-up kind of guy. He has a lot of ideas and pivots away from them if they don\u2019t work, just like the Valley does. He\u2019s more viral than Facebook ever was.\u201d\nStill, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201d\nThe venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who backed Mr. Romney in 2012, said on Twitter that he was supporting Mrs. Clinton. Meg Whitman, a former candidate for governor in California who now runs Hewlett Packard Enterprise, labeled Mr. Trump \u201cunfit to be president.\u201d When Mr. Thiel was revealed as a Trump delegate, a columnist for the tech news site Pando said he was\u201cutterly ashamed\u201dthat Mr. Thiel was a Pando investor. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\nAnother Trump supporter in Silicon Valley, Tyrone Pike, had some business dealings with the candidate many years ago in Atlantic City, N.J., and was favorably impressed. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme pronouncements, \u201cI kind of write them off,\u201d said Mr. Pike, who sold a software start-up to Citrix and is building another company. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a moderate than any of his words.\u201d\nEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201d\nBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\n\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201d\nYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201d\nMr. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has covered Mr. Trump intensively and critically. The internet tycoon said at a Post-sponsored tech conference that he was \u201cvery, very comfortable with all of Amazon\u2019s approaches and behaviors,\u201dThe Post reported.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.\nThe Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.\nMrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\n\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201d\nIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201d"

I knew how to do it in OS X 10.9, but my computer is now upgraded to OS X 10.11 and the instructions I have don\u2019t work anymore. How can I search for files and folders in this version of OS X?\nA.Apple\u2019s annual updates to its OS X operating system often bring changes to the way the software functions, but in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), you can still search for files using either the desktopFinderor theSpotlighttool. You can search for files by name, kind, size, date or even keywords within a file\u2019s content.\nTo search for a file using Finder, click the Mac\u2019s desktop background and press the Command and F keys on the keyboard; you can also get there by clicking the File menu on the Mac\u2019s toolbar and selecting Find. When the Finder window opens, enter your keywords in the search box in the upper-right corner.\nYou can narrow your search with the window\u2019s drop-down menu, which lets you filter by file type and other criteria.

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: How\u2019s it going, Mike? Isn\u2019t summer wonderful? The sun\u2019s out, there\u2019s no traffic and our boss is about to go on vacation. You know what that means? Party at the office!\nMike:One thing I miss about working in the New York office is the wealth of treats we had there. Our business editor, Dean Murphy, is practically a master of cupcakes and cider. In San Francisco I mostly scavenge forleftover tech protein shakes. I guess we can party by spiking the Soylent?\nFarhad: On to tech news. Let\u2019s start with money. Didi Chuxing, the Chinese rival to Uber, raised a gigantic pile of it \u2014$7.3 billion, putting to shame the$3.5 billionthat Uber reported raising earlier this month. Uber is also looking to raisea couple of billion more through something called a leveraged loan\u2014 which, to me, sounds like one step away from asking for money from a guy on the corner with a baseball bat. And to think, just a couple months ago people were saying the tech bubble was over.\nMike:Maybe there\u2019s money to be made in an on-demand loan shark app. The tagline: \u201cWe\u2019ll kneecap your insolvent start-up founders, anytime, anywhere.\u201d\nFarhad: Also, in a big win for regulators and consumer advocates, afederal court ruled this weekthat the F.C.C.\u2019s network neutrality rules were kosher. Most of our readers are opening this up early in the morning, so I won\u2019t risk putting them back to bed by going over the details of the regulations, but basically the decision means that internet service providers like Verizon can\u2019t unfairly monkey with the content coming over your line.\nAnd, really, in most cases, a good rule of thumb for internet users is: If it\u2019s bad for AT&T and Verizon, it\u2019s probably good for you.\nMike:I think I read that underneath aSnapple bottle cap.\nFarhad: Then there was Apple, which held its annual developer conference in San Francisco this week. The iPhone maker announceda blizzard of new features, including lots of nice updates to its messaging app and someless-than-stellar improvements to Siri. Also, the Apple Watch will be a little faster now, and Apple Music won\u2019t be as confusing. That\u2019s good, right?\nMike:Two things I never use \u2014 Apple Watch and Apple Music \u2014 are improving, so I guess I shrug at that news. But 15 million people use Apple Music, so they must be doing something right, or right-ish. I\u2019m not a watch guy, so I\u2019m probably the wrong audience there.\nFarhad: And the biggest news of the week came early. On Monday, Microsoft announced it wouldspend $26.2 billion to buy LinkedIn, the online r\u00e9sum\u00e9-posting social network. I have to say, I don\u2019t really get this deal; I can see how the companies\u2019 user bases are similar, but I don\u2019t see the justification for spending this much on it. Also, personally, I find LinkedIn to be very annoying. But maybe you can defend this deal?\nMike:The explanations I\u2019ve read thus far seem to amount to thatmeme of a guy shouting \u201chaha! Business!\u201dand asking me to just accept that these two companies know what they\u2019re doing.\nHere\u2019s my best guess: Microsoft is buying a social graph. That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.\nTo my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)\nSo what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.\nIs all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.\nFarhad: Ben Thompson of Stratecherymounted the best defense of this deal: He thinks some of LinkedIn\u2019s tools could improve Microsoft\u2019s customer relationship management software, making it a better rival to Salesforce. And he argues that LinkedIn allows Microsoft to create a direct relationship with employees who will ultimately decide what kind of technology to use at their offices \u2014 and selling such technology is, of course, Microsoft\u2019s main business.\nMike:So I\u2019m on par with Ben\u2019s thinking, and Ben is very smart, so I feel better about myself.\nFarhad:But I\u2019m very skeptical. I think LinkedIn\u2019s long-term position in all of our work lives is in doubt. Sure, today, lots of people use it. But asThe Verge\u2019s Casey Newton argued this week, LinkedIn is not very useful: \u201cin practice it\u2019s not much more than a way for white-collar workers to field occasional inquiries from recruiters and vendors who pay dearly for the privilege.\u201d\nThere are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.\nFor instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)\nGranted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.\nOh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn? Thanks.\nMike:I have just endorsed you for \u201cbeing a jerk.\u201d See you next week!"

But as Apple stumbled in the 1990s and Windows improved, Dell\u2019s Windows PCs grabbed a significant share.\nNow those old rivals have plenty of company.\nThis week, at aneducation conferencein Colorado, executives from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other tech companies will be discussing what they bring to the educational market, from software and online tools to devices like the Mac or Google\u2019s Chromebooks.\nA cynic would say they want to get them hooked while they\u2019re young. And there might be some truth to that: Get comfortable with a Mac or a Chromebook when you\u2019re young and you\u2019ll probably use it for years to come.\nBut education is also a significant business opportunity.

Although iOS 9 itself runs on older models,Apple\u2019s notes on Notessay the sketching feature is available only on the iPhone 5 and later, sixth-generation iPod Touch, iPad models released from fall 2012 and beyond, and the 2013 iPad Mini 2 and later. (The Notes app works with theApple Penciland other compatible stylus tools for iOS gadgets.)\nIf your Apple hardware meets the system requirements but you have not updated your device to the iOS 9 software, you need to do so if you want the most current version of the Notes app. In addition to drawing tools, the app now lets you add web links, maps, photos and videos to notes; create checklists; and format text.\nTo sketch in the iOS 9 Notes app, tap the New Note icon, or tell Siri to make a new note for you. When you have the new blank note in front of you, tap the plus icon that appears above the keyboard and then select the icon that looks like a squiggle. The keyboard disappears and you should see a set of onscreen drawing tools. Tap the pen, marker or pencil tool and start drawing.\nYou can change the color of the \u201cink\u201d by tapping the black circle next to the drawing tools and switching to another hue. Tap the curved arrow icon to undo your work, or use the eraser tool at the bottom of the screen to remove certain sections of the drawing. When you are finished, tap the Share icon to send a copy of the sketch by mail or message, post it on social media sites or save it to an online file-storage folder.\nIf you cannot upgrade to iOS 9, plenty of third-party sketching and drawing apps are available in the iOS App Store. Just check each app\u2019s details page to make sure it runs on whatever version of iOS you are using."

Mine was a whole lot better until I found out that \u201cBrexit\u201d was not, in fact, a delicious cereal.\nFarhad:I was just trying to think of a snappy joke about Brexit, but I\u2019m too worried about a global financial apocalypse. While I perusevarious urban survival kits on Amazon, you should watch John Oliver\u2019s hilarious \u2014 and, now, very scary \u2014take on Britain leaving the European Union.\nMike:Yeah. Thankfully all of my money is inDogecoin. On to more pressing matters, like commodity technology news.\nI missed half of this week because I was super sick, but it seems like I didn\u2019t miss much. Most of the world\u2019s news was more geopolitical and less, uh, technopolitical.\nHere\u2019s one thing: Twitter bought an artificial intelligence start-upcalled Magic Pony, because apparently the company\u2019s turnaround strategy is primarily based on listening toold Ginuwine albums. Seriously though, machine-learning recruiting is intensely competitive, and Twitter no doubt publicized the move to try to raise its profile and help recruiting, which is hard when you\u2019re facing off against Facebook and Google for the same candidates.\nIt\u2019s VidCon and Cannes Lions, big advertising industry events in our world, so a bunch of tech companies announced metrics and small ad-related product updates. Instagram hithalf a billionmonthly users, while Spotify is at100 million-plus regular visitors, with more than 30 percent of those folks subscribing to the monthly paid service. Twitter and Vine will also let \u201ccreators\u201d produce140-second videos, which is particularly un-Vine-ish but probably good for ad revenue.\nFarhad:Why 140 seconds? Did they choose that because Twitter allows 140 characters in its tweets? Man, tech companies really like to be cute, don\u2019t they? Maybe after the world collapses we\u2019ll all grow up.\nAlso: I liked BuzzFeed\u2019s investigation into Uber\u2019s pay. For years the ride-hailing company has been talking up how much its drivers make, but drivers have long complained that Uber\u2019s declining fares lead to very low wages.BuzzFeed found that they were right, at least in three large cities: After expenses, the average Uber driver in Denver makes about $13 an hour, while those in Houston make $11, and those in Detroit make close to $9. That\u2019s not nothing, and surely for lots of people Uber\u2019s flexible hours make the platform an important way to earn extra money, but the numbers are far smaller than the companyhas long led people to believe.\nMike:Yeah. As it turns out, driving your car is, uh, tough on the car, and is an expense one must account for in the long run. Who knew?\nAlso, Twilio debuted on thepublic markets and did rather well, but it\u2019s a telephony company and not a dramatic unicorn death, so no one in news media land cared. Sad!\nFarhad:Very smart of Twilio to time the I.P.O. to the Brexit. Now if its stock crashes, there\u2019ll be something to blame.\nMike:But I\u2019d like to talk about something that really chaps my burgers. We\u2019ve heard about this for months, but now that some of the highest-profile Apple commentatorsare writing about it, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s coming: Apple is probably going to ditch the regular headphone jack in a coming release of the new iPhone, opting to go with a proprietary jack or a Bluetooth-enabled version of earbuds. Speculation posits that the company will do it to either further slim down the device or to make room for a better battery, or perhaps some combination of the two. Or some other thing I haven\u2019t anticipated.\nMy gut reaction: pure and utter contempt. I\u2019m seriously considering switching to Android, that\u2019s how annoying this is to me. O.K., now you go and tell me why Apple would do this. It seems like a real strong way to alienate users.\nFarhad:I\u2019m pretty much with you on this score. AsThe Wall Street Journal reported, it\u2019s not just that Apple is removing the headphone jack from the next iPhone \u2014 it\u2019s also not making many other big changes, including changes to the phone\u2019s design, which it usually does every couple years.\nSo basically it looks like the new iPhone will be roughly the same phone we have now, with one major thing missing. What is Apple thinking? We won\u2019t know exactly until it releases the new phone later this year, but this seems bad to me. Sales of the iPhone are already flat. The company needed something big this year. Now it\u2019s creating a device that many might consider a downgrade rather than an upgrade.\nMike:Part of what I like about headphone jacks in literally every audio-based device of the last 20-plus years is the intercompatibility. I don\u2019t want to buy special earbuds when I\u2019m going to the gym, I want my crummy $12 ones that will get sweaty and break and I can easily toss in the garbage.\nFarhad:I know what the Apple boosters will say: But what about thefloppy drive? That is, Apple has a history of removing dying tech standards from their products, and despite short-term grumbling things always work out in the end. You need to get rid of stuff for progress to happen.\nYeah, sure, but that argument doesn\u2019t really hold for the audio jack, because it is basically perfect in its current state, and honestly I can\u2019t see any reason for upgrading. As you point out, today\u2019s headphone jack works on just about every device you have (including airplanes). One based on Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning connector will work only on iOS devices and not anywhere else \u2014 not even current Macs, which lack a Lightning port. So guess what? You\u2019ll need to get a little adapter, or dongle, to carry with you all the time. And what about wireless headphones? Well, those work on today\u2019s iPhones, and getting rid of the headphone jack doesn\u2019t somehow make them better.\nMike:The floppy drive argument is so stupid. Manufactured public relations spin. I\u2019m not buying it.\nFarhad:AsThe Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel writes, this whole thing is \u201cuser-hostile and stupid.\u201d Welcome to the dongle!\nMike:O.K., so help me out, tech columnist. What Android phone do I buy when I make the switch?\nFarhad:The Samsung Galaxy S7 is pretty good. But I\u2019m not joining you. Despite everything, I still love iOS, so I\u2019m not leaving the iPhone. I guess Apple knows what it\u2019s doing. O.K., till next week!\nMike:Cheerio! I\u2019ll be at the bank, transferring the rest of my Dogecoin into gold."

        "title": "Buybacks by Companies Like Apple May Signal Danger, Not Growth",
        "fulltext": "IPhonesalesare down and Apple has run intoobstaclesinChina, its second-most-important market. Investors have beaten down Apple\u2019s once highflying shares this year, and the company\u2019s troubles have been a drag on the entire stock market.\nBut Apple and the stock market would probably be in worse shape now if not for an important factor: Companies like Apple have been buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of their own shares at a record-breaking pace, returning money to shareholders even as earnings lag.\nThis is a bit of a puzzle because many studies have shown that using cash for buybacks generallydoesn\u2019t improvea company\u2019s operations or add to its intrinsic value. But spending money on buybacks is much better than wasting it on money-losing projects, when corporations don\u2019t have other good uses for the cash. And by reducing the number of shares on the market, buybacks make earnings per share look better. That helps executives to big paydays as they more easily reach their compensation targets, and it often nudges up short-term share prices, returning money to rank-and-file shareholders.\nAt the moment, corporate America is sitting on an enormous cash hoard. Many companies have been using the money in an epic share-buying spree \u2014 one that has increased in intensity even as earnings have declined. In the 12 months through March, operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped to $854.9 billion from $989 billion, but buybacks increased to $589 billion from $538.1 billion. That is the largest total for buybacks ever in a 12-month period, according to a report from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nWhile Apple ranked second in buybacks to Gilead Sciences in the first quarter, it has been the undisputed king of buybacks over some longer periods. Apple spent $36.8 billion on buybacks in the 12 months through March, more than double the $16.6 billion spent by Microsoft, the next-ranking company. And over the five years through March, Apple bought back $116.6 billion worth of its own shares, followed by Microsoft with $45.7 billion, Pfizer with $44.9 billion and Oracle with $43.7 billion.\nA recent surge in buybacks may have been stimulated by problems in the stock market, which fell sharply at the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said, \u201cthe pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn.\u201d More than three-fifths of the S.&P. 500 companies bought back at least some of their own shares in the quarter, he said, and 139 bought enough over 12 months to reduce their share count by at least 4 percent.\nAs a matter of simple math, reducing the number of shares by 4 percent will increase earnings per share by 4 percent, too, and will tend to bolster short-term prices.\nBuybacks are playing an important role in the stock market. A Goldman Sachs report, relying mainly onFederal Reserve data, found that to a startling degree, the buyback surge had made companies like Apple their own most reliable investors. By funneling money into their own shares, companies have been making up for a gap in demand from mutual funds, foreigners, pension funds and individual Americans. In the first quarter of the year, the Federal Reserve data showed net outflows from the American stock market from these sources. But when corporate purchases of the companies\u2019 own shares were included, there was a net inflow of cash \u2014 providing a crucial cushion for stock prices.\nBuybacks are a critical part of Goldman\u2019s positive stock market outlook for the remainder of 2016: \u201cWe maintain our forecast that net buybacks will equal $450 billion in 2016 and remain the largest source of U.S. equity demand this year,\u201d the company said.\nLow and even negative interest rates resulting from the sluggish global economy and from the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been enabling big corporations to borrow money cheaply, even when those companies\u2019 earnings have declined, and even when they have had no immediate productive use for the funds.\nInMarch, for example, when Apple told Wall Street that its iPhone sales had fallen, that the Chinese market was proving more difficult than expected and that its earnings had declined, it also said that it had more than $230 billion in cash and equivalent securities. Most of that money is held overseas, where it is not subject to immediate taxation by the Internal Revenue Service. Yet the company has also been borrowing billions of dollars by issuing bonds denominated in euros, yen and Swiss francs, enabling it to draw on an almost limitless reservoir of funds. It hasn\u2019t needed all of this money for research and development, factories or even for mergers and acquisitions. Instead, it has been funneling much of it to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nSuch maneuvers often produce good results for stocks over the short term. Over longer periods, however, unless earnings grow substantially, financial engineering like this will take you only so far.\nHistory tells us that surges in buybacks are not always a sign of good things to come. It is surely worth recalling what happened after American companies last set a 12-month buyback record. That was in December 2007, right before the worst economic and stock market declines in recent history. Recall that the economic setback known as theGreat Recessionlasted from December 2007 through June 2009. And from December 2007 through March 2009, the stock market lost almost half of its value. The last stock buyback surge represented the high point of both economic and stock market cycles, which endured brutal corrections.\nFor now, buyback authorizations by American companies continue to increase, and there is so much cash on hand that the current trend can easily continue for many months. At some point, buybacks won\u2019t be an elixir for share prices. They will be a symptom of an overextended market."

        "title": "Apple Developer Conference: A More Open Siri, and Other Upgrades",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Steven P. Jobs ran Apple, the company\u2019s devices were distinguished by their polished software and famous iTunes store. Today, critics and even loyal fans are taking shots atApple\u2019s buggy softwareandApple Music, its new streaming music service.\nWith its hardware salesnow slowing, Apple is under pressure to fix its software and online services, which have become increasingly important to consumers. So at its annual conference for software developers on Monday, the iPhone maker tried to demonstrate that it was still a purveyor of high-quality software and services.\nBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple\u2019s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.\nApple announced:\n\u25a0 Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.\n\u25a0 Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.\n\u25a0 A rebranding of its Mac operating system.\n\u25a0 An expansion of Apple Pay.\n\u25a0 Opening up Siri to developers.\n\u25a0 Improvements in photos and maps.\n\u25a0 Subscriptions through Apple News.\n\u25a0 Opening up its messaging service to developers\n\u25a0 A new interface for Apple Music.\nHere were the main points:\nFarhad:Apple divided its presentation into four segments focused on each of its computer operating systems \u2014 one each for iPhone, the Mac, the Apple Watch and Apple TV.\nThat segmentation suggests Apple\u2019s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.\nThat is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominant\nBrian:One big takeaway was that Apple has a lot of catching up to do in online services. Most of Apple\u2019s noteworthy announcements on Monday matched features already offered by other internet companies, namely Amazon and Google.\nFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.\nApple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?\nFarhad:Though lots of developers create apps for the iPhone, Apple has long been careful about how much access it gives developers to crucial parts of its operating system. That seems to be changing. This presentation was marked by much greater access \u2014 Apple now allows third-party developers to create new experiences in Apple Maps, to interact with Siri, to get access to its Messages service and to get access to the lock screen and phone interface. Similar access has been available to developers on Google\u2019s Android operating system. Now Apple seems to be going out of its way to cater to developers, too.\nBrian:Apple announced a new version of its operating system, Watch OS, powering Apple Watch. Notably, Apple started the keynote with Apple Watch, which signifies the increasing importance of the gadget, the first brand-new piece of hardware introduced by Apple under the leadership of its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook.\nVindu:Apple repositioned the watch as more of a health monitor, putting the activity tracker in a more prominent place and encouraging competitive sharing of workouts with friends.\nBrian:The new fitness features of the Apple Watch place the product in moredirect competition with Fitbit, the largest wearables maker.\nBrian:Eddy Cue, head of Apple\u2019s software and services, announced improvements in the operating system powering Apple TV, called tvOS. That includes a feature called single sign-on: People have complained about how long it takes to log into individual services like Hulu, Netflix and Showtime. Now, users will be able to sign into all network apps with a single universal login.\nApple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.\nVindu:Over all, the improvements in Apple TV are modest. But some tighter integration with live TV networks does set up Apple to possibly become a TV provider for cord-cutters as more channels offer their services over the internet.\nBrian:Apple rebranded its Mac operating system, which was called OS X for 15 years. It will now be called MacOS, bringing it in line with the branding schemes of Apple\u2019s other software products (tvOS, WatchOS, iOS).\nWith its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.\nApple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.\nVindu:Apple is trying to make Apple Pay more useful for retailers. The company said Apple Pay, its payment service, is coming to the web for the first time, with dozens of retailers already lined up to use it.\nHowever, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.\nBrian:Apple unveiled a big upgrade for Siri, allowing outside app developers to take advantage of voice controls. Now Siri can do things like summon an Uber car, send a message through a chat app like WhatsApp or send someone cash with apps like Square Cash.\nThe move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.\nFarhad:This opening up of Siri is an improvement, but Apple was unclear about how expansive this system will be. How many apps will be able to use Siri? What functions will Siri be able to handle for them? Can Siri handle very sophisticated requests, like ones that depend on multiple apps \u2014 for instance, \u201cCall an Uber five minutes before my next meeting\u201d? Apple hasn\u2019t specified. Given that voice is becoming an increasingly important interface for the next generation of computing, Apple\u2019s progress here could be a key benchmark for its future.\nVindu:Good news for publishers: Apple News, which has 50 million monthly active users, will let people subscribe to get every article from their favorite publications, including those with pay walls like The Wall Street Journal. Apple News has been a bit of a stepchild, with publishers largely focusing their efforts on Facebook, Twitter and Google\u2019s AMP to speed up the display of articles on the mobile web. Will this get news organizations on board?\nVindu:Apple is challenging Facebook Messenger, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, by opening up its Messages service to outside developers. Facebook has made a big play to establish Messenger as a place to conduct all kinds of activities, from ordering an Uber car to watching videos. Apple is now matching that, but with the full array of developers that use iOS instead of the handful that have chosen to work with Facebook.\n(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)\nVindu:Apple said it had 15 million subscribers to Apple Music, but the streaming music service has gotten off to a slow start. Apple said it had learned from the experience so far and unveiled a redesign of Apple Music that simplifies navigation and makes it easier to find your favorite music. But with more popular apps like Spotify soon able to tap Siri, it\u2019s unclear whether the changes will be enough to dislodge competitors. Apple\u2019s much-criticized iTunes software for buying and organizing music saw no upgrades."
