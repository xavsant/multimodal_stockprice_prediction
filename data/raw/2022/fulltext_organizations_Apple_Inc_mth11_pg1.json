        "title": "An iPhone Factory Needs Workers. The Chinese Government Wants to Help.",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s largest iPhone factory, in the city of Zhengzhou, has been beset with production problems caused first by a Covid lockdown and then by ashortage of workers. Now, that plant is getting help from an unlikely source: the Chinese government.\nOfficials in central China have tapped the government\u2019s vast network of party members, civil servants and military veterans to help Foxconn, the Taiwanese-based assembler of Apple\u2019s iPhones, with its recruitment drive. They called on them to \u201crespond to the government\u2019s call\u201d and \u201caid in the resumption of production\u201d at the factory, according to county notices and state media reports.\nThe mobilization campaign highlights the Communist Party\u2019s concerns over its reeling economy in a time of severe business disruptions, low demand and record-high debt. As businesses falter under the tough pandemic prevention measures of the nation\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, the authorities are turning to party-led mechanisms to keep them humming.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great irony,\u201d said Adam Segal, an expert on the Chinese military and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to the party\u2019s efforts to recruit cadres to work at Foxconn. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly reflective of the sorry state of the economy and the worry that Apple and others may relocate.\u201d\nBusinesses, both foreign and domestic, have struggled in China as the government has continued to pursue a stringent zero Covid policy that relies on mass lockdowns, quarantines and near-daily testing to try to quash infections. Those measures have prompted some longstanding foreign manufacturers, including Apple, to look to countries like Vietnam and India toreduce their reliance on China.\nThe risk of Apple\u2019s dependence on China became clear when an outbreak of coronavirus battered Zhengzhou in mid-October. The Foxconn plant, which makes more than half the world\u2019s iPhones, went into a lockdown: holding roughly 200,000 workers inside its compound and setting off widespread panic.\nWorkers whospoke to The New York Timeson the condition of anonymity described food shortages and the fear of being at the mercy of the company for basic necessities. On the last weekend of October,hundreds of workers fled, some with no plans to return.\nThe worker exodus hit Apple\u2019s supply chains, with a possible delay in iPhone shipments for theholiday season, the company announced. A report by UBS, a global investment bank, estimated that wait times for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Max were approaching \u201cthe highest levels in history.\u201d\nA week after the mass departure of workers, the Chinese government sprang into action.\nIn Zhoukou, a city in eastern Henan, a township government met to discuss Foxconn\u2019s recruitment challenges, and officials gave out quotas for workers to be recruited, according toShanghai Securities Journal, a state newspaper. Reached by phone by The Times, a Zhoukou official acknowledged that the city had been helping Foxconn with recruitment but declined to elaborate.\nMilitary veterans have also been brought in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for companies to resume work and production,\u201d Zhang Yongchao, the office manager of the veteran affairs bureau of Changge, a city an hour from the Foxconn plant, told The Times. As the pandemic, along with China\u2019s harsh measures to contain it, has led to labor shortfalls at Foxconn and other businesses, it has created opportunity for veterans, who have long had difficulty finding work, he said.\n\u201cPlus, Foxconn\u2019s pay is relatively good,\u201d he added.\nNotices for recruitment were posted acrossofficial county social mediapages. Foxconn would pay 30 yuan ($4) an hour, roughly 5 yuan, or around 70 cents, more than earlier in the year. Workers who had previously fled because of the outbreak and were willing to return would get aone-time bonusof 500 yuan ($70).\nThe notices made clear the urgency of the company\u2019s recruitment drive: Those who showed up for work by mid-November were promised an additional 3,000 yuan after 30 days of work.\n\u201cIt is quite rare to see a mass recruiting with such a large-scale use of the government\u2019s power,\u201d said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch, a New York-based Chinese labor rights group.\nThe government has an interest in supporting companies like Foxconn, a major taxpayer and employer in Henan.\nAs the pandemic has rattled businesses and caused labor shortages, the government must take up the \u201cbaton\u201d to help enterprises and \u201cpromote the stability of the global supply chain,\u201d Global Times, aCommunist Party newspaper, said in a commentary justifying the government\u2019s aid to Foxconn.\nChina often deploys its military and party members in moments of crisis, reflecting the party\u2019s deep-seated faith in the power of ideology and loyalty over material interests. During the Shanghai lockdowns this spring, China called on thousands of medics in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and party cadres as part of its full-throated pandemic response.\nMr. Li, the activist, who has spent decades observing labor trends in China, said he had never seen a government campaign for private businesses hiring retired soldiers. He also expressed doubt about older veterans\u2019 fitness for factory work, as most employees at Foxconn are under 35.\nFoxconn said that it did not comment on \u201cindividual employee matters\u201d but that the manufacturer was working with \u201crelevant local government agencies\u201d to recruit and return production to normal as soon as possible.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Chinese government\u2019s mobilization campaign and pointed to a statement from Nov. 6, when the company said it would work with Foxconn \u201cto return to normal production levels while ensuring the health and safety of every worker.\u201d\nChina\u2019s push to mobilize workers also shows that there is a deep mutual dependence between one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and the world\u2019s most populous country. It has long been assumed that Apple needs China more than China needs Apple, as throngs of smartphone buyers generate a fifth of the company\u2019s sales.\nBut now, as the country faces mounting economic challenges, Apple may have the upper hand. If production fails to meet expectations, Mr. Li said, \u201cFoxconn may transfer to other countries, and it could also drive the entire electronic industries to speed up their transfer to foreign countries.\u201d\nThe bellicose rhetoric used in the recruitment drive suggests that the government is keen to avoid losing a major economic partnership. One notice urged veterans to \u201ckeep duty in mind: If there is a war, respond to the call.\u201d\nTripp Micklecontributed reporting."

        "title": "In a Challenge to Beijing, Unrest Over Covid Lockdowns Spreads",
        "fulltext": "In an iPhone factory in central China, thousands of workers clashed with riot police and tore down barricades.\nIn the southern city of Guangzhou, protesters broke out of locked-down buildings to confront health workers and ransack food provisions.\nAnd online, many Chinese raged at the authorities after the death of a 4-month-old girl, whose father said access to medical treatment was delayed because of Covid restrictions.\nAs China\u2019s harsh Covid rules extend deep into their third year, there are growing signs of discontent across the country. For China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, the unrest is a test of his precedent-breaking third term in power and underscores the urgent political question of how he can lead China out of the Covid era.\nThe rare displays of defiance over the past two weeks are the most visible signs of frustration and desperation with the lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing that have upended everyday life. The anger, combined with outbreaks ofCovidacross the country that have driven cases to an all-time high, augurs a dark winter ahead.\nEarlier this month, officials said they would adjust Covid restrictions to limit the impact the disruptions have had on the economy and government resources. The latest surge in cases has called that pledge into question, with many officials falling back on familiar heavy-handed measures to try to stop the spread of the virus.\nWhether Mr. Xi can find a middle ground will reflect on China\u2019s status as the world\u2019s factory floor and a major driver of global economic growth. Some multinational companies are already looking toexpand production elsewhere.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing at Foxconn is the bankruptcy of \u2018the China model,\u2019\u201d said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, referring to the Taiwanese operator of the plant in central China that produces half of the world\u2019s iPhones. \u201cIt\u2019s the collapse of China\u2019s image as a production powerhouse, as well as China\u2019s relationship to globalization.\u201d\nMany will be watching to see if recent chaos at Foxconn\u2019s plant spreads elsewhere. Even before the riot that broke out at the plant this week, Apple had warned that a poorly organized lockdown there wouldimpact its sales. Analysts have predicted longer waiting times for holiday purchases of the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.\n\u201cIf the government continues with its zero-Covid policy, Foxconn would only be the beginning. There is Foxconn today, but other factories will face similar situations,\u201d said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch, a New York-based Chinese labor rights group.\nThe Foxconn workers were lashing out about a delay in the payment of bonuses as well as the Taiwanese assembler\u2019s failure to properly isolate new workers from those who had tested positive. The new hires had been recruited recently after thousands of workersfled the Foxconn plant last monthbecause of a Covid outbreak.\nFrom Tuesday evening until the dawn of Wednesday, thousands of workers clashed with riot police and health workers, according to four workers who spoke to The Times. Protesters destroyed barricades, stole food supplies and hurled pieces of fencing at the authorities.\n\u201cWe protested the whole day, from day to night,\u201d said Han Li, a new worker from Zhengzhou who had joined the protests. He said he had felt deceived, and that the bonus payments and living conditions at the factory were different from what he had been promised. Mr. Han said he saw workers get beaten and injured.\nVideos that Foxconn workers shared with The Times showed workers, by the thousands, thrashing and hurling steel beams against police wearing riot gear and protective suits. One video, taken at dawn, showed the apparent aftermath: A motionless worker curled up on the roadside as a crew of security personnel stomped and kicked him. Another sat on the road with a bloodied sweater and towel wrapped over his head.\nIn a statement, Foxconn attributed the delayed bonuses to \u201ca technical error\u201d in its hiring system. Regarding the violence, it vowed to work with employees and the government to \u201cprevent similar accidents from happening again.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman told The Times that Apple team members on the ground in Zhengzhou were \u201creviewing the situation\u201d and were working with Foxconn \u201cto ensure their employees\u2019 concerns are addressed.\u201d\nOn Wednesday evening, Foxconn promised $1,400 to workers who wished to resign, offering them free transportation home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all tears,\u201d Mr. Han said on Thursday. \u201cNow I just want to get my compensation and go home.\u201d\nIn some ways, China\u2019s struggles are of Mr. Xi\u2019s own making. China has clung to harsh \u201czero-Covid\u201d policies aimed at eradicating Covid infections, even as its vaccination efforts have lagged. For three years, Beijing pumped out propaganda in support of tough controls, arguing they were the only way to protect lives. It also described the terrifying consequences of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in much of the rest of the world.\nAt the same time, many others have questioned the need for lockdowns at all. This week, as millions of Chinese tuned in to watch the World Cup in Qatar, they saw unmasked crowds rooting for their favorite teams. Chinese social media users posted messages expressing sarcasm and envy, as they contrasted their cloistered lives with the raucous celebrations on TV.\nMr. Xi, one of China\u2019smost powerful leaders in decades, has used heavy censorship and severe punishments to silence his critics. That makes the public airing of grievances particularly striking, such as in Guangzhou last week, when throngs of migrant workers staged a forceful protest after being confined for over three weeks.\nIn the locked-down district of Haizhu, home to roughly 1.8 million people, the workers, many of whom toil for long hours and low pay in Guangzhou\u2019s textile industry,rushed intothestreetto protest food shortages. They tore down fences and barricades, and videos circulating online showed another confrontation between residents and police.\nAs cases continue to climb, the government\u2019s pandemic prevention resources \u2014 which include food, hospital beds and quarantine facilities \u2014 have in some places been depleted, forcing workers to sleep on the streets or, in the case of Haizhu, in a tunnel, workers said.\nPeople have also been angered by reports of deaths caused by delays in medical care resulting from Covid restrictions. Earlier this month, the death of a 3-year-old boy in the city of Lanzhou after coronavirus restrictions kept him from being taken promptly to a hospital drew an outpouring of grief and anger as well as fresh scrutiny of the costs of \u201czero Covid.\u201d\nA similar outcry erupted online last week following the death of a 4-month-old girl whose father took to Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media outlet, to describe delays in the emergency response. Due to Covid protocols, dispatchers declined to send an ambulance, and when one arrived, responders refused to take his daughter to a hospital. In total, it took 12 hours for her to receive help.\n\u201cI hope the relevant departments will intervene, investigate a series of loopholes in epidemic prevention, inaction and irresponsibility, and seek justice for us ordinary people,\u201d wrote Li Baoliang, the baby\u2019s father. On Sunday, authorities released the results of an investigation into the incident. While the government expressed condolences to the family, it blamed the tragedy on individual medical staff who it said have a weak sense of responsibility.\nBeneath Mr. Li\u2019s online complaint, many pointed to the harms being done by policies designed to protect the public.\n\u201cWhat is taking people\u2019s lives? Is it Covid?\u201d asked one commenter."

        "title": "Elon Musk Takes On Apple\u2019s Power, Setting Up a Clash",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here @tim_cook?\u201d Elon Musktweetedon Monday to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, igniting a spat between the world\u2019s richest man and the world\u2019s most valuable public company.\nIn a series of tweets over 15 minutes, Mr. Musk, the new owner of Twitter, accused Apple of threatening to withhold Twitter from its App Store, a move that would limit some new users from downloading the app. The action would amount to censorship, Mr. Musk said, with no explanation from Apple for why Twitter would be blocked. He added that Apple had also reduced its advertising spending on Twitter.\nApple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?\nWith his tweets, Mr. Musk set the stage for a power struggle with Mr. Cook, who holds immense influence over other tech companies through Apple\u2019s dominance. Mr. Musk has a vested interest now in Apple\u2019s clout because of his ownership of Twitter, which hebought last month for $44 billion. Twitter is distributed through Apple\u2019s App Store and is used by iPhone and iPad owners around the world. In one tweet, Mr. Musk implied he was ready for \u201cwar\u201d with Apple.\nMr. Musk has been poised to confront Apple since taking over Twitter.His business planis predicated on shifting its revenue from a dependence on advertising to a greater reliance on subscription sales. But any new subscription revenue will be subject to Apple\u2019s practice of taking as much as a 30 percent cut.\nMr. Musk\u2019s complaints also come at a pivotal time for Apple. There\u2019s a push in Congress during the final months of the year to advance a series of antitrust laws. Among the bills under consideration is the Open App Markets Act, which seeks to give developers more control over their apps and allow them to skirt the fees that Apple and Google charge.\n\u201cElon is the latest chapter in a push to make App Store fees lower, and this will resurrect a topic that\u2019s been fairly quiet over the past six months,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, a technology research firm. He said he anticipated a future in which App Store fees were reduced to around 20 percent.\nMr. Musk and a spokesman for Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\nApple has increasingly faced a backlash from app developers, as well as pressure from regulators and politicians around the world, over its App Store policies. The App Store has become a prime gateway where billions of iPhone users download Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, games and all sorts of other programs, making it an arbiter of software distribution.\nApple uses the fees that it collects from its App Store, which was created in 2008, to pay a staff of several hundred people who review each app that it distributes. The company has said its app reviewers protect customers\u2019 privacy and security, as well as prevent them from being subjected to fraud.\nAmong the things that the reviewers vet is the use of Apple\u2019s in-app payment system, which has helped the company collect an estimated $22 billion in fees annually from developers, according to Sensor Tower, a market research firm.\nIn 2019, Epic, the maker of the Fortnite video game,sued Applefor anticompetitive behavior with its App Store. Last year, the judge in the case ruled largely in favor of Apple, finding that the company did protect the privacy and security of customers. But the judge also issued a ruling that would require Apple to allow developers to link customers to their own payment systems. Both Epic and Apple are appealing the case.\nOn Monday, Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive officer, lent his support to Mr. Musk on Twitter. Mr. Sweeney pointed out that Apple had kicked Epic out of the App Store when it similarly defied the tech giant\u2019s policies. He questioned if Apple would boot every developer that complained about it, a list that now includes Meta\u2019s Facebook, Spotify and Twitter.\n\u201cApple blocked Fortnite within a few hours of Epic defying their policy,\u201d Mr. Sweeney tweeted. \u201cWould they nuke Twitter? Spotify? Facebook? Netflix? At what point does the whole rotten structure collapse?\u201d\nApple has rankled app developers for other reasons. Last year, it made a series of tech changes to enhance people\u2019s privacy on mobile apps. Those shifts made it harder for many apps to target mobile advertising to users, leading tech executivesincluding Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, which owns Instagram as well as Facebook, to speak out.\nApple has also required companies to create a \u201csafe experience\u201d for their apps to be listed in its App Store. After the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol last year, Apple blocked the \u201cfree speech\u201d social networkParlerfrom appearing in its App Store until the service introduced guardrails to prevent calls for violence on the service.\n\u201cIn my time at Twitter, representatives of the app stores regularly raised concerns about content available on our platform,\u201d Yoel Roth, Twitter\u2019s former head of trust and safety, wrote in aneditorialin The New York Times this month. Mr. Roth said App Store reviewers had raised concerns about pornography and racial slurs on Twitter.\nMr. Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter has upended the relative harmony between it and Apple. As an outspoken user of the platform, with nearly 120 million followers, Mr. Musk has often used Twitter to needle business rivals like Bill Gates or Sam Bankman-Fried. His spat with Mr. Cook could become \u201ca revolution against online censorship in America,\u201d Mr. Musktweetedon Monday.\nLast week, Mr. Musk also mused about building his own phone if Apple and Google booted Twitter from their app stores. \u201cI certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,\u201d hetweeted.\nApple has urged Mr. Musk to preserve the status quo. In aninterview with \u201cCBS Mornings\u201dthis month, Mr. Cook was asked whether there was a risk that Twitter could be removed from the App Store. He said Twitter would continue to be distributed and praised its commitment to moderate abusive content.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants hate speech on their platform, so I\u2019m counting on them to continue to do that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nPhil Schiller, a longtime Apple executive who helps oversee its App Store, recently deleted his Twitter account whenMr. Musk reinstated former President Donald J. Trumpto the platform. Mr. Cook continues to use Twitter and used it last week to wish his followers a happy Thanksgiving.\nMr. Musk\u2019s attacks on Apple\u2019s leadership could create challenges for the tech giant \u201cin Congress, where Big Tech is still a target,\u201d Mr. Munster of Loup Ventures said. Republicans in Congress have embraced Mr. Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter because he has promised to restore free speech, an issue that they speak about often. Mr. Musk resonates with that group, which is ascendant in Washington, Mr. Munster said.\nIn September, Mr. Cook met with Republican congressional leaders, including Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and discussed the importance of free speech online, two people familiar with those conversations said. Because Apple doesn\u2019t have social media platforms, it has so far largely avoided being dragged into that debate."

        "title": "After Covid Lockdown, Fear and Unrest Sweep iPhone Factory in China",
        "fulltext": "Covid lockdown measures have generated a wave of fear and unrest inside the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturing complex, in north-central China, with stories of food shortages among quarantined employees filling social media, and large numbers of workers fleeing the facility.\nThe plant, operated by Foxconn, the Taiwanese-based manufacturing giant with facilities across China, went into lockdown in mid-October as coronavirus cases were rising in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province. Under China\u2019s zero-Covid policies, cities and companies are expected to take strict measures to eliminate transmission of the virus.\nAs Covid cases began to be detected in the plant, Foxconn shut the facility off from the outside world, walling its roughly 200,000 workers inside its grounds. It banned eating in the factory\u2019s cafeteria, forced employees to take long, circuitous routes from their dormitories to reduce contact with others, and required daily coronavirus testing and temperature checks.\nBut what really worried workers were accounts that emerged from employees who had been taken into quarantine after testing positive. At the mercy of Foxconn to feed themselves, some said they were getting inadequate food or none at all, and were lacking other necessities.\nAs these stories spread on social media, other workers decided they were better off fleeing their job than risk catching the virus and being forced into quarantine. Two workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation from the company, said hundreds of workers had left the plant.\nWith transportation restricted as Zhengzhou dealt with the outbreak, many had no options but to walk home, some over long distances.\nChina\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been promoted byXi Jinping,who last month won a third term as China\u2019s leader. The policy, marked by severe lockdowns and quarantines, has led to the shutdown of entire cities because of a handful of cases.\nOn Wednesday, Zhengzhou officials ordered the region around the plant to go into a seven-day lockdown, imperiling any further attempts to flee. A local notice called the outbreak \u201cserious and complex,\u201d as the city reported 358 new locally transmitted cases on Wednesday, up from 24 on the same day a week before.\nOn Monday, the authorities closed the Shanghai Disney Resort after an outbreak of 10 Covid cases in Shanghai,Reuters reported. Visitors at the theme park were kept inside until they could provide a negative test.\nEarlier experiences in China, such as the Shanghai lockdown this year, suggest that the Zhengzhou measures could extend beyond what was initially announced. Visiting the complex on Tuesday, the province\u2019s governor urged Foxconn to improve the care of its workers.\nApple, the maker of the iPhone, did not respond to a request for comment. In an emailed statement, Foxconn, one of the principal assemblers of Apple products, referred to its pandemic measures as a \u201cprotracted battle\u201d and insisted that its workers were receiving three meals a day.\nBut employees accused Foxconn of a chaotic and at times illogical Covid response. They said the company had sent workers who tested positive for the coronavirus into quarantine centers together with their close contacts, even when those individuals had tested negative. At the same time, other close contacts were told that they must continue working.\nLeo Lin, 29, who works inside the factory complex, described an atmosphere of panic as quarantine facilities began to overflow and the factory lost its grip on isolating close contacts.\nFor years, Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million people, has helped supercharge China\u2019s export-driven economic model. Known as \u201ciPhone City,\u201d it has come to manufacture roughly half of Apple\u2019s global iPhone supply.\nThe seven-day lockdown announced on Wednesday may hurt Foxconn\u2019s ability to ship iPhones from the plant. China\u2019s economy as a whole is growing at its slowest pace in decades under the government\u2019s policy of preventing infections with strict lockdowns that can shut down entire regions over just a handful of cases.\nIn a sign of Foxconn\u2019s concern about the exodus of workers, the company last week began offering them an extra $14 a day to continue working. On Tuesday, the company increased the figure to $55 a day, according to an official announcement.\nInitially, Foxconn did not allow its workers to leave the facility, but as public outrage mounted on social media, the company relented. One worker told The New York Times that it was unclear whether those who had left would keep their jobs or be paid for work already performed.\nGao Mingjun, the daughter of a Foxconn worker, said that her mother had not tested positive during the outbreak, but that the factory had placed her mother in quarantine with a colleague sleeping in the bunk above her. That co-worker later tested positive.\nAround 5 p.m. on Saturday, her mother decided to walk the 38 miles back to her home in Xuchang, exiting through the complex\u2019s front gate with about 100 co-workers. Some eight hours later, Ms. Gao called her exhausted mother, asking her to take a break at the side of the road.\n\u201cHer feet hurt too much, and they were all blistered up,\u201d Ms. Gao said.\nAt dawn on Sunday, after having walked all night, her mother reached the community center in Xuchang.\n\u201cThe trek was very long,\u201d Ms. Gao said of her mother\u2019s journey. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely not going back to Foxconn.\u201d"

The increase would continue the Fed\u2019s effort to douse inflation by raising borrowing costs to reduce consumer demand.\nThe big question is, what will the central bank do next?Optimism has returned to the markets in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 climbing 8.1 percent last month on hopes of a \u201cFed pivot\u201d toward smaller rate increases in the future. Investors in Asia and Europe nudged stocks higher this morning, and U.S. futures are flat.\nThere are competing factors weighing on the Fed.The most persuasive came from Tuesday\u2019s data on job openings and quit rates, known as the JOLTS report, which showed a still-healthy and growing \u2014 though slowing \u2014 U.S. labor market. Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist for LPL Financial, wrote in a research note that the JOLTS data suggest the U.S. jobs market could withstand further rate increases. (On cue, stocks slumped.)\nMeanwhile, left-leaning lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont,openly questionedthe Fed\u2019s aggressive rate-increase policy, saying its approach reflected \u201can apparent disregard for the livelihoods of millions of working Americans.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect Jay Powell, the Fed chair, to make bold proclamations.He\u2019s unlikely to declare an end to jumbo-size rate increases in his speech after the Fed decision. Instead, investors will be on alert for subtleties: \u201cCertainly yanking/modifying \u2018ongoing increases\u2019 from the statement would be the first clue\u201d that the Fed sees smaller increases in the future, Tom Porcelli, a chief economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.\nMeanwhile, investors will also watch the Bank of England tomorrow, when it convenes its first rate-setting meeting since Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s prime minister. Like the Fed, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates by 0.75 percentage points, the biggest increase in 30 years, to bring down torrid inflation and maintain a sense of calm in the markets for British government bonds and the pound.\nCVS and others reach a tentative $12 billion settlement over the opioid crisis.CVS said it has agreed in principle topay $5 billionto resolve thousands of state and local lawsuits accusing it and other chains of mishandling opioids.Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walmartare also said to be on the hook for billions if a deal is reached.\nJair Bolsonaro agrees to a transition of power in Brazil.The incumbent Brazilian presidentwon\u2019t stop his administrationfrom handing over the country\u2019s leadership to his left-wing rival, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. But Bolsonaro didn\u2019t admit defeat or tell his supporters to end protests that have blocked highways across Brazil.\nUkraine grain shipments will restart today, Turkey says.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey saidRussia had agreed to resume participationin a deal that lets ships carrying wheat and other crops depart Ukraine. Wheat futures in Chicago dropped on the news, as investor fears about a global grain shortage abated.\nBenjamin Netanyahu may yet return to power.Interim results from Israel\u2019s election show his Likud party on a path toforming a majority in Parliament. That could propel Netanyahu back to the prime minister position, even as he stands trial on corruption charges \u2014 though pollsters said it was too early to call the election.\nThe U.S. should ban TikTok, a top federal official says.Brendan Carr, one of five members of the Federal Communications Commission, told Axios that the Chinese-owned video platform should bebarred on national security grounds, given concerns about U.S. data privacy. TikTok noted that Carr has no role in any such decision.\nDays into the Elon Musk era at Twitter, the makings of anew business modelfor the long-embattled social network are taking shape. The company\u2019s new owner is pressing ahead with a subscription offering, which Musk has repeatedly emphasized is a necessary new source of revenue.\nBut its importance has also seemingly grown as more advertisers have said they are at least temporarily stepping back amid worries about widening chaos on the platform.\nA key Musk focus is an $8-a-month Twitter Blue service.As currently envisioned, subscribers would receive the \u201cverified\u201d check-mark badge, see fewer ads, be ranked higher in replies to others\u2019 tweets, be able to share longer videos and bypass paywalls at news publishers that partner with Twitter. (The $8 monthly fee was lowered from the original $20 figure \u2026 after Musk seemed tonegotiate publicly with the author Stephen King.)\nTwitter is also reportedly rushing out a service that would let userscharge others to see content like video, according to The Washington Post; the feature has raised internal concerns about copyright infringement and other legal issues.\nWill users pay for Twitter Blue?Supporters of the movepoint to other social networks, like LinkedIn andSnap, that charge users for additional features. And some organizations, like the newsletter publisher Puck, said they wouldfork over the feesto keep their employees verified.\nBut others point out that verification is meant at least in part to, well,verifythat the Twitter user is authentic, and paying to get a check markdefeats that purpose. Check marks will also effectively turn subscribers\u2019 prioritized tweets into paid advertisements for Twitter Blue, whichcould turn off actual advertisersthat want their ads to appear next to organically popular content, Slate argues.\nWe\u2019d also ask: How much money would subscriptions bring in? \u201cIt won\u2019t be the majority of people, but there\u2019s asmall base of people that will\u201d subscribe, the analyst Rich Greenfield told The Wall Street Journal. But given that Twitter\u2019s own internal research from before the Musk deal closed purportedly showed adrop in activity among power users, it\u2019s unclear how much Twitter Blue would add to a top line that hit $5 billion last year.\nSpeaking of advertisers \u2026Twitter\u2019s ad leadership is in disarray, after Leslie Berland, its chief marketing officer, and Sarah Personette, its sales chief, left the company.\nAnd though Musk flew to New York this week to allay advertising executives\u2019 fears over content moderation, the ad giant IPG has joined the firms advising clients to temporarily suspend campaigns on the platform over just that.\nIn other Twitter news:\nHere\u2019s a running list ofcelebrities who have said they\u2019ll leave Twitter.\nU.S. officials are said to be deliberating whether they have the authority toreview Musk\u2019s takeoveron national security grounds.\nMusk has reportedly pulled over 50 Tesla workers into Twitter-related duty \u2014 even though their skill setsaren\u2019t compatible with Twitter\u2019s systems.\nThe great tech rout of 2022 continued on Tuesday as Amazon, a bellwether tech stock, fell 5.5 percent on fears about the slowing global economy and rising interest rates sapping consumer demand. In the past year, investors have dumped shares in Amazon, erasing about $700 billion from its market valuation.\nAmazon is the third tech stock to crash out of the trillion-dollar club this year.Meta Platforms, Facebook\u2019s parent company, is down 71 percent for the year, and is now valued at $252 billion, while Tesla is down nearly 42 percent and has a market cap of $719 billion. Only Apple, the Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft still have thirteen-digit valuations.\nA reminder: Andy Jassy, who took over as Amazon C.E.O. last year, will join Andrew to discuss the future of its businessat the DealBook Summiton Nov. 30.\n\u2014 Colm Kelleher, the chair of UBS, responding to a top Chinese official at a bankers\u2019 summit in Hong Kong today. Participants at the event were advised to discount unfavorable reports in international media about what\u2019s happening in China.\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, start-ups focused on women\u2019s healthseized the momenttorally supportersof abortion rights. There are now emerging signs that investment dollars for these companies \u2014 which for years have been largely neglected by venture capitalists \u2014 are growing in the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson.\n\u201cSomething changed,\u201dElizabeth Bailey, a managing director of the women\u2019s health-focused venture firm RH Capital, told DealBook. RH Capital this week closed its oversubscribed second fund at $38.5 million \u2014 with more than a quarter of that amount coming in the few months after the Dobbs decision. \u201cWe simply had not seen that momentum previously,\u201d Bailey added.\nThat said, some women\u2019s health start-ups, particularly those focused on abortion access, are still reporting difficulties. The co-founder of Hey Jane, which provides abortion pills and which recently raised $6.1 million in new funding, said last month that many potential investors werewary of being entangled in politics.\nOverall investment in women\u2019s health start-ups is coming off a low baseline.Global investment in so-called \u201cfemtech\u201d companiescrossed $1 billionfor the first time just last year, according to PitchBook. (Female-founded companies overall receivedonly 2.4 percentof thenearly $330 billionof U.S. venture capital invested last year.)\nAmong the reasons for the low numbers is the historical dearth of female venture investors, leading mostly male-led firms to ignore start-ups focused on women\u2019s health and concerns. Still, the trend lines are improving, as more women rise in the venture capital industry and investors recognize the market potential of femtech and related industries. \u201cWe are at least seeing things moving in the right direction,\u201d Bailey said.\nDeals\nQatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund reportedly plans toincrease its stake in Credit Suisseas part of the Swiss bank\u2019s financial turnaround.
