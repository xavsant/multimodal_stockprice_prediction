        "title": "Judge Tells Apple to Help Unlock iPhone Used by San Bernardino Gunman",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A judge in California on Tuesday ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December.\nThe ruling handed the F.B.I. a potentially important victory in its long-running battle with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies over the government\u2019s ability to get access to encrypted data in investigations. Apple has maintained that requiring it to provide the \u201ckeys\u201d to its technology would compromise the security of the information of hundreds of millions of users.\nThe F.B.I. says that its experts have been unable to get into the iPhone 5c used bySyed Rizwan Farook, who was killed by the police along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, after they attacked Mr. Farook\u2019s co-workers at a holiday gathering.\nProsecutors said in a court filing that Apple had the \u201cexclusive\u201d means to bypass the security features on the phone, but that the company had \u201cdeclined to provide that assistance voluntarily.\u201d F.B.I. experts say that because of the phone\u2019s security features, they risk losing the data permanently after 10 failed attempts to enter the password.\nThe Justice Department had secured a search warrant for the phone, which is owned by Mr. Farook\u2019s former employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. But prosecutors said they saw little choice but to seek the additional order compelling Apple\u2019s assistance.\nOfficials have discovered a potential link between the attackers and Islamic extremism.\nIn an unusually detailed directive, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the District of Central California ordered Apple to provide \u201creasonable technical assistance\u201d to the F.B.I. in unlocking the phone. That assistance should allow investigators to \u201cbypass or erase the auto-erase function\u201d on the phone, among other steps, she wrote.\nIn a statement,Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the company would oppose the order and resist efforts to provide a \u201cback door\u201d to the iPhone, and he called the implications of the government\u2019s demands \u201cchilling.\u201d\n\u201cFor many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers\u2019 personal data because we believe it\u2019s the only way to keep their information safe,\u201d the company said inthe statement. \u201cWe have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.\u201d\nProsecutors said the contents of the phone could provide crucial evidence about the attackers\u2019 communications and contacts before the shooting.\nThe husband and wife appear to have been motivated by a devotion to violent jihad, but the authorities have not connected them publicly to any extremists overseas. Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor, has been charged with providing them with the assault weapons used in the attack and conspiring with Mr. Farook in an earlier plot that was not carried out.\nEileen M. Decker, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, where the investigation is being handled, said the effort to compel Apple\u2019s technical cooperation marked \u201canother step \u2014 a potentially important step \u2014 in the process of learning everything we possibly can about the attack in San Bernardino.\u201d\nA vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.\nProsecutors \u201chave made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible,\u201d Ms. Decker said.\nJames B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, has been at odds with Apple and other technology companies for months over whether they should provide de-encryption technology for their products. Without it, he has argued, the bureau is at risk of \u201cgoing dark\u201d in its investigations. The Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and most of the Republican hopefuls support Mr. Comey\u2019s stance.\nApple and other technology companies say that creating an opening in their products for government investigators would also create a vulnerability that Chinese, Iranian, Russian or North Korean hackers could exploit.\nApple, arguing in December against a British proposal that could force it to provide the government with a way into iPhone communications, said the dispute should not be seen \u201cas an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Apple argued. \u201cLaw enforcement today has access to more data \u2014 data which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justice \u2014 than ever before in the history of our world.\u201d\nApple said that \u201cwe believe it would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat.\u201d"

But I must take umbrage at Apple\u2019s position regarding the unlocking of a terrorist\u2019s cellphone.\nThis is not a fishing expedition. It is a single request for a single telephone in the aftermath of a heinous act, a request that has the imprimatur of a legally sought and granted court order.\nAs much as Apple would like to believe that privacy is absolute, it is not. Not when the society that provides it is placed at grave and continuing risk. Apple has an obligation to that society to provide whatever protection is in its power to achieve.\nRICHARD M. FRAUENGLASS\nHuntington, N.Y.\nTo the Editor:\nMaybe it\u2019s time to try a Solomonic solution to the standoff between Apple and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a phone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack.\nApple maintains that the content on each of its customers\u2019 iPhones is uniquely encrypted and that it possesses no master key to unlock the data. The F.B.I. offers a workaround. It apparently wants Apple to load a new operating system onto the disputed phone, minus the feature that allows owners to have all their information erased if someone makes 10 failed passcode attempts.\nThe F.B.I. would then use a computer to achieve entry by trying combinations of letters and numbers. The task would be herculean: There are hundreds of millions of possible combinations in a 32-character passcode alone.\nIt seems to me that using such a method would isolate the defeat of Apple\u2019s security to this one phone.\nBut to ensure that the tool has no chance of being used indiscriminately by law enforcement or slipping into the hands of criminals, the judge could modify her order. Tell Apple to delete the passcode protection on the phone in its own laboratories.\nThe F.B.I. would be present but would have no access to the programming fix. Then let Apple conduct the \u201cbrute force\u201d maneuver to guess the passcode, transfer the phone data to a hard copy and then destroy the altered software or place it in a vault.\nPerhaps Apple would object to being forced to serve as an arm of law enforcement. But every day companies are pressed into complicity when they obey subpoenas to hand over phone or credit card records of a criminal suspect.\nApple would be able to guarantee privacy to its law-abiding customers, while the government would not be crippled in its obligation to look for further potential accomplices to a horrible mass murder.\nFRANK SPENCER-MOLLOY\nSimsbury, Conn.\nTo the Editor:\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is not asking for a way to remotely hack into your phone without your knowledge. The backdoor the agency wants Apple to enable still requires physical possession of the phone, as well as of special hacking equipment and deep expertise. It cannot be used for mass data collection like that of the National Security Agency.\nApple warns of enabling hackers and totalitarian governments. But what hackers have your physical phone? And what dictators are not already able to coerce you or Apple to unlock your phone?\nCurrent law permits cellphone searches. If we don\u2019t like a law, we should repeal it, not make it easier to evade.\nILYA SHLYAKHTER\nCambridge, Mass.\nTo the Editor:\nAs an employee who works for a retailer for Apple and other cellphone products, I receive firsthand experience with Apple customers every day. Apple customers and those familiar with their devices openly recognize the company for the trademark safety measures that are taken with the encryption of its products.\nA right to privacy is an understandable priority to every individual, whether outside or within the United States. It is a priority to small family businesses and businesses that interact globally.\nEvery day, I have the opportunity to work with a diverse network of Apple customers who proudly proclaim their human right to confidentiality with the purchase of their devices. We have experienced that right often taken away from us with an unjustified aim.\nI cheer the efforts Apple is making to protect that right, and I don\u2019t even have an iPhone.\nAMANDA DELACRUZ\n\nLake Worth, Fla."

        "title": "Apple Faces U.S. Demand to Unlock 9 More iPhones",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department is demanding Apple\u2019s help in unlocking at least nine iPhones nationwide in addition to the phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.\nThe disclosure appears to buttress the company\u2019s concerns that the dispute could pose a threat to encryption safeguards that goes well beyond the single California case.\nApple is fighting the government\u2019s demands in at least seven of the other nine cases, Marc J. Zwillinger, a lawyer for the company, said in a letter unsealed in federal court on Tuesday.\n\u201cApple has not agreed to perform any services on the devices,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger wrote. Starting in December, the letter says, Apple has in a number of cases objected to the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to force its cooperation through a 1789 statute known as the All Writs Act, which says courts can require actions to comply with their orders.\nIn the San Bernardino case, prosecutors have cast their demands for Apple to help them unlock the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook \u2014 one of the attackers in the December rampage, in which 14 people were killed \u2014 as a limited effort in response to an unusual situation.\nStill, \u201cno one should be surprised that we\u2019re investigating other cases and looking for assistance in those other cases,\u201d a law enforcement official said on Tuesday.\nSince challenging a judge\u2019s demand in the San Bernardino case, which called for Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone\u2019s passcode, the company has repeatedly asserted that such a move could not be done in isolation.\n\u201cOnce created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said in a letter to customers. And in anoteon its website on Monday, Apple said law enforcement agencies nationwide \u201chave hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the F.B.I. wins this case.\u201d\nApple has long maintained that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it was technically able to do so. In a report covering the first six months of 2015, Apple said it had received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies worldwide for information on roughly 60,000 devices, and it provided some data in roughly 7,100 instances.\nBut while the data backed up on Apple\u2019s iCloud service is readily accessible by the company, it has made the security on the iPhone itself increasingly hard to crack.\nBecause a number of the newly disclosed cases remain sealed, Apple\u2019s letter did not describe the types of crimes at issue. But they appear to involve run-of-the-mill prosecutions for offenses like drug trafficking and pornography, rather than a high-profile terrorism investigation, officials said.\nThe newly disclosed cases are in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston.\nThe existence of the other demands came to light in a drug-trafficking case in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where prosecutors are seeking access to the data held in an iPhone linked to a methamphetamine distribution ring.\nThe owner of the phone,Jun Feng, 45, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the case. But prosecutors have pushed ahead anyway with their efforts to force Apple to unlock his phone, in part because they maintain that it could lead them to other drug suspects.\nThe two sides are awaiting a ruling from Magistrate Judge James Orenstein on whether Apple should be forced to cooperate. Before issuing a ruling, Judge Orenstein wanted Apple to detail other pending requests from prosecutors.\nThe Brooklyn drug-trafficking case has been dwarfed by the fight in California. But national security lawyers say the Brooklyn case remains important, because Judge Orenstein\u2019s decision is expected to be the first to offer a broad examination of the government\u2019s authority under the All Writs Act to force Apple to unlock passcode-protected iPhones.\nThe judge has indicated skepticism over the government\u2019s demands. Initially, Apple agreed to a formal order to help the Justice Department gain access to Mr. Feng\u2019s phone, but Judge Orenstein balked, questioning whether the All Writs Act could be used that way. He invited Apple\u2019s lawyers to raise objections.\nWhile his ultimate decision will not be legally binding in California, it could influence the legal arguments there. And an appeal by either side has the potential to work its way through the federal court system to become significant case law.\nLaw enforcement officials around the country are anxiously watching the cases in both Brooklyn and California to see how their own investigations might be affected.\nAt a news conference last week after the debate erupted in California, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said they had collected about 175 iPhones, in investigations, that they have been unable to unlock.\nMr. Vance rejected the notion that Apple should be forced to cooperate only in certain prominent crimes.\n\u201cWhat we discover is that investigation into one crime often leads into criminal activity in another, sometimes much more serious than what we were originally looking at,\u201d he said."

        "title": "How Tim Cook, in iPhone Battle, Became a Bulwark for Digital Privacy",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Letters from around the globe began pouring into the inbox of Timothy D. Cook not long after the publication of the first revelations from Edward J. Snowden about mass government surveillance.\nDo you know how much privacy means to us? they asked Apple\u2019s chief executive. Do you understand?\nMr. Cook did. He was proud that Apple sold physical products \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not traffic in the intimate, digital details of its customers\u2019 lives.\nThat stance crystallized on Tuesday when Mr. Cook huddled for hours with lawyers and others at Apple\u2019s headquarters to figure out how to respond to afederal court order requiring thecompany to let the United States government break into the iPhone of one of the gunmen in aSan Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting.Late Tuesday, Mr. Cook took the fight public with aletter to customersthat he personally signed.\n\u201cWe feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,\u201d wrote Mr. Cook, 55. \u201cUltimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201d\nMr. Cook\u2019s standoff with law enforcement officials is indicative of his personal evolution from a behind-the-scenes operator at Apple to one of the world\u2019s most outspoken corporate executives. During that time, he has moved a once secretive Silicon Valley company into the center of highly charged social and legal issues. While Mr. Cook\u2019s predecessor, Apple co-founderSteven P. Jobs, was considered a business icon, he never took aggressive positions on such matters as Mr. Cook now has.\nBeing at loggerheads with the United States government is risky for Apple and may draw a torrent of public criticism of the world\u2019s most valuable company at a time when itsgrowth rate has significantly decelerated.\nYet people who know Mr. Cook said he did not believe he had a choice but to be vocal. Mr. Cook, who became Apple\u2019s chief executive in 2011, has long said that businesses and their leaders should think of themselves as important members of civic society. In September,he emphasizedthat this responsibility \u201chas grown markedly in the last couple of decades or so as government has found it more difficult to move forward.\u201d\nMr. Cook \u201csays what he believes, especially in difficult situations,\u201d said Don Logan, the former chairman of Time Warner Cable who has been friends with Mr. Cook since he became chief executive of Apple, bonding over their shared alma mater, Auburn University. Of Mr. Cook\u2019s opposition to the court order, Mr. Logan said: \u201cTim is currently dealing with a very difficult situation and he knows the decision he has made has lots of ramifications, good or bad. But he wants to do the right thing.\u201d\nApple declined to make Mr. Cook available for an interview. The company is preparing to file an opposition brief against the court order.\nMr. Cook\u2019s ideas about civic duty were partly formed during his childhood in rural Alabama. In a speech at the United Nations in 2013, he recounted how Ku Klux Klansmen had once burned a cross on the lawn of a black family\u2019s home and how he yelled for them to stop. \u201cThis image was permanently imprinted in my brain, and it would change my life forever,\u201d he said.\nAt Apple, which he joined as a senior executive in 1998, Mr. Cook was a quiet figure for much of the period when he worked for Mr. Jobs, a showman who prized secrecy at the company. After Mr. Jobs stepped down because of ailing health, Mr. Cook began making Apple more open, publishing an annual report on suppliers and working conditions for more than a million factory workers.\nIn 2014,Mr. Cook revealed he was gay, a move widely seen as making a statement about gay rights. Last year, he wrote aneditorialdecrying religious freedom laws that had been proposed in more than two dozen states that would let people skirt anti-discrimination laws that conflicted with their religious beliefs.\nHis outspokenness has drawn criticism, with some investors questioning how nonbusiness initiatives \u2014 including some of Apple\u2019s environmental moves \u2014 would contribute to the company\u2019s bottom line. Mr. Cook responded at a shareholder meeting that it is important for Apple to do things \u201cbecause they\u2019re just and right.\u201d\nPrivacy has long been a priority for Mr. Cook. At a tech conference in 2010, he said Apple \u201chas always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.\u201d He cited the iPhone\u2019s feature that shows where a phone \u2014 and presumably its user \u2014 is and said fears about abuse and stalking had compelled the company to let consumers decide whether or not their apps could use their location data.\ntranscript\nna\nMr. Cook\u2019s views on privacy hardened over time as customers globally began entrusting more personal data to Apple\u2019s iPhones. At the same time, Apple was growing tired of requests from government officials worldwide asking the company to unlock smartphones.\nEach data-extraction request was carefully vetted by Apple\u2019s lawyers. Of those deemed legitimate, Apple in recent years required that law enforcement officials physically travel with the gadget to the company\u2019s headquarters, where a trusted Apple engineer would work on the phones inside Faraday bags, which block wireless signals, during the process of data extraction.\nProcessing these requests was extremely tedious. More worrisome, the data stored on its customers iPhones was growing more personal, including photos, messages and bank, health and travel data.\nAnd some government officials were not exactly instilling confidence in Apple\u2019s engineers. In one case, after law enforcement officials rushed a phone to Apple\u2019s headquarters for data extraction, the engineers discovered their target had not enabled the device\u2019s passcode feature.\nSo Mr. Cook and other Apple executives resolved not only to lock up customer data, but to do so in a way that would put the keys squarely in the hands of the customer, not the company. By the time Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system, iOS7, in September 2013, the company was encrypting all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones by default.\n\u201cPeople have a basic right to privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook has said.\nBy then, Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about how the National Security Agency had cozied up to some tech companies and hacked others to gain user data were reverberating worldwide. The disclosures included revelations of a comprehensive, decade-long Central Intelligence Agency program to compromise Apple\u2019s products; C.I.A. analysts tampered with the products so the government could collect app makers\u2019 data. In other cases, the agency was embedding spy tools in Apple\u2019s hardware, and even modifying an Apple software update that allowed government analysts to record every keystroke.\nLetters from alarmed Apple customers started flooding into Mr. Cook\u2019s inbox, fortifying his stance on privacy. Apple\u2019s eighth mobile operating system, iOS8, which rolled out in September 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.\nFor officials at the world\u2019s law enforcement agencies, the new software was a clear signal that Apple was growing defiant. A month after iOS8\u2019s release, James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., told an audience at the Brookings Institution that Apple had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d with the expanded encryption, arguing that the operating system effectively sealed off any chance of tracking kidnappers, terrorists and criminals.\nGovernment agencies began to press Apple and other tech companies for so-called back doors that could bypass strong security measures. With tensions rising, some form of technical compromise \u2014 whether in the form of a chip, a back door or a key \u2014 was off the table by 2015.\nAt Apple, Mr. Cook and others continued to work with investigators to the extent the company could and complied with court orders. Last October, a federal judge in New York said the government was overstepping its boundaries by using a centuries-old law, the All Writs Act, as the basis for its request that Apple open an iPhone for a drug investigation. Apple\u2019s lawyer sided with the judge in the case. The matter has not been resolved.\nAfter December\u2019s San Bernardino attack, Apple worked with the F.B.I. to gather data that had been backed up to the cloud from a work iPhone issued to one of the assailants, according to court filings. When investigators also wanted unspecified information on the phone that had not been backed up, the judge this week granted the order requiring Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone\u2019s passcode and get into the device.\nApple had asked the F.B.I. to issue its application for the tool under seal. But the government made it public, prompting Mr. Cook to go into bunker mode to draft a response, according to people privy to the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The result was the letter that Mr. Cook signed on Tuesday, where he argued that it set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for a company to be forced to build tools for the government that weaken security.\n\u201cCompromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why encryption has become so important to all of us.\u201d\nFar from backing down from the fight, Mr. Cook has told colleagues that he still stands by the company\u2019s longstanding plans to encrypt everything stored on Apple\u2019s myriad devices, services and in the cloud, where the bulk of data is still stored unencrypted.\n\u201cIf you place any value on civil liberties, you don\u2019t do what law enforcement is asking,\u201d Mr. Cook has said."

But those protections do not go far in preventing the government from gaining access to a person\u2019s digital information in an investigation because probable cause is a low standard for getting a warrant.\nMoreover, Apple\u2019s resistance to the order, issued under a 1789 law calledthe All Writs Act, is not based on the Constitution, because there is no question that the government has a sound basis to search for evidence that might be on the iPhone about planning for the attack in December.\nAletterissued last week by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, announcing the decision not to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation gain access to the data makes no mention of the Constitution. Instead, it talks more generally about the need to protect personal privacy and the security of customer information. AsThe New York Timespointed out, there may be a significant global business advantage to Apple\u2019s stance that has little to do with what the law provides.\nA much greater stumbling block for the government in obtaining encrypted data is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which can be used to thwart efforts to get passwords required to unlock encrypted files. In the world of cryptology, a secret code known only to the user usually means that the information could be kept away from the government unless there is a means to compel the person to reveal it.\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that an individual cannot be forced to be \u201ca witness against himself,\u201d which generally means the government cannot force someone to disclose information that can be used to convict that person. But whether it lets a person shield electronic files is a more complicated issue.\nThe scope of the privilege against self-incrimination came up last year in an insider trading case, and it illustrates how the courts have struggled to adapt the Fifth Amendment to gaining access to digital information.\nIn Securities and Exchange Commission v. Huang, two defendants were accused of gathering confidential information from their employer, Capital One, about credit card usage at retailers to help identify which companies to buy shares. The bank provided smartphones to its employees, and each had a personal passcode known only to the user. The S.E.C. suspected that the defendants\u2019 phones, which they returned to Capital One after resigning, contained information that would be helpful to proving the case, so it asked for a court order directing them to reveal their codes so the files could be opened.\nThe defendants asserted the Fifth Amendment, claiming that revealing the codes could lead to potentially incriminating evidence useful in a criminal case because insider trading violations can be prosecuted by the Justice Department.\nThe problem is figuring out how far the privilege against self-incrimination goes in protecting passwords that can open encrypted files.\nIndividuals cannot be forced to reveal the contents of their own mind, but they can be required to turn over records that could reflect their thoughts. The Supreme Court held inFisher v. United Statesthat the content of documents \u2014 even if they are incriminating \u2014 is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.\nBut the court then noted that the act of turning over the records, called the \u201cact of production,\u201d could convey information about their existence, possession and authenticity, and therefore that could be the basis for asserting the privilege against self-incrimination.\nAs if that\u2019s not confusing enough, the Supreme Court in the Fisher case then explained that the government could still force an individual to turn over documents if any information conveyed by the act of production was a \u201cforegone conclusion,\u201d meaning the government learned little new from turning them over.\nThe nub of the issue is this: Does turning over a password to open up encrypted files reveal new information from the person\u2019s mind, or is it just like handing over a folder with documents the government already knows exists and is at your house?\nCourts love to use metaphors (or perhaps similes) to illustrate their analysis, even though these rarely have much explanatory power. Here is one Justice John Paul Stevens used in a dissenting opinion inDoe v. United Statesto explain how the Fifth Amendment operates for producing information: \u201cHe may in some cases be forced to surrender a key to a strongbox containing incriminating documents, but I do not believe he can be compelled to reveal the combination to his wall safe.\u201d\nThis is where the challenge of digital information makes the Fifth Amendment analysis more difficult. A password is a bit like a key, because it simply opens up files contained in the electronic version of a file cabinet. But it is also similar to the combination to a safe, such as the use of numbers in a specific sequence in the code.\nFiguring out which one it is has divided the courts. In the Huang case, the district judge denied the request to reveal the passwords, finding that \u201cas the S.E.C is not seeking business records but defendants\u2019 personal thought processes, defendants may properly invoke their Fifth Amendment right.\u201d\nIt turned out that denying access to the smartphones did not affect the case, as one defendant settled and a jury found the other engaged in insider trading.\nIn an earlier case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlantareached a similar conclusionwhen the Justice Department issued a grand jury subpoena requiring the production of unencrypted hard drives from a computer suspected of containing child pornography. The appeals court found that the act of decryption would be testimonial, and therefore subject to the Fifth Amendment.\nOther courts have reached the exact opposite conclusion regarding the availability of the Fifth Amendment to maintain the encryption of electronic records. The Federal District Court in Denver, inUnited States v. Fricosu, found that the privilege against self-incrimination did not prevent ordering an individual to decrypt the hard drive on a laptop computer. The case is similar to the one involving Apple because the court issued the order under the All Writs Act to compel assistance in furthering an investigation of possible wrongdoing.\nInCommonwealth v. Gelfgatt, the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts, the state\u2019s highest court, found that compelling a lawyer to decrypt files related to a mortgage fraud scheme did not fall within the privilege against self-incrimination. The court noted that the defendant had admitted to installing the encryption program on his computers, so under the foregone conclusion analysis, it would not violate his rights to make him enter the password to decrypt them.\nObtaining access to electronic files, especially emails and messages, can be crucial in white-collar crime cases. Proving a violation usually revolves around establishing a defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent, so there is often no better proof than contemporaneous communications and documents created around the time of the transaction. If encryption keeps that kind of information away from investigators, it will make proving violations that much more difficult.\nUnlike an individual, companies cannot use the Fifth Amendment to encrypt their files to keep them away from the government because that constitutional protection does not apply to organizations. With the Justice Department\u2019s recent emphasis on identifying individuals involved in corporate misconduct as the primary measure of cooperation, getting to the personal data of employees can be crucial to proving a case, especially if companies encourage them to encrypt files as a security measure.\nIt may be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals from having to turn over passwords to help the government obtain evidence that may well end up convicting them.\nThe digital age is making it much more difficult to figure out how far the Constitution should go in dealing with forms of information that were largely unknown a generation ago, much less when the Fifth Amendment was adopted."

        "title": "Explaining Apple\u2019s Fight With the F.B.I.",
        "fulltext": "Tuesday evening, a federal courtordered Appleto help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.\nWednesday morning, Apple said in a strongly worded letter that it wouldchallenge the court\u2019s request. While technology companies recently have resisted government demands, Apple\u2019s letter is one of the industry\u2019s most forceful pushbacks against a court ruling.\nIn the hours after Apple\u2019s letter was published, technologists and legal experts have been dissecting what, exactly, the Cupertino, Calif., company can\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 do to help the government.\nWhat is the government asking for?\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation wants to examine the iPhone used by Syed Farook to determine whether he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, had planned the shooting directly with the Islamic State. The iPhone, a 5c version of the smartphone that was released in 2013, is locked by a passcode, which the F.B.I. wants Apple to circumvent.Apple would have to build a new version of its iOS smartphone software that allows the F.B.I. to bypass certain restrictions. Apple claims this software can give someone \u201cthe potential to unlock any iPhone in someone\u2019s physical possession.\u201d\nSo what does the court order require Apple to do?\nThe court is ordering the company to \u201cbypass or disable\u201d a feature that automatically wipes an iPhone clean of all its data after 10 incorrect password attempts have been entered. This is a standard feature on iPhones.\nTechnically, that would not require Apple to decrypt the passcode that blocks access by outsiders to the iPhone. It would allow the government to try an unlimited number of passwords without fear of the phone erasing all of its stored information.\nIn electronic security parlance, that is what is called a \u201cbrute force\u201d attack, and all it takes is time and patience to submit a large number of passcodes. Brute force attacks are usually carried out with the assistance of a powerful computer, which can automatically input millions of different password combinations until it guesses the correct one.\nCan Apple comply with the order if it wants to?\nApple\u2019s opposition is mostly ideological.\n\u201cThe same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, wrote in the letter.\nApple argues that the software the F.B.I. wants it to create does not exist. But technologists say the company can do it.\nWhy can\u2019t the F.B.I. build this software?\nThe iPhone is designed to run only iOS software created by Apple. For the phone to recognize that the software was made by Apple, the company must sign each piece with an encrypted key to verify it. Even if the F.B.I. tried to build a new version of iOS, it would not have Apple\u2019s crucial signature.\nThe agency argues that this is a one-time request and wants Apple to create software only to get into Mr. Farook\u2019s phone, not unlimited access to iPhones everywhere.\nAre there other ways for the F.B.I. to get this information?\nThere is a lot of data available that does not require Apple\u2019s assistance in unlocking the phone. The F.B.I. could ask Verizon, the cellular carrier by which Mr. Farook\u2019s phone was serviced, to give the agency more information on the phone.\nThe government could also request information from the application developers who created the apps for Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone.\nBut those are avenues the F.B.I. has probably already pursued, explaining why it wants Apple to unlock the device. Some data is not accessible without Apple\u2019s intervention.\nAre there other legal implications for the tech industry?\nWhat Apple is most worried about is the precedent that compliance can set for future requests from the government. There are few earlier rulings courts can use for guidance, and Apple does not want to pave the road for similar requests to itself and other tech companies.\nOther countries, like China, could also make similar demands.\n\u201cThe key question here is how far can the government go in forcing a third party to aid in surveillance?\u201d said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union.\nApple will most likely file an appeal with the court in the coming days."
