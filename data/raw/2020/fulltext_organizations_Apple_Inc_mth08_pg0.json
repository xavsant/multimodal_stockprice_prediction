        "title": "How Apple\u2019s 30% App Store Cut Became a Boon and a Headache",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Twelve years ago, Apple introduced the App Store,a peculiar online marketplacefor the year-old iPhone. It had 500 offerings. Apple told app makers it would take a 30 percent cut of their sales, and few complained.\nToday, the App Store is one of the world\u2019s largest centers of commerce, facilitating half a trillion dollars in sales last year alone. And Apple still takes 30 percent of many apps\u2019 sales.\nThat commission has proved hugely consequential for Apple. It has been the primary driver of growth in recent years for a company that has nearly $275 billion in annual sales. And it has created some of Apple\u2019s biggest headaches,drawing antitrust scrutiny,fury from app makersandlawsuits from consumers and partners.\nThe headaches intensified this week whenEpic Games, the maker of Fortnite, arguably the world\u2019s most popular video game, sued both Apple and Google, accusing the companies of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30 percent fees. The lawsuits followed Apple and Google\u2019s removal of Fortnite from their app stores because Epic encouraged users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google, to avoid their fees.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,\u201d said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. \u201cIt should be closer to that,\u201d he said.\nThat is the rising sentiment among app developers, consumers and regulators. Apple and Google, which together are worth more than $3 trillion, make the software that backs virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones. That dominance has allowed them to keep their commissions high.\nBut now that the tech giants\u2019 smartphones have become the only way other businesses reach millions of people, those businesses are increasingly pleading: Do you really need a third of my sales?\n\u201cThere are very few companies out there that have a 30 percent profit margin,\u201d said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an email service. \u201cThe only way we can support this fee is by passing that cost on to customers.\u201d ProtonMail charges 30 percent less for subscriptions purchased on its website, but when the company advertised that to its iPhone users, Apple restricted its app.\nLikewise, Spotify increased its monthly subscription to $13 from $10 in 2014 to account for Apple\u2019s fee. A year later, Apple introduced a competing music service \u2014 priced at $10. To compete, Spotify opted out of Apple\u2019s payment system, enabling it to avoid the commission. Now customers can still use Spotify\u2019s app, but they must subscribe on Spotify\u2019s website. Yet Apple bars Spotify from saying that in its iPhone app.\n\u201cEither we lose because we have to pay them a 30 percent tax just to operate and raise our prices for consumers as a result, or we lose because it becomes much more expensive to convert users from free to premium,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters in June after European regulatorsopened an antitrust investigationinto Apple based on Spotify\u2019s complaint.\nEven consumers have spoken up. An enormousclass-action lawsuitaccuses Apple of breaking antitrust laws to enforce its commission, inflating app prices for iPhone users. The Supreme Court ruled last year the lawsuit could proceed.\nOn Friday, Facebook chimed in, complaining that Apple is collecting 30 percent of sales on its new live-events service, where people can sell expert talks, fitness classes and cooking tutorials on Facebook\u2019s app. Facebook said it wanted to process the payments itself so it could pass on 100 percent of the sales to the small businesses selling the talks and classes, but Apple declined.\nApple argues that it has actually cut software developers a break. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,suggested to Congresslast month that when software was still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, 50 percent to 70 percent of the retail price went to middlemen.\n\u201cIn the more than a decade since the App Store debuted, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThe App Store evolves with the times, and every change we have made has been in the direction of providing a better experience for our users and a compelling business opportunity for developers.\u201d\nFor Google, the stakes are lower. It allows people to download apps from outside of its Android app store, meaning app makers like Epic have ample ways to still reach consumers using Android devices. And Google\u2019s vast online advertising business makes its app store a much smaller portion of its overall business.\nOver the past year, Apple has collected $19 billion of the $63.4 billion in sales of digital goods and services on iPhone and iPad apps, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Google collected $10 billion of the $33.8 billion in similar spending on its app store, Sensor Tower said.\nBefore Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony to Congress, at a House hearing focused on the power of Big Tech, Apple commissioneda studythat showed its cut was in line with what many other platforms charged for similar distribution, including the app stores from Google, Microsoft and Samsung, and the game stores from Nintendo, Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.\nAmazon\u2019s Twitch gaming platform collects 50 percent, according to the study. By comparison, Amazon, eBay and Walmart charge 6 percent to 17 percent for sales of goods on their websites, the study said.\nWhat the study didn\u2019t note: Apple popularized the 30 percent cut.\nIt applied that rate on any purchases of an app in 2008, and then a year later on any transactions inside of apps for digital goods and services, such as a virtual currency in a game or a subscription to a music, TV or dating app. Apple does not take a cut of apps\u2019 sales of advertising or physicals goods, and thus most apps don\u2019t pay a fee.\nSo how did Apple arrive at 30 percent?\nThere was some precedent; Apple had been charging roughly the same commission on music sales on its iTunes software. For each 99 cent song it sold, Apple passed on 72 cents to major music labels and 62 cents to independent labels,according to The Wall Street Journalin 2007.\nWhen Apple began setting rules for the App Store, \u201c30 percent was just kind of a no-brainer,\u201d said Mr. Shoemaker, who joined the company in early 2009. \u201cIt was, \u2018Of course that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use.\u2019 Nobody questioned it.\u201d\nIn 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store, the company\u2019s late co-founder Steve Jobstold The New York Times: \u201cWe are not trying to be business partners\u201d with app developers. Rather, he added, Apple wanted to \u201csell more iPhones.\u201d\nAt the time, there was far less pushback from app developers, in part because the App Store was so nascent and the digital transactions were complicated without Apple\u2019s help.\nWith Apple, \u201cit was pretty much one click and that was revolutionary,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker said. \u201cSo people were willing to bite that 30 percent. But now, those kinds of tools are a dime a dozen.\u201d\nIndeed, many companies now protestingApple\u2019s feeseem willing to pay something, just not 30 percent.\nEpic made $1.8 billion on Fortnite last year, in large part by selling digital currency that players need to buy new features inside the game. The game itself is free.\nOn Thursday, Epic started its confrontation with the tech giants by allowing Fortnite users to pay it directly in its iPhone and Android apps, rather than via Apple or Google\u2019s payment systems.\nEpic also offered a 20 percent discount on all purchases that used its payment system. That meant that if Apple and Google charged a 10 percent commission, their price would be about the same as the one Epic was offering its customers.\nEpic has also shown that running a profitable app store is possible with a lower commission. It runs its own online marketplace for other developers to distribute their games on desktop computers. In that store, it takes 12 percent of sales \u2014 and still makes a profit of 5 percent to 7 percent, the company said.\nYet at Apple, the discussion has long been about how to maximize profits. In 2011, Apple executives were discussing how much to charge content providers like Hulu and the NBA for new customers who signed up via Apple TV, according tointernal emailsprovided to House lawmakers investigating Apple.\nJai Chulani, one Apple executive, said in an email to colleagues that he worried that if Apple charged 30 percent of the first year of a subscription \u201cwe may be leaving money on the table.\u201d\nEddy Cue, one of Apple\u2019s most senior executives, responded with a better idea: \u201cFor recurring subscriptions, we should ask for 40%.\u201d"

        "title": "To Fight Apple and Google\u2019s Grip, Fortnite Creator Mounts a Crusade",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tim Sweeney, chief executive and founder of the video game makerEpic Games, has antagonized the world\u2019s most powerful technology giants since at least 2016.\nThat year, Mr. Sweeney, a self-described computer nerd with a slightly nervous energy,lashed outin an op-ed against Microsoft, saying it was attempting \u201csneaky maneuvers\u201d to dominate personal computer games. He also knocked Facebook\u2019s Oculus Rift app store as \u201cdisappointing\u201d for not being as \u201copen\u201d as it claimed.\nIn 2018, Mr. Sweeney went at it again. He launchedFortnite, Epic\u2019s popular video game, outside Google\u2019s Play Store to bypass its app store fees, which he called a \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate.\u201d And in January at an industry conference, he declared that \u201cundue power has accrued to many of the participants who are not at the core of the industry.\u201d\nHis mission to rein in the power of the tech companies has now reached a fever pitch. Mr. Sweeney is preparing for a protracted legal battle after Apple and Google banned Fortnite, which is played by more than 350 million people, from their stores this month for trying to get around its payment systems. In response,Epic sued both companies, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use those payment systems.\nMr. Sweeney\u2019s yearslong public crusade against the tech Goliaths suggests that the issue is not something he will easily drop. People close to him said the fight was not about money or ego. Instead, they said, it is firmly about principle.\n\u201cHe sees a vision of the world that is fair and open,\u201d said Bradley Twohig, a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which has invested in Epic.\nBruce Stein, chief executive of the esports start-up aXiomatic and an investor in Epic, said, \u201cHe was principled before he had the money to not be principled.\u201d\nHow deeply Mr. Sweeney feels about tech power will be key as the fight with Apple and Google escalates. On Monday, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court of Northern Californiatemporarily blocked Applefrom cutting off support for an Epic software development tool called Unreal Engine. Mr. Sweeney had said that if Unreal Engine were cut off, it would be an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to his company\u2019s $17 billion business. The judge, who did not require Apple to bring Fortnite back to the App Store, will rule again on the matter next month.\nIn an interview last month, Mr. Sweeney, 49, said the stakes of theantitrust investigations into tech giantslike Apple and Google were no smaller than the future of humanity. \u201cOtherwise you have these corporations who control all commerce and all speech,\u201d he said. He declined to be interviewed for this article, citing the active lawsuits, but has written on Twitter that he is \u201cfighting for open platforms and policy changes equally benefiting all developers.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to be swayed unless we get what we think is right,\u201d Adam Sussman, Epic\u2019s president, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe will always sacrifice short term for long term.\u201d\nOther developers have embraced Epic\u2019s cause. Spotify, the music streaming app, and Match Group, the maker of dating apps like Tinder, have released statements applauding Epic\u2019s moves. In a legal brief on Sunday, Epic also outlined Microsoft\u2019s support for it.\nBut to many others, Mr. Sweeney faces an uphill battle. In conversations with a dozen of Epic\u2019s investors and former executives, as well as with deal makers and analysts in the gaming industry, many said that while they supported Mr. Sweeney\u2019s stance, few expected him to prevail in all of his demands against Apple and Google.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a herculean uphill battle for them to beat Apple in court,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, because Epic violated the terms of the App Store.\nAsked for comment, Apple referred on Monday to its latest legal filing, in which it said Epic\u2019s \u201c\u2018emergency\u2019 is entirely of Epic\u2019s own making.\u201d Google said it would \u201cwelcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play.\u201d\nMr. Sweeney, who grew up in Potomac, Md., and whose father worked for the Defense Mapping Agency, got into technology as a child. At age 9, he learned to code on an Apple II computer. In 1991, as a college student, he started Potomac Computer Systems, selling games on floppy disks via mail from his parents\u2019 basement.\nHe eventually dropped out of the University of Maryland, where he had studied mechanical engineering. In 1992, he changed his company\u2019s name to Epic MegaGames, then later dropped \u201cMega\u201d and moved the start-up to North Carolina.\nEpic, now based in Cary, N.C., began licensing its tools for graphics and game development \u2014 such as Unreal Engine \u2014 to other companies. That became a steady source of income, smoothing out the hits-or-bust nature of the games business.\nIn Epic\u2019s early days, Mr. Sweeney was an awkward, quirky developer with a renegade streak who spent every waking hour writing code, investors and former colleagues said.\nBut he did get some use out of his Ferraris. \u201cHaving a fancy car is an excellent hobby when you\u2019re a workaholic,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said in an interviewposted to YouTube in 2008. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have any free time, you can still drive to work.\u201d\nBy then, Mr. Sweeney had shown his stubborn streak. When Silicon Knights, a game development company, sued Epic in 2007 over Unreal Engine\u2019s licensing, Epic spent five years and millions in legal costs to win the suit rather than settle.\nOver the years, Mr. Sweeney also worked diligently to keep control of Epic, which is privately held. In 2012, when Epic considered selling itself, it found two options: It could sell a majority stake in its operations to Warner Bros. for roughly $800 million, or sell a minority stake for the same valuation to Tencent, the Chinese internet company, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.\nEven though the Warner plan had more potential business advantages, Epic went with Tencent, which kept Mr. Sweeney in control.\nHis antagonism toward the big tech platforms began a few years later when Epic started building Fortnite, a battle royale-style fighting game that later expanded into a more creative mode where players could build their own games and challenges.\n\u201cWe wanted to build online games and have a direct relationship with our customers,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said in the July interview. He added that he had discovered that the fees from the app stores meant that Apple and Google could sometimes make more money on a game than its creators.\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally unjust,\u201d he said. \u201cThat shows the market is out of control.\u201d\nEpic began work on its own app store, which it introduced in 2018. Epic\u2019s store charges a 12 percent fee when a developer sells its wares through the store, compared with Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cuts. After Epic created its games store, a competitor, Steam, lowered its fees from 30 percent to 20 percent for the biggest sellers.\nIn 2017, Fortnite became a runaway hit. Investors swarmed, and Epic raised more than $3 billion in funding from backers including Sony, KKR, BlackRock and Fidelity. Even with all the new investors, Mr. Sweeney maintained majority control, allowing him to focus on the long term.\n\u201cWhen you invest in Epic, you are signing up for a different journey,\u201d Mr. Stein of aXiomatic said. \u201cOne that is focused on the gamer audience, not on quarterly results.\u201d\nMr. Sweeney\u2019s ambitions go beyond the gaming world. Fortnite is not just a place to fight virtual battles, the idea goes, but also a potential home for the \u201cmetaverse,\u201d a digital universe for all kinds of interactions and experiences. In April, nearly 28 million people attended a Travis Scott concert inside Fortnite.\nMr. Sweeney has backed down once from a fight with a tech giant. In April, two years after releasing Fortnite outside the Google Play Store, Epic agreed to offer the game through the store. It said it was doing so because users were encountering \u201cscary, repetitive security pop-ups\u201d to download and update the app outside the Play Store.\nEven so, Mr. Sweeney was not afraid to thumb his nose at the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This month, Epic started encouraging Fortnite\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. That violated Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s rules that they handle all such app payments so they can collect their 30 percent commission.\nIn response, Apple banned Fortnite from its store; Google later did the same. Epic was ready. It rallied its fans around the hashtag #FreeFortnite and published a video satirizing Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d ad, which had portrayed Apple as the underdog. The parody included a villain wearing the same sunglasses as Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\nOn Sunday, Epic hosted a #FreeFortnite gaming contest offering anti-Apple hats and digital avatars as prizes. And Mr. Sweeney? He also played along.\nJack Nicas contributed reporting."

        "title": "\u2018This Market Is Nuts\u2019: S&P 500 Hits Record, Defying Economic Devastation",
        "fulltext": "Widespread economic devastation, severeunemploymentand a grim prognosis for recovery have not stopped thestock market\u2019sexuberance. And on Tuesday, that undying optimism propelled the market to a new high, pushing it past a milestone reached only six months ago, when the coronavirus was just beginning its harrowing journey across the United States.\n\u201cThis market is nuts,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nTo those outside Wall Street, the market\u2019s rise may appear inexplicable given thehuman and economic toll of the virus, and a stalemate in Washington that has paralyzed efforts to provide more relief that many businesses and workers desperately need. Still, investors have cast the nearly relentless drumbeat of bad news aside to focus on any signs that the worst might be over. They have also been emboldened by theFederal Reserve\u2019s steadfast supportof the markets and unwavering embrace of low interest rates.\nInvestors are taking into account the fact that the virus, which had seen a recent surge that threatened to set back much of the country a second time,has shown signs of abating, with the number of new cases declining by 16 percent over the last 14 days, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Expectations for 2020 corporate profits, formulated by Wall Street analysts, seem to have stopped plummeting. Also, slow but notable progress toward a vaccine, which many manufacturers and public health experts say could be ready by next year, has made many investors bullish.\nAnd the economy is improving, even if the recovery is tepid. Some 1.8 million new jobs were added in July, and weekly state unemployment benefit claims havefallen below one millionfor the first time since March.\nTogether, these data points have been enough to create an outlook that, while not exactly rosy, is at least no longer pallid. At the same time, the improvements are hardly so significant that they would prompt the Federal Reserve to pull back its support for the economy. The Fed has started new programs to buy Treasury bonds and other financial assets to calm investors, and is financing those programs by essentially creating new money.\n\u201cIt seems to me that markets have decided this economic environment is the best of both worlds: enough economic recovery to support corporate earnings and prevent a substantial recession, but not so much that the Fed would have to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman, an investment bank.\nSeveral times in recent days, the S&P 500 had crisscrossed its Feb. 19 closing high of 3,386.15 in intraday trading, before falling below that level to end the trading day. But on Tuesday, the blue chip index notched a modest gain of 0.2 percent, to close at 3,389.78, after another solid performance by major technology companies.Amazon.comrose 4.1 percent, pulling the Nasdaq composite index to a fresh record as well. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2 percent.\nTuesday\u2019s rise was the latest chapter in a remarkable rebound for the stock market after a nearly 34 percent collapse in February and March. It was the fastest-ever nosedive of more than 30 percent from a peak, reflecting the depths of panic as investors began to consider the economic costs of the pandemic. Those fears were warranted. Since March, the economy has suffered the sharpest collapse since the Great Depression. Anestimated 28 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits. The economy has been almost decimated, as gross domestic productshrank nearly 10 percent during the second quarter of the year, wiping out nearly five years of economic growth.\nAfter that initial steep decline, however, the stock market began to recover and has done so steadily since, in a marked display of what analysts describe, by turns, as optimism, hubris or sheer speculative greed that is heavily reliant on federal spending, easy monetary policy and continued signs of progress in the hunt for virus vaccines. The result has been a remarkable rally of more than 50 percent that has underscored the dissonance that sometimes exists between the markets and the economy.\nDuring the deep recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008, financial markets recovered faster than employment, wages and business activity. The S&P 500 was hitting record highs by early 2013, a year before the U.S. job market replaced all the jobs lost in the downturn.\nIn part, that reflects the forward-looking nature of the stock market, where \u2014 in theory \u2014 investors buy stocks based on long-term expectations for profits and dividends they expect companies to generate, rather than how they\u2019re faring when the shares are purchased.\nThe American economy continues to struggle, but investors widely believe that the worst of the coronavirus-related downturn is over. Earlier this month, economists at Goldman Sachs upgraded their outlook for economic growth in 2021, writing that they \u201cnow expect that at least one vaccine will be approved by the end of 2020\u201d and be widely distributed in early 2021. Last week, stock market analysts at the firm raised their year-end estimates for the S&P 500, saying the broad index could rise to 3,600 or a further 6 percent or so.\nBut the divergence between the path of financial markets and the current health of the economy also highlights the fact that, despite looming large in the American psyche, the stock market is not a particularly good reflection of the broader U.S. economy or the mood of the American middle class.\nMany Americans own stock, but the vast majority of shares owned by households are controlled by the wealthiest people in the country, making them less likely to feel the pain of the economic slump.\nAnd only a tiny fraction of American businesses \u2014 less than 1 percent of those with 20 employees or more,according to one finance professor\u2014 are publicly traded. Those whose shares trade on the open market tend to be much larger and better financed than a typical firm.\nEven among publicly traded companies, almost all the gains in major stock market indexes this year are attributable to the surging share prices of a few giant technology companies, foremost among them Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\nThese megacompanies \u2014 Apple appears poised to become the first-ever company to reach a market value of $2 trillion \u2014 are exerting an enormous influence over major stock market indexes such as the S&P 500. Since such indexes are weighted by the market value of their constituents, the largest companies hold sway over their direction.\nTech giants have fared incredibly well through the crisis as investors bet the stay-at-home economy plays to many of their strengths. Amazon is up about 80 percent this year. Apple is up almost 60 percent, while Microsoft has risen more than 34 percent.\nWithout those three companies, the return on owning S&P 500 stocks \u2014 including dividend payments \u2014 would have been negative 4.1 percent this year through the end of July. Instead, investors captured an actual return of 2.4 percent, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nThe stock market is also incredibly sensitive to actions by the Federal Reserve, with stocks often soaring when the central bank eases monetary policy, typically in response to an economic slump. That means a weak economy can actually be quite good for Wall Street, if it means that the Fed keeps the river of freshly created money \u2014 what\u2019s known on Wall Street as liquidity \u2014 flowing into financial markets. That could help explainwhy empirical studies of the relationship between economic growth and stock market performanceoften show little connection between the two.\n\u201cNothing matters but liquidity,\u201d wrote Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Global Research, in a recent research note describing what he called the \u201cnihilistic\u201d bull market of 2020.\nThe performance of the market in the face of such dire expectations for growth, he wrote, is just the latest example of investors betting that low growth will prompt the Fed to continue pushing money into the financial system, ultimately bolstering stocks. In other words, stocks are going up not because of economic optimism, but because the future looks fairly grim. Mr. Hartnett titled his report, \u201cI\u2019m so bearish, I\u2019m bullish.\u201d"

        "title": "The Lesson We\u2019re Learning From TikTok? It\u2019s All About Our Data",
        "fulltext": "IsTikTok, the Chinese-ownedsocial network that is used mostly by teenagersto post dance videos, a national security threat?\nIt depends on whom you ask.\nPresident Trump has said it is and hasthreatened to ban the appin the United States. But security experts are morehesitant to draw conclusions. While there is no direct evidence thatTikTokhas done anything malicious with people\u2019s data, sharing information could be fundamentally less safe with a company that might allow the Chinese authorities to intercept it.\nSo I asked two companies that offer mobile security products to take a close look at TikTok\u2019s app to see what they could glean about it. They had very different takes.\nDisconnect, a San Francisco security firm, analyzed the code of the TikTok app for iOS. In July, the app\u2019s code contained references to servers in China. Last weekend, Disconnect reviewed the app\u2019s latest version and saw that the lines of code referring to Chinese servers had been removed.\nPatrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of Disconnect, said that while he did not witness any data transmission by the app to Chinese server computers, he found the existence and subsequent removal of the code suspicious.\nBut Sinan Eren, the chief executive of Fyde, a security firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said the references to servers in China did not alarm him. Plenty of apps have legitimate reasons for relying on some Chinese servers \u2014 for example, if they have users in Asian countries and want to stream video to them quickly in a cost-effective manner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic for anybody to say that they\u2019re not going to use any Chinese servers, ever,\u201d Mr. Eren said.\nTikTok said that the code discovered by Disconnect was obsolete and that it had updated its app as part of a continuing effort to eliminate unused features. \u201cWe have not shared data with the Chinese government, nor would we if asked,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday, after The New York Times called about the code, TikTok also published a blog post titled \u201cProviding peace of mind\u201d and said it was working on \u201cefforts around cleaning up inactive code in the app to reduce potential confusion or misconceptions.\u201d\nWhether or not TikTok\u2019s code was doing something nefarious, there is a broader lesson here. As increasingly digital creatures, we often don\u2019t think twice about giving the apps that we love permanent access to information about ourselves. So the debate about TikTok is a reminder that we must be on guard about the data we share with any apps \u2014 whether it\u2019s from an American or a Chinese company \u2014 and get in the habit of denying their requests to our personal data.\n\u201cWe should be minimizing the amount of data we share,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who collects it in the first place.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what you can do to set up your app defenses.\nWhen you open a newly installed app on your phone, notifications may pop up asking for permission for access to sensors and data such as your camera, photo album, location and address book.\nWhen that happens, ask yourself these questions:\nDoes this app need access to my data or sensor for it to work properly?\nDoes the app need access to this sensor or data all the time or just temporarily?\nDo I trust this company with my data?\nSometimes it makes sense to grant access. An app like Google Maps, for example, needs to know your location so it can figure out where you are and give directions.\nIn other instances, the need is less clear.\nGasBuddy, an app that helps you find nearby gas stations with the lowest prices, asks for permission to know your location. You could allow it to pull your device\u2019s precise location from its GPS sensor. But it would be safer just to enter your ZIP code so it has less precise information about your whereabouts. (A 2018Times investigation found that GasBuddywas one of dozens of apps that shared users\u2019 location data with third parties.)\nThen there is the question of whether an app needs permanent access to our data and sensors \u2014 meaning it always has permission to get information like our location and photos even when we are not using features related to that data.\nUsually the answer is no. As a brand-new TikTok user, for example, I had granted it permanent access to my phone\u2019s camera and microphone. But I have mostly used the app to scroll through people\u2019s cooking videos and have posted only two videos. And the app doesn\u2019t really need to know that much about me. So I eventually went into the settings to disable access to those sensors.\nEven if giving access makes life easier, it may be worth putting up with some hassle if you don\u2019t trust the company. Mr. Eren, who said he no longer trusted Facebook after a series ofdata scandals, uses the Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp. But to avoid sharing his address book with Facebook, he said, he manually added his contacts to WhatsApp.\nThat all sounds like a lot of work. But there\u2019s good news: Apple and Google are making it easier to reduce the amount of data we share with apps.\nIn Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system,iOS 14, which is due for release this fall, apps requesting your location will present you with the option to share just an approximate location. That could be useful if you\u2019re searching Yelp, for example, for restaurants in the neighborhood but don\u2019t wish to tell Yelp exactly where you are.\nGoogle said that in Android 11, its mobile operating system due for release this year, apps requesting location would present people with the choice to grant access just once, which would prevent constant location sharing with an app. (Apple has offered that option for about a year.)\nGoogle also said that if any apps were not used for a long period after being granted access to sensors and data, Android 11 wouldautomatically resetthem to require permission again.\nMany apps are constantly pulling information from our devices, such as the model of our phone and what version of mobile operating system it is using, and are sharing that data with third parties. Marketers who gain access to that information can then stitch together a profile about you and target you with ads across different apps \u2014 a practice known as app tracking.\nSo what to do? To limit this invisible data harvesting, I recommend using so-called tracker blockers.\nMr. Eren\u2019s app, Fyde, which is free for iOS and Android devices, automatically blocks such trackers, for example. Disconnect also offers tracker blocking apps, Privacy Pro and Disconnect Premium, for iPhone and Android devices.\nI prefer Fyde. In my tests constantly running the tracker blockers, it consumed less battery than Disconnect\u2019s apps did.\nApple said that in iOS 14, apps would be required to ask people for permission to perform tracking.\nThis last step is less technical: Stay informed. If you wonder how a company manages to offer its app, do some research on the business. Read its website and send the company questions to gain a basic understanding of what\u2019s happening with your data and what steps you should take to minimize sharing.\nIf it\u2019s a free app that relies on ads for revenue, you can usually assume that your data is part of the transaction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what they collect today \u2014 it\u2019s the drip over time,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cBefore you know it, these apps have this huge profile about you that they\u2019ve sold to so many people. Once the horse is out of the barn, it\u2019s going to be hard to rein it back in.\u201d"

The companies have said they may be forced to shut down ride-hailing operations in the state if the deadline isn\u2019t extended. (Want this delivered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.)\nApple became thefirst U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion valuationyesterday, two years after it was the first to cross the $1 trillion threshold. How high can it go?\nAnalysts can\u2019t keep up.The run-up in the iPhone maker\u2019s share price has outpaced the predictions of even preternaturally bullish sell-side analysts. The median price target for the company\u2019s stock is around $450, according to S&P Capital IQ, or 3 percent lower than its most recent close. Still, two-thirds of analysts have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Apple, though the highest price target is only about 10 percent higher than where it trades now. (Four brave souls have \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderperform\u201d ratings, with the lowest price target projecting a 60 percent decline.)\nIs the valuation justified?Although Apple\u2019s recent financial resultshave been robust, its valuation \u2014 as measured by its price-to-projected-earnings ratio \u2014 is its highest in more than a decade. Investors are paying more for each dollar that Apple expects to earn, believing either that the company could make even more money in the future or thatanysort of earnings growth in this market is worth a premium. The latter seems a popular belief, with tech giants benefiting from people\u2019s increasingly digital lives during pandemic lockdowns, while most other sectors are struggling through the worst recession in generations.\nApple\u2019s stock has made a lot of people rich.It\u2019s not exactly daring to invest in the biggest company in the market \u2014 though it is unusual for the largest companies to also generate the juiciest stock returns \u2014 but that bet has paid off handsomely of late.\n\u2022 Apple is by far the largest holding in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio: Berkshire Hathaway bought a $1 billion stake in early 2016 and now owns shares worth more than $110 billion, or more than 40 percent of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio.\n\u2022 Like Berkshire, nearly 2,000 other large institutional investors have Apple in their top 10 holdings,according to WhaleWisdom.\n\u2022 Tim Cook\u2019s relatively modest stake in the company he runsrecently made him a billionaire. And if Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s late founder, had kept the 11 percent of the company he held when it went public in 1980 \u2014 he dumped all but one share when hewas ousted in 1985\u2014 it would be worth nearly $220 billion today.\nSenator Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.The California senatormade history last nightas the first woman of color on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. Former President Barack Obamacriticized the Trump administration\u2019s recordwhile defending his own legacy. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose speech was seen as apotential auditionfor a role in a Biden administration,called for universal child care. Tonight, Joe Biden will close out the Democratic convention by accepting the party\u2019s presidential nomination, preceded by speeches from Senator Tammy Duckworth, Mike Bloomberg and others.\nMichigan will pay $600 million to victims of the Flint water crisis.The payment ismeant to settle claimsby tens of thousands of Flint residents that they were poisoned by lead-tainted tap water after officials changed the city\u2019s supply six years ago.\nQantas warned that international flights would be on hold for nearly a year.The Australian airline said thatit was \u201cunlikely\u201dto resume transoceanic flights before next July, despite the industry\u2019s efforts to convince travelers that flying is safe.\nA Florida appeals court rebuked police tactics in the Robert Kraft case.A three-judge panelaffirmed a lower court\u2019s rulingthat police improperly gathered the video evidence at the heart of prostitution-solicitation charges against Mr. Kraft, who owns the New England Patriots. Unless prosecutors appeal to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court, the decision essentially ends the case.\nPresident Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear tires.His demandcame after an employee posted a photo on social media purportedly detailing company policy against wearing some political attire at work. Goodyearrespondedthat the slide had not come from \u201cGoodyear corporate,\u201d but that it asks employees to refrain from political campaigning at the workplace.\nThe home rental company ended months of speculation by announcing that it had confidentiallyfiled to go public. It was valued at $31 billion before the pandemic, but its prospects are now much murkier.\nAirbnb is aiming for a traditional I.P.O., eschewing thedirect listingmodel that Silicon Valley elders like Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley have advocated. (It\u2019s been pitched amerger with a SPAC, too.) The timing of the I.P.O. isn\u2019t clear, though Reuterssaid the company was aimingto go public by the end of this year.\nWhy go public now?It seems odd at first, given that Airbnb\u2019s business is so dependent on travel. Since the pandemic, Airbnb has slashed costs, raisedemergency fundingand laid off a quarter of its staff. But consider:\n\u2022 The S&P is trading nearrecord highs, driven in large part by technology companies.\n\u2022 Airbnb\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky,told employees last monthits gross bookings have rebounded. (Business travel is an exception.) Expect that to be a big part of the I.P.O. pitch.\n\u2022 Twelve years after Airbnb\u2019s founding, some early investors areeager to cash out\u2014 preferably soon, given the uncertainty of the November elections and the pandemic.\nWhat happens next?Airbnb will have to reassure potential investors about its safety protections, community relations and accusations of discrimination. Would-be backers will also want to learn more about the company\u2019sembrace of stakeholder capitalism, which pledges to serve a larger community rather than just shareholders.\nFacebook said it hadremoved nearly 800 QAnon groups from its siteyesterday, and would restrict activity for another 1,950 groups, 440 pages and more than 10,000 Instagram accounts. The viral conspiracy theory\u2019s influence has recentlycrept into mainstream politics.\nFacebook\u2019s announcement comes after intense pressure from major advertisers.Companies from Clorox to Coca-Cola havepushed for more controlover the content their ads appear alongside. And as elections approach, disinformation spread on social media sites has been subject to increasing scrutiny. (The specific disinformation in this case? QAnon adherents rally behind false allegations that President Trump is battling a cabal of left-wing, Satan-worshiping pedophiles,among many other things.)\nIf the day started bad for QAnon, it ended on a higher note, when Mr. Trumpoffered some encouragementat a news conference called to discuss the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me.\u201d\nOne part of President Trump\u2019s push for TikTok to sell itself to an American company hascaused much head-scratching: his demand for a cut of any deal. The White House\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has attempted to explain.\nMr. Trump said the U.S. should receive a \u201cvery big proportion\u201d of any TikTok sale, likening it to a real-estate transaction in which a tenant pays \u201ckey money\u201d to a landlord in exchange for a lease. Legal experts have said there\u2019s no precedent for any such payment, and warned it could undermine the legal integrity of the M.&A. process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s been done in the past,\u201dMr. Kudlow acknowledged to CNBCyesterday. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done now.\u201d That marks a change from earlier this month, when Mr. Kudlow said of the idea, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a specific concept that will be followed through.\u201d\nSuch a fee would deny China \u2014 via ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based owner \u2014 some proceeds from a sale, though ByteDance\u2019s investors also include Sequoia, General Atlantic and SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund. Mr. Kudlow also said that a payment wouldn\u2019t be like an investment banking fee, because \u201cthe Department of Treasury isn\u2019t in the investment banking business.\u201d (That said, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is a former investment banker, andhas been involved in discussionswith the lead bidder, Microsoft.)\nBut there may not be any fees for anyone.Mr. Kudlow said that no definite offers from prospective bidders, including Microsoft, Oracle and others, had yet materialized. Under an executive order that Mr. Trump signed last week, TikTok has less than three months to find a buyer or face being banned in the U.S.\nChina\u2019s new law tightening its control over Hong Kong has had many consequences, includingblowback from the Trump administration. It has also had an unforeseen effect on American universities with Chinese students.\nThere\u2019s reason for concern.Last year, a University of Minnesota student who tweeted criticism of Chinese leaders while he was in the U.S. wassentenced to six months in prisonfor \u201cprovocation\u201d after returning home to China.\nColleges are now adopting measures to shield students from the law,The Wall Street Journal reports:\n\u2022 Princeton will assign students in a Chinese politics class codes to protect their identities.\n\u2022 Amherst may introduce anonymous chat rooms to allow for unfettered classroom discussions.\n\u2022 Harvard Business School may excuse some students from participating in discussions on politically touchy subjects if they fear reprisal from the Chinese authorities.\n\u2022 Several schools will put warning labels on classes that cover material China considers politically sensitive.\nThe fears are heightened by remote learning, with school administrators worried that virtual classes could be recorded and monitored by Beijing officials. \u201cThere is no way that I can say to my students, \u2018You can say whatever you want on the phone call and you are totally free and safe here,\u2019\u201d Meg Rithmire, a professor at Harvard Business School, told The Journal.\nDeals\n\u2022 Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Momenta, a drug maker that specializes in autoimmune disease treatments, for $6.5 billion.

        "title": "Facebook Gaming Finally Clears Apple Hurdle, Arriving in App Store",
        "fulltext": "For six months, Facebook tried to get Apple to approve its newFacebook Gaming appso it could be available inApple\u2019s App Store. Each time,Apple said no.\nThis week, Facebook said it had acceded to Apple\u2019s demands to change its Gaming app so that it could be distributed to iPhone and iPad users starting on Friday. To comply with Apple\u2019s rules, which prohibit apps if their\u201cmain purpose\u201dis distributing software such as games, the social network said it had entirely removed playable games from its new app.\nFacebook said Apple had essentially used its power over the App Store to force its hand, turning the Gaming app into an inferior experience for iPhone and iPad owners. In addition to playable games, the original version of the app allows users to watch and create live gameplay streams and participate in gaming communities \u2014 functions that will still operate in the Apple version.\nThe frustration with Apple extends to Facebook\u2019s highest echelons. In a statement, Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, said, \u201cUnfortunately, we had to remove gameplay functionality entirely in order to get Apple\u2019s approval on the stand-alone Facebook Gaming app.\u201d She added that Facebook would continue to build communities for those who played games on Facebook, \u201cwhether Apple allows it in a stand-alone app or not.\u201d\nGames are the largest source of revenue for Apple on the App Store, and many tech executives have concluded that Apple blocks game services that could compete with its own products and sales.\nApple, without directly addressing Facebook Gaming, said its App Store policies were designed to protect consumers. It added that it had allowed other apps that included games into the App Store.\nThe sparring is a reminder of wherethe power lies in Silicon Valley. While Facebook runs the world\u2019s largest social network and owns many popular apps such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, Apple controls their distribution through its App Store. That makes Facebook dependent on Apple to reach many of its users.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has expressed consternation about the power that Apple holds, albeit obliquely. In testimony toCongresslast week about Facebook\u2019s rivals, he said, \u201cSome are upstarts, but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their app stores to compete with them.\u201d\nIn June, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it had opened a formalantitrust investigation into Apple\u2019s App Storeterms, spurred by a complaint from Spotify, the music-streaming service. Other app developers, such as Basecamp, have alsoscuffled with Appleover its App Store rules.\nSome companies with gaming apps are shying away from Apple\u2019s App Store, privately saying Apple will simply not approve their apps because they compete. On Wednesday, for example, Microsoft ended a limited test of its xCloud game streaming app for Apple devices, though it will offer cloud gaming on Android devices starting next month.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store,\u201d a Microsoft spokesman said on Thursday. \u201cApple stands alone as the only general-purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to nongaming apps even when they include interactive content.\u201d\nFacebook announced its Gaming app in April, saying people could use it to watch livestreams of games and play simple games like Words With Friends and Thug Life. Google\u2019s Play store for Android devices approved it that month.\nBut Apple rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming this year. In its denials, Apple cited rules that forbid apps with the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of distributing games and apps that offer simple games in a \u201cstore or storelike interface.\u201d\nFacebook kept trying. It said it had told Apple that more than 95 percent of activity on the Android version was watching streams of game playing, rather than playing games directly.\nTo please Apple, Facebook made games less prominent by first removing icons from a list of playable games and then removing the game catalog entirely. In the last rejected version, which Facebook submitted in May, the only way for users to find playable games was scattered in their news and activity feed.\nIn June, Apple announced a new appeals process for App Store submissions, including the ability to challenge its guidelines. A Facebook spokesman said the social network had requested such an appeal for Facebook Gaming but never received a response.\n\u201cApple ghosted us,\u201d he said. Apple approved Facebook Gaming only after Facebook submitted a version with games completely removed, the spokesman said.\nOn Friday, when Facebook releases the app for iPhone and iPad users, it also intends to distribute a cheeky image of the \u201cPlay\u201d aspect of the app crossed out in red, with an asterisk reading, \u201cEdited on iPhone.\u201d\nApple\u2019s moves have created \u201cshared pain across the games industry, which ultimately hurts players and developers and severely hamstrings innovation on mobile for other types of formats like cloud gaming,\u201d said Vivek Sharma, Facebook\u2019s vice president for gaming."

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Domination of Business Reaches New Heights",
        "fulltext": "American tech titans flew high before the coronavirus pandemic, making billions of dollars a year.\nNow, the upheaval has lifted them to new heights, putting the industry in a position to dominate American business in a way unseen since the days of railroads.\nA rally in technology stocks elevated the S&P 500 stock index to a record high on Tuesday even as the pandemic crushes the broader economy. The stocks of Apple,Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, the five largest publicly traded companies in America, rose 37 percent in the first seven months this year, while all the other stocks in the S&P 500 fell a combined 6 percent, according to Credit Suisse.\nThose five companies now constitute 20 percent of the stock market\u2019s total worth, a level not seen from a single industry in at least 70 years. Apple\u2019s stock market value, the highest of the bunch,reached $2 trillion on Wednesday\u2014 double what it was just 21 weeks ago.\nThe tech companies\u2019 dominance of the stock market is propelled by their unprecedented reach into our lives, shaping how we work, communicate, shop and relax. That has only deepened during the pandemic, and as people shop more frequently on Amazon, click on a Google or Facebook ad or pay up for an iPhone, the companies receive a greater share of spending in the economy and earn ever larger profits. This is why investors have flocked to those stocks this year at the expense of the scores of companies struggling in the health crisis, and are betting that their position will be unassailable for years.\n\u201cCovid was the perfect positive storm for these guys,\u201d said Thomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University.\nThe companies\u2019 deeper encroachment into American lives can be seen in web traffic numbers for Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, which own the four most visited sites in the country. The traffic on these sites was immense before the pandemic, but daily visits increased sharply in March, when stay-at-home orders began, with Facebook up 15 percent and YouTube 10 percent, according to SimilarWeb, an online data provider.\nThe web traffic has held steady at the higher plateau, with more than one billion daily visits to the big four sites in the United States alone. And the same pattern is evident worldwide. Facebook reported that the number of daily users of its services globally in June was 12 percent higher than a year earlier.\nAmazon\u2019s business, already towering over competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing, has become even more important to businesses and households. Its stock is up over 50 percent from its pre-pandemic high, underscoring just how much investors think it has benefited from the disruption.\nCritics say the companies have grown in part because of a range of anticompetitive practices. European regulatorsare investigatingwhether Apple\u2019s App Store breaks competition rules. American regulators arelooking atwhether large tech firms committed antitrust abuses when acquiring other companies. Some antitrust scholars believe the rise of industry-dominating companies has led to stagnant wages and increased inequality. Last month, tech chief executiveswere grilledby members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.\n\u201cAny single action by one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, in his opening statement at the hearing. \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d\nAccording to some competition experts, the concentration in some industries is greater today than in the late 1800s, when Congress passed sweeping antitrust legislation to curb the power of the railroads.\nJan Eeckhout, an economics professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, said that in 1929, Sears and A&P accounted for 3 percent of retail sales, a situation that stirred up concern in Congress and helped give rise to additional antitrust laws in 1936.\nToday, he said, Walmart and Amazon jointly account for 15 percent of retail sales.\nIn arecent study, researchers at the RAND Corporation used public filings, other data and statistical inference techniques to model the connections among top companies. Its leading example was Amazon, with its e-commerce marketplace used by thousands of retailers and its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, powering so many online businesses.\nOn a typical work-from-home day, a person might communicate with colleagues using Slack, attend videoconferences on Zoom, order takeout food via DoorDash and in the evening watch a movie on Netflix, said Jonathan Welburn, a lead author on the RAND study. All of them run their businesses on Amazon Web Services.\n\u201cAmazon is a very central digital hub, and it epitomizes the direction our economy has taken,\u201d Mr. Welburn said.\nThe growing importance of cloud computing, the digital engine rooms of the modern economy, shows how tech firms are building on their dominance. Global spending on cloud computing rose 33 percent to more than $30 billion in the second quarter, according to Synergy Research.\nTo be a full-service cloud provider like Amazon, Microsoft and Google is an immensely expensive endeavor. Each spends an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion a year on its data centers and cloud networks, said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy. That is just the capital-spending table stakes to compete. Only a handful of companies in the world can afford them.\nThe companies say their huge spending helps the U.S. economy and ends up lowering prices.\n\u201cOur engineers are helping America remain a global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and quantum computing,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in his prepared testimony at the recent House hearing. \u201cCompetition drives us to innovate, and it also leads to better products, lower prices and more choices for everyone.\u201d\nIn his testimony, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, asserted that Apple did not have a dominant share of any market in which it did business.\nAnd during an earnings call in July, Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said his company could not indefinitely thrive while the rest of the economy and other industries struggled. \u201cThe world needs to do well for us to do well in the long run,\u201d he said.\nIt is still possible for new companies to make inroads. Users of Zoom, the videoconferencing company,have balloonedduring the pandemic, and its stock is up over 150 percent since the end of February. And TikTok shows that it is still possible to build a highly popular social media app, though Microsoftmay soon acquire it.\nOf course, the searing rally in the stocks could be the result of excessive optimism and the stocks could fall. But if the Big Five keep reporting huge profits, they should still make up an outsize share of the overall market. In the 12 months through the end of June, they earned nearly $500 million a day in net income combined.\n\u201cThe stock market has the great advantage that it\u2019s looking at the stream of future profits,\u201d Mr. Philippon said. \u201cThey think they are high today \u2014 and going to remain very high in the future.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "For years, companies have complained that they pay good money for online ads, only to see them end up near a racist post or an article promoting a conspiracy theory.\nNow major advertisers like Clorox andCoca-Cola, along with a number of large advertising agencies, are pushing the big tech companies to give them more control over where and how their ads show up.\nThe effort follows theadvertiser boycott of Facebooklast month, when more than 1,000 companies stopped buying ads on the platform to protest its handling of hate speech and misinformation.\nBen Hovaness, an executive at Omnicom Media Group, a company that manages $38 billion in global marketing spending, said it was time for the tech giants to go by the rules that applied before digital platforms were dominant.\n\u201cAdvertisers buying TV ads, print ads, radio ads have for many decades had control over which programs or which pieces their ads appear next to or within,\u201d Mr. Hovaness said. \u201cNow that social advertising is a major portion of a lot of our clients\u2019 budgets, having control over adjacency is just something that we see as essential as the ecosystem matures.\u201d\nOmnicom Media Group, known as OMG, has demanded that Facebook, Twitter and other tech companies do more than make promises that ads will be kept away from inappropriate content. It wants the big digital platforms to put systems in place to make sure that online ads will appear where companies are comfortable, and it wants proof that the systems work.\nMr. Hovaness also said that the reports on ad placement and ad performance provided by the tech companies were insufficient and should be supplemented by independent quarterly audits.\nGreater control of ad placement and the independent measurement of ad performance were included in a list of proposals submitted recently to tech companies by the Council on Accountable Social Advertising, a lobbying group formed by OMG, along with dozens of clients, including Clorox.\nFacebook, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube have agreed to most of the proposals in principle, and OMG is monitoring the platforms to see if they update their practices.\nThe OMG campaign comes during a summer when tech companies have fallen under new scrutiny. Ina congressional hearinglast month, lawmakers interrogated the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Criticism has mounted over the proliferation ofmisinformationrelated to thecoronavirus pandemicand thecoming electionon various digital platforms.\nThe ad industry is adding its grievances to the mix. In addition to the OMG-led effort, a newly formed coalition of trade groups, ad firms and companies, thePartnership for Responsible Addressable Media, is pushing back against planned changes fromAppleandGooglethat are expected to disrupt how companies reach potential customers.IPG Mediabrands, an ad group, released an audit of nine tech companies last week.\nBut some industry watchdogs are skeptical of the efforts, especially at a time when companies spend more than half of their marketing budgets on digital platforms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for optics, so they can appear to be doing something,\u201d Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher, said. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really going to have a long-term effect is when consumers or marketers revolt and actively stop using the platforms.\u201d\nTech executives have defended their dealings with advertisers and pledged to do better.\n\u201cWe fundamentally believe that our advertisers should have control over what content a user sees before and after their ad,\u201d said Andrew Abbott, who is Reddit\u2019s liaison to OMG.\nFacebook cited its work with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an advertising trade group created last year to address toxic online content, and said that it had spent billions of dollars to keep hatred off its platform.\nTara Walpert Levy, the vice president of agency and brand solutions for Google and YouTube, said: \u201cIt is terrific to see Omnicom and others leaning in even further.\u201d\nDoes that mean there will be peace between the advertisers and the tech companies? Mr. Hovaness, the OMG executive, sounded optimistic. Sort of.\n\u201cNow the really fun part starts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe platforms are saying, philosophically, we agree with your construct of advertiser rights and remedies, and we think your clients are entitled to these features.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe see this as a monthslong effort. Getting these partners to agree in principle is a key but early step. The odds of these platforms\u2019 first pass at solutions being perfect is pretty low. And that\u2019s fine.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Reaches $2 Trillion, Punctuating Big Tech\u2019s Grip",
        "fulltext": "It took Apple 42 years toreach $1 trillionin value. It took it just two more years to get to $2 trillion.\nEven more stunning: All of Apple\u2019s second $1 trillion came in the past 21 weeks, whilethe global economyshrank faster than ever beforein the coronavirus pandemic.\nOn Wednesday, Apple became the first U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion valuation when its shares climbed 1.4 percent to $468.65 in midday trading, though they later declined and ended the day flat. It was another milestone for the maker of iPhones, Mac computers and Apple Watches, cementing its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company and punctuating howthe pandemic has been a bonanza for the tech giants.\nAs recently as mid-March, Apple\u2019s value was under $1 trillion after the stock market plunged over fears of the coronavirus. On March 23, the stock market\u2019s nadir this year, the Federal Reserve announcedaggressive new measuresto calm investors. Since then, the stock market \u2014 and particularly the stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 has largely soared, with theS&P 500 hitting a new highon Tuesday.\nInvestors have poured billions of dollars into the tech behemoths, betting that theirimmense size and powerwould serve as refuges from the pandemic-inducedrecession. Together, those five companies\u2019 value has swelled by almost $3 trillion since March 23, nearly the same growth as the S&P 500\u2019s next 50 most valuable companies combined, including Berkshire Hathaway, Walmart and Disney, according to S&P Global, the market analytics firm. Apple\u2019s valuation alone rose by about $6.8 billion a day, more than the value of American Airlines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become the new flight to safety,\u201d Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor who studies the stock market, said of investors flocking to Big Tech. Companies that are rich, flexible and digital are benefiting in the pandemic \u2014 and that describes the tech Goliaths, he said, adding, \u201cThis crisis has strengthened what was already a strong hand.\u201d\nApple\u2019s rapid rise to $2 trillion is particularly astonishing because the company has not done much new in the past two years. It has simply built one of the tech industry\u2019s most effective moneymakers, which has such a firm grip over how people communicate, entertain themselves and shop that it no longer relies on groundbreaking inventions to keep the business humming.\nApple first reached$1 trillionin August 2018, after decades of innovation. The company, founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, churned out world-changing products like the Macintosh computer, the iPod, the App Store and the iPhone.\nSince then, it has mostly tweaked past creations, selling gadgets with names like the Apple Watch Series 5, the AirPods Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It has also pushed into services such as streaming music, streaming movies and TV programs, andproviding news, selling subscriptions for them.\nUnder its chief executive, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s most important innovation in recent years has arguably been its nearly unrivaled ability to generate profits. Mr. Cook has built a sophisticated global supply chain to produce billions of devices \u2014 most assembled in China \u2014 and leaned into a product line designed to lock customers into its ecosystem so they buy new gadgets every few years and pay monthly fees to use Apple\u2019s suite of digital services.\nApple has also grown despite its size by extracting more money from the companies that run businesses on iPhone apps,drawing accusationsthatits 30 percent cutof some app revenues is unfair.\nThe Silicon Valley company\u2019s business has been onlyfurther entrenched by the pandemic, which has forced people to work, learn and socialize virtually. From April through June, even as Appleshuttered many of its retail storesbecause of the virus, it posted $11.25 billion in profits, up 12 percent from a year earlier. It increased its sales of every product and in every part of the world.\n\u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives and, in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview last month.\nStill, Mr. Maestri disputed that the pandemic had been good for business. Apple would have made billions of dollars more without it, he said.\nIn the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn\u2019t just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared toward creating opportunities for others.\u201d\nApple declined further comment.\nAmazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, have also continuedraking in billions of dollarsamid the pandemic. Their outsize influence has attracted intense scrutiny over the past year, includinga bipartisan grillingof four of the companies\u2019 chief executives in Congress last month.\nRepresentative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House subcommittee that is investigating how the tech giants are brandishing their power, warned at the hearing that the companies had grown too powerful.\n\u201cTheir ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors and inspire fear represent the powers of a private government,\u201d he said. \u201cAs hard as it is to believe, it is possible that our economy will emerge from this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated than before.\u201d\nLast week, Apple\u2019s power over its App Store was in the spotlight when itbooted the popular game Fortnitefrom its store. Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, then sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.\nApple has also wielded another powerful tool to boost its valuation and enrich its investors and executives:stock buybacks. Since the company\u2019s value hit $1 trillion, it has returned $175.6 billion to shareholders, including $141 billion in stock buybacks. Apple has repurchased more than $360 billion of its own shares since 2012, by far the most of any company, and has announced plans to spend at least tens of billions of dollars more on Apple stock.\nApple has increased its buybacks since it used the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax law tobring back most of the $252 billionit had once held abroad. (The law saved it $43 billion in taxes on the move, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.) Apple has $194 billion in cash and bonds.\nBuying back stock generally increases a company\u2019s share price, in part because it reduces the number of shares for sale. Critics haveargued that it also increases inequalitybecause it mostly enriches wealthy investors and the company\u2019s executives, who are often large shareholders, as is the case with Apple. Executives and some economists saidreturning excess cash to shareholderswas better than sitting on it.\nApple is the second publicly traded company to hit $2 trillion. Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company, went public in December and briefly exceeded the mark. It remained the world\u2019s most valuable company until Apple surpassed it last month.\nOthers are vying to reach $2 trillion soon. The candidates likely to hit that milestone next?Microsoft,AmazonandAlphabet."

        "title": "An Epic Battle",
        "fulltext": "Want this delivered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.\nApple and Google havekicked Fortnite out of their app stores, making the wildly popular and hugely lucrative video game unavailable to many iPhone and Android device users. It follows moves by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, encouraging the game\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly rather than going through the online stores, which take a cut of sales.\nThe tech giants insist on handling app paymentsand take a 30 percent commission on transactions via their stores. This gatekeeper policy is at the center of antitrust complaints against Apple and Google in the U.S. and Europe. After the Fortnite ban, Epic sued Apple and Google in federal court, with its C.E.O., Tim Sweeney, promising \u201ca hell of a fight.\u201d\n\u2022 Epic\u2019s argument: Apple and Google collectively dominate mobile platforms and cannot be trusted to charge \u201cfair\u201d prices.\n\u2022 Apple and Google\u2019s argument: They built and maintain their platforms and should be allowed to charge whatever they want. In other words, they aren\u2019t public utilities.\nIt\u2019s a gutsy gambit by Epic, and probably a losing one, at least in the short term. Neither Apple nor Google is likely to capitulate: If they did, they\u2019d have to offer the same terms to everyone on their platforms. (\u201cThese guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users,\u201d Apple said in a statement.) However, a protracted legal battle could put more pressure on the tech giants in Washington, Brussels and other places that are looking closely at their market power. If Epic rallies app developers to get behind its cause,that could be a problem for the platforms, too.\n\u2022 Since March 2018, Fortnite has been downloaded more than 130 million times on iPhones and iPads, generating about $360 million in revenue for Apple, according to Sensor Tower. It\u2019s easier to download apps on Android devices outside Google\u2019s store, so it has made less in commissions from sales of Fortnite, which has appeared in its online store only since April. Fortnite can also be played on other devices, computers and consoles, giving it leeway to lose iPhone and Android users without going completely dark.\nThis is not a genuine negotiation.For Epic Games, it is as much a public relations event as anything else. Within minutes of Fortnite\u2019s being banned by Apple \u2014 something that Epic clearly anticipated \u2014 it released aslickly produced video parodyof Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d ad. Mr. Sweeney, the game maker\u2019s chief, framed the dispute as no less than \u201ccritical to the future of humanity,\u201d citing the risk of submission to \u201ccorporations who control all commerce and all speech.\u201d\n\u2022 Spotify, which has waged a similar battle with Apple,issued a statementin support of Epic and against what it called Apple\u2019s \u201cunfair practices.\u201d\n\u2022 It\u2019s worth noting that Epic brought out its own app store in 2018. It charges developers a 12 percent commission, which it says is still comfortably profitable.\nWhich is worse for Apple: No Fortnite or no WeChat?Losing the mostly young fans of Fortnite is bad, but the Trump administration\u2019s threat to ban U.S. companies from doing business with China\u2019s WeChat could affectvast numbers of iPhone users. Whatever the case, the longer these disputes endure, the bigger the risk that people who feel they can\u2019t live without a certain game or messaging app will think twice about buying Apple devices.\nThe Trump administration said that Yale discriminated against Asian-American and white applicants.After a two-year investigation, the Justice Department accused the Ivy League university ofviolating federal civil rights law, bolstering challenges to affirmative action policies that are expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court. Last year, the administrationbacked Asian-American studentswho accused Harvard of systematic discrimination.\nRefinancing mortgages is about to get more expensive.Interest rates remain at record lows, but two of America\u2019s largest mortgage finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,announced a 0.5 percent fee, citing a need to cover anticipated losses related to the pandemic. The charges will add an additional $1,400 to refinance a mortgage for the average homeowner.\nReal estate investors are taking owners to court.Mezzanine lenders like hedge funds and private equity firmsare suing commercial property landlords and developersto foreclose on assets and recoup losses on delinquent debts. One of the battles features a retail complex in Times Square that\u2019s owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law.\nThe Labor Department chief was accused of interfering in a pay discrimination case.A senior lawyer said the head of the agency, Eugene Scalia, had sought a low settlement with Oracle, the tech giant, ina long-running dispute over pay discriminationthat originated in the Obama administration.\nDaimler settled emissions-cheating charges by paying a $2.2 billion fine.The moneycovers federal fines and a class-actionsuit by Mercedes owners, at a fraction of the $20 billion that fellow German automaker Volkswagen paid to settle similar charges.\nThe good news: New claims for U.S. state unemployment benefits fell below one million last week for the first time since March.\nThe bad news: Claims remain high by historical standards, and other signs suggest that the economy is losing momentum. Also, new aid for jobless workers looks likely to be smaller than initially suggested, and it\u2019s not clear when it will start, how long it will last or how many workers it will cover.\nSome of the academic research that caught our eye this week, summarized in one sentence:\n\u2022 The rise in companies\u2019 market power explains a lot of \u201cundesirable\u201d trends.

(Sandra Black, Jeffrey Denning, Lisa Dettling, Sarena Goodman and Lesley Turner)\nJim Tankersley covers economic and tax policy for The Times in Washington. His new book, \u201cThe Riches of This Land: The Untold, True Story of America\u2019s Middle Class,\u201d is out this week. In it, hechallengesthe \u201cwhitewashed, \u2018Leave It to Beaver\u2019 tale that so many people have been led to believe\u201d about the post-World War II economic boom \u2014 and subsequent bust for many who once considered themselves middle class.\nJim spoke with DealBook about what went wrong, and how to fix it.\nWhat\u2019s in the book for DealBook readers?\nI hope that it\u2019s both enlightening and challenging. And, perhaps, hopeful.\nThe basic idea is that reducing discrimination in the American economy is what really got us the prolonged middle-class boom of the postwar era. The research says that 40 percent of post-1960 growth in this country came from breaking down occupational barriers for women of all races and for Black men.\nIf we could break down the barriers for women and Americans of color to advance, get good jobs and be paid what they\u2019re worth, we can unleash another productivity boom, which I know is something that Wall Street loves to contemplate.\nHow do you define \u201cmiddle class\u201d?\nEssentially, it\u2019s about economic stability. The middle class, to me, means that you have a high enough income and enough wealth that you can afford a house and a car and education for your kids and retirement and health care. You can give your kids the chance to build an even better life than you built for yours.\nWe\u2019ve seen millions of Americans either fall short of those dreams or be knocked out of the middle class over the past few decades, for lots of reasons.\nWhat\u2019s one of the main things that went wrong?\nWe got impatient. There is this idea that the work was finished on civil rights. White men have run this country for most of its history, and the white men who ran the country in the 1980s, in particular, did a lot of things to roll back civil rights. They fought affirmative action in court, and the Reagan administration waged a war on drugs that led to the mass incarceration of Black men. Those things impeded progress.\nHas the pandemic changed your thinking on this? Or the protests against racial inequality?\nI had a finished draft of the book around New Year\u2019s. In March, we decided to rip it up and add 10,000 words on the pandemic. If anything, the events of the past few months have strengthened what I had in there. This crisis is uniquely aimed at exactly the sort of workers who have been left behind by the economy.\nOn the racial injustice protests, I have a contrarian take: I think the protests, more than any other development in the last couple of months, have given me economic hope for America. The protests have forced an increasingly large share of white Americans to acknowledge the degree to which systemic racism still exists. Recognition of a problem is always the first step toward policy. That gives me some hope that we can have another middle-class resurgence in our country.\nDeals\n\u2022 SoftBank will lend $1.1 billion to WeWork to help it cover costs related to the pandemic.
