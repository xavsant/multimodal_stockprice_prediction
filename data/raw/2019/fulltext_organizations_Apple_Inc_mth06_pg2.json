        "title": "The People Screaming for Blood Have No Idea How Tech Actually Works",
        "fulltext": "The techlash has officially arrived.\nThe unbridled power of big tech is nowin the cross hairs of Washington. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are divvying up behemoths like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to begin investigations into all manner of behaviors, even aspoliticians are tripping over themselvesto render judgments about breakups and antitrust and new regulations.\nThe cavalry has finally arrived. Shouldn\u2019t I be thrilled?\nAfter all, I\u2019ve been banging on for the past two years about the tech potentates\u2019 immense clout, sometimes sloppy management style and stubborn refusal to take responsibility for the consequences of the tools they create.\nBut I am not thrilled and here\u2019s why: The very same agencies and legislators now screaming for blood have for decades ignored any sensible regulation of Silicon Valley, afraid of killing the golden geeks. Just a year ago most could not have cared less about the ballooning power of tech over so many aspects of American life. More to the point, they have stayed stubbornly ignorant of how all this tech stuff actually works.\nNow, though, they are coming in with guns blazing in a way that looks thoughtless and is likely to prove pointless. They remind me of a legal-pad-carrying Avengers team that\u2019s going to take a lot of what\u2019s good about tech down with what\u2019s bad. The obviously planted leaks about the unclear parameters of the Justice Department investigations could be the harbinger of a disorganized and possibly draconian crusadethat could reduce this industry, one of our national treasures, to a pile of rubble.\nLook, I strongly support the need to regulate tech and put up solid guardrails, especially since the sector has had pretty much no oversight ever. So far, there has been only self-interested self-regulation that looks like a mishmash of reactive and haphazard decisions by executives who seem to remain ignorant of human nature. These are people who still don\u2019t get the fact that neo-Nazis are not just nice guys who want to use their platforms to chat about the best tiki torches and how to get your whites whiter.\nBut I digress. If regulators had applied some pointed pressure only a decade ago, when all the same warning signs were there, we could have prevented the mess we find ourselves in now, with rampant disinformation, egregious privacy breaches and in-plain-sight addictive elements built right into the medium.\nConsider, for example, Google\u2019s 2008 attempt to take over Yahoo\u2019s search in a deal that was clearly overreach. I was flabbergasted at the time that the government seemed to be hesitating to stop Google from amassing what amounted to an 80 percent share of the market.\nAs I wrote then: Google \u201ccannot be allowed to have a monopolistic share of the market. It is bad for advertisers, it is bad for consumers, it is bad for innovation.\u201d\nIn that case, federal regulators eventually blocked the move, but its timidity was to become a trend. There were many other acquisitions that could have used another look-see. Did they truly believe the F.T.C. consent decree in 2011 was enough to bring Facebook to heel? Was Uber\u2019s follow-no-rules approach not enough of a clue that the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mentality that pervaded tech was a problem?\nIt was the same playbook over and over, as those in charge of watching out for the rest of us allowed the creation of companies too bignotto fail that have stifled competition and hurt consumers.\nSo naturally, now comes the payback. But it feels too late, and in many ways it goes too far. The threat to break up the biggest companies is little more than rhetorical tech slamming that will not accomplish anything beyond makingSenator Elizabeth Warren sound tough(she is tough, but not on this). Breaking up companies takes forever and is a drastic way to do what could have been done via actual laws now in place or intelligent changes in antitrust laws.\nAt the same time, in other ways the regulators are being too feeble. Sure, the endless grabbing of data by tech companies is offensive. But our government not even trying to pass a national privacy bill to protect users is more so.\nInstead of just reacting, we need our government to be creatively proactive. Regulators should be thinking about how to use federal incentives to spur small business creation to bring meaningful jobs and new innovations to this country; how to persuade investors to spread more venture capital beyond the three states (California, Massachusetts and New York) that get most of it; how to push for a more diverse work force and fund ambitious education programs, which other countries do without pause; how to anticipate the human impact of the next group of technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics; how to create the most forward-thinking infrastructure plan to modernize our cities; and how to encourage tech to focus on innovations to combat existential issues like climate change, and food and water shortages.\nBut hey, at least they are all over the regulation of electric scooters. Meanwhile, techies aremoving on to pogo sticks.\nSpeaking of bouncing and crashing, the stocks of all of these companiesswooned on Monday,with investors fearful that far-ranging scrutiny would pull the emergency brake on the digital gravy train.\nCall it the techlash whiplash.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "The Week in Business: A Surprise Tariff War, and the Future of iPhone Screens",
        "fulltext": "Want this column in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHappyJune! And sorry about your stock portfolio, which probably isn\u2019t looking too hot after President Trump\u2019s latest tariff threats. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the week\u2019s business news.\nMAY 26-june 1\nUber has taken some knocks lately. Less than a month after the ride-hailing company\u2019s lukewarm initial public offering, its shares have fallen more than10 percent. And according to itsfirst-quarter earnings report, released on Thursday, Uber is seeing its slowest growth in years and lost more than $1 billion so far in 2019. But it still won\u2019t tolerate rudeness. Uber also announced that riders with \u201csignificantly below average\u201d ratings(yes, the rating system goes both ways) will get thrown off the app. (The announcement came after a Lyft passenger was caught on camera attacking a driver for not going faster.) It\u2019s unclear how bad a rating would merit expulsion, but Uber says riders will get a couple of warnings before they\u2019re officially banned.\nIt\u2019s a rough world out there for car manufacturers, what with all these tariffs and ride-sharing apps flying around, so why not band together? At least that\u2019s what Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chairman might have been thinking when he officially invited Renault to merge with his company last Monday after several weeks of private talks. The trans-Atlantic coupling would create the world\u2019sthird-largest automaker, second only to Toyota and Volkswagen. The elephant in the room? That would be Nissan, Renault\u2019s formal partner. The companies\u2019relationship has frayedsince Nissan\u2019s chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested last year. If they can all mend fences, the resulting juggernaut would be the world\u2019s largest car manufacturer by a wide margin, and force other players in the industry torethink their business strategies.\nAs of this week, one less group may have cause to complain about their terrible parental leave policy. JPMorgan Chasereached a tentative settlementwith a father who sued the bank for denying him the 16 weeks of paid leave that it offers to new mothers. The bank also agreed to create a $5 million fund to compensate up to about 5,000 dads who were shortchanged in the past. The case sets an important legal precedent for corporate parental-leave policies to become more gender neutral.\nJUNE 2-8\nInexplicably, given the state of his trade warwithChina, Mr. Trump has decided to replicate the same tariff tactic with another major trade partner. Hethreatened Mexicoon Thursday with 5 percent tariffs on all goods unless its government stops the flow of illegal immigrants across the border with the United States. Those tariffs are set to take effect on June 10 and would gradually increase by 5 percent increments until they reach 25 percent \u2014 unless undocumented immigrants stop coming. An across-the-board tax of this nature could be extremely damaging for both American consumers and businesses, many of which are already hurting from the trade dispute with China. Stock up on avocados while you still can.\nApple will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, which is basically like Fashion Week for software nerds. Expect a lot of technobabble aboutcomplex new featuresfor its products. But for the average Apple consumer (which is to say, an iPhone owner), all you need to know is \u201cdark mode.\u201d That\u2019s the name of a trend toward making black space more dominant on screens\u2019 backgrounds, which helps save battery life and cuts down on the amount of bright light beaming into your retinas when you should probably be going to bed or, hey, looking at other humans.\nPresident Trump will pay a state visit this week to London, where he\u2019ll meet with the soon-to-be-former prime minister, Theresa May. That could be awkward, considering Donald Trump Jr.\u2019spast remarksabout Ms. May \u2014 but what hasn\u2019t she heard at this point? She isstepping downas the leader of the Conservative Party this Friday, admitting defeat in her dogged attempts to forge a Brexit plan with Parliament. Her successors are already lining up, but to what end? The failure of Britain\u2019s government to withdraw from the European Union by the deadline has sobruised the country\u2019s economythat new leadership is too little, too late.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosicriticized Facebookfor \u201clying to the public\u201d after a doctored video that made her appear drunk was spread on its platform. Meanwhile, the robots really are winning: Artificial intelligencecan now outsmart humansat capture the flag and other multiplayer games. And elsewhere,a new report showsthat the 2017 tax cuts didn\u2019t really stimulate the economy. They definitely didn\u2019t pay for themselves, either."

        "title": "How Updates in iOS 13 and Android Q Will Change Your Smartphone",
        "fulltext": "Year after year, Apple and Google announce big upgrades for their smartphone operating systems. That means the software that makes your phone tick is about to change \u2014 again.\nWith change comes new things to learn. The annual upgrades, which are free, improve our devices by fixing bugs and strengthening security, but they can be intimidating because every update includes hundreds of new features.\nApple\u2019s iOS 13, the next version of the iPhone operating system, which was unveiled this week, includes new features like a so-called dark mode to make the screen easier on your eyes. And Google\u2019s Android Q, unveiled last month, introduces new gestures for controlling Android phones and some enhancements tosafeguard user privacy.\nFortunately we have a few months to prepare: Both upgrades are expected by the fall.\nTo drill down on the most important changes, I tested an early version of Android Q and got an early look at iOS 13. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nLet\u2019s start with the least flashy yet most important change: speed.\nMany of Apple\u2019s iPhones, from the four-year-old iPhone 6S to the latest ones, will become faster with iOS 13. Apple said it made improvements to the operating system that will make apps open up to two times faster. The new software system will also reduce data sizes of apps, which will also increase speeds. App downloads will be 50 percent smaller, and software updates will be 60 percent smaller. For owners of the newer models, the face scanner will unlock the phone about 30 percent faster.\n[Get the personal tech newsletter for advice and tips on navigating the technology changing how you live.]\nMany apps are designed with white backgrounds, and in some circumstances, this can get tiresome for the eyes. Apple phones and Android devices will both get dark modes, which can be toggled on by tapping on a shortcut. Both versions replace white backgrounds with dark colors, ranging from gray to black, depending on how an app\u2019s interface is layered.\nSo what\u2019s the point? Dark mode can be beneficial for a number of reasons: It should reduce battery consumption because fewer pixels need to be lit up, and it will make screens easier on the eyes when reading in the dark.\nOne caveat: While Apple and Google demonstrated their own apps working with dark mode, third-party developers will have to use the companies\u2019 tool kits to enable their apps to work with dark mode. By the time of the operating systems\u2019 release, there will probably be plenty of apps taking advantage of the new mode.\nIn tech land, privacy has been the most prominent topic for the last few years, and Apple and Google are promising privacy enhancements in their next mobile operating systems.\nChief among Apple\u2019s new privacy features is Sign In With Apple, a button for using an Apple ID to sign in to iOS apps and websites. It competes with similar tools from Google andFacebook, which let you use your Google or Facebook accounts to log in to different websites and apps.\nApple is taking a unique approach. When you sign up for a website or app with your Apple ID, iOS 13 will include an option to hide the email address linked to your Apple ID. In the process, Apple will create what is essentially a burner email address to sign up, hiding it from the third party. Whenever the website or app you sign up for tries to contact you, it will email the burner address, and Apple will forward the memo to your real email address. So if a business starts sending spam to the burner email address, you can delete your account, and the business won\u2019t have your real email address.\nGoogle\u2019s Android Q, on the other hand, plays catch-up with Apple on privacy. The software update will focus on giving people more control over how their location is shared. When an app asks for permission to have access to your location data, Google will ask whether you want to share your location all the time, only while the app is in use or never. (In the past, the only options were to share data all the time or never.)\nAlso brand-new to Android is a menu in the settings app labeled Privacy. Here, a switchboard of controls includes an option to see the apps that are using your location as well as the ability to opt out of ad-targeting inside apps.\nApple and Google have been copying each other\u2019s phone software for years. This time, Android will borrow heavily from the iPhone\u2019s newer gesture-based user interface.\nWhen you have an app loaded in Android Q, just swipe up from the bottom to return to the home screen. Swiping up and holding down your finger opens an app carousel to quickly switch between apps by swiping left or right. These gestures are just like the way you would control a newer iPhone after Apple abandoned its physical home button.\nFinally, iOS 13 will introduce an overhaul to Apple\u2019s maps software, helping it play catch-up with Google Maps. Apple said it had invested a significant amount of time and money into improving its maps, especially in the United States. In some areas, maps will show a binoculars button; tapping on it will load a 3-D view of the street to let you look around as if you were there. The feature mimics Google\u2019s Street View, which has been available for many years.\nIn addition, Apple Maps will begin providing real-time information in some cities for transit routes. If your bus is running late, for example, the app will show an update with the latest bus schedule. (Google began offering a similar feature,Commute, last year in its maps app.)"

        "title": "To Take Down Big Tech, They First Need to Reinvent the Law",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Americans fear the future, they turn to antitrust action.\nIt happened in the 1890s, when the United States was rapidly moving from a farming economy to an industrialized one. It happened again in the late 1940s, when nuclear war seemed imminent. And it is happening now, as big technology companies work on artificial intelligence that threatens to create a world where human beings are eternal losers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying about how history doesn\u2019t repeat itself but it rhymes, and we\u2019re definitely in a rhyming mode,\u201d said Edward T. O\u2019Donnell, a historian at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. \u201cOur worries about our technological future are sending us back to solutions in our industrial past.\u201d\nFor decades, antitrust regulation has been overwhelmingly focused on the welfare of the consumer. No cost to the consumer, no problem. That opened the door for Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon \u2014 which offered digital services that were cheap or free \u2014 to become immensely profitable and powerful.\nNow a backlash is mounting asrenegade scholarstry to reverse years of established doctrinethat they say does not appropriately take the clout of those companies into account. Economic absolutism is making way for other considerations as antitrust thinking goes back to its roots.\n\u201cPeople might enjoy using the tech platforms but they are also asking, What kind of society do we want?\u201d said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Institute of Public Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re at one of those antitrust moments.\u201d\nThe change in antitrust thinking has recently gathered momentum. This month, American regulators indicatedthey were looking at Big Tech, inspiring a rush of \u201cabout time\u201d remarks from politicians across the spectrum. Since then,President Trump, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler have all endorsed in their own ways a heightened scrutiny of the tech behemoths.\nMakan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, recentlygave a speech in Israelin which he upped the stakes by rejecting the consumer welfare standard as the sole determinant of harm. He went so far as to assert that \u201cdiminished quality\u201d can harm competition, which could send regulators into some novel areas.\nMr. Delrahim concluded by saying the antitrust division \u201cis working hard to stay true\u201d to the original vision of John Sherman, the Ohio senator whose name is on the 1890 antitrust act that was the first legislation against monopolies.\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in the Senate by a 51-to-1 vote, while the House endorsed it unanimously. It was two pages long, did not bother defining the word \u201cmonopoly\u201d and was used in its first decade mostly to go after labor. Some historians think the conservative Congress that passed it was merely being cynical, offering a sop to reformers.\nThe fear of the future, however, was real as the economy transformed itself. In 1890,the percentage of the population in agriculturewas at 43 percent, down from 72 percent in 1820. The steel companies, meatpackers and railroads hired and then hired some more. The number of millionaires rose from a few hundred before the Civil War to about 4,000 in 1890, historians estimate. .\n\u201cThe rising fear of the day was that honest, hardworking people are being screwed and the system is rigged,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, author of \u201cHenry George and the Crisis of Inequality: Progress and Poverty in the Gilded Age.\u201d People grew to depend on big companies like Standard Oil, just as their descendants today cannot sign off from Facebook and Google. But they did not necessarily like them.\n\u201cNearly every household had a five-gallon red can of Standard Oil\u2019s kerosene,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cBut the founder, John D. Rockefeller, was often seen as rapacious octopus.\u201d\nIn 1900, the Democratic Party platform included the belief that \u201cprivate monopolies are indefensible and intolerable,\u201d declaring: \u201cUnless their insatiate greed is checked, all wealth will be aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed.\u201d\nGroundbreaking reforms followed, including the breakup of Standard Oil. In 1913, in a largely forgotten episode, National Cash Register Co. became the first tech company to be successfully prosecuted for violating the Sherman Act. Nearly 30 executives at the company, which controlled 95 percent of the cash register market, were convicted andsentenced to brief prison terms.While they appealed and never served a day, the company\u2019s power was broken.\nAntitrust moves ebbed and flowed through the 20th century. In the late 1940s, said Daniel Crane, an antitrust historian at the University of Michigan, \u201cthere was quite a bit of alarm about the growing tide of industrial concentration following the war, and fear that undue levels of concentration could bring fascism or communism to power.\u201d\nBy the mid-1950s, Americans had reconciled themselves to working for large corporations but antitrust remained a potent force.\n\u201cAnybody who knows anything about the conduct of American business knows that the managers of the large corporations do their business with one eye constantly cast over their shoulders at the antitrust division,\u201d the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in 1964.\nOne of the most controversial cases of that era is now enjoying a resurgence: Brown Shoe Co. Inc. v United States.\nThe case began in 1956 when Brown Shoe, a manufacturer and retailer, merged with G.R. Kinney Co., which also made and sold shoes to customers. The government sued, saying the merger would increase concentration in the manufacturing and selling of shoes, eliminate a major competitor and deprive other shoe companies of a fair opportunity to compete. The government won the case in the district court and then, in 1962, at the Supreme Court.\nThe case could give Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple nightmares. The reason: The way that regulators defined unhealthy concentration in a market. At the time, Brown Shoe and Kinney together owned only 7.2 percent of the country\u2019s retail shoe stores, and shoe stores were by no means the only place to buy shoes. The closest the merged company got to a monopoly was in six cities, where it sold over 40 percent of children\u2019s shoes.\nGoogle, by contrast, has92 percent of the worldwide search market today,while Facebook has70 percent of the social media marketand Amazon about 38 percent of the e-commerce market in the United States, according to research firms. (Antitrust arguments against Apple are less about market share and more about how it treats competitors in its App Store.)\nBrown Shoe\u2019s argument that the shoe industry was \u201cdynamically competitive\u201d did not sway minds. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that \u201cthe protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses\u201d was a priority, even if \u201coccasional higher costs and prices\u201d might be the result.\nBrown Shoe is a \u201cfoundational antitrust decision even though it embodies values that have fundamentally shifted,\u201d C. Paul Rogers III, a professor at SMU School of Law, wrote last year in the SMU Law Review.\nIn an interview, he said, \u201cThe court was very concerned about trends toward concentration and growth by acquisition. It ignored efficiency arguments, saying efficiency gains could actually be a negative because they can squeeze out the small guys.\u201d He added that he thought the case was wrongly decided on its facts, \u201cbut if that populist approach comes back, it would be scary to these very efficient high-tech behemoths.\u201d\nApple, Amazon, Google and Facebook declined to comment on Brown Shoe.\nIf the populists gain more momentum, they have a ways to go to unseat the antitrust establishment, which still hews to the consumer welfare standard developed by Robert Bork, the influential legal scholar and judge, and scholars at the University of Chicago beginning in the 1970s.\nSome experts, like Mr. Singer of George Washington University, are waiting to see how sincere regulators are in their newfound zeal \u2014 and where exactly they plan to go. Mr. Delrahim of the Justice Department mentioned in his speech some unusual applications of antitrust, including \u201cprivacy protections\u201d and \u201cfree speech on platforms.\u201d\nMr. Singer said that last was a nod to President Trump, who has said he and some of his supporters have been unfairly treated on social media. As for privacy, \u201cI am very skeptical that more competition is going to make the platforms less exploitative of user data,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir whole reason for existing is to exploit user data.\u201d\nAt least for the moment, however, the reformers are ascendant and the economists defensive.\n\u201cThe American people designed antimonopoly law so anyone can understand the rules,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the executive director of Open Markets, a Washington think-tank that has advocated antitrust reform. \u201cEnforcers followed guidelines that limited industrial firms to 25 percent of any market. To enforce the law, in other words, all you had to do was be able to count to four. We don\u2019t need economists to help us count to four.\u201d\nEven if the reformers decisively win, the arguments will doubtless continue. The truest thing ever said about antitrust was by Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1990s.\n\u201cMerger enforcement in the United States,\u201d he said, \u201chas often been erratic and always controversial.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer and one of the most influential executives in the history of the Silicon Valley giant, is leaving the company.\nMr. Ive will depart this year to start his own design company, Apple said on Thursday. Through his new firm, LoveFrom, Mr. Ive will continue to work on a wide range of Apple products, the company said.\n\u201cJony is a singular figure in the design world, and his role in Apple\u2019s revival cannot be overstated,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.\nMr. Ive, who has worked at Apple for nearly three decades, was responsible for the look and feel of many iconic Apple products, including theiPhoneand the iMac. He also helped design Apple\u2019s new headquarters, a futuristic,flying-saucerlike glass buildingthat has become one of the most distinctive structures in Silicon Valley.\nApple\u2019s design team will now be led by Evans Hankey, an industrial designer at the company, and Alan Dye, previously a creative director at Apple. They will report to Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who oversaw the creation of the Apple Watch.\nApple\u2019s share price was down more than 1 percent in after-hours trading after Mr. Ive\u2019s departure was announced.\nApple has struggled in recent quarters with slumping iPhone sales and a significantdrop in revenue across the China region. In April, when Apple last reported its quarterly financial results, profit dropped 16.4 from the same quarter a year earlier, and iPhone sales dropped 17.3 percent.\nRevenue from online services, including Apple\u2019s App Store, was on the rise. But the hardware business that defined Apple \u2014 and the career of Mr. Ive \u2014 has slowed. The Apple Watch has been a modest success, but it has not captured the market or the popular imagination in the way that the iPhone and the iMac did when they were released.\nApple did not make Mr. Ive available for comment Thursday evening.\nBorn and raised outside London, Mr. Ive joined Apple in 1992, when the company was nearing its lowest ebb. One of his first projects was the Apple Newton, an early hand-held computer that, while innovative, was bulky and too expensive to find a mainstream audience. It was considered a bust.\nBut Mr. Ive became a key player in the company\u2019s revival after its founder Steve Jobs returned in 1997.\nMr. Jobs and Mr. Ive often met for lunch, and at the end of each day, the chief executive would visit Mr. Ive\u2019s Apple design studio, according to Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography \u201cSteve Jobs.\u201d\n\u201cThe difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge,\u201d Mr. Jobs told Mr. Isaacson. \u201cHe understands what we do at out core better than anyone.\u201d\nAs the head of Apple\u2019s industrial design team, Mr. Ive helped shape the original iMac, a clear plastic bubble of a personal computer that marked a return to form for the company.\nAfter the iMac, he played a vital role in Apple\u2019s breakout products. From the iPod music player to the iPhone to the iPad tablet, Apple redefined personal computing over the next decade or so and became one of the most profitable and valuable companies in the world.\nIndustrial design \u2014 how the look, feel and behavior of a product are defined by its creators \u2014 has long been a key part of the Apple ethos.\n\u201cThis is part of Steve\u2019s legacy,\u201d Mr. Ive told The New York Timesin an interview in 2014. \u201cDeep in the culture of Apple is this sense and understanding of design, developing and making. Form and the material and process \u2014 they are beautifully intertwined \u2014 completely connected.\u201d\nIn 2012, after the success of the iPad, Mr. Ive was knighted in Britain. And his voice was a staple of Apple television ads, as he deconstructed the Apple design philosophy for the masses.\nThis philosophy extended to the Apple Park, the company\u2019s $5 billion campus in Cupertino, Calif. Before it opened to employees in 2017, Mr. Ive spent a significant portion of his time working on the new headquarters.\nIn the years since, he has stepped back from his daily role at the company and spent more time on outside projects, including a Christmas tree for the historic Claridge\u2019s hotel in London.\nThough he and Mr. Jobs came to represent the company\u2019s unique approach to design, Mr. Ive always made a point of saying he was just one piece in the puzzle. \u201cInnovation at Apple has always been a team game,\u201d he told The Times."
