        "title": "The World\u2019s Wokest Sports League Bows to China",
        "fulltext": "The national editor of this newspaper last yearaskedthe commissioner of the N.B.A. at a conference how it felt \u201cto be the wokest professional sports league.\u201d It was a fair description: While Colin Kaepernick has been unable to find a job in the N.F.L. after kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, basketball stars like LeBron James, Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant have freely expressed their support for the Black Lives Matter movement,even on the court.\nIt\u2019s areputation\u2014 and a brand \u2014 that the league has cultivated. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were given that designation,\u201d Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, responded. \u201cBut I understand the sentiment and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d He went on to insist that \u201cpolitical speech\u201d is players\u2019 \u201cabsolute right within the league.\u201d\nAbsolutely, that is, unless the subject of that political speech is the Chinese Communist Party, which presents perhaps the greatest strategic threat to our freedoms of any regime in the world. On that subject, Mr. Silver and the league he runs are shamefully silent.\nA stunning instance of N.B.A. acquiescence to Beijing began on Friday evening when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, put out a tweet expressing support for Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement: \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d You might assume that the wokest professional sports league \u2014 this is a business, after all, thatpulledits all-star game out of Charlotte, N.C., in 2017 because of that state\u2019s anti-transgender bathroom bill \u2014 would see human rights, representative democracy and freedom of conscience as core virtues. But you would be wrong.\nThe Morey tweet, though promptly deleted, went viral in China, where outrage from sponsors and fans wasfast and furious. But the swiftness with which the N.B.A. bent its knee to Chinese sensitivities was truly breathtaking for a league that prides itself on a \u201csense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important,\u201d as Mr. Silver has boasted. Perhaps the factas many as 500 million Chinesewatched at least one N.B.A. game last season and the N.B.A.\u2019s business operations there are valued atmore than $4 billionhad something to do with it.\nThe owner of the Houston Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, didn\u2019t hesitate to throw his general manager under the bus: \u201cListen \u2026 @dmorey doesnotspeak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence inTokyois all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we arenota political organization,\u201dhe postedlate Friday night, a few days before a Rockets preseason game in Japan.\nSoon after came Mr. Morey\u2019swalk back: \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\nAmong the offended was the Chinese Basketball Association, which immediately suspended its relationship with the Rockets. The association is headed by Yao Ming, a former Rockets player who made the team by far the most popular N.B.A. franchise in China. By Monday, the current Rockets star James Hardenoffered a full-throated apologyon behalf of his boss: \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there.\u201d\nThe N.B.A.\u2019sofficial Chinese apology,put out on the social media site Sina Weibo (China\u2019s version of Twitter), was something to behold: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets,\u201d it said. Mr. Morey \u201cundoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans.\u201d\nAll of this comes just as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are headed to China for a two-game exhibition. The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, who weighed in on the Morey controversy in a longFacebook postthat called the tweet \u201cdamaging,\u201d the democracy protesters a \u201cseparatist movement\u201d and the subject of Hong Kong\u2019s independence a \u201cthird-rail issue.\u201d\nThat an Alibaba chief sees the situation this way \u2014 the company\u2019stechnologyhas been used by the Chinese government tosurveil its citizens\u2014 should not come as a surprise to anyone. The question is how an American league that prides itself on promoting progressive values squares those values with allowing an apologist for authoritarianism to own one of its teams. What\u2019s more, why is a league run by a commissioner who rightly criticized President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban for going \u201cagainst the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great N.B.A.\u201d alsorunning a training campfor young players in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, amid campsof a far different kind?\nWoke politics often seems to train our collective attention down on our navels rather than out at the world. Is the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms really as morally urgent as a country that is, as Pete Buttigieg sharply put it, \u201cusing technology for the perfection of dictatorship?\u201d This is a worldview that encourages companies to take cost-free stands on the progressive cause of the moment and do absolutely nothing to uphold fundamental progressive values when doing so requires more sacrifice than the time it takes to write up a news release. A worldview that fails to force companies like the N.B.A., Apple, Google and Disney to account for the fact that they are serving as handmaidens to totalitarians is not one worth taking seriously.\nThe longstanding conventional wisdom on China \u2014 that engagement and investment by America in China would inevitably lead to the country\u2019s political liberalization \u2014has simply not proven true. This is the chestnut Adam Silver himself insists on, when hespeaksabout the possibilities of \u201cbasketball diplomacy.\u201d\nAlas, just the opposite has happened.\nChina has become more repressive the more it has engaged with the West. Meantime, that economic engagement has led major Western businesses and institutions to keep quiet on a major moral issue of this century. The N.B.A.-China partnership is just one example of so many in which Beijing is calling the shots.\nReal political wisdom on this score lies with the creators of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d who, having offended China with an episode this week,dunked on the N.B.A.\u2019s cravenness.\n\u201cLike the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\u201d said Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a statement. \u201cWe too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t just look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Tech Giants Shift Profits to Avoid Taxes. There\u2019s a Plan to Stop Them.",
        "fulltext": "Digital tax dodgers, take heed: International leaders have advanced a plan to prevent large multinational companies like Apple, Facebook and Amazon from avoiding taxes by shifting profits between countries.\nIt\u2019s an effort to de-escalate a global battle over how to tax the digital economy.\nThe framework proposal, released Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, would allow countries to tax large multinationals even if they did not operate inside their borders. If international negotiators can now reach agreement on its key details, the plan will pave the way for new taxes not just on tech companies but on automakers and any other large multinational firms that operate online.\nPolitical and corporate leadershave clashed in recent yearsover how \u2014 and where \u2014 to tax companies that operate across national borders, particularly those that sell goods and services online.\nTraditionally, companies have paid taxes in the countries where their economic activity is generated. But in the digital economy, firms can \u201cmove\u201d the source of their profits, like patents and other intellectual property, to countries where tax rates are extremely low. That allows them to pay lower rates than companies that operate only in a single country like the United States.\nMany countries, particularly those in Europe, have moved to curb that practice by approving new taxes on large multinational companies that sell to their citizens but pay little or no tax to their countries. France approved a new digital tax this year that would hit large American tech companies like Google. The Trump administration responded by threatening tariffs on imported French goods, like wine, before the countries agreed to pause their plans in hopes of finding a multilateral agreement through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWednesday\u2019s release brought an18-page framework planthat officials hope will form the basis of an international agreement on digital taxation as early as next year. That framework would fundamentally alter how and where companies that operated across national borders were taxed, though it leaves the details of those tax rates to future negotiators. It suggests new rules on where companies should pay taxes \u2014 largely based on where their sales occur \u2014 and on which profits are subject to taxation.\n\u201cIn a digital age, the allocation of taxing rights can no longer be exclusively circumscribed by reference to physical presence,\u201d the framework states. \u201cThe current rules dating back to the 1920s are no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalized world.\u201d\nThe framework applies only to multinationals with annual revenues of about $825 million or higher. It excludes manufacturing suppliers and resource extraction companies, like oil companies.\nAs it stands, the framework appears to be a victory for large, consumption-heavy countries like the United States, China and much of Western Europe, and a loss for so-called tax havens, like Ireland. Advancing the negotiating process is a win for large multinationals, even though a final deal could put them on the hook to pay more in taxes, because the alternative appears to be a series of country-by-country digital taxes that could be expensive to comply with.\n\u201cAmazon welcomes the publication of these proposals by the O.E.C.D., which are an important step forward,\u201d a spokeswoman said Wednesday in an email. \u201cReaching broad international agreement on changes to fundamental international tax principles is critical to limit the risk of double taxation and distortive unilateral measures and to provide an environment that fosters growth in global trade, which is vital for the millions of customers and sellers that Amazon supports around the globe.\u201d\nA Treasury Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the United States \u201cis studying the O.E.C.D. Secretariat\u2019s proposal and is actively engaged in the process aimed at forging a consensus on international tax issues,\u201d before reiterating the administration\u2019s opposition \u201cto unilateral digital services taxes.\u201d\nThe framework will be taken up for discussion by finance ministers from large countries, who are due to meet in Washington next week."

        "title": "Apple Offers Upbeat Forecast While Profit Continues to Fall",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple said on Wednesday that its profit shrank for the fourth consecutive quarter \u2014 the longest such streak since 2016 \u2014 but it forecast that better days were ahead.\nThe tech giant said its profit fell 3.1 percent to $13.69 billion in the latest quarter, from $14.13 billion a year ago, largely because of continued declines in iPhone sales. Yet the results beat analysts\u2019 expectations and were quickly cheered by investors because of indications that its new iPhone models would be a hit.\nApple reported a 9 percent fall in iPhone sales in the quarter, smaller than the declines in other recent quarters. More important, the company said it expected strong sales in the current holiday quarter \u2014 news that seemed to confirm Wall Street expectations that people like the iPhones introduced last month.\nApple also showed signs of recovery in China, a crucial market where the company had struggled for months. After a drop in sales of roughly 20 percent in the region over the previous nine months, Apple said sales there were down 2.4 percent in the last quarter.\nThe results suggested that the issues causing Apple\u2019s business to shrink in China and elsewhere in recent months had been resolved \u2014 or at least temporarily patched.\nApple had blamed some of its struggles in China on the country\u2019s slowing economy and its trade war with the United States. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview on Wednesday that those issues were subsiding.\n\u201cThese trade tensions have not been helpful to the Chinese economy and to our business, and we think that as you\u2019ve seen from our results, the peak of those tensions were at the beginning of the year,\u201d he said.\nApple got off to a rocky start this year whenit cut revenue forecasts because of slow sales in China, prompting a sharp sell-off of its stock. Since then, Apple\u2019s financials have improved and its market value has rebounded. Apple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe company is still benefiting from low expectations, from when they set the bar really low\u201d in January, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. \u201cAnd since then, they\u2019ve been telling a different story, which is that they\u2019re pivoting to be less dependent on the iPhone.\u201d\nApple became a $1 trillion company on the back of the iPhone, one of history\u2019s most successful products. But as the smartphone market became saturated, Apple increased iPhone prices to keep growing.\nThe strategy worked for a time. But as prices went up, sales of new phones slowed, particularly in markets like China. In recent months, Apple has propped up iPhone sales in places like China with price cuts and financing.\nApple\u2019s latest iPhones \u2014 the iPhone 11 family \u2014 seem to be bucking the trend. The latest quarter represents just nine days of sales of the iPhone 11, but the drop in iPhone sales were lower than in the previous three quarters. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a bit early,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. \u201cBut the initial signs are very positive.\u201d\nApple\u2019s overall revenue increased 1.8 percent to $64 billion in the quarter ending in September. Apple predicted $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, compared with $84.3 billion a year prior.\nMany analysts had increased their estimates for iPhone sales in recent weeks after certain signs, including reports from factories in China, suggested that demand for the new phones was strong. Analysts attributed some of that success to Apple\u2019s decisions with the latest phones, including dropping the price of its flagship phone while adding an additional camera lens to its higher-end models.\nApple has made up for the declines in iPhone sales with growth in other areas, such as wearable devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as its business of selling apps and other services like music and news.\nWearables revenue grew by 54 percent to $6.5 billion and services revenue increased by 18 percent to $12.5 billion in the quarter. Apple is trying to bolster that business with a gaming service introduced last month and a streaming service set to start on Friday."

        "title": "China Sharpens Hacking to Hound Its Minorities, Far and Wide",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 China\u2019s state-sponsoredhackershave drastically changed how they operate over the last three years, substituting selectivity for what had been a scattershot approach to their targets and showing a new determination by Beijing to push its surveillance state beyond its borders.\nThe government has poured considerable resources into the change, which is part of a reorganization of the national People\u2019s Liberation Army thatPresident Xi Jinpinginitiated in 2016, security researchers and intelligence officials said.\nChina\u2019s hackers have since built up a new arsenal of techniques, such as elaborate hacks of iPhone and Android software, pushing them beyond email attacks and the other, more basic tactics that they had previously employed.\nThe primary targets for these more sophisticated attacks: China\u2019s ethnic minorities and their diaspora in other countries, the researchers said. In several instances, hackers targeted the cellphones of a minority known as Uighurs, whosehome region, Xinjiang, has been the site of a vast build-out of surveillance tech in recent years.\n\u201cThe Chinese use their best tools against their own people first because that is who they\u2019re most afraid of,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a former United States government official who writes on cybersecurity and espionage for the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. \u201cThen they turn those tools on foreign targets.\u201d\nChina\u2019swillingness to extend the reach of its surveillance and censorship was on display after an executive for the National Basketball Association\u2019s Houston Rockets tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong this month. The response from China was swift, threatening a range of business relationships the N.B.A. had forged in the country.\nIn August, Facebook and Twitter said they had taken down a large network ofChinesebots that was spreading disinformation around the protests. And in recent weeks, a security firm traced a monthslong attack on Hong Kong media companies to Chinese hackers. Security experts say Chinese hackers are very likely targeting protesters\u2019 phones, but they have yet to publish any evidence.\nSome security researchers said the improved abilities of the Chinese hackers had put them on a par with elite Russian cyberunits. And the attacks on cellphones of Uighurs offered a rare glimpse of how some of China\u2019s most advanced hacking tools are now being used to silence or punish critics.\nGoogle researchers who tracked the attacks against iPhones said details about the software flaws that the hackers had preyed on would have been worth tens of millions of dollars on black market sites where information about software vulnerabilities is sold.\nOn the streets in Xinjiang, huge numbers of high-endsurveillance cameras run facial recognition softwareto identify and track people. Specially designed apps have been used to screen Uighurs\u2019 phones, monitor their communications and register their whereabouts.\nGaining access to the phones of Uighurs who have fled China \u2014 a diaspora that has grown as many have been locked away at home \u2014 would be a logical extension of those total surveillance efforts. Such communities in other countries have long been a concern to Beijing, and many in Xinjiang have been sent to camps because relatives traveled or live abroad.\nThe Chinese police have also made less sophisticated efforts to control Uighurs who have fled, using the chat app WeChat to entice them to return home or to threaten their families.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. China has denied past claims that it conducts cyberespionage, adding that it, too, is often a target.\nSecurity researchers recently discovered that the Chineseused National Security Agency hacking toolsafter apparently discovering an N.S.A. cyberattack on their own systems. And several weeks ago, a Chinese security firm, Qianxin,published an analysistying the Central Intelligence Agency to a hack of China\u2019s aviation industry.\nBreaking into iPhones has long been considered the Holy Grail of cyberespionage. \u201cIf you can get inside an iPhone, you have yourself a spy phone,\u201d said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis atFireEye, a cybersecurity firm.\nThe F.B.I. couldn\u2019t do it without help during a showdown with Apple in 2016. The bureau paid more than $1 million to an anonymous third party to hack an iPhone used by a gunman involved in the killing of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.\nGoogle researchers said they had discovered that iPhone vulnerabilities were being exploited to infect visitors to a set of websites. Although Google did not release the names of the targets, Apple said they had been found on about a dozen websites focused on Uighurs.\n\u201cYou can hit a high school student from Japan who is visiting the site to write a research report, but you are also going to hit Uighurs who have family members back in China and are supporting the cause,\u201d said Steven Adair, the president and founder of the security firm Volexity in Virginia.\nThetechnology news site TechCrunchfirst reported the Uighur connection. A software update from Apple fixed the flaw.\nIn recent weeks, security researchers at Volexity uncovered Chinese hacking campaigns that exploited vulnerabilities in Google\u2019s Android software as well. Volexity found that several websites that focused on Uighur issues had been infected with Android malware. It traced the attacks to two Chinese hacking groups.\nBecause the hacks targeted Android and iPhone users \u2014 even though Uighurs in Xinjiang don\u2019t commonly use iPhones \u2014 Mr. Adair said he believed that they had been aimed in part at Uighurs living abroad.\n\u201cChina is expanding their digital surveillance outside their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it really is going after the diaspora.\u201d\nAnother group of researchers, at the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto, recently uncovered an overlapping effort, using some of the same code discovered by Google and Volexity. It attacked the iPhones and Android phones of Tibetans until as recently as May.\nUsing WhatsApp messages, Chinese hackers posing as New York Times reporters and representatives of Amnesty International and other organizations targeted the private office of the Dalai Lama, members of the Tibetan Parliament and Tibetan nongovernmental organizations, among others.\nLobsang Gyatso, the secretary of TibCERT, an organization that works with Tibetan organizations on cybersecurity threats, said in an interview that the recent attacks were a notable escalation from previous Chinese surveillance attempts.\nFor a decade, Chinese hackers blasted Tibetans with emails containing malicious attachments, Mr. Lobsang said. If they hacked one person\u2019s computer, they hit everyone in the victim\u2019s address books, casting as wide a net as possible. But in the last three years, Mr. Lobsang said, there has been a big shift.\n\u201cThe recent targeting was something we haven\u2019t seen in the community before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a huge shift in resources. They were targeting mobile phones, and there was a lot more reconnaissance involved. They had private phone numbers of individuals, even those that were not online. They knew who they were, where their offices were located, what they did.\u201d\nAdam Meyers, the vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, said these operations were notably more sophisticated than five years ago, when security firms discovered that Chinese hackers were targeting the phones of Hong Kong protestersin the so-called Umbrella Revolution.\nAt the time, Chinese hackers could break only intophones that had been \u201cjailbroken,\u201d or altered in some way to allow the installation of apps not vetted by Apple\u2019s official store. The recent attacks against the Uighurs broke into up-to-date iPhones without tipping off the owner.\n\u201cIn terms of how the Chinese rank threats, the highest threats are domestic,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThe No. 1 threat, as the Chinese see it, is the loss of information control on their own population. But the United States is firmly No. 2.\u201d\nChinese hackers have also used their improved skills to attack the computer networks of foreign governments and companies. They have targeted internet and telecommunications companies and have broken into the computer networks of foreign tech, chemical, manufacturing and mining companies. Airbus recently said China had hacked it through a supplier.\nIn 2016, Mr. Xi consolidated several army hacking divisions under a new Strategic Support Force, similar to the United States\u2019 Cyber Command, and moved much of the country\u2019s foreign hacking operation from the army to the more advanced Ministry of State Security, China\u2019s main spy agency.\nThe restructuring coincided with a lull in Chinese cyberattacks after a 2015 agreement between Mr. Xi and President Barack Obama to cease cyberespionage operations for commercial gain.\n\u201cThe deal gave the Chinese the time and space to focus on professionalizing their cyberespionage capabilities,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\nChinese officials also cracked down on moonlighting in moneymaking schemes by its state-sponsored hackers \u2014 a \u201ccorruption\u201d issue that Mr. Xi concluded had sometimes compromised the hackers\u2019 identities and tools, according to security researchers.\nWhile China was revamping its operations, security experts said, it was also clamping down on security research in order to keep advanced hacking methods in house. The Chinese police recentlysaid they planned to enforce national laws against unauthorizedvulnerability disclosure, and Chinese researchers were recently banned from competing in Western hacking conferences.\n\u201cThey are circling the wagons,\u201d Mr. Hultquist of FireEye said. \u201cThey\u2019ve recognized that they could use these resources to aid their offensive and defensive cyberoperations.\u201d"

        "title": "16 Useful Gems in Apple\u2019s New iOS 13",
        "fulltext": "Every September, Apple offers the world a new update of its iOS software for iPhones. This year\u2019s version, iOS 13, didn\u2019t exactly have a graceful landing; since its release in September, Apple has produced no fewer than five follow-up versions intended to fill feature holes and fix bugs. A sixth version, 13.2, is in beta testing now.\nBut never mind all that. Apple has said plenty about what it considers the most important new features: Dark Mode, which gives all your apps a slick, white-on-dark, inverted-colors look; QuickPath, which lets you type by swiping sloppily across the relevant keys instead of tapping them, as you can on Android phones; and a rewritten Maps app.\nBut when you give thousands of software engineers a whole year to improve your phone software, you wind up with dozens of features that don\u2019t get a lot of press. Here, then, is a treasure map to the hidden gems of iOS 13.\nYou can now doeverythingon the phone by voice alone: tap and drag, operate buttons and sliders, edit text, even \u201cpush\u201d the buttons on the edges of the phone. The feature is intended for disabled iPhone fans. But it\u2019s so complete, easy, and fast, it might appeal to other kinds of people, too: those whose hands are wet or grubby, for example, or those who are reclining and tired.\nTo turn on Voice Control, tap Settings >Accessibility >Voice Control.\nAt this point, you can navigate by saying, for example, \u201cGo Home,\u201d \u201cOpen Maps,\u201d \u201cGo back,\u201d \u201cOpen app switcher,\u201d and \u201cOpen Control Center.\u201d\nYou can \u201cuse your fingers\u201d by saying, \u201cTap Reply,\u201d \u201clong-press Mail,\u201d \u201cswipe up,\u201d \u201cscroll down,\u201d \u201czoom in,\u201d \u201cpan up,\u201d \u201cswipe left three,\u201d and so on. Instead of pressing the hardware buttons on the phone, say, \u201cTurn volume up,\u201d \u201cMute sound,\u201d \u201cRotate to portrait,\u201d and \u201cTake screenshot.\u201d\nThe real miracle is text editing. You can say \u201cDelete that\u201d to backspace over the last utterance (or, say, \u201cDelete previous two lines\u201d). Best of all, you can speak corrections, which is heaven-sent when you have to fix the errors (either yours or Siri\u2019s) in a dictated message. Just say, \u201cReplace \u2018Never call me again\u2019 with \u2018Best of luck.\u2019\u201d\nIf there\u2019s something you want to tap, like a spot on the map, that has no identifying labels, say, \u201cShow numbers,\u201d \u201cShow grid,\u201d or \u201cShow labels.\u201d You get tiny numbers, words, or grid squares overlaid on the screen. Speak what you want to tap.\nAnd don\u2019t worry about triggering accidental functions. The phone ignores everything you say (\u201cHey, can I borrow your charger?\u201d) that isn\u2019t a command (\u201copen Messages\u201d).\nThe Reminders app is a far more competent To Do manager in iOS 13. One welcome touch: you can now create \u201csubtasks\u201d for a reminder. For example, for a reminder called \u201cTonight\u2019s hot date,\u201d the indented subtasks might be \u201cShower,\u201d \u201cPick up dry cleaning,\u201d and \u201cGet braces removed.\u201d\nTo create a subtask, long-press the subordinate item\u2019s name and then drag it beneath the primary one. It indents itself.\nTo make Reminders more useful, iOS 13 lets you create them right from within Messages, Mail, Photos, Maps, and other apps. Select some text (or a photo, or a location, or whatever), tap the Share button, and then tap Reminders. You\u2019ll see the new To Do the next time you open Reminders.\nFinally, this one\u2019s worth its weight in gold: When you\u2019re creating a Reminder, you can turn on \u201cRemind me when messaging\u201d and then tap Choose Person to pluck somebody\u2019s name from Contacts. When you next begin messaging this person, the reminder will pop up.\nIt\u2019s ideal for those moments when you\u2019re preparing for bed and remember: \u201cOh shoot \u2014 I forgot to ask Robin to return my Tesla.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no more Loupe \u2014 the magnifying glass that has made placing the text-insertion point easier for the last 12 years. Instead, you\u2019re supposed to drag the blinking insertion point with your finger. It gets larger as you drag it into position.\nAlternatively, use the iPhone\u2019s invisible trackpad. When you long-press the Space bar, all the keys go blank; you\u2019ve just turned the entire keyboard area into a trackpad. Keep your finger down; slide it around to move your cursor.\nOnce you\u2019ve highlighted some text, you can tap anywhere with three fingers to summon a new toolbar, bearing icons for Cut, Copy, and Paste.\nBut toolbar, schmoolbar \u2014 it\u2019s even faster to use the new three-finger gestures.\nFor Copy, pinch on the screen with three fingers. For Cut, do that twice. For Paste, tap where you want to paste, and thenunpinchwith three fingers (spread them).\nYou, no doubt, never make mistakes \u2014 but for the record, you can now do Undo by swiping left with three fingers. (Swipe right for Redo.)\nIn the beginning, there was Find My iPhone: a feature that let you locate a lost phone from iCloud.com.\nIn iOS 13, incredibly, that works even if the phone has no internet connection \u2014 if, for example, you left it in some Montana bus stop that has no signal.\nApple has turned the world\u2019s 1.4 billionotheriPhones, iPads, and Macs into remote detectors for your phone. Any passing iOS 13 iPhone will, unbeknown to its owner, pick up your phone\u2019s silent Bluetooth beacon signal and relay its location back to you.\nTo make all of this happen so securely that neither Apple nor anybody else can locate your phone, Apple designed a solution that requires you to own a second Apple device; it\u2019s the only machine capable of decrypting your phone\u2019s location.\n(You can turn the feature off in Settings >[your name] > Find My > \u200bFind My iPhone.)\nThe Photos tab of the Photos app presents your entire photos collection in a delightful and efficient way: As grids of photos labeled Years, Months, and Days. (Videos play silently in place as you browse.)\nEach presents representative photos; the software omits duplicates, duds, and screenshots. You can time-zoom in or out \u2014 from Years to Months to Days, or the other way \u2014 by pinching or spreading two fingers.\nHandily enough, you remain on the same photo as you zoom. For example, if a photo of a bleary-eyed you is the sample photo for 2019, you\u2019ll land on the same photo when you zoom into Months (as the October photo), and again into Days (for this week).\nThe Edit screen has some new options: Vibrance, Sharpness, Definition; vertical and horizontal perspective correction; and Vignette, which darkens or brightens the four corners of the photo. For the first time in iPhone history, you can zoom in on a photo while editing.\nPerhaps most valuable of all: You can perform anyediting maneuver onvideosjust as easily as on photos. That includes all the color-correction tools, perspective-fixing tools, cropping tools, and even rotating tools. At last, you can fix videos that the phone mistakenly captured sideways.\nYou\u2019d need a hundred articles like this one to document all of the minor improvements, but here\u2019s a teaser list:\nNo more fiddling at the subway turnstile.In cities whose transit systems accept Apple Pay, like New York City\u2019s, you can breeze through the gates without the button-pressing and ID-authenticating steps that used to be required every time. To set this up, visit Settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay -> Express Transit Card, and choose the credit card you want to pay your fare. Now just hold the phone near the turnstile sensor and blow on through.\nIn the Calendar, you can attach files, photos, Word or PDF documents to appointments. That\u2019s handy for itineraries or business documents for a meeting.\nIn the iCloud Drive(Apple\u2019s version of Dropbox), you can now create or open .zip files, compressing or decompressing a file on the fly. Just long-press the file to view the commands.\nIn Maps, iOS 13 displays addresses that it finds in your Calendar appointments, to save typing when getting directions.\nSilence Unknown Callers(in Settings-> Phone) offers a small weapon against obnoxious robocallers. Every incoming call will go straight to voice mail without making your phone ring, buzz, or display a notification \u2014 except calls from people in your Contacts and people you\u2019ve called yourself.\nYour battery\u2019s life spanwill be much longer if you turn on Optimized Battery Charging in Settings->Battery. This option makes the iPhone stop charging at 80 percent except when it thinks you\u2019ll need the extra oomph, which it learns by studying your daily charging patterns. (Lithium-ion batteries last longest if you avoid charging them fully every day.)\nIn Mail, when you\u2019ve started addressing a message, you can tap the \u201ci\u201c beside someone\u2019s name to see a choice of their email addresses.\nEmail formattinghas had a huge upgrade. Now you can decorate your outgoing messages with typefaces, styles, formatting, attachments, and photos. It\u2019s all waiting in the new formatting bar, which appears when you tap the < at the right end of the typing suggestions bar.\nIn Messages, you can shoot canned responses right from the conversation list. Long-press a conversation\u2019s row to view the available short replies. They\u2019re usually along the lines of \u201cThanks,\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cTalk later?\u201d\nSiri can play the radio. It instantly begins to play any of 100,000 radio stations; just ask. \u201cHey Siri: Play WCBS.\u201d \u201cPlay BBC Radio 1.\u201d \u201cPlay 98.1 The Breeze.\u201d\nTo choose a Wi-Fi network, you no longer have to burrow into Settings. Just open the Control Center (swipe up from the bottom of the screen, or, on recent models, down from the top right \u201cear\u201d); long-press the Wi-Fi cluster; and then long-press the Wi-Fi icon. There\u2019s your list of available hot spots.\nAll of this, of course, is a lot to get used to \u2014 and change, as we all know, is hard. But look at the bright side: You have a whole year to get used to the new software before Apple changes it again next fall."

        "title": "10 Watches That Changed What\u2019s on Your Wrist",
        "fulltext": "What does\u201ccontemporary design\u201d mean in an industry that perennially looks backward?\nIt\u2019s a serious question for watchmakers, most of whom are traditionalists at heart. (Compare the dominant aesthetic in modern wristwatches with pocket watches created500 years ago; other than their shrinking diameters, little has changed.)\nToday\u2019s boom in sales of vintage watches, as well as new models that pay tribute to classic timepieces, has only exacerbated the industry\u2019s tendency to repeat its own design history. \u201cWith most big makers, more than 50 percent of their models are heavily inspired by their ownpast \u2014 becausethey sell,\u201d saidAurel Bacs, asenior watch consultantat the auction house Phillips.\nHe listed the most obvious examples:the1917Cartier Tank,the1957Omega Speedmaster,the1963Rolex Daytona,the1972Audemars Piguet Royal Oakandthe1976Patek Philippe Nautilus, all models that remain in production and continue to generate millions of dollars in sales.\nBut how about the current era? What will be remembered? We asked a group of industry insiders to assess the past quarter century of wristwatch design and identify the models that have had an effect on all kinds of watches, from Seiko to Swiss.\nTen timepieces, listed here in order of their introduction, made the cut \u2014 a selection sure to intrigue, and perhaps provoke, watch fans.\nIn the first decade of the new millennium, long before today\u2019s mania for daintier vintage timepieces began, watchmakers routinely produced colossal styles approaching 50 millimeters, or 2 inches, in diameter.\nAlthoughPanerai, the Italian heritage brandmade popular bySylvester Stallone, often is credited with kicking off the industry\u2019s size craze in the late 1990s, Audemars Piguet did it first with the Royal Oak Offshore, a 1993 model designed byEmmanuel Gueitto appeal to young buyers.\nNicknamed \u201cThe Beast,\u201d the42-millimeter-wideand15-millimeter-thickstainless steel wristwatch weighednearly two-thirds of a pound, dwarfingthe original39-millimeterRoyal Oak. And, in a testament to its sporty vibe, thepushersand crown were clad in rubber.\n\u201cThe Offshore was obviously inspired by the Royal Oak, but it was completely strange for the time,\u201d saidWilliam Rohr, managing director of the online watch forum TimeZone. \u201cIt was extremely huge, thick, heavy.\u201d\nThe model\u2019s brazenly masculine design helped pave the way for the hulking timepieces of theAughts\u2014 chiefly, the2005 Hublot Big Bang, a mechanical chronograph that incorporated gold, ceramic,Kevlar, carbon, tungsten,tantalumand rubber. It also foreshadowed the hoopla over steel sport timepieces thatdominatethe luxury watch market today.\nAlthough a backlash followed the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 the style struck many people as inappropriate after a global economic downturn \u2014 the Royal Oak Offshore remained a best seller, partly because Audemars Piguet had begun using it for limited editions featuring pop-culture figures, includingArnold SchwarzeneggerandJay-Z.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get them and if you did, they were immediately worth 30 percent more than what you paid for them,\u201d saidSteve Hallock, owner of Tick Tocking, a Los Angeles watch dealer specializing in contemporary timepieces. \u201cHublotandRichard Milletook a page out of that book and that book will never be closed because it was very successful.\u201d\nViewed from today\u2019s perspective, the Lange 1 by A. Lange & S\u00f6hne is the epitome of a classic round timepiece. But when it was unveiled in 1994, its key design elements \u2014 an asymmetrical time display and outsize date divided across two windows \u2014 cast theGermanmaker as an iconoclast.\n\u201cWhen it came out, there was nothing even remotely like it on the market,\u201d saidElizabeth Doerr,editor in chief andco-founder ofthe watch site Quill & Pad.\nThe model was the brainchild ofWalter Lange\u2014 agreat-grandsonof the brand\u2019s founder,Ferdinand Adolph Lange\u2014 and the entrepreneurG\u00fcnter Bl\u00fcmlein. And it wastheir first big effortsince resurrecting the house in1990.(The brand,which had operated since1845inGlash\u00fctte,the historic home of Germany\u2019s watchmaking industry, had been expropriated by the East German government following World War II and made to produce cheap watches for export.)\nThe Lange 1\u2019s then-unusual design heralded an important new perspective for the tradition-bound world of mechanical watchmaking, saidKatharine Thomas,head of the watch department at Sotheby\u2019s New York, and she compared the revived company to a modern start-up that \u201cmarked a path for companies outside the general Swiss establishment.\u201d\nAnd the success of the timepiece put the company name back on the map; in 2000,Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemontacquired the brand.\nDespite the many variations that the Lange 1 has spawned, including a 25th anniversary collection of 10 timepieces introduced this year, its look remains virtually unchanged.\n\u201cIs there a more recognizable dial than the one with anoutsizeddate?\u201d wroteEvald Murajon the watch site Hodinkeein an adoring reviewof a Lange 1 spinoff introduced in 2014 to mark the model\u2019s 20th anniversary.\nMr. Bacs said the watch offered a supreme example of German engineering:\u201cIn the car world, the Lange 1 would be a Porsche, Mercedes or another German luxury car. It\u2019s so different, it\u2019s so daring. It\u2019s soun-Germanbut still very German, because in the end it has all the German qualities \u2014 the reliability, the no-nonsense approach.\u201d\nAs Eric Wind, a vintage watch dealer, said, \u201cIt\u2019s become a model that everyone wants to own \u2014 even vintage lovers.\u201d\nIn1998, at the Baselworld fair in Switzerland, theFrench-born watchmaker Vianney Halterpresented a retro-futuristic wristwatch, named Antiqua.\nFashioned in the steampunk tradition bythe American industrial designer Jeff Barnesand built by Mr. Halter, the yellow gold model featured four riveted porthole-like dials of platinum in an asymmetrical, three-dimensional case, looking like something out of a Jules Verne novel.\n\u201cThe front of it is this wildCaptain Nemo-looking design, but if you look at the back, it\u2019s a round watch with a standard movement with a perpetual calendar,\u201d saidGary Getz, a Northern California watch collector whohas written abouthis love of the AntiquaforQuill & Pad. \u201cIt\u2019s party in the front, business in the back.\u201d\nWidely considered to be the first model to experiment with an entirely new form, the Antiqua\u2019s juxtaposition of avant-garde design with a classic mechanical movement (bearing ahaute complication, no less) is why Maximilian B\u00fcsser,founder and creative directorof theGeneva-based brand MB&F,considers it \u201cthe missing link\u201d between traditional and contemporary watchmaking.\n\u201cWhen it came out, I ran into my colleagues\u2019 office with a drawing of it and said, \u2018Have you seen this?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. B\u00fcsser, then a product manager at the Swiss watchmakerJaeger-LeCoultre. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t get it; they thought it was just weird.\u201d\nFor all its boundary-pushing greatness, the Antiqua has not, by most standards, been a commercial hit. Slightly more than 120 pieces were made, with one model, in white gold, still available \u2014 for 280,000 Swiss francs, or$281,590.\nFran\u00e7ois-Paul Journehas a cultlikefollowing that is allbut unrivaled among his horological peers. The most obvious heir to the scientific tradition of horology epitomized by watchmaking legends such asAbraham-Louis BreguetandGeorge Daniels, Mr. Journe has garnered a near-mythic reputation among high-end watch enthusiasts since founding his eponymous brand in1999, not to mention the interest ofChanel, which acquired a minority stake in the company in2018.\n\u201cIf watches are still around in 200 years, F.P. Journe will be the equivalent ofPatek Philippe,\u201d said Mr. Hallock, the Los Angeles watch dealer.\nMr. Journe solidified his reputation as a hotshot young watchmaker on the strength of his company\u2019s second production model, the Chronom\u00e8tre \u00e0 R\u00e9sonance, which he presented in2000. Generally regarded as a masterpiece of modern watchmaking, the wristwatch was inspired by a Breguet pocket watch that Mr. Journe restored for a client in 1982; it featured two balance wheels in what is called a resonance movement, an esoteric example of precision timekeeping.\n\u201cThe basic idea is by placing the two balance wheels very close to each other, they will pick up each other\u2019s energy and eventually beat in sync,\u201dBrad Schwartz, a New York-based collector of Journe watches, wrote in an email.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how beautiful the R\u00e9sonance movement is \u2014 if I could wear mine with the movement side up I would,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, who owned six at one point. \u201cAdding to the beauty are the screwed-on chapter rings, the blue steel hands, theguilloch\u00e9pattern in the center of each dial and theknurledcrown, all signature Journe accents.\u201d\nEven though most people familiar with the model say its design was secondary to its mechanical innovation \u2014 it was the first wristwatch to house the resonance movement \u2014 the truth is that the Chronom\u00e8tre \u00e0 R\u00e9sonance established Mr. Journe\u2019s singular aesthetic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a watch that, when you remove the logo from the dial, people still recognize it from across the room,\u201d Mr. Bacs said.\nWhenRichard Milleintroduced histonneau-shaped, technically advancedRM 001in 2001, the French watchmaker not only broke with watchmaking tradition, he torched it.\n\u201cThe first time I witnessed the Richard Mille RM 001 in the flesh was likeUrsula Andressrising out of the sea like Botticelli\u2019s Venus, accompanied by theK\u00e4rntnertortheater Orchestra\u2019s1824performance ofBeethoven\u2019s \u2018Ode to Joy,\u2019\u201dWei Kohwrote in a 2018 post titled\u201cThe Watch That Changed the World.\u201d\nMr. Koh, the Singapore-basedfounder and editorial directorofthe watch magazineRevolution, went on to say the timepiece\u2019s sleek shape was \u201cas erotically charged as the body ofFerrari\u2019s 250 GTO.\u201d The automotive reference was spot on. Mr. Mille \u2014 who has said he carved a bar of hotel soap into the RM 001 form one sleepless night \u2014 is a racing enthusiast who designed his first watch to both look and function like a Formula One car: Comfort, performance, shock-resistance, durability and lightness were top of mind.\nAccording to an oft-repeated story, Mr. Mille threw the RM 001 to the ground during the 2001 Baselworld watch fair to prove to prospective clients that, despite its considerable price and intricate complication \u2014 the 200,000 euro wristwatch housed a tourbillon, a delicate revolving mechanism designed to counteract the effects of gravity on the gears of a mechanical timepiece \u2014 the sporty model, equipped with titanium base plates, could withstand the abuse.\nDespite the model\u2019s game-changing construction \u2014 theRenaud & Papi movementwas integrated with the case, an unheard-of innovation at the time \u2014 the RM 001 owes its icon status to its voluptuous silhouette.\n\u201cYou can see a Richard Mille on someone\u2019s wrist across the street and it\u2019s not because it has neon lights,\u201d Mr. Hallock said.\nThe dozens of numbered RM models that have followed \u2014 including theRM 27-01 Tourbillon Rafael Nadal, which weighs only two-thirds of an ounce (strap included), and the newRM 62-01 Tourbillon Vibrating Alarm ACJ, the brand\u2019s most complicated timepiece \u2014 are testaments to Mr. Mille\u2019s vision and staying power.\nDuring most of its history, Ulysse Nardin was best known as an old-fashioned maker of nautically inspired timepieces (even after it was reinvigorated in the 1980s bythe Swiss businessman Rolf Schnyderand the watchmaking wunderkindLudwig Oechslin, who together created a trilogy of widely praised astronomical wristwatches).\nThen, during a dinner in New York in2001, Mr. Schnyder and Mr. Oechslin presented an outlandish-looking gold watch appropriately named Freak. It lacked a dial, crown and traditional hands; it indicated the time with an enormous minute hand that also doubled as the movement, and a rotating main plate that served as the hour hand.\nThe model\u2019s radical exterior obscured a movement that, for the first time, incorporated silicon, a material that has since revolutionized mechanical watchmaking by eliminating the need for lubricants like oil.\n\u201cSingle-handedly, the Freak inaugurated the era of the superwatch \u2014 mechanically sophisticated, visually arresting, unapologetically exotic,\u201dJack Forster,editor in chiefofHodinkee,wrote on the online watch sitein 2018.\nThe Freak \u201cquestioned so many things we believed were carved in stone,\u201d Mr. Bacs, the Phillips specialist, said.Like the need for a crown to set the time (with the Freak, you simply turned the bezel).\nTo fully appreciate the pioneering design \u2014 and Mr. Oechslin\u2019s reputation as what Mr. Bacs called the \u201cSwiss Leonardo da Vinci of the 20th and 21st centuries\u201d \u2014 it is important to note that the mechanical watchmaking renaissance was only about a decade old when Ulysse Nardin made its surprise introduction. Plenty of watchmakers were still reeling from the quartz crisis of the 1970s, when the Swiss industry lost60,000 jobsto competition from the Japanese.\nThose who emerged from the crisis intact were \u201cbasically mimicking what had been done before,\u201d Mr. B\u00fcsser said. \u201cA man\u2019s watch was 35 millimeters with a white dial and Roman numerals. We were all doing super boring stuff in those days.\u201d\nYou might describe the co-founders of Urwerk \u2014 the master watchmakerFelix Baumgartnerand the designer and artistMartin Frei\u2014 as the watch industry\u2019s resident philosophers.\nWhen they introduced their subversive luxury brand in1997,the name they chose was a mash-up ofUr, the Sumerian citywhere modern timekeeping began, and werk, the German word for work (also, appropriately, part of the German word Uhrwerk, or movement).\n\u201cIt was a play on words, this idea of a business that deals with the philosophical matter of time,\u201d Mr. Freitold The New York Timesin 2014.\nAt the 2003 Baselworld fair, Urwerk unveiled the UR-103, \u201cthe model that made everybody sit up and take notice,\u201d said Ms. Doerr of Quill & Pad.\nPriced at 60,000 Swiss francs, the sci-fi-looking steel watch was distinguished by its unconventional, satellite-based time display (inspired by antique clocks, no less) that appeared at the bottom of Urwerk\u2019s by-now-signature case.\n\u201cThe shape was closer to a spaceship, and the alternative time-telling via rotating discs was extremely novel,\u201dAlexandre Ghotbi,head of watches for Continental Europe and the Middle EastatPhillips, wrote in an email.\nBy placing the traveling hour indication on the bottom of the case, Mr. Frei was free to enlarge the crown and position it at the traditional 12 o\u2019clock position.\n\u201cWe have asked ourselves since the very beginning, what can we do differently?\u201dMr. Frei said in an interview.\nIn the UR-103, Urwerk answered that question by filling the back of the watch with three display fields that act as a control center: one to indicate the seconds, another to show a 15-minute revolution, and a third to communicate what remained of the watch\u2019s 42 hours of power reserve.\n\u201cTraditions are important,\u201d Mr. Frei said. \u201cBut you also have to comment about what\u2019s surrounding you now.\u201d\nWhen Mr. B\u00fcsser foundedhis independent watch brandin2005, he already was regarded as something ofamentor by many contemporary watchmakers.\nHe had earned that reputation during hisseven-year tenure asmanaging directorof Harry Winston Timepieces, where he created the groundbreaking Opus concept, a series of annual collaborations with master watchmakers \u2014 including Mr. Journe, Mr. Halter and Mr. Baumgartner \u2014 that resulted in some of the wildest, wackiest models the world had ever seen.\nMB&F\u2019s first watch,Horological Machine No. 1, or HM1, was a daring, three-dimensional design, but nothing compared with its anarchic fourth creation, theHM4 Thunderbolt, released in2010. Less a wristwatch than two miniature jet engines joined by a titanium case and strapped to a wrist, the model \u2014 which displayed the time and power reserve on dials positioned perpendicular to the wearer\u2019s wrist \u2014 was unlike anything MB&F had made before, or has made since.\nLike all of Mr. B\u00fcsser\u2019s timepieces, the titanium model was a nostalgic ode to his 1970s youth (in this case, his mania for assembling model aircraft) as well as a love letter to kinetic art, a category he champions at his four M.A.D. Gallery locations, in Geneva; Hong Kong; Taipei, Taiwan; and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cEach piece from MB&F is more of an objet d\u2019art than a design,\u201d said Mr. Rohr of TimeZone. \u201cPeople love it or hate it.\u201d\nTo hear Mr. B\u00fcsser, he was compelled to create the HM4, regardless of how many people it alienated. \u201cIt was a moment in my life when nothing else mattered,\u201d hesaid in an interview. \u201cI had no kids. My company was everything. I needed to go to the end of that story even if that meant I was going to bankrupt myself. In those days, there was so much anger in me \u2014 anger against myself, my industry. I was a fanatic. Real creative risks don\u2019t come out of being in your comfort zone.\u201d\nIf you remember only one name from the annals of watchmaking design history, make itGerald Genta. The Swiss designer spent six decades moonlighting for the 20th century\u2019s greatest makers, creating wristwatches known for their slender cases, graceful angles, sporty but elegant integrated bracelets and, as it happens, extreme commercial success.\nMr. Genta\u2019s best-known designs \u2014 the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and the Patek Philippe Nautilus \u2014 are modern-day best sellers, perennially in demand on the secondary market.\nIn 2000, the Roman jeweler Bulgari acquired Mr. Genta\u2019s namesake brand and set about placing its own spin on his towering legacy. Proof that it succeeded came in2014, when the house introduced its Octo Finissimo series of ultrathin timepieces, led by the hand-wound Octo Finissimo Tourbillon, a 5-millimeter-thick titanium watch whose round bezel and octagonal case recalled Mr. Genta\u2019s masterful use of shapes.\n\u201cPeople have tried to play with a variety of shapes \u2014 round, square, oval and rectangular \u2014 and I think the first home run since the Genta designs of the \u201970s and \u201980s is the Bulgari Octo,\u201d Mr. Bacs said.\nThe series, overseen by the Bulgari watch designerFabrizio Buonamassa Stigliani,has earned raves for its design and technical mastery as well as several world records for thinness. A single watch \u2014 a refined, automatic version of the tourbillon introduced in 2018 \u2014 actually acquired three of those: At3.95 millimeters thick, it is marketed as the world\u2019s thinnest automatic watch, world\u2019s thinnest automatic tourbillon and world\u2019s thinnest tourbillon.\n\u201cThe vintage world is exhausting because nothing new comes out of it, but Bulgari kind of did it,\u201d Mr. Rohr of TimeZone said.\nWhether the Apple Watch belongs on a list of horological design pioneers is a matter of perspective. Mechanical watchmaking purists such as Mr. Getz, the Northern California collector, are unequivocal: \u201cIt\u2019s not a watch. It\u2019s a connected device.\u201d\nYet there\u2019s no denying the model\u2019s ubiquity on wrists around the world.Neil Cybart, founder of the Apple analysis siteAbove Avalon, wrote in an email that Apple has sold 77 million watches since the model went on sale in thespring of 2015, and that 2019revenuewill total approximately $12 billion, with a growth rate of 25 percentyear over year.\n\u201cGiven how the total value of Swiss watch exports was$21 billion in 2018(up 6 percent year over year), Apple Watch is about 60 percent the size of the entire Swiss watch industry,\u201d Mr. Cybart said in an email. \u201cNo other comes close to these figures when looking at smartwatches.\u201d (There have been estimates that 2019 will be the yearApple outsells the entire Swiss watch industry by volume.)\nDesigned byJony Ive, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of design at the time, and the well-known industrial designerMarc Newson, the Apple Watch, with its rubber strap case attachmentand minimalist architecture, evoked Mr. Newson\u2019s work withIkepod, a short-lived cult-classic watch brand he co-founded in1994.\nInitially positioned as a luxury product, with an 18-karat gold version that started at $10,000, the watch now starts at a new low price of$199and is promoted as a health and fitness tool. But that hasn\u2019t lessened its influence on the high-end watch business.\n\u201cIt has provoked every watch collector to rethink what we do every day,\u201d Mr. Bacs said. \u201cThe design is brilliant. The size is brilliant. The wearability is brilliant.\u201d\nFor mechanical watchmakers, the Apple Watch\u2019s most significant legacy may be its role as a gateway to traditional watch consumerism.\n\u201cBack in 2015, 44 percent of U.S. adults wore a watch,\u201d saidReginald Brack,watches and luxury industry analystat the market research companyNPD Group. \u201cFlash-forward to 2019 and 55 percent of U.S. adults wear a watch.\u201d\nMr. Brack wouldn\u2019t cite brand names, but he attributed that growth to smartwatches."

        "title": "Facebook Encryption Eyed in Fight Against Online Child Sex Abuse",
        "fulltext": "An explosion in reports of child sexual abuse imagery on the internet is prompting the authorities to step up pressure on technology companies over their use of encryption \u2014 and Facebook, which flags by far the largest amount of the material, is drawing outsize attention.\nThe tension is part of a growing debate over privacy and policing in the digital age. Law enforcement groups have long lamented the use of encryption, a tool that protects personal data from hackers and government surveillance but also lets child predators and other criminals hide their online activities.\nThere is increasing \u201cinternational consensus, at least among law enforcement folks, that this is a serious problem,\u201d said Sujit Raman, an associate deputy attorney general in the Justice Department. \u201cAnd the companies, you know, they\u2019re just not as engaged on the issue as they really need to be.\u201d\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that Facebook Messenger, which is not encrypted, accounted for nearly two-thirds of reports last year of online child sexual abuse imagery. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said that Facebook as a whole was responsible for 90 percent of the reports.\n[ReadThe Times\u2019s investigationinto online child abuse images.]\nIn March, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced that the messaging servicewould move to encryptionin coming years, setting up a direct conflict between its business interests and the demands of law enforcement.\nJay Sullivan, Facebook\u2019s director for messaging privacy, said the company was transitioning to encryption because it was one of the fastest areas of online growth, according to prepared remarks at a conference last month at Stanford University. The company\u2019s other messaging service, WhatsApp, is already encrypted.\nJustice Department officials, including Attorney General William P. Barr, are expected to raise concerns about the change to Messenger, and about encryption overall, atan event on Fridaywith the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the national clearinghouse for child sexual abuse imagery and officials from the Australia and Britain.\n\u201cOnline child exploitation has increased dramatically in the past few years, and offenders continue to adopt more sophisticated means to entice victims and evade justice,\u201d the department said in invitations to the event.\nLaw enforcement agencies say encryption is a major obstacle in child sex abuse, terrorism and other investigations. The Justice Department has repeatedly sought ways to break encryption, but doing so would create opportunities for hackers and allow for broader surveillance. Those efforts have been strongly opposed by groups focused on internet privacy protections.\n\u201cA secure messenger should provide the same amount of privacy as you have in your living room,\u201d said Erica Portnoy, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cAnd the D.O.J. is saying it would be worth putting a camera in every living room to catch a few child predators.\u201d\nBut Mr. Raman, the associate deputy attorney general, said platforms like Facebook provided opportunities forchild predatorsthat were not readily available in the real world, creating a need for more scrutiny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique platform,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a combination of open profiles, which almost creates a menu of options if you\u2019re a child predator, and also will provide \u2014 if they implement their plans \u2014 the sort of mechanisms for drilling down and contacting children\u201d with encryption.\nCriminals have become adept at using encryption and the so-called dark web to cloak themselves, requiring greater effort by law enforcement to identify them. Even so, mainstream technology companies, like Apple, have come to embrace encryption technologies, particularly after disclosures about large-scale data collection by the National Security Agency.\n\u201cThere are really good reasons to have end-to-end encryption, but we have to acknowledge it comes with trade-offs,\u201d said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped develop technology in 2009 for detecting online child abuse imagery.\nGavin Portnoy, a spokesman for the clearinghouse of abuse material, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said officials there opposed the widespread adoption of encryption. \u201cThe rape and sexual exploitation of children that we see in millions of reports to the cyber tip line will continue to circulate online, but will be invisible to tech companies,\u201d he said.\nThe Times reported on Saturday that tech companies flagged45 million photos and videosas child sex abuse material last year. Those images were contained in 18.4 million reports, nearly 12 million of which came from Facebook Messenger. It was unclear whether photos and videos of abuse were actually more prevalent on Facebook or were just being detected at a high rate.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not picking on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Raman said. He compared the millions of reports from Messenger with those sent by Apple, which encrypts its iMessage system. Apple sent 43 reports last year and about 150 so far in 2019.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company worked closely with law enforcement and complied with all legal obligations.\nThe decision to encrypt Messenger has raised alarms other countries that rely on reports submitted by tech companies to the national clearinghouse. The center distributes the reports to the authorities both domestically and internationally.\nFernando Ruiz P\u00e9rez, head of operations for cybercrimes at Europol, said Facebook was responsible for a \u201cvery high percentage\u201d of reports to the European Union. He said that if Facebook moved to encrypt messaging, the \u201cpossibility to flag child sexual abuse content will disappear.\u201d\nTechnologists at Facebook and elsewhere have been discussing ways to limit the spread of illicit content on a system that uses encryption, but it is proving a thorny problem.\nGuy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president for integrity, said at theStanford conferencethat the company would rely on \u201csignals\u201d that could indicate the spread of abuse imagery even if Facebook was unable to see it \u2014 when users tried to distribute messages to large groups, for example.\nBut Dr. Farid, the professor who helped build the detection technology, said that would be inadequate. He suggested scanning for abuse content by making a fingerprint of an image before the message was encrypted, and then comparing the fingerprint with a database of known illegal material.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a technical barrier here,\u201d Dr. Farid said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this because they want to avoid liability.\u201d\nMultiple cryptography experts said the practice would significantly weaken the privacy benefits of end-to-end encryption on images, however.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019s O.K. to open it up to hackers or Chinese censorship,\u201d said Ms. Portnoy, the digital rights technologist. \u201cThat system right there is very similar to how Chinese browsers implement censorship.\u201d\nAlex Stamos, a Stanford professor who arranged the conference, and Facebook\u2019s former chief information security officer, acknowledged that all the proposals involved trade-offs. But he said the discussion was necessary because child sexual abuse material was \u201cby far the worst thing that happens online.\u201d\n\u201cThere are options here,\u201d Mr. Stamos said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t quite have your cake and eat it too.\u201d"

        "title": "Europe\u2019s Margrethe Vestager Takes a Rare Step Toward Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "European authorities took an even more aggressive approach than usual to regulating the technology industry Wednesday when they applied a rarely used rule, ordering a company to halt a potentially anticompetitive practice while an investigation is underway.\nTheEuropean Commission\u2019s top antitrust enforcer, Margrethe Vestager, said \u201cinterim measures\u201d were being taken against the company, the chip maker Broadcom, to ensure that its competitors were not marginalized amid an inquiry. It is the first time the regulator has used the rule in nearly two decades, signaling urgency within Europe to keep the technology market competitive.\nBroadcom, the leading maker of chips used in television set-top boxes and modems, has been accused of using exclusivity agreements to block customers from using products made by rivals. Aformal inquiry of Broadcomwas opened in June, and the European Commission is now ordering the company to stop enforcing the exclusionary termswith six manufacturers ofthe boxes and modems.\nMs. Vestager said Broadcom\u2019s competitors would lose revenue and viability if the company\u2019s actions were not halted, and that spurred her decision. \u201cThey will progressively be marginalized and may ultimately be forced to leave the market,\u201d she said.\nBroadcom said it would appeal the decision.\nBroadcom is seen as a test case for a policy that could have significant ramifications for companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google that have been targeted in Europe over anticompetitive practices.\nThe European authorities have handed out billions of dollars in antitrust penalties against technology giants, but have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to match the plans of the fast-paced industry. By the time regulators have ordered the firms to change their business practices, they have cemented a dominant market position, or the technology itself has adjusted or advanced.\nThe announcement on Wednesday highlights the growing power of Ms. Vestager, a longtime foe of the tech industry who will begin a second five-year term in December as the European Union\u2019s top antitrust regulator.\nWith many investigations taking years to complete, the decision also shows how she thinks antitrust regulation must evolve for the digital economy.\n\u201cInterim measures aim at preventing irreversible harm to competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference in Brussels. She added that they \u201callow the commission to order a company to stop conduct that we consider at first sight to be illegal.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said her office had weighed the company\u2019s right to defend itself versus a need for \u201cspeed and effectiveness in antitrust enforcement.\u201d\nOver the past five years, Ms. Vestager has become the world\u2019s best-known regulator of the technology industry. She has issued billions of dollars in fines against Google for anticompetitive practices related to the Android mobile operating system, its shopping-comparison service and online advertising. She also ordered Apple to repay roughly $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes to Ireland. The companies are appealing those judgments.\nThose tough actions led to her recent reappointment as head of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust division, and she was handed added responsibility over setting digital policy for the European Union. The widening role gives her vast authority over not just competition issues, but digital taxes and setting new rules for the use of artificial intelligence.\nBut even those who have applauded Ms. Vestager\u2019s aggressiveness in the past say the actions of the antitrust office have been too slow. As investigations drag on, they say, companies can continue misbehaving, acting in ways that block competition.\n\u201cIt is not unusual for competition investigations to draw out for several years,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Reyna, head of legal and economic affairs at the European Consumer Organization, a consumer rights group. \u201cThis risks making antitrust enforcement in the fast-paced tech sector a blunt sword.\u201dInterim measures, Mr. Reyna said, should be used \u201cto prevent that the abusive conduct of a company causes irreparable harm.\u201d\nCompanies have resisted the use of interim measures, arguing that the move amounts to reaching a verdict in a trial that is still underway.\nBroadcom said its practices and provisions were not harming competition. \u201cWe do not believe that these provisions have a meaningful effect on whether the customers choose to purchase Broadcom products,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nIn July, the European Commission announced aformalinquiry into whether Amazon was unfairly using data collected from third-party sellers that use its website and logistics network. At issue is whether Amazon is using the data from those third-party customers to promote its own products and services.\nThe Broadcom case is being watched closely as the commission looks into other big companies in the technology sector.\nThe commission is exploring aninvestigation of Facebook, a person familiar with the inquiry has said, andrivals have accused Appleof imposing unfair terms on companies that sell services through the App Store."

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When numerousstate attorneys general gathered last monthon the steps of the Supreme Court to announce an antitrust investigation into Google, one wasconspicuously absent:Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general.\nHe was also missing from a list of state attorneys general publicly signing on to ajoint antitrust investigationinto Facebook, released last week by New York.\nMr. Becerra\u2019scurious no-show from the public announcements has provided one of the more enduring questions about the scrutiny of the tech industry sweeping through Washington and state capitals. What is Mr. Becerra \u2014 whose state is home to most of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, including Google and Facebook \u2014 up to?\nHis decision to skirt the question has led toquestions about what one of the largest and most influential states is doing on the tech antitrust front. Mr. Becerra\u2019s office has more resources \u2014 money and people \u2014 than most state attorneys general, which would be needed to pursue a major legal case against one of the top tech companies.\nIt has led tocriticism from political rivals and groups calling for aggressive action against the giant tech companies, as well as attention from localnewsorganizations.Yet Mr. Becerra, who has been vocal about problems with Silicon Valley in the past, has remained fastidious about saying little about any potential investigations. He has neither confirmed nor denied that his office is examining Google, Facebook or any other tech company.\n\u201cNo one except California and the A.G.\u2019s officeknows what, if anything, we\u2019re doing with regard to either of those two or any other company in the internet space,\u201d he saidin an interview this week. He added that he was following his office\u2019s longstanding practice not to speak publicly about a possible investigation.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Becerraresponded to a questionabout California not publicly endorsing the joint investigations by asking one of his own.\n\u201cHow do you know we\u2019re not investigating?\u201d he said.\nMr. Becerra\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Lovenheim, said the office did not disclose what it was or was not investigating to protect the integrity of its work. \u201cIt\u2019s just our policy not to comment on any pending or potential investigations,\u201d she said in a statement.\nOther attorneys general offices are not offering any insight, either. Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said that her office \u201ccannot comment on whether we have or have not had a conversation with another state about any of our investigations.\u201d\nMr. Becerra, a Democrat, spent more than 20 years in the Housebefore being appointed California\u2019s attorney general and taking office in 2017.Since he left Washington, anti-tech fever has become an animating force in politics. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up Big Tech a calling card of her presidential campaign. The House Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Becerra once served, is also running its own antitrust investigation into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.\nMr. Becerra has been willing to take on the large tech companies in other contexts. His office is developing regulations around the California Consumer Privacy Act, an online privacy law that the internet industry has tried to weaken.The law gave consumers more rights over their data when the legislature passed it last year, but it is up to Mr. Becerra to propose the rules and enforce them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly technical matter; they got a lot right,\u201dsaid Ashkan Soltani, a technologist who has been involved with supporting the California law.\nHis office has also been aggressive in other antitrust matters. In addition to challenging T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint, itannounceda tentative settlement this month in an antitrust lawsuit with Sutter Health, a Northern California hospital system. Mr. Becerra has also expressed concern that consumer data was being concentrated among a small number of online platforms.\n\nOn Oct. 1, eight groups who have advocated more aggressive scrutiny of companies like Facebook and Google wrote to Mr. Becerra asking to discuss their concerns with him. Sarah Miller, the deputy director of one group, the Open Markets Institute, said they wanted \u201cto offer to share our views, to hear his views and to help brief or provide educational support.\u201d\n\u201cYour state is at the epicenter of this national conversation, giving you a unique and powerful position,\u201d the groupswrote. \u201cWe hope to build a constructive line of communication as these corporations continue to be under public and regulatory scrutiny.\u201d\nThe groups heard nothing until after Ms. Miller followed up 10 days later. Officials eventually offered to set up a phone call between the groups and some of Mr. Becerra\u2019s senior aides.\nMs. Millersaid that theissue was whether Mr. Becerra would \u201chave political courage and join, even symbolically, these investigations that are looking into whether these companies are monopolies that our public institutions should be addressing.\u201d\nAsked generally about his contact with critics, Mr. Becerra saidthis weekthat his office was \u201cin conversation with both competitors and critics of some of the industry in the tech field\u201d on an \u201congoing basis.\u201d\nRepublican state lawmakers in California have also attacked Mr. Becerra over his public absence from the investigations, saying the state should have a voice in the investigative process.\nFour of them have introduced a resolution, which has yet to attract any Democrats, calling on the attorney general to \u201cwork closely with other state attorneys general to determine legal actions the State of California and other states may take to curb the monopolistic powers of giant technology companies.\u201d\nWhen it comes to talking about investigating those platforms, however, Mr. Becerra insists his hands are tied.\n\u201cIt puts me in a predicament,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike when I was a member of Congress and I could pretty much say whatever I wanted, I\u2019m in a different position now.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Removes App That Helps Hong Kong Protesters Track the Police",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple removed an app late Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track the police, a day afterfacing intense criticism from Chinese state mediafor it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the complicated politics of a country that is fundamental to its business.\nApple said it was withdrawing the app, HKmap.live, from its App Store just days after approving it because the authorities in Hong Kong said protesters were using it to attack the police in the semiautonomous city.\nA day earlier, People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial accusing Apple of aiding \u201crioters\u201d in Hong Kong. \u201cLetting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings,\u201dsaid the article, which was written under a pseudonym that translates into \u201cCalming the Waves.\u201d\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an email to employees on Thursday that the company had removed the app after receiving \u201ccredible information\u201d from the authorities and people in Hong Kong \u201cthat the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d As a result, he said, the app violated Apple rules and local laws.\n\u201cNational and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,\u201d he said in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times. \u201cIn this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d\nWith its reversal, Apple joined a growing list of corporations that are trying to navigate the fraught political situation between China and Hong Kong, where antigovernment protests have unfolded for months.\nThat minefield was evident this week when anexecutive of the N.B.A.\u2019s Houston Rocketstweetedhis support of the Hong Kong protests. The tweet prompted a backlash from the Chinese authorities, leading to apologies by the Rockets and ultimately the cancellation of broadcasts of N.B.A. exhibition games in China, one of the N.B.A.\u2019s largest markets.\nCompaniesranging from Marriott to United Airlines to Versacehave also backtracked on perceived slights to the Chinese government in the past, such as customer surveys that suggested Taiwan was an independent nation. All the firms are balancing the enormous economic opportunity in China, with its 1.4 billion consumers, with the negative public image of capitulating to an authoritarian government.\n[Here\u2019s how Hong Kong\u2019s protests have evolvedinto a broader pushback against Beijing.]\nNo multinational company arguably has as much at stake in China as Apple, which assembles nearly all its products there and counts the country as its No. 3 market after the United States and Europe. It tallied nearly $44 billion in sales in the greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, in the year that ended June 30. Apple\u2019s stock price often rises or falls depending on how it is performing in China.\nMr. Cook has become a deft diplomat in China. He has traveled there frequently and attended numerous Chinese government events. In recent months, he has argued for moderation in the trade war between the United States and China. While Mr. Cook regularly speaks out on political issues in the United States like gun control and immigration, he has largely remained silent on Chinese politics, including the clashes in Hong Kong.\nIn late 2017, Mr. Cook said at a conference that while he disagreed with some Chinese policies, Apple must comply with local laws.\n\u201cEach country in the world decides their laws and their regulations, and so your choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?\u201d he said. \u201cYou get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.\u201d\nMaya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Apple\u2019s decision to remove the Hong Kong app would embolden the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cI think the party concludes from this that intimidation, harassment and pressure work for most people, in most places,\u201d she said.\nA Twitter account that claimed to be run by the developer of HKmap.live said in a message on Wednesday that Apple\u2019s reasoning for the app\u2019s removal \u2014 that protesters were using it to attack the police \u2014 was false.\n\u201cThat is ridiculous,\u201d said the person running the account, who declined to provide a name. The person shareda message that Apple sent explaining the removal. In the notice, the company cited App Store policies that apps must comply with local laws and must not \u201csolicit, promote or encourage criminal activity or clearly reckless behavior.\u201d The note was signed: \u201cApp Store Review.\u201d\nSupporters of the app have argued that it helps Hong Kong residents avoid clashes between the police and protesters. The app \u201cis used by passer-by, protesters, journalist, tourist and even pro-government supporters,\u201d the HKmap.live Twitter account later tweeted, calling the removal \u201cclearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right.\u201d\nThe Twitter account said Google had not removed the app from the marketplace for Android devices. The account said the iPhone app had been downloaded more than 100,000 times and the Android app more than 50,000 times.\nThe app shows a map of Hong Kong with updates from users on the location of the police, their water cannons and safe zones, among other things. Apple initially rejected the app for enabling people to evade the police, the app\u2019s Twitter account said last week. Several days later, the account tweeted that Apple had reversed course. It soon became the top free app in Hong Kong, according to the app-data firm Sensor Tower, and criticism from mainland China began.\nAfter the People\u2019s Daily editorial, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that\u201canyone with a conscience and a sense of justice\u201dshould boycott the app.\nCharles Mok, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong, said on Thursday that he hadsent a letter to Mr. Cooksaying HKmap.live helped people avoid the protests.\n\u201cWe Hong Kongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression,\u201d he wrote.\nIn the United States, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri,tweetedthat Apple had told him that its initial rejection of the app was a mistake. \u201cLooks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?\u201d\nApple has made other moves that appeared to appease the Chinese government. It recently removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from iPhone keyboards in certain areas, including Hong Kong.\nOn Sept. 30, Apple pulled the app of the news organization Quartz from the App Store in China, Quartz said. The news organization, which has covered the Hong Kong protests, said Apple had sent it a vague notice about removing its app \u201cbecause it includes content that is illegal in China.\u201d\nZach Seward,Quartz\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement, \u201cWe abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world,\u201d andincluded a link to its articlesabout software designed to dodge censorship.\nApple declined to comment on the Quartz app on Wednesday and did not respond to a request regarding the Taiwanese flag emoji.\nApple has removed other apps in China that it allows elsewhere, includingThe New York Times appand some services thatenabled Chinese users to circumventthe government\u2019s internet restrictions.\nApple has long prided itself on how every app in its App Store is approved by one of its employees, unlike Google\u2019s largely automated approach for Android apps. Apps that pose tricky policy questions are deliberated during weekly meetings of senior executives, led by Phil Schiller, an executive who heads the App Store. That group decided to remove the HKmap.live app, said a person familiar with the decision who declined to be named because the process was confidential.\nSeparately, Google this week removed a mobile game, The Revolution of Our Times I, which allowed users to play as Hong Kong protesters. Google said it had pulled the app from the Android app store worldwide because it violated its policy that bars \u201cdevelopers from capitalizing on sensitive events.\u201d\nThe developer, who declined to be named, said in an email that he or she donated 80 percent of the app\u2019s revenues to a group supporting the Hong Kong protests.\nA Google spokesman said the company had decided to remove it during regular reviews of Android apps. He said Google hadn\u2019t heard from the Chinese government or the Hong Kong police about it."
