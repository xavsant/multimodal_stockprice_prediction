        "title": "U.S. Imposes Sanctions on 11 Chinese Companies Over Human Rights",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday barred 11 new Chinese companies from purchasing American technology and products without a special license, saying the firms were complicit in human rights violations inChina\u2019s campaign targeting Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region.\nThe list of sanctioned companies includes current and former suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren, Google, HP, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Muji, according toa reportby the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank established by the Australian government. The group cited the websites of thesanctioned Chinesecompanies, which mentioned their financial relationships with major American brands.\nThe administration\u2019s announcement could precipitate more efforts by prominent clothing and technology brands to sever ties with opaque supply chains that touch on Xinjiang, a major source of cotton, textiles, petrochemicals and other goods that feed into Chinese factories.\nHuman rights groups and journalists have documented acampaign of mass detentionscarried out by the Chinese government in Xinjiang, in which one million or more members of Muslim and other minority groups have been placed into large internment camps intended to increase their loyalty to the Communist Party. Some of these detainees areforced to work in factoriesin or near the camps, often processing Xinjiang\u2019s abundant cotton crop into various textiles that may then be funneled into international supply chains.\nATimes video investigationidentified Chinese companies using a contentious labor program for Muslim Uighurs to satisfy demand for face masks and other personal protective equipment, some of which ended up in the United States and other countries.\nNine of the companies that the Trump administration cited on Monday, including Changji Esquel Textile Co. Ltd., Nanchang O-Film Tech and Hetian Taida Apparel Co. Ltd., were added to the so-called entity list for their use of forced labor, the Commerce Department said. Two other companies, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI, were added for conducting genetic analyses that were used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, according to theannouncement.\nThe blacklist only prevents U.S. companies from selling components or technologies to Chinese companies without a license, not from purchasing products. In practice, however, major international brands are unlikely to continue doing business with any firm named on a government list for forced labor or other abuses in Xinjiang.\n\u201cBeijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement. \u201cThis action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations.\u201d\nThe move comes amidrising tensionsbetween the United States and China, and less than two weeks after the administrationimposed sanctionson multiple Chinese officials for aiding in human rights abuses.\nMr. Trump held off on sanctions over China\u2019s treatment of its Uighur minority for much of 2018 and 2019in the interest of closing a trade dealwith China, which hesigned in January. Since then, the Trump administration has become more critical of China, blaming it for not doing enough to contain the coronavirus andrebuking a new security lawthat increases Beijing\u2019s control over Hong Kong.\nThe announcement on Monday is the latest step in the administration\u2019s campaign to bar Chinese companies from buying products from American companies. The United States had previously placed 37 companies on its entity list for violations related to Xinjiang. The Trump administration has also sanctioned a variety of Chinese technology companies, includingHuawei, for national security threats.\nOne of the companies sanctioned on Monday, Nanchang O-Film Tech, has said that it manufactured selfie cameras for some models of the iPhone, as well as other camera and touch screen components for Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung.\nIn December 2017, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, visited O-Film\u2019s Guangzhou factory, posting a picture of himself on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, according to the report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\u201cGetting a closer look at the remarkable, precision work that goes into manufacturing the selfie cameras for iPhone 8 and iPhone X at O-Film,\u201d the post read. According to a O-Film news release that has since been deleted, Mr. Cook praised the company\u2019s \u201chuman approach towards employees\u201d and said the workers seemed to be living \u201chappily,\u201d according to the ASPI report.\nBefore that visit, 700 Uighurs were transferred from Xinjiang to work at an O-Film factory in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, a move that was expected to \u201cgradually alter their ideology\u201d and increase their \u201cgratitude toward the Party and contribute to stability,\u201d the ASPI report said, citing a Xinjiang newspaper.\nIt remains unclear whether the government in Xinjiang ultimately supplied more workers to O-Film. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. O-Film could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAnother company on the list, Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co, has said on its website that its cooperative partners include Google, HP, Haier, iFlytek and Lenovo. Another listed company, Changji Esquel Textile Co. Ltd, also appears to have ties to major international brands, working with Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Muji, according to the Chinese company\u2019s website.\nPVH, which owns the Tommy Hilfiger brand, Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss and a representative for Muji in the United States, where the brand is restructuring, did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.\nThe Wall Street Journal reportedin May 2019 that Esquel had set up three spinning mills in Xinjiang, and that the company had taken in at least 34 Uighur workers offered by Chinese officials. In astatementthis April, Esquel denied that it had ever used forced labor and called the statements \u201ccompletely false and deeply upsetting.\u201d\nIn a letter to Mr. Ross on Monday, Esquel again said it did not and would never use forced labor, and asked to be removed from the list.\n\u201cWhere is the evidence that Esquel has ever, in its 25 years of operations in Xinjiang, used forced labor?\u201d wrote John Cheh, the chief executive of Esquel Group. \u201cNo agency of any government nor any nongovernmental organization has presented such evidence, because it does not exist. In the lead up to including our Changji mill on the entity list, no one from the Commerce Department spoke with anyone at Esquel or we would have gladly provided them with the facts and answered any questions at that time.\u201d\nThe companies on the entity list also include KTK Group, which supplies components for high-speed trains, and Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co. Ltd. On July 1, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized a shipment of 13 tons of hair products manufactured by Lop County Meixin Hair Product Co. Ltd. that it suspected were made with human hair originating in Xinjiang."

        "title": "The Last Days of the Tech Emperors?",
        "fulltext": "On Wednesday, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, opened a half-virtual hearing on \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power\u201d with a combative opening statement: \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d\nThat set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to theG.D.P. of Japan.\nGiven the history of Silicon Valley\u2019s relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members\u2019 questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think.\nDespite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants.\nIn the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executivesgotCapitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as \u201cAtari Democrats.\u201d Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition.\nThe bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as Bill Clinton and Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early internet-era policymaking. Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House,talked up cyberspaceand formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers. His party\u2019s leaders convened \u201chigh-tech summits\u201d on Capitol Hill.\nThe lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy internet companies could regulate themselves.\nWashington\u2019s embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry\u2019s wealth and power. A 2013Senate hearingto interrogate Mr. Cook about Apple\u2019s tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company\u2019s innovative products. Mr. Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise.\n\u201cGoogle is still the story of the American dream,\u201ddeclaredRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee\u2019s chairman at the time.\nThose days seemed a dim memory Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyze significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings inthe summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety.\nThe evening network news programs showed Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expos\u00e9 of the industry, \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed.\u201d\nThis combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seatbelts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers.\nWednesday felt like Big Tech\u2019s Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to this week\u2019s hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech\u2019s practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech\u2019s power.\nThere are of course many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.\n\u201cIt appears to me,\u201d Mr. Bezos observed, \u201cthat social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful for a democracy.\u201d (Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.)\nLarge tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learned a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.\nAlthough the trial didn\u2019t end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the yearslong policy scrutiny now facing its peers.\nThen there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments \u2014 carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s \u2014 the problems posed byunregulated bignesswere clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.\nTech\u2019s consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm. We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains.\nBut we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click \u201cbuy\u201d on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative.\nWhat happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But this week marks the end of Washington\u2019s great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies\u2019 bigness possible in the first place.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

What more is needed from the business community to produce lasting change? Join us on Thursday, Aug. 6 at 11 a.m. Eastern to find out.R.S.V.P. here. (Want this delivered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a busy week, and I\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d Sundar Pichai told investors, as he presented Alphabet\u2019s latest earnings. The day after he and his counterparts at Amazon, Apple and Facebook faced afive-hour congressional grilling, the tech giants all unveiled better-than-expected profits \u2014 much, much better than expected.\nCombined, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook earned more than $28 billion.In after-hours trading, the companiesadded $250 billionto their market caps, according to Bloomberg, pushing the total value of the firms above $5 trillion, or about a fifth of the entire S&P 500.\nTalk about good timing.Focusing onthe bumper haulwas a relief for the executives, who were on the defensive in front of lawmakers. It was also probably better to unveil such gaudy numbersafteranswering pointed questions about theiroutsize powerand the potential for abuse of their dominant positions. The earnings awkwardly followed a series of grim economic statistics released earlier in the day \u2014 more on that below \u2014 showing a steep drop in U.S. economic output and millions of workers struggling to find jobs.\n\u2022Alphabetreported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, hurt by a slowdown in advertising, but its $7 billion profit comfortably beat analyst forecasts. Mr. Pichai was the most forthcoming with investors about the regulatory scrutiny that Big Tech faces. \u201cWe realize, at our scale, that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\u2022Amazonhad warned investors to expect profits to be wiped out by $4 billion in coronavirus-related costs. Although the firm spent as much as promised, sales grew so fast that it turned a $5 billion profit for the second quarter, double the result of the year before. Its second-quarter sales of $89 billion were $8 billion more than analysts expected.\n\u2022Facebookreported that profits doubled, to $5 billion, as its monthly active users rose by 12 percent, to 2.7 billion. A boycott by big advertisers could hurt its bottom line, the company warned, but it said that sales so far are holding up in the current quarter.\n\u2022Applesaid that its profit rose by 12 percent, to more than $11 billion. Its service business performed particularly well, including sales from the App Store, a particular focus of antitrust interest. The congressional committee investigating the tech giants released a trove of internal emails this week, includingsome from the Apple co-founder Steve Jobsdating to the early 2010s about how to prevent Apple users from buying e-books via Amazon\u2019s apps.\nTo finish, a quiz:What do the annual G.D.P. of Qatar, market cap of Cisco Systems and Apple\u2019s second-quarter cash balance all have in common? They\u2019re all around $195 billion.\nPresident Trump stokes outrage by suggesting a delay to the election.On Twitter, he questioned whether the elections on Nov. 3 should proceed as planned,drawing condemnationeven from allies in Congress. Here\u2019s whyhe has no powerto make that happen.\nVaccine makers race to build supply lines.Drug companies face pressure not just to test their coronavirus vaccines quickly, but also toproduce them in huge quantities. Separately, Gilead said it hopes to produce enough remdesivir, its Covid-19 treatment, to meet global demandby October.\nCorporate America can\u2019t quit buybacks.While share repurchases are expected to drop this year, S&P 500 companies arestill buying back sharesin the second quarter, in some cases more than in the first, The Financial Times reports.\nBasketball is back.The N.B.A.resumed its seasonyesterday from its bubble at Walt Disney World with a pair of nail-biters. (And all the players, coaches and refereestook a knee during the national anthems.) The question now is whether the league\u2019s quarantined approach will spare it the problems bedeviling Major League Baseball, asmore games were postponedafter team employees tested positive for the coronavirus.\nSpaceX faces its next test.The two astronauts who traveled to the International Space Station on the company\u2019s rocket arescheduled to return to Earththis weekend. (Assuming Tropical Storm Isaias doesn\u2019t force a postponement.) Elon Musk has said that the Crew Dragon\u2019s re-entry into the atmosphere is his biggest concern. You can watch the journey livevia NASA.\nThe U.S. economy recorded one itsmost severe declines in historyin the second quarter, as the pandemic erased years of growth with terrifying speed. Outputfell by nearly 10 percentin the three months to June; during the 2008 recession, G.D.P. fell by \u201conly\u201d 4 percent over an 18-month span.\nIt could be worse.Aggressive stimulus programs have cushioned the blow, as reflected in this extraordinary chart showing how programs like extra unemployment insurance and payroll support have bolstered incomes during the downturn, breaking the usual relationship between income and economic output.\nIt might get worse.U.S. lawmakers havebeen unable to agreeon an extension to supplemental unemployment benefits, which expire today. More than a million people have submitted new jobless claims for 19 consecutive weeks, with signs that the recovery in the labor market is stalling as coronavirus cases rise. Without extra stimulus,economists warn, the shock of the pandemic could do permanent damage to the economy. In other words, the blue line in the chart will follow the red one downwards, feeding an economic spiral.\nIt\u2019s not any better in Europe, which today reported itsworst economic contraction on record, with eurozone G.D.P. shrinking by around 12 percent in the second quarter.\n\ud83c\udf7a \u201cTo put a finer point in the level of demand we\u2019re seeing, we eclipsed July 4 week shipment days in the United States four times already this year.

The Times foreign affairs columnist Tom Friedman joined us for a DealBook Debrief call with readers to make sense of it all. (Here\u2019s the recording, if you missed it.) Some highlights:\n\u2022 \u201cI think he\u2019s out for regime change.\u201d\nPresident Trump has broken countless norms of political life, both at home and abroad, in ways that Tom said worried him greatly. One area of particular concern is China policy, where Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line approach is both too headstrong and counterproductive. Of Beijing\u2019s leaders, Tom said, \u201cthey know as long as Trump is president, he can never galvanize the global coalition\u201d against them.\n\u2022 \u201cWe are going to see innovation on steroids.\u201d\nNot all of the upheaval of recent months has been bad. While acknowledging the toll of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods, Tom said that changes brought about in response to the coronavirus have set us up for \u201cone of the most massive, amazing, creative and destructive periods of human history.\u201d Innovative thinking, aided by advanced and cheap technology, could bring major changes to how we live and work.\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s flatter than ever.\u201d\nHas the pandemic wiped out the idea of globalization? Tom \u2014 whose book \u201cThe World Is Flat\u201d examined the increasing interconnectedness of the 21st century \u2014 doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIt\u2019s flatter than ever because when it comes to globalization, I am a technological determinist,\u201d he said, pointing to the ubiquity of smartphones. \u201cTechnology is not just interconnecting the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s actually making the world interdependent.\u201d\nOne thing that the pandemic has imposed on many businesses is friction. From sourcing supplies to serving customers, everything has become harder, for public health-related reasons. Perhaps, then, it\u2019s not the best time to publish a book titled \u201cFrictionless: Why the Future of Everything Will Be Fast, Fluid, and Made Just for You.\u201d\nThe co-authors, Christiane Lemieux and Duff McDonald, are undeterred. Ms. Lemieux is a designer, entrepreneur and former creative director of Wayfair; Mr. McDonald is familiar to DealBook readers as the author of books aboutJamie Dimon,McKinseyandHarvard Business School. So what can a book with case studies about \u201ccompanies that thrive in the world of frictionless commerce\u201d reveal about the friction-filled time we now live in? We asked, and they answered:\nWhen Covid-19 hit, the concept of frictionlessness was battled-tested in the biggest possible way. Everyone was at home. Could that website handle the increased traffic? Was it able to adjust to a disrupted supply chain? Could it communicate with customers worried about getting crucial items like toilet paper or food? The companies that have been up to the task already understood the centrality of the concept before this national nightmare began.\nWhy? Because those companies were ready for Covid-19, even if no one could have predicted it. They were already in the flow, making all the right and thoughtful moves. They were institutionalizing the concept of community. They were building diverse \u2014 and dispersed \u2014 workforces. They made respect for each other a condition of employment, not an afterthought.\nDeals\n\u2022 Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund withdrew a $400 million takeover bid for the English soccer club Newcastle United.

        "fulltext": "There is a lot of chatter about David Solomon\u2019s D.J. gig at a packed Hamptons concert over the weekend, where a seeming lack of social distancing has led to an investigation by the New York health authorities. For the Goldman Sachs chief, eyebrows are being raised about his judgment, along with a healthy dose of schadenfreude. More below. (Want this delivered to your inbox each morning?Sign up here.)\nFour tech moguls are scheduled to testify before Congress tomorrow to defend their companies against accusations of monopolistic behavior. They will be spending today doing intense prep with advisers, because they have a tough task ahead.\nExpect lawmakers to hammer the four C.E.O.s\u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 over whether their companies are stifling rivals and harming consumers. (\u201cIt has the feeling of tech\u2019s Big Tobacco moment,\u201d a former F.C.C. adviser,told The Times.) The virtual hearing, to be held by the House\u2019s judiciary antitrust subcommittee, could provide fodder for various investigations into the companies.\n\u2022 Mr. Bezos could bein for a rough ride. The Amazon chief, whohasn\u2019t testified before Congressbefore, had been hoping to avoid the political fray that his counterparts have been dragged into before. Instead, his company has drawn criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike over a variety of issues, from its competitive practices to its treatment of warehouse workers.\nThe C.E.O.s may wrap themselves in the flag as a defense.Bloomberg reports that Mr. Zuckerberg, for instance, isplanning to portray Facebook as an American success story under threat from another Washington bugbear: Chinese tech companies like TikTok. The tech giants have also been lobbying lawmakers and preparing favorable studies that rebut claims of anticompetitive practices.\nSome observers think the tech moguls already have the upper hand.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at N.Y.U. who often criticizes Silicon Valley, writes that letting all four C.E.O.s testify at the same timeprevents deep scrutinyof any one of them. \u201cBig tech has won before the hearing starts,\u201d Professor Galloway writes.\n\u2022 That said, he offers some detailed questions for the committee to ask. A sample query for Mr. Bezos: \u201cIf your firm can accrete the value of the largest firm in the world in five weeks, and money is power, then isn\u2019t your firm the most powerful private entity in history?\u201d\n____________________________\n\ud83d\udcdeJoin us on Thursday for our DealBook Debrief call with Tom Friedman, The Times Opinion columnist, on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Place in a Pandemic World.\u201dRegister here for the call, which starts at 11 a.m. Eastern.\n____________________________\nRepublicans unveiled their coronavirus aid package.The $1 trillion bill wouldcut extra unemployment benefitsto $200 per week from $600, as G.O.P. lawmakers contend that the current amount discourages Americans from returning to work. Democrats are poised to reject any benefits cut. (A reminder: The enhanced jobless benefits officially expire on Friday, though some states\u2019 programs have already lapsed.)\nMalaysia\u2019s former prime minister was found guilty of corruption.Najib Razak \u2014 who remains a member of Parliament \u2014had been chargedin connection with the disappearance of $4.5 billion from the 1MDB government fund he once controlled. Goldman Sachs has agreed to a $3.9 billion settlement over its role in the scandal.\nSenator Susan Collins plans to vote no on Judy Shelton\u2019s nomination to the Fed.Ms. Collins, a Republican from Maine who faces a tough re-election fight,said she cannot support Ms. Sheltonbecause of the nominee\u2019s comments questioning the need for an independent central bank.

Nearly 200 blue-chip companieswithdrew their usual earnings forecastslast quarter. In the past two weeks, 10 companies that withdrew or didn\u2019t provide an earnings forecast in the first quarter reinstated guidance after the second.\n\u2022 One of these is the personal care company Kimberly-Clark, which said: \u201cThe duration and impact of Covid-19 on our business remains unclear, and there continues to be uncertainty in the environment. However, our visibility is improving, and we\u2019re restoring forward-looking guidance for 2020.\u201d Others saying similar things include Intel, Philip Morris International and Walgreens.\nThe companies that are giving guidance are more bullish than before.More firms are maintaining or upgrading their full-year forecasts than downgrading them.

M.L.B. had considered a similar quarantined approach, but abandoned it as parts of the country appeared to be recovering and players opposed the stricter proposal.\nIt shows the fragility of restarting pro sports leagues.A team might be hit by only a few infections, but \u201cthe sense was things still would be manageable,\u201d Thomas Boswell of The Washington Postwrites.

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Backlash Is Just Starting",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nWednesday\u2019sfive-plus-hour congressional probingof the bosses of America\u2019s tech giants did not reveal a singular \u201cgotcha\u201d moment or smoking gun email. We\u2019ve heard many of these examples of Big Tech abuse before.\nBut the power of this hearing and others like it was the cumulative repetition of tales of abusive behavior, and evidence of the harm this has had on people\u2019s lives.\nThe spectacle also showed that the impact of congressional investigations is the digging that happens when the C-SPAN cameras are turned off.\nWorries about America\u2019s tech stars have swirled for years. It\u2019s clear now that this isn\u2019t going away. In world capitals, courtrooms and among the public, we are wrestling with what it means for tech giants to have enormous influence on our lives, elections, economy and minds.\nAnd while what happens to the future of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook is anyone\u2019s guess, it was clear from Wednesday\u2019s hearing that Congress was pointing the way for other branches of government to pick up the digging from here.\nWe saw on Wednesday oldemailsandtextsfrom Mark Zuckerberg, worried about Facebooklosing ground to Instagramand suggesting that buying competing apps is an effective way to take out the competition. The big deal here: Trying to reduce competition by purchasing a rival is a violation of antitrust law. (Zuckerberg said that Instagram\u2019s success wasn\u2019t assured when Facebook bought it.)\nRepresentatives said that their interviews with former Amazon employees backed upnews reportsthat the company used private data from its merchants to make its own version of their products.\nThe subcommittee discussed their conversations with companies that claimed Google funneled web searches to services it owned rather than to rivals like Yelp. Through company documents and questioning, members of Congress picked apart Apple\u2019s stance that it treats all app developers the same.\nMy colleague Kevin Roosewrotethat the tech bosses seemed to be \u201ctaken off guard by the rigor and depth of the questions they faced.\u201d\nTheDepartment of Justiceand the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating whether these companies abuse their power, and I bet they watched closely. The U.S. government\u2019santitrust case against Microsoftmore than 20 years ago was built, in part, on the emails of Bill Gates and other Microsoft executives discussing how they planned to kill upstart competitors.\nHere\u2019s one more sign that the backlash against Big Tech has only just begun: The shouty tech critics in Congress and the tech bosses all seemed to agree that these four companies have a meaningful impact on many people\u2019s lives.\nThe tech bosses focused on the good that comes from their companies\u2019 size, reach and influence. A New York bakery finds customers by buying advertisements on Google. Merchants can thrive by selling their products or apps on Amazon or Apple.\nThe representatives pointed out examples of the dark side of Big Tech\u2019s size, reach and influence. In the pin drop moment of the hearing, a House member played an audio recording of a book seller saying her family was struggling because of a change Amazon apparently made that dried up her sales there.\nThe subcommittee chairman said these tech powers can pick the winners and the losers. That might be stretching it. But both sides demonstrated that these four companies have a profound say in who wins or loses.\nLawmakers of all political stripes seemed uncomfortable with the knowledge that four companies have this much influence. Beyond the legal antitrust questions at issue, it\u2019s this feeling of discomfort that makes it hard to imagine that nothing will change for these tech superpowers.\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was really two hearings. The Democrats mostly asked the four tech chief executives about ways their companies wielded their power and influence. Republican memberslargely askedabout persistent concerns that Google and Facebook in particular censor right-leaning viewpoints or treat conservative figures unfairly.\nSome Republican politicians\u2019 complaints about political bias aren\u2019t backed by credible evidence. Regardless, suspicion of bias is a thorny problem for these companies.\nIn a 2018 Pew Researchsurvey, Americans who described themselves as Republicans or Republican-leaning overwhelmingly said that they believed that tech companies censor online information for partisan reasons. (A smaller, but still majority, share of Democrats said that they believed this, too.) Since then, polling has shown a growing mistrust of tech companies, particularly among conservatives.\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt the tech companies\u2019 businesses. In fact, some Republican members on Wednesday argued that even though people don\u2019t trust Big Tech, they have no choice but to continue using these services because these companies have so much influence. It was an effective way to connect bias concerns to investigations into tech company market power. (Yes, Isaidearlier this week not to pay attention to bias claims. But maybe pay attention a little?)\nEven if allegations of bias don\u2019t cause the companies to lose customers, the loss of faith among a large share of Americans should worry them.\nIt\u2019s also a problem if the tech companies overcorrect. Facebook employees and critics have said fears of being accused of bias have made the company reluctant to crack down on people, including President Trump, who spread dangerous or inflammatory messages online. It\u2019s a fine line to walk.\nThe really important stuff from the Big Tech hearing: House plants and bookshelves.My colleague Mike Isaacrated the tech bosses\u2019 choices of backgroundsfor their webcast testimony. Mike gave Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who sat in front of wooden shelves with a sprinkling of books and tchotchkes, a score of 8 out of 10 for his \u201ccool Pacific Northwest dad office vibes.\u201d\nExample infinity of technology as a flawed virus surveillance:A Wall Street Journal technology columnist reviewed smart watches, internet-connected thermometers and other gizmos that say our heart rate readings or other bodily data can provideearly warnings of coronavirus infections.

        "fulltext": "They didn\u2019t look like titans. They didn\u2019t look like masters of the universe. They didn\u2019t look like \u201cemperors of the online economy,\u201d as Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee and Democrat from Rhode Island, called them. Nor did they look like \u201ccyber barons,\u201d as RepresentativeJamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said.\n\u201cThey\u201d \u2014 the four chief executives of Big Tech: Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Tim Cook of Apple; and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, all witnesses in a congressional hearing on their market dominance \u2014 didn\u2019t even look all that big.\nIn fact, beamed in from their offices on the West Coast because of concerns about the coronavirus, facing down the mask-clad members of Congress who were socially distanced from one another on the wood-paneled stage of the hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building, the four men looked more like four guys dressed up in their first graduation suits \u2014 serious, sincere, a little uncomfortable \u2014 than the four horsemen of the digital apocalypse whose planetary power was a threat to one and all.\nWhich was the point, of course. Mr. Bezos and co. were wearing costumes donned with purpose. They knew they were going to be looked at and judged, not just by the men and women in the room, but also by the viewing public. The hearing had been billed as potentially as significant as the Big Tobacco hearings that changed the cigarette industry. There was a lot at stake.\nAnd though the whole idea of having to testify via video rather than in person seemed at first to be a disadvantage, it may have worked in their favor, serving to shrink their presence to human size and allowing them all sorts of opportunities for scene setting and character building.\nSo Mr. Zuckerberg, framed against a white background that resembled barn siding, didn\u2019t wear hissignature Brunello Cucinelli gray T-shirtand black hoodie, but rather a blue suit and a blue-and-white checked tie that was slightly askew, as if he had stuck one finger inside so he could take a deep breath.\nMr. Cook, most often a model ofnormcore fashion choices, opted for a dark gray suit and a light gray tie \u2014 the same gray as his glasses frames \u2014 the knot listing just to one side. A long Zen planter\u2019s worth of verdant greenery was arrayed behind him; beside him was a sustaining mug of tea.\nMr. Pichai, whose styleBuzzFeedonce described as \u201cBanana Republic dad,\u201d also appeared in a subtly patterned gray tie, though his echoed the patterned artwork on the wall behind him and perfectly matched his gray suit.\nWhich matched his hair and beard, which matched the gray pottery on the cabinet behind him, out of which bloomed a healthily lush green plant, one part of an artistic and minimal still life. He sat mostly with his hands clasped on the desk in front of him, radiating a sort of beneficent calm.\nAnd Mr. Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, eschewed his newly favoredleather jackets, open-necked shirts and buff-body tailoring for a simple dark suit and tie, which stood out against his homey light wood shelving, scattered with vases, a few select books and other decorative objects, while he sustained himself with occasional snacks kept just offscreen.\nSnacks! So what if he\u2019s the richest man in the world. He\u2019s really just like you and me.\nNot for Mr. Bezos or his compatriots the overblown tie knots of the European business moguls or the brassiness of the double-breasted; not for them the look-at-me power red of the president. Not for them the perfectly made-to-measure style, where not a single wrinkle mars the glossy expanse of fabric, which practically sings, \u201cmoney is no object.\u201d\nNot for them, even, the flourishes of a pocket hankie or a lapel pin. The reference was, if anything, the men in the gray flannel suits of yore.\nThat they wore such suits at all was a nod to the mores of Washington, because in their natural environment, denizens of the digital world often see the garments as sartorial shackles that reflect old ways of thinking. But these witnesses\u2019 outfits, in their straightforward styling, both separated the chief executives from their traditional camouflage, thus making them seem less subversively Other, and conveyed respect for the office before which the men were appearing.\nAll of the committee members wore conservative suits or jackets too, save Greg Steube, the Republican congressman of Florida, who modeled many shades of grape, and Jim Jordan, the Republican congressman from Ohio, who has made appearing in shirt sleeves a trademark. The better,he has said, to feel ready to rumble.\nIndeed, judging by his undone cuffs, already turned back and poised to be rolled up, as well as his combative language (and tendency to keep forgetting to put his mask on), he was really ready this time. Though his opponents, sitting quietly in their on-screen version of \u201cHollywood Squares,\u201d the Capitol version, seemed to be playing a different part.\nAfter all, if you are trying to convince a group of lawmakers that the words they keep using to describe you \u2014 \u201cdominant,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d \u201cbillions,\u201d \u201ctrillions\u201d \u2014 are not nearly the whole story, you don\u2019t want to just tell the story of how you are the embodiment of the American success story; of your humble beginnings and crazy dreams. You don\u2019t want to just give voice to your concern for customers and users and small businesses. You want to channel Clark Kent of Smallville, rather than Superman.\nWell, they wouldn\u2019t look very good in tights, anyway."

        "title": "Business Leaders Urge Trump to Leave DACA Alone After Court Ruling",
        "fulltext": "A group of prominent business leaders urged President Trump on Saturday to leave in place a program affecting roughly 800,000 young immigrants who are shielded from deportation, saying it would disrupt the economy and impact the battle against the coronavirus.\nThe letter, from members of the Coalition for the American Dream, an alliance of business and industry leaders, comes after the Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration improperly wound down the Obama-era program known asDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a finding that was made on procedural grounds. The signers of the letter included executives with Amazon, General Motors, Hilton Worldwide, Target, Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and almost every sector of the manufacturing industry.\n\u201cAs large American employers and employer organizations, we strongly urge you to leave the DACA program in place,\u201d members of the group wrote about the program, which applies to people who were brought to the United States as children. \u201cDACA recipients have been critical members of our work force, industries, and communities for years now, and they have abided by the laws and regulations of our country in order to maintain their DACA status.\u201d\nThe letter went on to say that \u201ctheir work and commitment to our companies, their families and communities are critical to our nation\u2019s strength, especially since there are tens of thousands of DACA recipients working as front line doctors and nurses and in other critical industries fighting Covid-19.\u201d\n\u201cThis is no time to disrupt the economic recovery of our companies and communities, nor time to jeopardize the health and safety of these vulnerable individuals,\u201d the letter said, noting that polls have consistently shown voters don\u2019t want to see DACA recipients deported. \u201cWe ask that you leave DACA in place and refrain from taking any additional administrative actions that would negatively impact the DACA program.\u201d\nMr. Trump has suggested he would try again to rescind the program, which he has alternately praised and criticized.\nOn Friday, in an interview with the Spanish-language network Telemundo, Mr. Trump gave a confusing statement about his plans to write an immigration-related executive order in about four weeks.\n\u201cDACA is going to be just fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he was going to issue a \u201cbig executive order. I have the power to do it as president and I\u2019m going to make DACA a part of it.\u201d\nThen he immediately said, \u201cBut, we put it in, and we\u2019ll probably going to then be taking it out.\u201d At another point, he said that it would be a \u201cvery big bill\u201d that would call for merit-based immigration and include a DACA provision. He then said there would be a \u201croad to citizenship\u201d in the executive order \u2014 which he repeatedly confused with a piece of legislation. Presidents cannot create a pathway to citizenship without congressional action.\nAlmost immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s interview, a White House spokesman issued a statement that was quite different from what the president said. The statement said that Mr. Trump was working on an executive order to \u201cestablish a merit-based immigration system to further protect U.S. workers,\u201d something that the White House has been planning for weeks. The statement made clear it would not relate to DACA or a \u201croad to citizenship.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Several Chinese firms and the major international brands they supply pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s decision toadd 11 Chinese companies to a government blacklistfor aiding human rights violations, saying they had found no evidence of forced labor or other abuses in their supply chains.\nOn Monday, the Trump administration added the Chinese companies to the so-called entity list, which bars them from buying American technology and products without a special license. Nine companies were added to the list for their use of forced labor, while another two were included for conducting genetic analyses that were used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, the Commerce Department said.\nThe Chinese government has carried out a campaign of mass detentions in Xinjiang, placing one million or more members of Muslim and other minority groups into large internment camps intended to increase their loyalty to the Communist Party. Some of these detainees areforced to work in factoriesin or near their camps.\nThe list of companies sanctioned on Monday included current and former suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren, Google, HP, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Muji, according toa reportby the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank established by the Australian government. The group cited the websites of the sanctioned Chinese companies, which mentioned their financial relationships with major American brands.\nIn a statement, Apple said that it had immediately begun a detailed investigation of Nanchang O-Film Tech, one of its suppliers that appeared on the list, when it learned of the allegations earlier this year. Apple dispatched independent third-party investigators to O-Film\u2019s facilities in March, and then conducted surprise audits in June and July, including verifying employee documentation and interviewing with workers in local languages, it said.\n\u201cApple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect,\u201d Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have found no evidence of any forced labor on Apple production lines and we plan to continue monitoring.\u201d\nAnother company included on the list, Changji Esquel Textile Company Ltd., appeared to have extensive connections with major international clothing brands, including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss.\nIn a statement, Hugo Boss said that it maintained \u201ca close and longstanding business relationship with the Esquel Group,\u201d Changji Esquel\u2019s parent company. Hugo Boss said it prohibited the use of forced labor in its supply chains, and that it had raised the allegations with Esquel Group. Esquel had assured it that all of the company\u2019s requirements and standards had been met.\n\u201cWe at Hugo Boss take these allegations very seriously and will continue to further pursue the matter,\u201d the company said.\nIn a statement Monday, Esqueldenied the accusations, saying that it did not and would never use forced labor, and that no one from the Commerce Department had spoken with the company to investigate the claims.\nAnother Chinese company, BGI Group, which had two subsidiaries placed on the list for providing gene technology for the surveillance of Uighurs, said it was \u201cpuzzled by\u201d its inclusion.\nBGI Group said that one subsidiary, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI, was established in November 2016 and had not carried out actual business so far. The other entity, Beijing Liuhe BGI, provides commercial gene synthesis for scientists conducting basic research, and it\u2019s unclear \u201chow its services or products could be used with respect to the allegations made,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cBGI Group does not condone and would never be involved in any human-rights abuses,\u201d it said in a statement.\nSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting."

        "title": "Their Businesses Went Virtual. Then Apple Wanted a Cut.",
        "fulltext": "ClassPass built its business on helping people book exercise classes at local gyms. So when the pandemic forced gyms across the United States to close, the company shifted to virtual classes.\nThen ClassPass received a concerning message from Apple. Because the classes it sold on its iPhone app were now virtual, Apple said it was entitled to 30 percent of the sales, up from no fee previously, according to a person close to ClassPass who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting Apple. The iPhone maker said it was merely enforcing a decade-old rule.\nAirbnb experienced similar demands from Apple after it began an \u201conline experiences\u201d business that offered virtual cooking classes, meditation sessions and drag-queen shows, augmenting the in-person experiences it started selling in 2016, according to two people familiar with the issues.\nAirbnbdiscussed Apple\u2019s demands with House lawmakers\u2019 offices that are investigating how Apple controls its App Store, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Those lawmakers are now considering Apple\u2019s efforts to collect a commission from Airbnb and ClassPassas part of their yearlong antitrust inquiry into the biggest tech companies,according to a person withknowledgeof their investigation.\nThose lawmakers are set to grill Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and the chief executives of Amazon, Facebook and Google in a high-profile hearing on Wednesday.\nApple\u2019s disputes with the smaller companies point to the control the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had over the shift to online life brought on by the pandemic. While much of the rest of the economy is struggling, the pandemic has further entrenched their businesses.\nWith millions more employees working from home, Amazon and Google are selling more online cloud space, with revenue for Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud soaring in the first quarter of the year, which included the start of the pandemic. Facebook and YouTube, which is part of Google, some of the internet\u2019s largest gathering places,had traffic surgeas people couldn\u2019t socialize in person.\nApplehas also brought in more revenuefrom its online-services business, mostly on the back of its App Store, and its Macs, iPads and iPhones have become even more important tools.\nWith gyms shut down, ClassPass dropped its typical commission on virtual classes, passing along 100 percent of sales to gyms, the person close to the company said. That meant Apple would have taken its cut from hundreds of struggling independent fitness centers, yoga studios and boxing gyms.\nApple said that with Airbnb and ClassPass, it was not trying to generate revenue \u2014 though that is a side effect \u2014 but instead was trying to enforce a rule that has been in place since it first published its app guidelines in 2010.\nApple said waiving the commission in these cases would not be fair to the many other app developers that have paid the fee for similar businesses for years. Because of the pandemic, Apple said that it gave ClassPass until the end of the year to comply and that it was continuing to negotiate with Airbnb.\n\u201cTo ensure every developer can create and grow a successful business, Apple maintains a clear, consistent set of guidelines that apply equally to everyone,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nClassPass was told it must comply with the rule this month, according to the person close to the company. Instead, it stopped offering virtual classes in its iPhone app, since those classes were subject to Apple\u2019s commission, according to Apple. As a result, fewer potential customers now see the classes advertised by its gym partners.\nIn 2016, Airbnb started a business offering in-person \u201cexperiences\u201d to travelers, such as guided tours, bar crawls and cooking classes with locals in their vacation destinations. In early April, as the pandemic gutted travel plans and the company\u2019s bottom line, Airbnb began selling virtual versions of similar experiences, though it quickly expanded that business to more prominent offerings, like cooking classes with famous chefs and training sessions with Olympic athletes.\nLater that month, Apple reached out to say that when the online experiences were sold in Airbnb\u2019s iPhone app, the company would have to pay Apple\u2019s fees, said a person familiar with their exchanges.\nApple said it believed that Airbnb had long intended to offer virtual experiences \u2014 not that the business was created simply because of the pandemic \u2014 and that it would continue to do so once the world has resumed to normal. Apple also pointed out that Airbnb had never paid Apple any money despite the fact that it built its multibillion-dollar business with the help of its iPhone app.\nAirbnb is still negotiating with Apple. In June, Brian Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, said that the online experiences offering was the company\u2019s \u201cfastest growing product ever\u201d and had earned $1 million in revenue. Apple said that if the two companies could not come to terms, it could remove Airbnb\u2019s app from the App Store.\nMany companies and app developers complain that Apple forces them to pay its commission to be included in the App Store, which is crucial to reaching the roughly 900 million people with iPhones. Apple said the App Store had 500 million visitors from 175 countries each week.\nFor months, economists and lawyers at the Justice Department have held meetings with companies and app developers about the App Store as part of its antitrust investigation into Apple. The music service Spotify and another large company that declined to be named also said they have had recent conversations with attorneys general from several states about the issue.\nUnlike Spotify, Airbnb and ClassPass do not offer services that directly compete with one of Apple\u2019s digital products.\nMany companies complain that they are also subject to what they call Apple\u2019s capricious enforcement of its rules, which can lead to their apps\u2019 removal from the App Store, killing some of their business. If Apple removes an app from the App Store, the developer couldn\u2019t gain new app users and couldn\u2019t update the apps already on people\u2019s phones, eventually rendering them broken.\nApple said a small fraction of iPhone apps were subject to its commission, which is in line with the fees other platforms charge, according to a study released by Apple last Wednesday. Airbnb, for instance, charges a 20 percent commission on experiences.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in the App Store today, you\u2019re not online. Your business cannot function. So they\u2019re the gatekeepers of something that every single company wants,\u201d said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an encrypted email service based in Switzerland that effectively competes with Apple\u2019s own email service. \u201cIf you want to pass through their gates, they\u2019re going to charge you 30 percent of your revenue.\u201d\nMr. Yen said his company had been battling with Apple since 2017 over its commission, with Apple sometimes restricting the ProtonMail app on iPhones. To account for Apple\u2019s fee, ProtonMail began charging 30 percent more for subscriptions bought on its iPhone app versus those bought on its website, which aren\u2019t subject to Apple\u2019s fee. \u201cThe only way that we could support this fee was actually by passing on the cost to the customer,\u201d he said.\nBut when ProtonMail told iPhone users about the lower price on its website, Apple restricted its app. Then, when the company instead tried to make clear that 30 percent of the subscription price went to Apple, Apple restricted its app again. \u201cYou only hide something like this if it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Yen said.\nAsked about ProtonMail\u2019s experience, Apple said its rules require certain apps to use its payment system and ban them from directing people to buy their products or services elsewhere."

        "fulltext": "Jeff Bezosof Amazon,Tim Cookof Apple,Mark Zuckerbergof Facebook andSundar Pichaiof Google are set to testify beforeCongresson Wednesday to make their case about why their companies actually are not that powerful.\nThe four will answer questions from House lawmakers who have been investigating their companies\u2019 business practices for more than a year to examine if they stifle competition and harm consumers. Because ofthe coronavirus pandemic, the chief executives will be testifying remotely via videoconference, starting at noon Eastern time.\nEach C.E.O. is expected to offer a full-throated defense of his business, with some like Mr. Bezos alreadylaying out their argumentsin prepared testimony. To make following along easier \u2014 the companies face scrutiny for complex and varied issues \u2014 The New York Times prepared this guide to what you are likely to hear and what you should know.\nCompanies and app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control over its iPhone App Store to set burdensome rules on their apps and charge some of them up to 30 percent of their revenues.\nMr. Cook is likely to argue that competition is alive and well in the App Store.\nCompetition may be fierce, but the playing field is not level. Apple\u2019s own apps have long enjoyed different rules in the App Store. Developers do not have to pay Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission. They are not subject to user reviews or ratings like other apps. They do not deal with what other companies call Apple\u2019s capricious enforcement of opaque rules. And they have regularlyranked ahead of the competitionin the App Store\u2019s search results.\nMr. Cook is likely to argue that Apple is not a monopoly because it controls just 15 percent of the global smartphone market.\nWhile that number is accurate, it downplays the iPhone\u2019s importance. Overall, Google\u2019s Android software dominates when measured by global users, in part because cheap Android devices have blanketed the developing world. But the iPhone has a much higher market share in industrialized nations, including about 42 percent in the United States, according to International Data Corporation, a research firm.\nMost app developers also care more about dollars than the number of users \u2014 and by that measure, iPhones regularly beat Android devices. So far this year, iPhone users have spent about $36.8 billion on digital goods and services like in-app features and subscriptions, or 65 percent of the global total, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. App developers said that made Apple\u2019s App Store necessary for their business, leaving them with little choice but to comply with its rules and fees.\nThere is also one fact that no one disputes: By any measure, the smartphone industry is a duopoly. Apple and Google create the software that underpin just about every smartphone in the world. And both companies enforce effectively the same fees on developers.\nMr. Cook is likely to argue that Apple does not take a fee from a vast majority of apps.\nThis is true. Apple does not charge up to 30 percent commission on the sale of physical goods or advertising, which make up a vast majority of commerce on iPhone apps. (This includes all of the physical goods Amazon sells over its iPhone app, and all of the ads Facebook and Google show in their apps.) In 2019, Apple said it received about 15 percent of the $519 billion in overall commerce in the App Store.\nBut it is also true that Apple takes a fee from many of the apps it competes with. The company charges commission on the sale of \u201cdigital goods and services,\u201d such as subscriptions to a music app like Spotify or a video-streaming service like Hulu, which are categories in which Apple offers its own services.\nCompanies accuse Google of using the dominance of its search engine to direct people to its own products and to force companies to advertise to remain visible in search results.\nMr. Pichai is likely to argue that Google has plenty of internet-search competition and that its high market share is because people like its products.\nYes, there are segments in which Google has more search competition, like shopping. But the notion that 90 percent of people use Google solely because they prefer its search engine is misleading because there are other factors that play into its large market share.\nGoogle actively preserves its search dominance, for example. One of its biggest expenses is the fee it pays Apple to be the default search engine on Apple devices. It does not make much sense to pay Apple billions of dollars each year if you believe that consumers will ultimately end up on Google anyway because it is better.\nMr. Pichai is likely to argue that Google has helped drive down prices in advertising and increased choices for advertisers.\nIn the past, Google has argued that digital advertising prices have come down more than 40 percent since 2010.\nIn response, Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority saidin a reportthis month that it found that Google\u2019s market power had a significant impact on prices. Its analysis showed that Google\u2019s prices were 30 percent to 40 percent higher than those for Microsoft\u2019s Bing search ads, when comparing like-for-like terms on both desktop and mobile.\nMr. Pichai is likely to argue that it\u2019s not in Google\u2019s long-term interest to load its pages with ads.\nIn reality, Google has steadilyincreased the real estate it devotes to ads, especially for commercially lucrative search terms. On smaller smartphone screens, there are times when a user must scroll to avoid seeing only ads. Google has also made its ads harder to spot by makingits advertising labels more discreet.\nGoogle also lets companies advertise on the search results of their competitors\u2019 names. Companies have argued that the policy feels like a shakedown, requiring them to pay Google to appear at the top of search results for their own name and prevent a rival from stealing potential customers. Google says it does not allow people to advertise against trademarked names if the owner of the trademark complains.\nLawmakers are investigating whether Amazon abuses its role as both a large retailer and a platform for third-party sellers who offer products on its marketplace. Because of these dual hats, Amazon might be able to use data it gathers from sellers to develop its own competing brands of products, like generic batteries and diapers.\nMr. Bezos is likely to say that Amazon is actually quite small, arguing that e-commerce makes upabout only 12 percentof all retail sales in the United States and that Walmart sells more than his company.\nAmazon has long said that all retailers \u2014 both online and physical ones \u2014 should be considered its competitors. Yet that 12 percent statistic, from the U.S. Census Bureau, includes large consumer categories where Amazon does not currently sell products, such as auto dealers and gas stations.\nIn Amazon\u2019s oldest lines of business, such as books, toys and electronics, the market is more concentrated. The research firm eMarketer estimates that 63 percent of books and other media are bought online, and Amazon has cornered about 90 percent of the online market for books, according to Rakuten Intelligence, another research firm.\nMr. Bezos is likely to say Amazon\u2019s third-party sellers are thriving, outpacing the growth of Amazon\u2019s own sales directly to customers.\nWhile many third-party merchants have seen their sales on Amazon grow, some also saytheir profit has shrunk. These third-party sellers are giving more money to Amazon over time to pay for services like fulfillment and advertising, which have become essential to thrive on its platform.\nMr. Bezos is likely to say that Amazon\u2019s own branded products are a small share of its business, that they are common practice in retail and that it doesn\u2019t use proprietary data to develop the products.\nAmazon has said the percentage of sales in North America from its own branded products is in the \u201clow single digits.\u201d Other retailers like Target and Costco depend more on private label sales than Amazon.\nBut some sellers say Amazon can develop products with more data and less risk. Walmart might have 200,000 unique products in its store, but Amazon can comb through the millions of items listed by sellers to choose which to emulate.\nAmazon says information on promising products are available to anyone through its public best-seller rankings, butThe Wall Street Journal reportedin April that the company had at times used private data, like advertising and other costs, that would give it an advantage. Amazon said that would violate its policies and that it was investigating the matter.\nFacebook faces scrutiny for its dominance in social media and its history of acquiring smaller companies like WhatsApp and Instagram that have helped it gain power while neutralizing the competition.\nMr. Zuckerberg is likely to point to TikTok, a Chinese-backed video app, as a sign that competition in social networking is thriving.\nTikTok, which only became popular in the past few years, remains Facebook\u2019s best evidence that it does not have a stranglehold on innovation and new products. Citing TikTok also gives Facebookpolitical pointsamid a geopolitical battle between the Trump administration and China.\nEven so, Facebook is the undisputed king of social networking. About 2.99 billion people around the world use one or more of its family of apps, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, each month. That dwarfs TikTok\u2019s 800 million monthly worldwide users.\nTencent\u2019sWeChat, which is huge in China, has 1.2 billion monthly active users. Other social networks are much smaller. Twitter has 186 million daily users, while Snap, the maker of Snapchat \u2014 which Facebook previously tried to buy \u2014 has 238 million.\nMr. Zuckerberg will most likely point to the vast digital ads marketplace to argue that Facebook has no advertising monopoly.\nGoogle, with about 29.4 percent market share of digital advertising in the United States, is Facebook\u2019s best argument to defend against accusations of cornering the market. The social network also has noted that Twitter, Pinterest, Snap, YouTube, Amazon and Apple are vying for the same ad dollars.\nFacebook has also said there should be no distinguishing between digital and traditional outlets competing for ad dollars. If Facebook is tussling with television, radio and print outlets to court advertiser spending, then its piece of the overall pie looks smaller.\nYet there is no question Facebook is a large presence in digital advertising. The company is expected to haul in more than $73.8 billion in ad revenue this year, even with the pandemic, according to estimates from eMarketer. For 2020, its share of U.S. digital advertising is set to be about 23.4 percent, eMarketer said."
