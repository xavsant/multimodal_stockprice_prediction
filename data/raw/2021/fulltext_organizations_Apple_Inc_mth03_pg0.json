        "title": "A Pioneer of Digital Design Looks Back on a Defining Era",
        "fulltext": "When Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984, it was the dawn of an era. Personal computing was ascendant. The World Wide Web was on its way. Screens would soon begin to take over people\u2019s lives \u2014 an early precursor to the always-on, Zoom-to-Zoom world we\u2019re living in today.\nMen, especially ones named Steve and Bill, get a lot of credit for heralding this modern era of information technology. But behind the scenes, at tech and design firms around the world, the look and feel of those screens was defined by lesser-known graphic designers \u2014 people who created the windows, dialogue boxes and icons taken largely for granted these days.\nSusan Kare, for instance, made the original icons, graphic elements and fonts for the Macintosh operating system: the smiling Mac, the trash can, the system-error bomb. And though the industry was predominantly male, she had many woman peers \u2014 among them Loretta Staples, an interface designer in San Francisco.\nFor seven years, she dreamed up interactive experiences meant to delight and satisfy the end user. That was long before \u201cdesign thinking\u201d became the talk of Silicon Valley, before her domain was sleekly rebranded as U.I. When she started, the field was so nascent that most of the software didn\u2019t exist.\n\u201cIt was just so exciting,\u201d Ms. Staples said during a Zoom call in December. \u201cYou had to put stuff together and fashion your own tools and ways of making things.\u201d\nNow 67, living in Connecticut and working as a therapist (the fifth phase of her professional life), she sees those years as formative, not only for her creativity but her worldview.\nMs. Staples grew up in the late \u201960s reading The Village Voice on a military base in Kentucky, dreaming of life in the northeast. But after completing her studies in art history at Yale and graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design, she began to question what she had come to see as regional values.\nOne of her professors, Inge Druckrey, was recognized for bringing Swiss Modernism to American schools. Also known as the International Style, it is visually defined by rigid grids and sans serif typefaces. The designer is meant to be \u201cinvisible.\u201d New York City\u2019s subway signs and Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d ad are good examples of its manifestation in American culture.\nMs. Staples valued the visual authority and logic behind this school of thought but found its fundamental neutrality confusing. \u201cHere I am, first-generation, middle-class, half-Black, half-Japanese, was never going to go to college and somehow weirdly ended up at Yale,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat on Earth does all this stuff have to do with \u2018where I come from,\u2019 whatever even that is?\u201d\nShe also found that institutions in the northeast were dismissive of rapidly evolving digital tools. \u201cI would keep scratching my head wondering, \u2018When is the East Coast going to get how important all this stuff is?\u2019\u201d Ms. Staples said.\nSo, in 1988, she responded to a newspaper ad for the Understanding Business, or TUB, a design studio in San Francisco run by Richard Saul Wurman, a graphic designer known today for creating TED conferences. At the time, TUB was one of the largest studios focused on Macintosh computers.\nMs. Staples taught herself how to use a beta version of Adobe Photoshop and other new tools that would allow her to design for interaction. Because the field was still emerging, she often \u201ckludged\u201d different programs together to get her desired effect.\n\u201cIn some ways, it was a more diverse world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t this unified, pervasive World Wide Web browser app kind of thing.\u201d\nMs. Staples became a full-time interface designer in 1989. She worked for the noted designer Clement Mok, briefly under John Sculley\u2019s leadership at Apple, then opened her own studio, U dot I, in 1992.\n\u201cWe take it for granted because U.I. is a big, big deal now,\u201d said Maria Giudice, who worked with Ms. Staples at TUB and has remained a friend. \u201cBut she was one of the few people who was really working in that space.\u201d\nInterface design was full of thoughtful little innovations and touches of magic, like hovering a cursor over a blurry object to bring it into focus. \u201cI know that probably doesn\u2019t sound like much now, but at the time it took a lot to make that happen,\u201d Ms. Staples said.\nIcons, though limited to a meager dollop of chunky pixels, were also a place for customization. Using ResEdit, a programmer\u2019s software, she once constructed an icon of a ceramic coffee mug with a tiny doughnut nestled against it. \u201cIt even had a little shading,\u201d she said.\nHer clients in the \u201990s included AT&T, the Smithsonian Institution, Sony and Paramount/Viacom, where she helped create a design for an interactive television prototype (a forerunner, in many ways, to streaming TV).\nMeanwhile, the World Wide Web was erupting. \u201cFor me, the internet was the beginning of the end,\u201d Ms. Staples said. When she began working as an interface designer six years prior, graphical user interface wasn\u2019t widely understood; now web pages were popping up by the hundreds, and everyone was surfing the net. Everything was becoming more standardized, commercialized, crowded and boring.\nIn a letter to the editor published both in Adbusters, an activist magazine, and Emigre, a graphic design magazine, Ms. Staples described recoiling at a progressive political publication that was designed in an expressive manner \u2014 a stark contrast to the increasingly homogeneous look of the world in her own field at the turn of the millennium.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been viscerally programmed to respond predictably to graphic conventions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCould it be that increasingly graphic design is less the solution and more the problem?\u201d\n\u201cI felt like I recognized design as a particular kind of cultural practice that I didn\u2019t want to practice anymore,\u201d Ms. Staples said.\nAfter making an exit, she cycled agilely through professions: design educator (her essays, which documented a pivotal period in digital design, are still used in classrooms today), fine artist, online business consultant. In 2000, she moved from Michigan, where she was teaching design, to New York City, disposing of a basement\u2019s worth of work documents in the process.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an archivist ultimately,\u201d she said. \u201cThings come and go, and that\u2019s the way my life has been.\u201d Her website, however, contains a selection of artifacts from her early professional life: 12 images of her designs, plus the student work and syllabuses for classes she taught.\nLooking back, Ms. Staples said that she used to see herself as a cultural critic disguised as a designer; now she\u2019s a cultural critic disguised as a therapist \u2014 one who has spent the last year working exclusively over video conferencing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird to have the option to control a view,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone is looking at the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s still thinking like a designer,\u201d Ms. Giudice said, \u201cjust applying it in a different way.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Google is cutting in half its commission on developers\u2019 first $1 million in app sales, followinga similar move by Applethat is aimed at appeasing developers and regulators who accuse the companies of abusing their dominance of the smartphone industry.\nGoogle said thatstarting July 1, it would take 15 percent of the first $1 million developers take in from certain app sales, down from 30 percent. Google will still charge 30 percent after the first $1 million.\nApple last year said it was halving its app-store commission to 15 percent on companies that earn less than $1 million a year in app sales.\nThe dual actions reverse years of resistance by the companies to change their app-store commissions, which have become important to their growth.\nRivals have intensified their criticism of the rates, saying they are artificially high because the companies have a duopoly on the distribution of mobile apps. Regulators around the world have begun investigating the commissions as part of larger antitrust probes, and lawmakers in several states are considering bills that would make it more difficult for Apple and Google to impose the fees.\nApple has been largely the focus of the criticism because it forces developers to use its app store to reach iPhone users. Google\u2019s Android software allows users to download apps outside of its flagship app store, called the Play Store. Still, Android is the dominant smartphone operating system around the world, underpinning roughly 85 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones, according to IDC, a market research firm.\nGoogle said its change would halve the app-store fees for 99 percent of Android developers. But while Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s moves have earned them positive headlines, they will likely have little impact on the companies\u2019 bottom lines, because most of their app-store revenues come from larger developers.\nApple\u2019s new policy, for instance, will affect roughly 98 percent of the companies that pay Apple a commission, but those developers accounted for less than 5 percent of App Store revenues last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm."

        "title": "States Are Right to Rebel Against Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "As Congresscontinues its interrogationof monopolistic practices of technology companies, states are getting into the game. Among the first targets on their list are Apple and Google, which together command 100 percent of the market for smartphone operating systems. New bills introduced in several states would threaten the companies\u2019 dominance and represent an opportunity for state leaders to put fairness in commerce at the center of governance.\nAll apps that iPhone users download pass through Apple\u2019s app store, because Apple doesn\u2019t allow alternative marketplaces. Google uses its own store, which is called Google Play and is preinstalled on most Android phones, togive preference to its own appsover similar apps from competitors. While Google does allow alternative app stores, users must download them.\nBoth companies retain as much as 30 percent of the money consumers pay both for apps and for the purchases they make within those apps. (Credit card networks typically charge around 3 percent in transaction fees.) Apple made $72 billion last year from app store fees alone, while Google Play earned Google $39 billion, according to a research company called Sensor Tower. This week Google said it wouldreduce its commissionfor some app store sales. Both companies are targets of American andEuropeaninquiries into monopolies in the technology market.\nLast fall Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, sued Apple aftertrying unsuccessfully to wrest controlof consumer payments by adding its own direct payment system to Fortnite. Apple responded by removing the game from its app store, and a trial is scheduled to begin in May.\nAnd now states are taking on the issue of payments for mobile phone software. Bills recentlyintroducedin more than a half-dozen states, including Arizona, New York, Illinois and Georgia, would prevent Apple and Google from forcing developers to use the platforms\u2019 payment systems. Some of the bills have been backed by the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization that opposes app store fees and was founded by technology companies including Epic Games and Spotify. With these bills, state lawmakers are directly challenging the market power of big tech, attempting to address through policy what could take years to achieve through antitrust cases.\nArizona\u2019s House of Representatives this monthpassed a billthat prevents providers of digital platforms fromcompellingconsumers and software developers based in the state to use those platforms\u2019 payment systems. The measure was supported almost entirely by Republicans. Most of the state\u2019s Democrats sided with Apple and libertarians at Americans for Prosperityand the Goldwater Institutein opposing the bill, arguing that the stateshould not be involvedin disputes between private businesses and that federal enforcers, not states, should regulate tech markets.\nThat libertarianism is at odds with the history of states using their powers to regulate commerce and protect marketplaces from corruption and monopolies. After all, states already use their powers to regulate utility markets, establish alcohol boards, oversee pharmaceutical distribution and provide oversight forother industries. Local regulation of corporate power predates the U.S. Constitution \u2014 the colony of Massachusetts capped the interest that lenders could charge on loans back in 1641 \u2014 and for centuries state leaders have maintained the tradition, challenging monopolies with regulations that kept local commerce open and vibrant.\nStates have antitrust laws because they have an interest in making sure that their local businesses, workers and consumers aren\u2019t steamrollered by large companies. Far from being an intrusion into business affairs or a usurpation of federal power, these bills ensure that local businesses can avoid private gatekeepers.With these bills, policymakers are providing local businesses with what they need: access to open markets.\nThese bills also create opportunities for economic growth, because they could help states persuade tech companies to relocate within their borders without resorting to the usualfailed tacticsof offering subsidies. States spend about $40 billion annually \u2014 and that\u2019s at the low end of the estimates \u2014 trying to entice corporations to move. When Amazonwas shopping aroundfor a home for its second headquarters, states weren\u2019t accused of unnecessarily meddling in private businesses\u2019 affairs by trying to lure the company with lavish subsidies. Similarly, we hear no protests when states and cities throw tax benefits at tech companies. According to Good Jobs First, a research organization that tracks corporate subsidies, Apple and Google have each received more than $200 million in state and local subsidies since 2015.\nThe idea that these measures could entice companies to relocate isn\u2019t theoretical.David Heinemeier Hansson, a co-founder of Basecamp, a software company in Chicago that hasfought with Appleover its payment system, has said the companywould like to move its operationsto a state with such a law on the books.\nThis is an opportunity for states to spend no money in order to accomplish something they\u2019ve been trying to do for decades using precious public resources: create new high-tech jobs and support small, innovative businesses by helping them escape the onerous terms imposed on them by Apple and Google. It turns out the secret sauce to economic growth is what state leaders have done for hundreds of years, which is to put fairness, not monopolies, at the center of lawmaking.\nMatt Stoller (@matthewstoller) is director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project and author of \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.\u201d Pat Garofalo (@pat_garofalo) is director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project and author of \u201cThe Billionaire Boondoggle: How Our Politicians Let Corporations and Bigwigs Steal Our Money and Jobs.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "How to Get a Peloton-Style Workout Without Splurging",
        "fulltext": "Lisa Whitney, a dietitian in Reno, Nev., came across the deal of a lifetime about two years ago. A fitness studio was going out of business and selling its equipment. She scored an indoor exercise bike for $100.\nMs. Whitney soon made some additions to the bike. She propped her iPad on the handlebars. Then she experimented with online cycling classes streamed on YouTube and on the app forPeloton, a maker of internet-connected exercise devices that offers interactive fitness classes.\nMs. Whitney had no desire to upgrade to one of Peloton\u2019s $1,900-plus luxury exercise bikes, which include a tablet to stream classes and sensors that track your speed and heart rate. So she further modified her bike to become a do-it-yourself Peloton, buying sensors and indoor cycling shoes.\nThe grand total: about $300, plus a $13 monthly subscription to Peloton\u2019s app. Not cheap, but a significant discount to what she might have paid.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with my setup,\u201d Ms. Whitney, 42, said. \u201cI really don\u2019t think upgrading would do much.\u201d\nThe pandemic, which has forced many gyms to shut down, has driven hordes of people tosplurge on luxury items like Peloton\u2019s bikes and treadmillsso they can work out at home. Capitalizing on this trend, Apple last year releasedApple Fitness Plus, an instructional fitness app that is exclusively offered to people who own an Apple Watch, which requires an iPhone to work.\nBut all of that can be expensive. The minimum prices of an Apple Watch and iPhone add up to $600, and Apple Fitness Plus costs $10 a month. Then to stream classes on a big-screen TV instead of a phone while you exercise, you need a streaming device such as an Apple TV, which costs about $150. The full Peloton experience is even pricier.\nWith the economy in a funk, many of us are trying to tighten our spending while maintaining good health. So I experimented with how to minimize the costs of doing video-instructed workouts at home, talked to tinkerers and assessed the pros and cons.\nHere\u2019s what I learned.\nTo start my experiment for working out at home on the cheap, the first question I tackled was whether to subscribe to a fitness app or stream classes from YouTube for free. Both largely provide videos of instructors guiding you through workouts.\nSo I bought an $8 yoga mat and a $70 pair of adjustable dumbbells and turned on my TV, which includes the YouTube app. I then subscribed to three of the most popular YouTube channels that have free content for exercising at home:Yoga With Adriene,Fitness BlenderandHolly Dolke.\nOne immediate downside was almost too much content \u2014 often hundreds of videos per YouTuber \u2014 making it difficult to pick a workout. Even when I finally chose a video, I learned I had to brace myself for some quality issues.\nIn the Yoga With Adriene channel, for instance, I selected the video \u201cYoga for When You Feel Dead Inside,\u201d which felt appropriate for the time we are living in. The video looked good, but at times the instructor\u2019s voice sounded muffled.\nProduction problems were more visible in the Holly Dolke channel, which has a collection of intense workouts that you can do without any equipment. When I tried the video \u201cMuffin Top Melter,\u201d an instructor in the background demonstrated how to do a more challenging version of each exercise, but the other instructor, in the foreground, constantly blocked her.\nThen there were the ads. As I lifted weights while following a10-minute fat-burning workoutfrom Fitness Blender, YouTube interrupted the video to play an ad for Dawn soap. That left me holding a dumbbell above the back of my neck while I waited for the ad to end.\nThose issues aside, I was able to do all of the exercises demonstrated by these YouTubers, and they left me winded and sweaty. For the cost of free, I can\u2019t complain much. Most important, Yoga With Adriene succeeded in making me feel less dead inside.\nTo compare the free YouTube exercise videos with the paid experience, I subscribed to Peloton and Apple Fitness Plus on my Apple TV set-top box. I did workouts using both products for the last two months.\nPeloton and Apple Fitness Plus addressed many of the problems plaguing the free exercise content.\nFor one, workouts were organized into categories by the type of workout, including yoga, strength training and core, and then by the difficulty or duration of the workout. It took little time to choose a workout.\nIn both Peloton and Apple Fitness Plus, video and audio quality were very clear, and the workouts were shot at various angles to get a good look at what the instructors were doing. The bonus of Fitness Plus was that my heart rate and calories burned were displayed on both my Apple Watch and the TV screen.\nIn short, paying those subscriptions provided convenience and polish, which led to a more pleasant workout. I concluded that Peloton\u2019s videos were worth paying $13 a month. And $10 a month is reasonable for Apple Fitness Plus, but only if you already have an Apple Watch and iPhone.\nSo what about exercise equipment like spin bikes? If you want the tech frills of a Peloton but don\u2019t want to spend on the equipment, there were two main approaches.\nTo go the cheapest route, you can make use of a bicycle you already have. Here\u2019s where home tinkerers can be especially crafty and resourceful.\nTake Omar Sultan, a manager at the networking company Cisco. He modified his road bike with a few add-ons: a bike trainer, which secured the rear wheel and bike frame and costs roughly $100; a$40 Wahoo cadence sensorthat tracked his pedaling output and speed and transmitted the data to a smartphone; and a heart rate monitor that strapped around his chest, such as the$90 Polar H10. Then he used a streaming device to follow Peloton classes on his TV.\n\u201cThe D.I.Y. setup is 80 percent of the way there\u201d to a Peloton, Mr. Sultan said.\nThe more expensive option was to buy an indoor exercise bike and use a tablet or phone to stream cycling classes via YouTube or the Peloton app, as Ms. Whitney did. The$700 IC7.9, for example, includes a cadence sensor and a holder for your tablet. You could then buy a heart rate monitor and a pair of $100indoor cycling shoesthat clip into the pedals.\nBut if you use your own bicycle or a modified spin bike and try Peloton\u2019s app, you won\u2019t be able to participate in the app\u2019s so-called leader board, which shows a graphic of your progress compared with other Peloton users online.\nWith a D.I.Y. bike, it can also be difficult to figure out how to shift gears to simulate when the instructor is telling you to turn up the resistance \u2014 like when you are pretending to ride up a hill.\nNicole Odya, a nurse practitioner in Chicago who modified a high-end indoor bike, the Keiser M3i, said there were major upsides to the D.I.Y. route. Using her own iPad, she has the flexibility to choose whatever fitness apps she wants to use, such asZwiftandmPaceLine. It also gave her the freedom to customize her bike, so she swapped out the stock pedals for better ones.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be locked into their platform,\u201d she said of Peloton."

        "fulltext": "The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.1 percent on Thursday, a drop that left the tech-heavy benchmark down 9.7 percent from the record it reached in February.\nA drop of 10 percent from a high is known as a correction, a Wall Street term that indicates something more serious than a garden-variety downturn.\nStocks that soared during the pandemic last year were slammed on Thursday.Shopify, which helps retailers develop e-commerce operations and saw its shares rise nearly 200 percent last year, was down nearly 6 percent. The tech security firm CrowdStrike, up more than 300 percent last year, was down more than 8 percent on Thursday.\nSome of the largest stocks were also lower, weighing on both the Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 index.\nApple dropped more than 1.5 percent and is down 16 percent since Jan. 25. Tesla dropped nearly 5 percent, bringing its losses from its January high to 29 percent.\nThe 10 percent threshold for a correction is arbitrary, but it is often an indication that investors have turned more pessimistic about the markets.\nThe decline in the stock markets was set off as investors, concerned that an economic recovery would mean the Federal Reserve would pull back on its easy-money policies, poured money into government bonds, which are considered more secure."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nHere\u2019s one more way that technology companies are becoming more like conventional corporations: When they talk about jobs, it\u2019s often a political message.\nGoogle last weekdetailed its expansionof offices, computer data centers and staff around the United States. The company didn\u2019t say so, but it needs more people, buildings and infrastructure to keep growing and making money. It\u2019s smarter politics and public relations to rebrand it as \u201cinvesting in America.\u201d\nGoogle is not alone. Amazon has turned its mammoth work force intoits loudest political messagethat the company is helping Americans and the economy. The iPhone manufacturer Foxconn keeps promising high-tech jobs at its Wisconsin factory, even though ithasn\u2019t delivered on three years of hiring promises. Facebook and Apple regularly talk about how they support small businesses and help generate jobs at app companies.\nGrowing corporationsareengines of economic growth, and it\u2019s nothing new for them to brag about what they\u2019re doing for political reasons. Defense contractors might suggest to members of Congress that cutting the Pentagon\u2019s budget could lead to fewer jobs in a lawmaker\u2019s district or state.Walmarttallies how much it buys from American suppliers.\nBut it\u2019s still odd to see tech companies playing this same game of corporate soft power. This was an industry that for a long time said it didn\u2019t need to do the usual corporate muck of lobbying and courting political power. This was never really true, but it\u2019s gotten even less so.\nAs more people and politicians worry about the influence of technology companies in the economy and our lives, digital corporations have been forced to try harder to keep people feeling warm and fuzzy about them. One way to do that is to copy what boring old companies have always done: Get attention for their hiring and growth.\nAmazon is the epitome of a company that uses its hiring and economic growth as a tool to influence how others perceive it. My colleague Karen Weise haswrittenabout Amazon\u2019s using its growing staff of 1.3 million people as a force of political persuasion.\nWorkers at Amazon warehouses go to Washington to meet with members of Congress and give lawmakers safety vests with the names of the company\u2019s warehouses in their districts. Amazon regularly talks up its job openings and new warehouses and offices, and ithas a website that tallies how much the company spends in the United States.\nIt\u2019s a compelling message. Few companies in the history of the United States have hired people at the rate Amazon has recently. And many towns and states want Amazon facilities in their backyards \u2014 and politicians want credit for bringing those jobs to their area.\nIt\u2019s also undeniable that all that spending is for Amazon, not for America. The company\u2019s sales are growing fast, and its commitment to get more packages to Prime members\u2019 doorsteps in one day has required it to add workers, open more depotsnear major population centersand spend more on planes and trucks.\nThe desire to paint corporate necessity in the best possible light sometimes creates strange spectacles. Apple in 2018basically patted itself on the back for paying taxesand buying equipment to make iPhones.\nTech companies are becoming just like every other for-profit corporation. They want to be seen as contributing to society, not just making money.\nTip of the Week\nThis tip fromBrian X. Chen, The New York Times\u2019s consumer technology columnist, made me immediately check my phone settings:\nMany of us rely on our smartphones for our everyday cameras. But our phones collect lots of data about us, and camera software can automatically make a note of our location when we snap a photo. This is more often a potential safety risk than a benefit.\nLet\u2019s start with the positives. When you allow your camera to tag your location, photo management apps like Apple\u2019s Photos and Google Photos can automatically sort pictures into albums based on location. That\u2019s helpful when you go on vacation and want to remember where you were when you took a snapshot.\nBut when you\u2019re not traveling, having your location tagged on photos is not great. Let\u2019s say you just connected with someone on a dating app and texted a photo of your dog. If you had the location feature turned on when you snapped the photo, that person could analyze the data to see where you live.\nJust to be safe, make sure the photo location feature is off by default.\nTo do this on iPhones: Open the Settings app, select Privacy, then Location Services and finally, Camera. Under \u201cAllow Location Access,\u201d choose \u201cNever.\u201d\nOn Androids, inside the Camera app, tap the Settings icon that looks like a gear cog. Scroll to \u201ctag locations\u201d or \u201csave location,\u201d and switch the toggle to the off position.\nYou might choose to turn the location feature on temporarily to document your vacation, but remember to turn it off when your trip is over.\nA very valuable chat app:My colleaguesreportedthat Discord, a messaging app that is popular for group video games, has discussed selling the company to Microsoft. A sale may never happen, but the price that was discussed was more than $10 billion.\nMeet Dr. Zoom:Some medical schools have heldcadaver dissection by simulation softwareduring the pandemic, and, yes, it\u2019s as weird as it sounds. My colleague Emma Goldberg talked to physicians in training about how they\u2019ve adapted to virtual learning in what is typically very hands-on education.\nWant to feel old and irrelevant?!Ryan Kaji is 9. His family generates $30 million in annual revenue from YouTube channels of Ryan opening new toys, exercising and doing craft projects.

Similar bills are being advanced by Republicans in at least 43 states, and the signatories are demanding that companies speak up more forcefully than they did in Georgia,Andrew and David Gelles report for The Times.\nThe effort is led by Ken Chenault and Ken Frazier, the former chief of AmEx and the departing chief of Merck, respectively. \u201cThere is no middle ground here,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cYou either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote.\u201d The letter did not criticize specific companies, but called on corporate America to publicly oppose new laws that would restrict the rights of Black voters, and to use their clout, money and lobbyists to sway the debate.\nThe signers included Roger Ferguson Jr., the chief executive of TIAA; Mellody Hobson and John Rogers Jr., the chief executives of Ariel Investments; and Ray McGuire, a former Citigroup executive who is running for mayor of New York.\nCorporations were circumspect as the debate raged in Georgia.Theirmuted responserevealed a double standard. Last year, dozens of big companies signeda pledgethat stated their \u201cclear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society.\u201d But \u201cwhen it comes to race, there\u2019s differential treatment,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality.\u201d\nActivists are calling for boycottsof Delta and Coca-Cola, which are based in Atlanta, for the tepid engagement in their home state. What happened in Georgia could easily spread to other states, the letter\u2019s signers believe. \u201cIf corporate America doesn\u2019t stand up, we\u2019ll get these laws passed in many places in this country,\u201d Mr. Frazier said.\nRegulators scrutinize banks\u2019 actions in the Archegos fire sale.The S.E.C. and Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authorityhave reportedly asked for informationfrom prime brokers involved with the stricken investment firm. A group of brokers met last week to discuss how to unwind the firm\u2019s trading positions \u2014 only to break ranks and start selling them quickly, roiling markets.\nPlans to fund President Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan take shape.The White House will call for15 years of higher corporate taxesto cover $2 trillion in spending that Mr. Biden plans to announce today. That includes raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, from the 21 percent set by President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts in 2017.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on compensating college athletes.At issue in the case today is whether the N.C.A.A. canput limits on education-related benefits. It comes amid a broader debate on whether student athletes can be paid.\nNew data show that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is highly effective in adolescents.The shot showed100 percent efficacyin children aged 12 to 15, according to a new trial by the drugmakers. Depending on regulatory approvals, inoculations could begin in time for the next academic year.\nA backslide in the number of Black finance executives.Anonymized government data shows that Black peopleheld fewer top rolesat U.S. financial firms in 2018 than in 2007, according to The Financial Times. That was the only minority group whose share of senior positions fell during the period.\nShares in the British food delivery service Deliveroo tumbled as much as 30 percent in their first day of trading this morning, after the companypriced its I.P.O.at the low end of expectations. It was an inauspicious debut for Britain\u2019s biggest initial stock sale in a decade.\nAnticipation for Deliveroo\u2019s I.P.O. was high,especially since the company\u2019s decision to list in London was praised as a victory for a post-Brexit Britain. Its debut was seen as a test for European stock investors\u2019 willingness to back a company that, like many American rivals, runs up huge losses, relies on a gig-economy model and gives its C.E.O. outsized control. British regulators have also been studying ways to make London\u2019s stock market more attractive to keep the city competitive in finance.\nIt turns out that many major British investors weren\u2019t that eager.Deliveroo\u2019s valuation dropped as low as 5.3 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), weeks after the company hoped to be valued at as much as \u00a39 billion. Asset managers like Legal and General said theywouldn\u2019t invest in the I.P.O., citing concerns about the compensation of the company\u2019s drivers and a dual-class stock structure that gives Will Shu, Deliveroo\u2019s C.E.O., more power than other investors for three years.\nInvestors also generally worry that food delivery services will lose steam as pandemic lockdowns ease.\nTech investors questioned whether Europe would welcome other start-up listings.Deliveroo\u2019s frosty reception may persuade other European tech businesses to list elsewhere, two of the company\u2019s backers told DealBook. A potential alternative is merging with a U.S.-based SPAC, as the British used-car marketplaceCazooand the German air-taxi makerLiliumare doing.\nCazoo\u2019s founder, Alex Chesterman, specificallycalled out British investors\u2019 risk aversionas a reason to list across the Atlantic: \u201cU.S. investors tend to be prepared to take bigger risks on bigger outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Marc Levinson, an economist, on the risks thatever-larger container shipspose to supply chains\nOne of the biggest criticisms of blank-check funds is the misalignment of interests between the companies\u2019 sponsors and later investors, particularly retail buyers. In his latest column, Andrewproposes a fixthat takes advantage of a unique aspect of the way SPACs are run.\nThe key is the companies\u2019 financial forecasts.Unlike with traditional I.P.O.s, which restrict what a company can say about its business, a company that goes public by merging with a SPAC is free to make financial forecasts. Because many of these companies are too young to have profits \u2014 or in many cases, revenues \u2014 these projections can be all that prospective investors have to go on. Companies may make promises they struggle to deliver, particularly for projections several years in the future. Virgin Galactic, which published projections out to 2023 when it merged with a SPAC in 2019, has had to revise its forecasts as its flight timetable has slipped.\nTying sponsors\u2019 stock commitments to those projections would lock them in for longer.If a target company makes forecasts for five years ahead, restricting its SPAC\u2019s sponsor from selling for five years would better align backers with what they are selling to the public, Andrew suggests.\nNot everyone likes the idea.The billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya, who drew criticism for unexpectedly selling some of his stake in Virgin Galactic this month (but not his sponsor shares), argued that it would unfairly punish sponsors for the shortcomings of management. Instead, he suggested making sponsors put more of their own money into SPAC deals: \u201cThe more they invest, the more they would need to scrutinize the projections,\u201d he said.\nApple is investing in UnitedMasters, a music distribution company that lets musicians bypass traditional record labels. Artists who distribute through UnitedMasters keep ownership of their master recordings and pay either a yearly fee or 10 percent of their royalties. Apple led the funding round, announced today, which DealBook hears values UnitedMasters at $350 million.\nMusicians are increasingly taking ownership of their work.Taylor Swift,most famously, and Anita Baker,most recently, have publicized their fights with labels over their master recordings. Artists once needed the heft of major publishing labels \u2014 which typically demand ownership of master recordings \u2014 to build a fan base. But with social media, labels no longer play as significant a gatekeeping role. \u201cTechnology, no doubt, has transformed music for consumers,\u201d said Steve Stoute, the founder of UnitedMasters. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for technology to change the economics for the artists.\u201d\nThe investment sets up a partnership between UnitedMasters and Apple.As streaming services, including Apple\u2019s, compete for subscribers, they are cutting more favorable deals with the artists who attract users to platforms. Spotify announced a project this week to detail how it pays musicians following community pressure. The deal with UnitedMasters is about \u201cempowering creators,\u201d Apple\u2019s Eddie Cue said.\nDamien Hirst, the renowned British artist, is getting intononfungible tokens, or NFTs. With a digital asset sale called \u201cThe Currency Project,\u201d he\u2019s among the first major established artists to join the crypto craze. It\u2019s a natural fit for him, because NFTs turn common things into unique and valuable assets, and money is a key theme of Mr. Hirst\u2019s art.\n\u201cNFTs are the most exciting new thing in the creative industry,\u201dMr. Hirst told DealBook. \u201cThe fact that they polarize people so much, and make so many people angry, just makes me even more sure of their importance.\u201d Mr. Hirst irked people back in 1991 with a gallery display of a 14-foot-long glass tank with a shark preserved in formaldehyde. In 2007, he sold askull encrusted in diamondsfor $100 million to an investment group he was secretly in on, thus inflating itsperceived worth. And while his latest project is not quite as outrageous, it certainly \u201cchallenges the concept of value through money and art,\u201d he said.\nTen thousand paper prints of cherry blossoms will be linked to digital tokens.The NFTs are for sale on Palm, a new platform backed by the blockchain entrepreneur Joe Lubin. The works, which have been in storage for the past five years, are born again via a kind of market that didn\u2019t exist when the prints were first made.\nFrom an investment standpoint, most NFTs are iffy,and may ultimately be worthless, said Megan Kaspar, the co-founder of Magnetic Capital, a blockchain incubator and investment firm. Until there is data on resales, no one knows which way things will go. Mr. Hirst\u2019s NFTs are arguably different from many, however, because they come with the physical prints \u2014 and his history of minting money.\nDeals\nThe F.T.C. sued to block the medical diagnostics company Illumina\u2019s $7.1 billion takeover of Grail, another sign of the U.S. government\u2019s tougher approach to antitrust enforcement.
