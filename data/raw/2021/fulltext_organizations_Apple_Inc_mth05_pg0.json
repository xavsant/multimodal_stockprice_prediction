        "title": "In Antitrust Trial, Tim Cook Argues Apple Doesn\u2019t Hurt App Makers",
        "fulltext": "Tim Cook, testifying on Friday in a trial that could undermine Apple\u2019s efforts to fend off growing scrutiny of its power, defended his business from accusations that it hurt app makers while on the hunt to expand its profits.\nMr. Cook, who took the witness stand for the first time as Apple\u2019s chief executive, answered friendly questions from anApplelawyer and faced pointed questions from both an opposing lawyer and the federal judge who will decide the case.\nThe trial\u2019s outcome could maintain Apple\u2019s dominance of the $100 billion app market or upend it.Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite,is suing Apple, claiming that the iPhone maker has created a monopoly with its App Store and uses that power to take an unfair cut from other companies that rely on the App Store to reach customers.\nAn Epic victory would invigorate an expanding antitrust fight against Apple. Federal and state regulators are scrutinizing Apple\u2019s control over the App Store, andthe European Union has recently charged Applewith violating antitrust laws over its app rules and fees. Apple faces two other federal lawsuits about its App Store fees \u2014 one from developers and one from iPhone owners \u2014 that are seeking class-action status.\nMr. Cook\u2019s testimony came toward the end of a three-week trial in an Oakland, Calif., federal court that has homed in on the power that Apple wields with its App Store and the 30 percent commission it takes on sales of most digital goods and subscriptions.\nHe entered the courthouse on Friday morning from an underground garage rather than its main entrance, which allowed him to avoid photographers gathered outside the front of the building. About 7:30 a.m., journalists spotted him going through security checks inside and shouted questions. Mr. Cook, wearing a dark gray suit, white shirt and gray tie, held up his hand in a peace sign.\nFor over an hour, an Apple lawyer led Mr. Cook through complaints against Apple, allowing him to explain why Apple conducted business a certain way \u2014 and why it wasn\u2019t harming app developers.\nMr. Cook testified that Apple faced plenty of competition, and he said commissions that Apple collected from app developers helped fund better security in the App Store. \u201cThere\u2019s a conflict between what the developer may want and what the consumer may want,\u201d he said. He added that Apple had lowered app-store fees for many developers much smaller than Epic.\nIn a cross-examination, an Epic lawyer took aim at Mr. Cook\u2019s credibility and questioned why Mr. Cook said he did not know some details of Apple\u2019s business, including the profit margins made from the App Store, which one outside expert testifying on behalf of Epic said could be as much as 80 percent.\nMr. Cook said that was wrong. He said the App Store was profitable, but Apple had not tried to determine precisely how profitable, in part because it would be difficult based on how Apple structured its costs.\nThe Epic lawyer challenged that claim, showing Mr. Cook internal Apple documents that suggested the company could calculate the App Store\u2019s profitability. Mr. Cook countered that the documents showed incomplete figures.\nThe Epic lawyer then spent time on a topic tangential to the trial but appeared intended to illustrate hypocrisy at Apple: The way the company operates in China, which undercuts Apple\u2019s public enthusiasm for consumer privacy. The New York Times reported this week thatApple had put its Chinese users\u2019 data at riskand aided the Chinese government\u2019s censorship by proactively removing apps.\nWhile Mr. Cook said Apple had to follow the laws in China, the Epic lawyer noted that other companies uncomfortable with Chinese policies had left the country. \u201cI know of nobody in the smartphone business who\u2019s not selling into China,\u201d Mr. Cook replied.\nThe most concerning moment for Mr. Cook and Apple came at the end of his testimony, when Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California joined in the interrogation of Mr. Cook.\nThroughout the trial, Judge Gonzalez Rogers asked pointed questions of witnesses from both Apple and Epic, and her back-and-forth with Mr. Cook on Friday revealed particularly intense scrutiny of Apple\u2019s arguments. Why couldn\u2019t Apple allow iPhone owners to have more options to purchase apps, she asked, especially if it meant lower prices for consumers?\n\u201cIf you allow people to leak out like that, we would, in essence, give up our total return on our\u201d intellectual property, Mr. Cook replied.\nThe judge asked whether Apple\u2019s decision last year to reduce its commission on app sales for developers who earned less than $1 million a year was designed to deflect scrutiny of Apple\u2019s App Store policies. Mr. Cook acknowledged scrutiny was a factor, but he added that Apple mostly wanted to help small developers affected by a weak economy during the coronavirus pandemic.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers then brought up a survey that said 39 percent of app developers were dissatisfied with how Apple managed the App Store. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that you feel, again, real pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act to address the concerns of the developers,\u201d she said.\nThe judge\u2019s biggest challenge in deciding the case may be defining the market that Epic and Apple are fighting over.\nEpic\u2019s lawyers have argued that the case is about iPhone apps and that a game maker has to go through Apple\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d to reach the more than a billion people who use the devices. That stifles innovation, Epic claims, and allows Apple to enforce strict rules and harm app developers by charging excessive fees. The company wants to host its own digital storefront within Apple\u2019s.\nMr. Cook said on Friday that he was \u201cnot a gamer,\u201d but he argued that Epic distributed its games in a number of ways, including on web browsers, gaming consoles and personal computers. Many of those platforms charge a commission similar to that of the App Store. If gaming is the market, Apple has argued, then there are many competitors \u2014 like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo \u2014 so Apple cannot have a monopoly.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers expressed frustration over the market semantics. \u201cOne side will say it\u2019s black, the other says it\u2019s white \u2014 typically it\u2019s somewhere in the gray,\u201d she said last week.\nEarlier in the trial, Trystan Kosmynka, a senior director at Apple, testified that the company rejected 40 percent of total app submissions in 2020. Apple could not effectively police which apps find their way onto iPhones if Epic had its own app store, Mr. Kosmynka said.\nEpic responded with a flurry of internal Apple emails showing times when harmful apps made it past Mr. Kosmynka\u2019s team. One app, which was released during the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, was a game that allowed users to shoot cannons at protesters.\nApple tried to show why allowing an app store within an app store could be problematic. Its lawyers criticized Epic\u2019s digital storefront for not maintaining tight enough control, saying companies had managed to use it to sell games that they called \u201coffensive and sexualized.\u201d\nIn an attempt to tie Epic to unsuitable content, Richard Doren, a lawyer for Apple, brought up Peely, a cartoon banana in Fortnite that sometimes wears a tuxedo and sometimes goes nude. Mr. Doren implied that it would have been inappropriate to display Peely without a tuxedo in a federal court. Matthew Weissinger, vice president of marketing at Epic, clarified that Peely, naked or suited, was not scandalous.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a banana man,\u201d he said.\nThe fight between the companies began in August, whenEpic violated Apple\u2019s rulesby circumventing Apple\u2019s payments system in the Fortnite app. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store, and Epic immediately sued the company and began a promotional campaign around the suit.\nOn the first day of the trial, Epic\u2019s chief executive, Tim Sweeney,testifiedthat his company had filed suit because he wanted to show the world the consequences of Apple\u2019s policies. Judge Gonzalez Rogers interrupted to ask whether Mr. Sweeney had known about a different developer\u2019s lawsuit against Apple.\nMr. Sweeney said he had.\n\u201cAnd you just ignored that and went on your own,\u201d the judge responded.\nThe trial will wrap up on Monday, but Judge Gonzalez Rogers said a ruling would probably take months. \u201cHopefully, before Aug. 13,\u201d she said. She also said her decision would probably be appealed, meaning the trial could be just the first chapter of a longer fight."

        "title": "Censorship, Surveillance and Profits: A Hard Bargain for Apple in China",
        "fulltext": "GUIYANG, China \u2014 On the outskirts of this city in a poor, mountainous province in southwesternChina, men in hard hats recently put the finishing touches on a white building a quarter-mile long with few windows and a tall surrounding wall. There was little sign of its purpose, apart from the flags of Apple and China flying out front, side by side.\nInside, Apple was preparing tostore the personal data of its Chinese customerson computer servers run by a state-owned Chinese firm.\nTim Cook,Apple\u2019schief executive,has said the data is safe. But at the data center in Guiyang, which Apple hoped would be completed by next month, and another in the Inner Mongolia region, Apple has largely ceded control to the Chinese government.\nChinese state employees physically manage the computers. Apple abandoned the encryption technology it used elsewhere after China would not allow it. And the digital keys that unlock information on those computers are stored in the data centers they\u2019re meant to secure.\nInternal Apple documents reviewed by The New York Times, interviews with 17 current and former Apple employees and four security experts, and new filings made in a court case in the United States last week provide rare insight into the compromises Mr. Cook has made to do business in China. They offer an extensive inside look \u2014 many aspects of which have never been reported before \u2014 at how Apple has given in to escalating demands from the Chinese authorities.\nTwo decades ago, as Apple\u2019s operations chief, Mr. Cook spearheadedthe company\u2019s entrance into China, a move that helped make Applethe most valuable company in the worldand made him the heir apparent to Steve Jobs. Apple now assembles nearly all of its products and earns a fifth of its revenue in the China region. But just as Mr. Cook figured out how to make China work for Apple, China is making Apple work for the Chinese government.\nMr. Cook often talks about Apple\u2019s commitment tocivil libertiesandprivacy. But to stay on the right side of Chinese regulators, his company has put the data of its Chinese customers at risk and has aided government censorship in the Chinese version of its App Store. After Chinese employees complained, it even dropped the \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d slogan from the backs ofiPhones.\nChina\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is increasing his demands on Western companies, and Mr. Cook has resisted those demands on a number of occasions. But he ultimately approved the plans to store customer data on Chinese servers and to aggressively censor apps, according to interviews with current and former Apple employees.\n\u201cApple has become a cog in the censorship machine that presents a government-controlled version of the internet,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, Asia director for Amnesty International, the human rights group. \u201cIf you look at the behavior of the Chinese government, you don\u2019t see any resistance from Apple \u2014 no history of standing up for the principles that Apple claims to be so attached to.\u201d\nWhile both the Trump and Biden administrations have taken a tougher line toward China, Apple\u2019s courtship of the Chinese government shows a disconnect between politicians in Washington and America\u2019s wealthiest company.\nMr. Cookhas been on a charm offensivein China, making frequent, statesmanlike visits and meeting with top leaders. On one trip in 2019, hetoured the Forbidden City, met with a start-up and posted about the trip on the Chinese social platform Weibo.\nBehind the scenes, Apple has constructed a bureaucracy that has become a powerful tool in China\u2019s vast censorship operation. It proactively censors its Chinese App Store, relying on software and employees to flag and block apps that Apple managers worry could run afoul of Chinese officials, according to interviews and court documents.\nA Times analysis found that tens of thousands of apps have disappeared from Apple\u2019s Chinese App Store over the past several years, more than previously known, including foreign news outlets, gay dating services and encrypted messaging apps. It also blocked tools fororganizing pro-democracy protestsandskirting internet restrictions, as well as apps about the Dalai Lama.\nAnd in its data centers, Apple\u2019s compromises have made it nearly impossible for the company to stop the Chinese government from gaining access to the emails, photos, documents, contacts and locations of millions of Chinese residents, according to the security experts and Apple engineers.\nThe company said ina statementthat it followed the laws in China and did everything it could to keep the data of customers safe. \u201cWe have never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate,\u201d the company said.\nAn Apple spokesman said that the company still controlled the keys that protect the data of its Chinese customers and that Apple used its most advanced encryption technology in China \u2014 more advanced than what it used in other countries.\nApple added that it removed appsonly to comply with Chinese laws. \u201cThese decisions are not always easy, and we may not agree with the laws that shape them,\u201d the company said. \u201cBut our priority remains creating the best user experience without violating the rules we are obligated to follow.\u201d\nMr. Cook declined an interview for this article. In public appearances, he has said that while he often disagrees with China\u2019s laws, the world is better off with Apple in China.\n\u201cYour choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?\u201dhe said at a conference in China in 2017. \u201cMy own view very strongly is: You show up and you participate. You get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.\u201d\nIn 2014, Apple hired Doug Guthrie, the departing dean of the George Washington University business school, to help the company navigate China, a country he had spent decades studying.\nOne of his first research projects was Apple\u2019s Chinese supply chain, which involved millions of workers, thousands of plants and hundreds of suppliers. The Chinese government made that operation possibleby spending billions of dollarsto pave roads, recruit workers, and construct factories, power plants and employee housing.\nMr. Guthrie concluded that no other country could offer the scale, skills, infrastructure and government assistance that Apple required. Chinese workers assemble nearly every iPhone, iPad and Mac. Apple brings in $55 billion a year from the region, far more than any other American company makes in China.\n\u201cThis business model only really fits and works in China,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said in an interview. \u201cBut then you\u2019re married to China.\u201d\nThe Chinese government was starting to pass laws that gave the country greater leverage over Apple, and Mr. Guthrie said he believed Mr. Xi would soon start seeking concessions. Apple, he realized, had no Plan B.\n\u201cFor Chinese authorities, this is no longer about, \u2018How much money are you pouring into China?\u2019 This is about, \u2018What are you giving back?\u2019\u201d Mr. Guthrie said.\nMr. Guthrie delivered his warning to Mr. Cook\u2019s top deputies, including Phil Schiller, a longtime marketing chief; Eddy Cue, head of internet software and services; Lisa Jackson, the company\u2019s government affairs chief; and Jeff Williams, its operations chief, who is widely viewed as Mr. Cook\u2019s right-hand man.\nAs Mr. Guthrie was delivering his warnings, Apple set about keeping the Chinese government happy. Part of that effort was new research and development centers in China. But those R&D centers complicated Apple\u2019s image as a California company. At a summit for its new Chinese engineers and designers, Apple showeda videothat ended with a phrase that Apple had been inscribing on the backs of iPhones for years: \u201cDesigned by Apple in California.\u201d\nThe Chinese employees were angered, according to Mr. Guthrie and another person in the room. If the products were designed in California, they shouted, then what were they doing in China?\n\u201cThe statement was deeply offensive to them,\u201d said Mr. Guthrie, who left Apple in 2019 to return to his home in Michigan. \u201cThey were just furious.\u201d\nThe next iPhone didn\u2019t include the phrase.\nIn November 2016, China approveda lawrequiring that all \u201cpersonal information and important data\u201d that is collected in China be kept in China.\nIt was bad news for Apple, which had staked its reputation on keeping customers\u2019 data safe. While Apple regularly responded to court orders for access to customer data, Mr. Cook hadrebuffed the F.B.I.after it demanded Apple\u2019s help breaking into an iPhone belonging to a terrorist involved in thekilling of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. Now the Chinese government had an even broader request.\nOther companies faced a similar dilemma in China, but Apple was uniquely exposed because of its high profile and acute dependence on the country.\nApple\u2019s iCloud service allows customers to store some of their most sensitive data \u2014 things like personal contacts, photos and emails \u2014 in the company\u2019s data centers. The service can back up everything stored on an iPhone or Mac computer, and can reveal the current location of a user\u2019s Apple devices. Most of that data for Chinese customers was stored on servers outside China.\nApple\u2019s China team warned Mr. Cook that China could shut down iCloud in the country if it did not comply with the new cybersecurity law. So Mr. Cook agreed to move the personal data of his Chinese customers to the servers of a Chinese state-owned company. That led to a project known inside Apple as \u201cGolden Gate.\u201d\nApple encrypts customers\u2019 private data in its iCloud service. But for most of that information, Apple also has the digital keys to unlock that encryption.\nThe location of the keys to the data of Chinese customers was a sticking point in talks between Apple and Chinese officials, two people close to the deliberations said. Apple wanted to keep them in the United States; the Chinese officials wanted them in China.\nThecybersecurity law went into effectin June 2017. In an initial agreement between Apple and Chinese officials, the location of the keys was left intentionally vague, one person said.\nBut eight months later, the encryption keys were headed to China. That surprised at least two Apple executives who worked on the initial negotiations and who said the move could jeopardize customers\u2019 data. It is unclear what led to the change.\nDocuments reviewed by The Times do not show that the Chinese government has gained access to the data. They only indicate that Apple has made compromises that make it easier for the government to do so.\nWith the keys in China, the government has two avenues to the data, security experts said: demand it \u2014 or take it without asking.\nThe Chinese government regularly demands data from Chinese companies, often for law-enforcement investigations. Chinese law requires the companies to comply.\nU.S. law has long prohibited American companies from turning over data to Chinese law enforcement. But Apple and the Chinese government have made an unusual arrangement to get around American laws.\nIn China, Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers\u2019 data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the government of Guizhou Province, whose capital is Guiyang. Apple recently required its Chinese customers to acceptnew iCloud terms and conditionsthat list GCBD as the service provider and Apple as \u201can additional party.\u201d Apple told customers the change was to \u201cimprove iCloud services in China mainland and comply with Chinese regulations.\u201d\nThe terms and conditions included a new provision that does not appear in other countries: \u201cApple and GCBD will have access to all data that you store on this service\u201d and can share that data \u201cbetween each other under applicable law.\u201d\nUnder the new setup, Chinese authorities ask GCBD \u2014 not Apple \u2014 for Apple customers\u2019 data, Apple said. Apple believes that gives it a legal shield from American law, according to a person who helped create the arrangement. GCBD declined to answer questions about its Apple partnership.\nIn the three years before China\u2019s cybersecurity law went into effect, Apple never provided the contents of a user\u2019s iCloud account to the Chinese authorities and challenged 42 Chinese government requests for such data, according to statistics released by the company. Apple said it challenged those requests because they were illegal under U.S. law.\nIn the three years after the law kicked in, Apple said it provided the contents of an undisclosed number of iCloud accounts to the government in nine cases and challenged just three government requests.\nApple still appears to provide far more data to U.S. law enforcement. Over that same period, from 2013 through June 2020, Apple said it turned over the contents of iCloud accounts to U.S. authorities in 10,781 separate cases.\nChinese officials say their cybersecurity law is intended to protect Chinese residents\u2019 data from foreign governments. People close to Apple suggested that the Chinese authorities often don\u2019t need Apple\u2019s data, and thus demand it less often, because theyalready surveil their citizens in myriad other ways.\nBut the iCloud data in China is vulnerable to the Chinese government because Apple made a series of compromises to meet the authorities\u2019 demands, according to dozens of pages of internal Apple documents on the planned design and security of the Chinese iCloud system, which were reviewed for The Times by an Apple engineer and four independent security researchers.\nThe documents show that GCBD employees would have physical control over the servers, while Apple employees would largely monitor the operation from outside the country. The security experts said that arrangement alone represented a threat that no engineer could solve.\n\u201cChinese intelligence has physical control over your hardware \u2014 that\u2019s basically a threat level you can\u2019t let it get to,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University.\nApple said it designed the iCloud security \u201cin such a way that only Apple has control of the encryption keys.\u201d\nThe documents also show that Apple is using different encryption technology in China than elsewhere in the world, contradictingwhat Mr. Cook suggested in a 2018 interview.\nThe digital keys that can decrypt iCloud data are usually stored on specialized devices, called hardware security modules, that aremade by Thales, a French technology company. But China would not approve the use of the Thales devices, according to two employees. So Apple created new devices to store the keys in China.\nThe documents, from early 2020, indicated that Apple had planned to base the new devices on an older version of iOS, the software underpinning iPhones, which is among the most targeted systems by hackers. Apple also planned to use low-cost hardware originally designed for the Apple TV. That alarmed the security researchers.\nBut Apple said that the documents included outdated information and that its Chinese data centers \u201cfeature our very latest and most sophisticated protections,\u201d which would eventually be used in other countries.\nThe Chinese government must approve any encryption technology that Apple uses in China, according to two current Apple employees.\n\u201cThe Chinese are serial iPhone breakers,\u201d said Ross J. Anderson, a University of Cambridge cybersecurity researcher who reviewed the documents. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that they will have the ability to break into the servers.\u201d\nApple has tried to isolate the Chinese servers from the rest of its iCloud network, according to the documents. The Chinese network would be \u201cestablished, managed, and monitored separately from all other networks, with no means of traversing to other networks out of country.\u201d Two Apple engineers said the measure was to prevent security breaches in China from spreading to the rest of Apple\u2019s data centers.\nApple said that it sequestered the Chinese data centers because they are, in effect, owned by the Chinese government, and Apple keeps all third parties disconnected from its internal network.\nIn Cupertino, Calif., Apple engineers have been racing to finish designs for the new Chinese iCloud. In a presentation to some engineers last year, according to slides viewed by The Times, managers made clear that the stakes were high.\n\u201cThere will be immense pressure to get it done. We agreed to this timeline three years ago,\u201d said one slide. \u201cImportant people put their reputations on the line. iCloud needs influential friends in China.\u201d\nThe documents showed that Apple\u2019s deadline to start storing data in the new Chinese data centers was June 2021.\nIn early 2018,Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire, was spending much of his time in Manhattan trying to broadcast his claims of corruption inside the Communist Party. His latest effort was an iPhone app in China that delivered those claims.\nBefore his app even became available on iPhones, the Chinese government was trying to block it. Shortly after Mr. Guo applied to the App Store, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government\u2019s internet regulator, told Apple it wanted the app rejected. It was unclear how the officials knew about it.\nThose events and the chain reaction they set off inside Apple were laid out in court documents last week in a wrongful-termination case against the company. The documents and interviews shine a light on a bureaucracy inside Apple designed to censor and block apps, often proactively, to appease the Chinese government.\nOn Feb. 4, 2018, shortly after the Chinese authorities demanded that Mr. Guo\u2019s app be rejected, an Apple manager emailed a colleague with a question: Did Mr. Guo belong on Apple\u2019s \u201cChina sensitivities list,\u201d along with the likes of Falun Gong \u2014 the Chinese spiritual movement \u2014 and the Dalai Lama?\nThe colleague replied that Mr. Guo probably should be on the list, given that he had been spreading unverifiable defamatory stories about Chinese officials. She suggested that the question be elevated to Apple\u2019s \u201cexecutive review board,\u201d a group of executives who decide the trickiest App Store issues, including top deputies to Mr. Cook.\nTwo weeks later, the board said Mr. Guo belonged on Apple\u2019s China blacklist. Apple employees added his name to the company\u2019s internal \u201cChinese App Store Removal wiki page,\u201d according to the documents, as well as a software program that would automatically tag any apps that mentioned him.\nSix months later, Mr. Guo submitted his app again, with changes to elude Apple\u2019s software. Trieu Pham, an app reviewer in Cupertino, was assigned the app. He didn\u2019t find anything that violated Apple\u2019s rules. On Aug. 2, he approved it.\nThree weeks later, Trystan Kosmynka, Apple\u2019s app review chief, sent an email to several managers at 2:32 a.m. The subject line was \u201cHot: Guo.\u201d The Chinese government had spotted Mr. Guo\u2019s new app, and Mr. Kosmynka wanted to know how it had gotten published.\n\u201cThis app and any Guo Wengui app cannot be on the China store,\u201d he wrote, according to the emails filed in the court case. \u201cCan we put the necessary pieces in place to prevent that ASAP.\u201d\nApple pulled the app and began investigating. A resulting report said the app was published because the \u201cChina hide process was not followed,\u201d according to court documents. It said that Mr. Pham, the app reviewer, should have sent the app to Apple\u2019s Chinese language specialists, who had been trained on which topics to block in the Chinese App Store, including Mr. Guo.\nWhen Apple managers questioned Mr. Pham, he told them the app didn\u2019t violate any policies. The managers responded that the app criticized the Chinese government, Mr. Pham said in court documents, and that this was enough for rejection.\nSix months later, Apple fired Mr. Pham. In response,he sued the company, accusing it of pushing him out to appease the Chinese government.\nApple said it removed Mr. Guo\u2019s app in China because it had determined it was illegal there. Apple said it fired Mr. Pham because of poor performance.\nMr. Guo\u2019s media outlets have ahistory of peddling misinformation. The exact nature of the apps in the 2018 case was unclear, though court documents said they discussed Chinese Communist Party corruption.\nPhillip Shoemaker, who ran Apple\u2019s App Store from 2009 to 2016, said in an interview that Apple lawyers in China gave his team a list of topics that couldn\u2019t appear in apps in the country, including Tiananmen Square and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. He said Apple\u2019s policy was matter-of-fact: If the lawyers believed a topic was off-limits in China, then Apple would remove it there.\nOn Chinese iPhones, Apple forbids apps about the Dalai Lama while hosting those fromthe Chinese paramilitary groupaccused of detaining and abusing Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in China.\nThe company has also helped China spread its view of the world. Chinese iPhones censor the emoji of the Taiwanese flag, and their maps suggest Taiwan is part of China. For a time, simply typing the word \u201cTaiwan\u201dcould make an iPhone crash, according to Patrick Wardle, a former hacker at the National Security Agency.\nSometimes, Mr. Shoemaker said, he was awakened in the middle of the night with demands from the Chinese government to remove an app. If the app appeared to mention the banned topics, he would remove it, but he would send more complicated cases to senior executives, including Mr. Cue and Mr. Schiller.\nApple resisted an order from the Chinese government in 2012 to remove The Times\u2019s apps. But five years later, it ultimately did. Mr. Cook approved the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nApple recently began disclosing how often governments demand that it remove apps. In the two years ending June 2020, the most recent data available, Apple said it approved 91 percent of the Chinese government\u2019s app-takedown requests, removing 1,217 apps.\nIn every other country combined over that period, Apple approved 40 percent of requests, removing 253 apps. Apple said that most of the apps it removed for the Chinese government were related to gambling or pornography or were operating without a government license, such as loan services and livestreaming apps.\nYet a Times analysis of Chinese app data suggests those disclosures represent a fraction of the apps that Apple has blocked in China. Since 2017, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple\u2019s App Store in China, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by Sensor Tower, an app data firm. Most of those apps have remained available in other countries.\nNumber of apps that disappeared from the iOS App Store in China by month through February 2021\nNote: Includes apps that were active at their time of removal (i.e. were updated less than a year before leaving the Chinese iOS store) and have not returned as of March 11, 2021.\nSource: SensorTower\nThe New York Times\nMore than 35,000 of those apps were games, which in China must get approval from regulators. The remaining 20,000 cut across a wide range of categories. Apps that mapped users\u2019 runs, edited selfies or taught sexual positions were removed. So were apps that allowed users to message privately, share documents and browse websites the Chinese government had blocked. More than 600 news apps also disappeared.\nApple disputed those figures, saying that some developers remove their own apps from China. Apple said that since 2017, it had taken down 70 news apps in response to Chinese government demands.\nThe discrepancy between Apple\u2019s disclosures and the Times analysis is in part because Apple is removing apps before China\u2019s internet censors even complain. Apple does not disclose such takedowns in its statistics.\nMr. Shoemaker said he and his team rationalized removing apps by framing them as simply enforcing a country\u2019s laws. Similar steps were taken in places like Saudi Arabia and Russia, he said. \u201cAt the same time, we didn\u2019t want to get hauled up in front of the Senate to talk about why we\u2019re quote \u2018censoring apps in China,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tightrope we had to walk.\u201d\nRaymond Zhongreported from Guiyang.Keith Bradshercontributed reporting from Guiyang."

        "title": "Apple and Epic Games head to court over app revenue.",
        "fulltext": "Apple and Epic Games, maker of the wildly popular game Fortnite, are set to square off on Monday in a trial that could decide how much control Apple can exert over the app economy. The trial is scheduled to open with testimony from Tim Sweeney, the chief of Epic, on why he believesApple is a monopoly abusing its power.\nThe trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, carries major implications, Jack Nicas and Erin Griffith report in The New York Times. If Epic wins, it will upend the economics of the $100 billion app market and create a path for millions of companies and developers to avoid sendingup to 30 percent of their app salesto Apple.\nAn Epic victory would also invigorate the antitrust fight against Apple. Federal and state regulators are scrutinizing Apple\u2019s control over the App Store, and on Friday,the European Union charged Applewith violating antitrust laws over its app rules and fees. Apple faces two other federal lawsuits about its App Store fees \u2014 one from developers and one from iPhone owners \u2014 that are seeking class-action status.\nBeating Apple would also bode well for Epic\u2019s coming trial against Google over the same issues on the app store for Android devices. That case is expected to go to trial this year and would be decided bythe same federal judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California.\nIf Apple wins, however, it will strengthen its grip over mobile apps and stifle its growing chorus of critics, further empowering a company that is already the world\u2019s most valuable and topped $200 billion in sales over just the past six months."

        "title": "Why You Should Care About Privacy",
        "fulltext": "Hi everyone, we made it to Friday. It\u2019s been a busy, and heavy, newsweek on The Daily: We revisited the insurrection at the Capitol, analyzed an uneven post-pandemic economic recovery and called a young woman living through airstrikes in Gaza.\nToday in the newsletter, we speak to two people who we thought could help us make sense of some of the stories you\u2019ve heard on the show recently.\nFirst, we look back at our recent coverage of Big Tech and ask one expert: What are the long-term implications of the feud between Apple and Facebook? Then, one of our producers who is focused on international news shares what else you need to know about the Israeli-Hamas conflict.\nOver the last few months on the show, we\u2019ve gone inside the mercurial world of Big Tech, covering how Robinhood facilitated theGameStop rebellion, the rise ofNFTs, apush for unionization at Amazon, the first major ruling ofFacebook\u2019s new oversight boardand the escalation of tensions betweenApple and Facebook.\nAnd in each episode, we\u2019ve wondered: In the ever-evolving world of Silicon Valley, what changes will stick? How seismic are these stories, really?\nSo for today\u2019s newsletter, we called someone who spends all of her time asking that question \u2014 peering into the future as she analyzes how the tech titans are changing our world: Shoshana Zuboff, the author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\u201d\nWe spoke with Shoshana specifically about thesignificance of the feud between Apple and Facebookin regards to privacy protections long term, the topic of our May 11 show. In the process, we also asked her about the prospect of platform regulation and her vision for a less-extractive digital future. Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited.\nApple has introduceda software update, called App Tracking Transparency, that limits an app\u2019s ability to extract personal data from iPhone users \u2014 a primary source of economic power for platform companies like Facebook that monetize the intimate details of our digital lives. How significant is App Tracking Transparency in limiting that power?\nIt\u2019s significant. But what I think a lot of folks reading the headlines perhaps don\u2019t understand is that what this App Tracking Transparency notification does on your iPhone is it limits applications from tracking us across to other applications and across devices.\nWhat this does not do is prevent these very same applications, including Facebook, which is the big whale in this discussion, from collecting data within their own application. This is a massive surveillance empire worth hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. But we call it an app.\nAnd App Tracking Transparency has no bearing on Facebook\u2019s, or any other application\u2019s, ability to continue tracking you, collecting every aspect of your behavior, your activities, your thoughts and feelings.\nSo, yes, it does take a big bite out of some of the things that they currently do, especially as they reach for this rich diversity of data, which is so important to them. But does it limit their ability to illegitimately convert our lives into data, which they then declare as their private property? No.\nWhy does it matter that these big tech companies can mine personal data for profit?\nAs we allow these companies to amass this huge scale of human-generated data, we\u2019re changing the nature of our society.\nBecause, first of all, we\u2019re allowing them to create these huge asymmetries of knowledge about people. Instead of this being a golden age of the democratization of knowledge, it\u2019s turned into something very different from what any of us expected. The last 20 years have seen, especially the last decade, the wholesale destruction of privacy.\nAnd operationally, what happens is they get to a point where they know so much about us that they can fashion targeting mechanisms. We\u2019re not just talking about targeted ads. We\u2019re talking about subliminal cues, psychological microtargeting, real-time rewards and punishments, algorithmic recommendation tools and engineered social comparison dynamics.\nWe have seen the scourge of disinformation on social media, wenow know from research, driving a huge number of unnecessary Covid deaths because of disinformation campaigns and also having a huge role in producing the seditious tragedy ofJan. 6.What is so important for folks to understand is that these are all connected points in one process. And the process is called how knowledge becomes power.\nApple\u2019s products are expensive. Is there a premium on privacy that only some can afford?\nAndroid, of course, is by far the dominant smartphone in most countries. We see people who can\u2019t afford privacy. And the idea of privacy as a luxury is a profoundly intolerable idea.\nCan you talk about how the pandemic has empowered these tech companies in their data collection?\nWhat\u2019s happening in this remote education space now is truly frightening.\nThe huge irony here is that the outbreak of the pandemic was exactly the same time frame in which theNew Mexico attorney general filed his class-action suitagainst Google Classroom, citing its illicit data extraction practices aimed at children.\nNow you\u2019ve got this whole sector called school safety technology. And then another sector called proctoring systems, which are these for-profit companies that attach to Google Classroom. When you dig into what these systems are doing, they\u2019re being paid by school systems, school districts for these services and, the so-called safety systems, they\u2019re tracking everything from notifications from social media, email files, chats, posts, messages, all documents, anything to do with the remote schooling activities. And then the proctoring systems, they\u2019re doing facial recognition, gaze and eye movements to track attention. They\u2019re producing what they call \u201csuspicion scores.\u201d They\u2019re also taking microphones. They\u2019re taking cameras. They\u2019re insisting that cameras record your surroundings and broadcast that to the proctor.\nAnd students and their families have no pushback because they\u2019re saying that students can\u2019t even access the data. They\u2019re not even doing a performative statement where they\u2019re agreeing to limit retention or third-party sharing. They can just do whatever they want.\nRead the rest of ourQ. and A. with Shoshanaand listen to ourBig Tech playliston Spotify.\nByDesiree IbekweandMahima Chablani\nAfter 11 days ofintense and deadly conflictbetween Israel and Hamas, a cease-fire has come into effect and the fighting has paused \u2014 at least for the moment.\nOn The Daily, we have covered thereasons for the surge in tensions,analyzed President Biden\u2019sdelicate diplomatic responseand heard from a resident in Gaza about what her life has been like.\n\u201cLife has always been hard and I don\u2019t know how this is going to end,\u201d Rahf Hallaq, the 21-year-old university student from the north west of Gaza City,told us. \u201cBut right now I have one concern. I want to survive it.\u201d\nAlong withRachelle Bonja, a member of The Daily\u2019s international stories team, we thought we\u2019d share some articles that have helped us understand the breadth of the conflict.\nCease-fires can be fragile and short-lived:As a cease-fire officially began between Israel and Hamas at 2 a.m. on Friday, diplomats and Middle East experts have cautioned that cease-fires are precarious agreements. While they can offer periods of calm to allow time for a longer-term deal and give civilians a chance to regroup, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office warned that \u201cthe reality on the ground will determine the continuation of the campaign.\u201d\nViolence fueled on WhatsApp:Last week, a message appeared in a new WhatsApp group called \u201cDeath to the Arabs,\u201d urging Israelis to join a street brawl against Palestinian citizens of Israel. Since then, Jewish extremists have formed more than 100 new groups on WhatsApp. While messaging apps have been used before to inspire violence and spread hate speech, these groups go even further by documenting and executing violent acts.\nWhat Israelis said about the violence:On the streets of Israel, before the cease-fire was announced, Times journalists took the temperature of residents. In Tel Aviv, residents said that they were trying to go about their daily lives but that there was an edginess in the air. The conflict was polarizing when it came to apportioning blame. Amir Efrimi, a designer, blamed Prime Minister Netanyahu for aggravating tensions in Jerusalem. \u201cWe have been in these situations before where horrible footage is screened on TV, but I have never gotten condemnations from regular people in other countries,\u201d Mr. Efrimi said.\n\u201cSocial media is the mass protest\u201d:In the past, when the conflict between Israel and Hamas led to large-scale casualties, there would be mass protests on the streets of many Arab nations. This time, the protests have been smaller and more scattered, with solidarity with the Palestinians shifting online \u2014 and going global (protests have taken place in America and Europe).\nMonday:Hundreds of people have been arrested and charged in connection with the Capitol riots. Bringing them to justice haspresented some unusual challenges.\nTuesday:A recent jobs report suggested that the pandemic recovery has lost momentum.We look into why.\nWednesday:A conversationwith Rahf Hallaq, a 21-year-old English language and literature student and resident of Gaza City.\nThursday:Thelong and complex relationshipbetween President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel.\nFriday:Two former soldierson how the war in Afghanistan \u2014 America\u2019s longest conflict \u2014 has shaped their lives.\nCheck out the trailer for our new series Day X, the season finale of Still Processing \u2014 and our favorite narrated articles of the week.\nHave thoughts about the show?

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nApplewouldn\u2019t be the company it is today withoutChina. It\u2019s where Apple manufactures nearly all of its products and sells many of them.\nBut my colleagues have a disturbing newarticleabout what Apple\u2019s dependence on China costs the company and China\u2019s citizens. Reading it left me questioning whether it\u2019s worth it for Apple and other American companies to operate in China if it means flouting their principles.\nJack Nicas, one of the reporters for the article, spoke to me about their investigation into the compromises that Apple makes to stay in the good graces of the Chinese government.\nShira: It\u2019s been clear for a long time that Apple is obeying Chinese laws in ways the company doesn\u2019t love. What was new and notable from your reporting?\nJack:We knew that the company had moved data from Chinese users of Apple devicesinside China\u2019s borders. We knew that Apple hadremoved appsat the Chinese government\u2019s request. What we didn\u2019t know until now was the degree to which Apple had acquiesced to the Chinese government\u2019s demands in both cases.\nWhy does it matter where and how Apple stores data from Chinese citizens\u2019 iPhones and other devices?\nApple\u2019s actions could in some ways make Chinese users\u2019 information \u2014 such as emails, digital address books, photos and locations \u2014 an inviting target for the government.\nApple agreed to move data that Chinese users save in iCloud to computer centers that are owned and operated by a Chinese state-owned company. Government employees physically manage the computers. The digital keys to unlock the data are saved on those computers. And Apple is using a technology to encrypt this data that it doesn\u2019t use anywhere else in the world because China wouldn\u2019t approve its other technology.\nSecurity experts and an Apple engineer who reviewed internal Apple documents for us said that the company almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the Chinese government from accessing Chinese users\u2019 potentially private and sensitive information.\ntranscript\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\nToday: Apple built the world\u2019s most valuable business by figuring out how to make China work for Apple. But a Times investigation has found that that dynamic has now changed and that China has figured out how to make Apple work for China. Sabrina Tavernise spoke with one of the reporters behind that investigation, Jack Nicas.\nIt\u2019s Monday, June 14.\nJack, tell me how you got into this story about Apple\u2019s relationship with China.\nSure. So I started covering Apple for The Times in early 2018, when Apple was really starting to push its stance on privacy. It was becoming a main selling point for Apple. This is when Facebook was facing a lot of scandal about how it was handling user data, and Apple saw that as an opportunity to differentiate itself from its rivals.\nI think it\u2019s \u2014 privacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\nWe even see Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., in interviews saying privacy is a fundamental human right.\nThis is like freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and privacy is right up there for us. And so we\u2019ve always done this.\nApple was making its pitch to consumers that they can trust their data with Apple. Now, what was interesting about Apple\u2019s push with privacy was I knew that Apple was deeply embedded in China. Apple was manufacturing virtually every Apple device in China, and it was selling $47 billion a year there \u2014 its number 2 market after the United States.\nAnd at the same time, China is ramping up its surveillance and also its censorship operation, and was not a country that cared a lot about privacy. And so I was interested to understand how Apple was reconciling its focus on privacy with the reality that it was so deeply embedded in China.\nOK, let\u2019s start there. How did Apple become so deeply embedded in China in the first place?\nWell, I think we have to go back to the late 1990s.\n\nApple computer, a pioneer in the personal computers and software business, has fallen on hard times. It decided to lay off 1,300 workers.\nThis may be surprising to some listeners, but Apple was actually on the brink of bankruptcy at that time.\nApple once promised a computer for everyone, but now the standard computer is not a Mac, but a PC.\nAnd to save the company \u2014\nApple computer has named Steve Jobs its interim chief executive officer.\n\u2014 the board of directors brought back Steve Jobs, their co-founder. And over the next several years \u2014\nThis is iMac. The whole thing is translucent. You can see into it. It\u2019s so cool.\n\u2014 Steve Jobs oversaw a few hit products. There was this colorful iMac.\nIt looks like it\u2019s from another planet, a planet with better designers. How many times have you gone on the road with a CD player and said, oh, god, the CD \u2014 I didn\u2019t bring the CD I want to listen to.\nAnd then there was the iPod.\nTo have your whole music library with you at all times is a quantum leap in listening to music.\nNow, Apple was still actually manufacturing products in the United States, but Tim Cook, who was the chief operating officer at the time, realized that it wasn\u2019t really sustainable because of high labor costs. And also, there wasn\u2019t just a lot of other factories and suppliers in the United States. So there wasn\u2019t this condensed supply chain.\nSo Apple was starting to move to Asia. It was manufacturing in Japan and Taiwan and Korea. And then in 2001, something really interesting on the global stage happened.\nBy adding China to the W.T.O., we strengthen the organization.\nThe World Trade Organization and all of its countries, including the United States, admitted China as a member.\nChina is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy\u2019s most cherished values \u2014 economic freedom.\nIn previous years, China and the communist government had this state-run, tightly controlled economy. And there were a lot of obstacles to do business there.\nThe W.T.O. agreement will move China in the right direction. It will advance the goals America has worked for in China for the past three decades. And, of course, it will advance our own economic interests.\nAnd so what was really important about China joining the W.T.O. was that it meant that China now had to abide by these international standards for manufacturing and trade, and the Chinese government had to be a little bit more hands-off toward private companies. And so Apple decided to try to test the waters there.\nSo China joined the W.T.O., which meant a company like Apple would have more protections operating there. But why did Apple decide to go to China as opposed to expanding, say, in Korea or Japan or Taiwan, where it was already manufacturing stuff?\nWell, Apple was suddenly growing very rapidly. The iPod had become a smash hit. And it started to realize that it was going to need more space and more labor to keep up with demand. And so China, especially, was appealing because it obviously had an enormous labor force.\nThere was very rapidly a supply chain that was building out there with many different suppliers already based there, which made manufacturing products easy. And the Chinese government crucially was pouring literally billions of dollars into infrastructure and factories to build out the supply chain and really make it easy for companies like Apple to come in and make these rather advanced products there.\nAnd when you say build out the supply chain, what exactly does that mean? What\u2019s the government doing?\nSure. We\u2019re talking about paving roads sometimes right through villages, building power plants, building employee housing, building factories. Let me give you an example that I think best illustrates this.\nSo one of my sources was a former senior Apple executive. And he told me about a story in 2004 when Apple was trying to build a large iPod factory in China. And when he visited the site with a partner in China, they were looking around. And he wanted to know where they were going to build the factory. And the partners said, right here.\nAnd the problem was there was a small mountain in the place where the factory was supposed to be. And he was confused. He said, this factory is supposed to be built in six to seven months. There\u2019s a mountain there. And the partner said, just trust us.\nSo six to seven months later, my source returned to China. And he was astonished to see that the mountain was essentially gone. And there was, indeed, an iPod factory there almost up and running and employees getting in there. And that was a show of the Chinese government\u2019s might and its investment and its ability to attract a company like Apple.\nSo China is quite literally willing to move mountains for this company?\nTotally. I mean, this really illustrated to Apple that China was where it wanted to be. So Apple made a bet on China. And the bet was that China would not only be a great place to do business in the short term, but that the Chinese government and China itself would be a great business partner and not put restrictions on how Apple did business over the long term. And there was no reason to really think otherwise. China had really been moving in just one direction. The place was opening up economically. And there was a belief among many economists and politicians and business leaders in the Western world that the more Western companies poured money into China, the more China would economically open up, the more it would politically liberalize, and the more China would resemble the Western world.\nOK. So this bet that Apple makes on China in 2004, how quickly does it start to pay off?\nBasically immediately. It was pretty clear from the early days of the iPod in China that China was going to be able to handle that business. And they made a decision that would actually prove to be far more consequential down the road, and that was to build their next product there.\nToday, Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and we are calling it iPhone.\nNow the iPhone launched in 2007. And \u2014\nThere\u2019s always hype surrounding new gadgets from Apple, but this is an all new level.\n\u2014 pretty quickly, it was a hit product.\nPeople have even waited in line for several days.\nI\u2019ve got food here, waters here, some snacks.\nWhat about sleeping?\nSleeping? I sleep right here in my chair.\nIn those first few years, the iPhone doubled in sales and doubled in sales and doubled in sales. And China was keeping up.\nReally, Apple is the story \u2014 better than expected earnings, profits up 47 percent, strong iPhone sales, strong Mac sales.\nAnd also in 2009, Apple began selling iPhones in China.\nAnd that is a huge consumer market?\nAbsolutely. And I think Apple saw that from the early days, that this was one reason to get into China.\nI think the upside over the next couple of quarters is all going to be driven by the iPhone and, most notably, China, the ramp-up of China. That\u2019s going to be a huge opportunity for them, as well as \u2014\nSo by this time, 2009, things are going really great. But there are also some warning signs. In 2009, China actually blocked Twitter and Facebook. And the following year, China was caught hacking Google and also was trying to censor Google search results. And so Google very abruptly pulled out of the country. And so at that moment, many of the tech companies were either being blocked or were fleeing China.\nSo these moves by the Chinese government seem like signs that, OK, China may be opening up economically, but politically the country was not liberalizing?\nRight. But Apple, meanwhile, was really doubling down and becoming more entrenched in the country. iPhone sales are skyrocketing. Apple\u2019s now selling in China, which is helping that. And to keep up, Apple and China are building bigger and bigger factories. And \u2014\nApple\u2019s dominance continues. The company announced it sold more than 2 million iPads in less than two months.\n\u2014 Apple again decides to build its next new product, the iPad, in China. Then in 2011 \u2014\nThe Tim Cook era begins at Apple. C.E.O. and \u2014\n\u2014 Tim Cook, who really was the mastermind of Apple\u2019s entrance into China, is rewarded with the job of C.E.O. after Steve Jobs becomes sick and eventually dies. And then finally, as the biggest affirmation and the biggest evidence of the success of Apple\u2019s bet on China \u2014\nApple is now the most valuable company on the face of the planet. The iPhone \u2014\n\u2014 Apple becomes the world\u2019s most valuable company, surpassing ExxonMobil.\nYep. It was all because of the iPhone and the iPad, Andrew. These two gadgets \u2014\nAt this point, Apple is really on top of the world, and that never would have been possible without China.\nBut shortly after that, China starts to change the terms of its relationship with Apple, and things become a lot more complicated.\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nSo Jack, you were talking about changes happening in China that really kind of changed the terms of the bet Apple was making. What were those changes?\nRight. Well, it really has to do with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. So in 2013, there is a change in government. And a new president assumes power, Xi Jinping. And he has a very different style than his predecessors. And from that day on, the relationship between Apple and China fundamentally changed.\nHow so?\nWell, I can actually just start with literally the first week of the presidency.\n\nSo he assumes power on March 14, 2013. And the very next day, Apple was under attack.\n[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nChina Central Television, which was the main government broadcaster, aired a report criticizing Apple.\n[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nAnd basically, they were saying that Apple doesn\u2019t issue long enough warranties for its products. The implication was that Apple was ripping off Chinese consumers.\n[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nAnd very quickly, there was this coordinated criticism of the company across Chinese society. The Chinese state-owned newspapers were calling Apple a quote, unquote, \u201cscoundrel.\u201d Chinese celebrities were all criticizing the company on social media. And it was really clear that this was a sign on just the second day of Xi Jinping\u2019s administration that the Chinese government was taking a different tact with Apple.\nBut why? Why would Xi Jinping and the Communist Party decide to attack Apple so suddenly after this incredibly successful and profitable relationship they had cultivated for more than a decade?\nWell, it\u2019s because Xi Jinping had very different plans for China. He comes to the presidency with a belief that China must regain its position as the most powerful economic and military force in the world. And to do that, Xi was trying to reduce China\u2019s dependence and go after the Western companies like Apple that had really been amassing a lot of influence in the country and really lift up some of the homegrown tech companies like Baidu and Tencent and Alibaba.\nAnd a big reason why China was changing its approach was because China could. China suddenly had a lot more leverage, and it had a lot more economic power, in part because of the investment from Apple and other Western companies. By 2013, China was the world\u2019s number 2 economy, and that is a very different place than it was in 2001. And it meant that Xi Jinping had more power and more ability to get his way.\nSo how does Apple respond to this attack by Xi Jinping?\nWell \u2014\nApple trying to save face in one of its fastest growing markets.\nThat\u2019s for sure, Siobhan.\nWithin several weeks, Tim Cook took a really unusual step.\nRight now, an unexpected apology this morning from Apple to the Chinese people.\nHe issued an open letter, and he apologized \u2014\nTim Cook saying, quote, \u201cWe recognize that we have much to learn about operating and communicating in China.\u201d\n\u2014 and said that Apple had, quote, \u201cincomparable respect\u201d for China and that Apple had a lot to learn about operating in the country.\nA humbler Apple, if that\u2019s possible, here. Heading toward the close \u2014\nAnd it was a real sign that the dynamics of this relationship had fundamentally changed.\nSo did this new stance from the Chinese government ring any alarm bells inside the company?\nYes. Pretty quickly, there were these conversations inside of Apple about the dilemma that they faced in China. And specifically, there was this former Apple employee who was a senior adviser in China. And he told me that early on he realized the predicament Apple was in, and he tried to get the company\u2019s leadership to do something about it.\nAnd so he was able to get an audience with some of Tim Cook\u2019s top deputies and make the case that Apple had basically no plan B to China, and that really left the company vulnerable to the whims of the government. But ultimately, nothing really changed at Apple. And that was, in part, because there was really no other country that could support the type of manufacturing that Apple now required, and there were certainly no consumer market that could make up for the lost sales if Apple had to leave China.\nSo Apple was stuck?\nExactly.\nSo how does this new chapter of the relationship between Apple and China play out?\nWell, for Apple, from a business standpoint, things continue to go wonderfully. Apple\u2019s valuation is skyrocketing. People continue to not be able to get enough of its products. But its situation in China is continuing to get hairier. And that\u2019s in part because over the next several years, we\u2019re starting to see that the administration of Xi Jinping is an increasingly authoritarian one.\nXi\u2019s government is building out a nationwide video surveillance network. They are getting more access to the data of China\u2019s biggest internet companies like Tencent. And they are starting to become much stricter internet censors and cracking down more and more on what people can say and read on the internet.\nAnd that was a worrying sign for Apple. As the iPhone began to sell more and more in China, Apple was increasingly a gateway to the internet for Chinese citizens. And then in the summer of 2017 \u2014\nThe new law was approved by China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress.\n\u2014 this new Chinese cybersecurity law went into effect that was a big deal for Apple.\nChina says it\u2019s necessary to safeguard cyber security and protect against hackers from within and outside \u2014\nAnd what exactly is this new cybersecurity law in China?\nSo the law requires tech companies to store data that is created in China in China.\nCompanies in key industries will need to open up their computer systems for security examinations. Most of their data will need to be stored locally, and crime investigations will have access to that data.\nAnd that\u2019s bad news for Apple because of iCloud.\nNow, iCloud is Apple\u2019s data storage service that millions of Chinese consumers use to store personal private data like their contacts, documents, photos, emails, even their real-time locations. Prior to this law, Apple stored this data largely outside of China.\nAnd this data was encrypted, which meant it could only be accessed with certain digital encryption keys. And Apple kept those digital keys to unlock the data outside of China as well. Under the new law, China wants Apple to bring that data to China and store that data on Chinese government servers. And it also wants Apple to bring the digital keys to those servers as well.\nSo China wants Apple to store its Chinese users\u2019 data on government-owned servers and to have the key to unlock that data also located in China?\nRight. So basically, this means that if Apple complied with the government\u2019s demands, Apple\u2019s Chinese customers\u2019 data would effectively be in the hands of the Chinese government.\nSo what does Apple do?\nWell, this is basically what I\u2019ve been trying to answer for almost two years. How did Apple respond to this new law? So over the course of these years, my colleagues, Ray Zhong, Daisuke Wakabayashi and I managed to obtain internal Apple documents. We spoke to 17 current and former Apple employees and also independent security experts. And here\u2019s what we found.\nApple essentially decides that it\u2019s willing to store the data in China. But in negotiations, Apple really tried to keep the encryption keys outside of the country, which would essentially protect the data and make it almost unusable for the Chinese government. Now, we don\u2019t know exactly what Apple was doing and saying to make its case to the Chinese government, and we don\u2019t know exactly how the Chinese government responded. But what we do know is that by 2018, those encryption keys did, in fact, end up in China, along with the user data, in a Chinese-controlled data center.\nSo in effect, China won?\nCorrect. Now, Apple has told us in response to our findings that it is doing everything it can to keep its customers\u2019 data safe. It also said that it\u2019s retained control of the encryption keys in China. And specifically, it said that it designed the security of its iCloud system, quote, \u201cin such a way that only Apple has control of the encryption keys,\u201d end quote. It didn\u2019t elaborate beyond that, but what we do know is that those encryption keys are stored on the Chinese data centers.\nNow, we obtained internal documents that explain the design and security of the iCloud system. And we shared those documents and some of our findings with four independent security experts. And those experts said that because the encryption keys are stored in China and not only in China, but on computers owned and run by the Chinese government, that makes it an impossible problem for Apple engineers to solve.\nAnything can be hacked. But when we\u2019re talking about the actual physical servers containing the data in the hands of a sophisticated hacker like the Chinese government, it becomes extremely difficult to protect that data.\nDo we know if China has actually accessed any user data that was made more accessible, as you said, under this law?\nNo, we don\u2019t know. What we do know is that the security expert said that Apple\u2019s compromises in China have made it nearly impossible for the company to stop the Chinese government from gaining access to the data. And we also know that this is not the only compromise Apple\u2019s making in China. What we found is that Apple is also becoming a tool of the Chinese government\u2019s vast censorship operation. And it all has to do with Apple\u2019s App Store.\nWhat do you mean?\nSo we\u2019ve known for a while that the Chinese government has asked Apple to take down apps. And we know that in some cases, Apple takes them down. In some cases, Apple doesn\u2019t. But what we\u2019ve found is over the past several years, Apple has begun to build this sophisticated system inside of its company that is designed to take down apps proactively before the Chinese government even asks if it thinks the app could upset Chinese officials or run afoul of Chinese laws.\nAnd so as part of that system, Apple has created, essentially, a blacklist of terms that are banned in China. And these are things like independence for Tibet and Taiwan, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama and the names of certain Chinese dissidents. And Apple actually hires hundreds of its own app reviewers. And then it trains them on what topics to look for.\nAnd it also creates software that scans each app for the banned terms. And so as a result, Apple has removed tens of thousands of apps in China to appease Chinese authorities. And those include apps from foreign news outlets like The New York Times, gay dating apps, apps that get around the government\u2019s internet restrictions, and apps that helped pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong organize.\nSo Apple is proactively searching for topics in its own app store that the Chinese government deems off limits and removing a bunch of them? It\u2019s pretty extraordinary for an American company to play this role.\nIt really is. And it essentially means that Apple, one of the most technologically advanced and richest companies in the world, is bringing to bear its technology and its resources to help the Chinese government censor the internet for Chinese citizens.\nWhat does Apple have to say about all of this? How does Apple defend its decision to comply with these pretty authoritarian demands from China?\nWell, in a statement Apple gave us in response to our story, they said, quote, \u201cThese decisions are not always easy, and we may not agree with the laws that shape them, but our priority remains creating the best user experience without violating the rules we are obligated to follow.\u201d Apple basically says that while it doesn\u2019t like these rules, they\u2019re the law, and Apple follows the law in the countries in which it does business. But obviously, this is an uncomfortable situation for Apple.\nFrom my American mindset, I believe strongly in freedoms.\nAnd in 2017, Tim Cook was asked about Apple\u2019s relationship with China.\nBut I also know that each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations. And so your choice is: Do you participate or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be? And my own view very strongly is you show up, and you participate. You get in the arena. Because nothing ever changes from the sideline.\nAnd he basically argued that Chinese citizens and the world at large are better off with Apple in China.\nI had this 25-year view of China, so I\u2019ve seen so much change in that quarter of a century. And to me, the arc of that is clear. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a straight line. But, honestly speaking, in no country in the world is progress a straight line.\nAnd his argument is that even though China is changing, Apple has more of a chance to influence the country if it stays in the country than if it leaves and is just on the sidelines.\nSo given all of this, these compromises that Apple has felt compelled to make, is the company doing anything now to fundamentally change its reliance on China?\nNot fundamentally. Apple has begun to diversify in some very small ways. It is now assembling a small number of iPhones in India. It\u2019s making AirPods in Vietnam, for instance. But for the most part, Apple still makes the vast majority of its devices in China. And the latest signs from its supplier report show that it\u2019s using an even higher percentage of suppliers in China than it did before.\nSo Jack, I\u2019m thinking about this bet that you mentioned early on, the bet that Apple made on China that it would remain a hospitable place to do business and be a good partner in the long run. How should we think about that bet now?\nSo from an economic standpoint, Apple\u2019s bet on China has been one of the biggest successes in modern business history. Apple is the most valuable company in the world, and it is the richest company in the world and the most profitable company in the world. But at the same time, Apple was in some ways making a bet that its entrance into China, its investment in China, would force China to open up and to liberalize and to reflect more of the values that Apple itself believes in.\nSo at the outset, I think that Apple believed that it could change China. But two decades later, it seems to be clearer that China has instead changed Apple.\nI think that Apple\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government reflects a new reality in which the world\u2019s soon to be number 1 economy is run by an increasingly authoritarian government that is willing to squash pro-democracy protesters and also commit human rights abuses when it comes to the Uyghurs, which is the Muslim ethnic minority in the country.\nAnd because of the nature of the global economy, where China is one of the largest consumer markets and, more importantly, the home to the most sophisticated and largest supply chain in the world, it means that Western industry will now be grappling for years to come on how to deal with this new China.\nThank you very much, Jack.\nThank you.\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n[SPEAKING HEBREW]\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s long and divisive time as prime minister of Israel ended on Sunday when the country\u2019s parliament gave its support to a diverse coalition of his opponents. The margin of victory was razor thin, 60 to 59, with one lawmaker abstaining.\nPrime minister designate, please.\nAfter the vote, supporters of Netanyahu repeatedly heckled his successor, Prime Minister-designate Naftali Bennett, who vowed in a speech to be a leader for all of Israel.\n[SPEAKING HEBREW]\nFriends, even if you\u2019re not in the government, we will represent your voters, and we will look after everyone.\nAnd \u2014\nAmerica is back at the table.\n\u2014 on Sunday, President Biden ended a summit of the group of seven, where he met with the heads of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, by declaring that the United States was eager to resume its role as a leader in global affairs after four years of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy under Donald Trump.\nThe lack of participation in the past and full engagement was noticed significantly not only by the leaders of those countries, but by the people in the G7 countries. And America\u2019s back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values.\nToday\u2019s episode was produced by Stella Tan, Austin Mitchell and Soraya Shockley. It was edited by Lisa Chow, engineered by Chris Wood and contains original music from Dan Powell and Marion Lozano.\nThat\u2019s it for The Daily. I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\nWhat about censorship of apps? We have known that Apple, like all companies operating in China,blocks materialthat the government says defies its laws and norms.\nWhat we found is that Apple built a system that is designed to proactively take down apps \u2014 without direct orders from the Chinese government \u2014 that Apple has deemed off limits in China, or that Apple believes will upset Chinese officials.\nThe system includes training app reviewers on a long list of topics that it believes are not permitted in China and creating software that searches for those topics, which include Tiananmen Square, independence for Tibet and Taiwan and the names of at least one critic of the Chinese Community Party. That shows that Apple in some ways is using its capabilities to augment the Chinese government\u2019s restrictions on the internet.\nDoesn\u2019t the company have to comply with China\u2019s laws? Is it appropriate to expect Apple to protect Chinese people from the surveillance and censorship of their own government?\nApple makes morals a central element of its brand. The company toutsits commitment to privacy, security, civil liberties andprotecting people from government intrusion. That\u2019s what makes Apple\u2019s actions in China so striking.\nIn Apple\u2019s defense, the company doesn\u2019t want to do any of this. And people close to Apple have said that the Chinese people are better off with the company in China trying its best to protect people\u2019s data and free speech. If Apple left China, there aren\u2019t other companies\u2019 phones or computers that can get people around the Chinese government\u2019s surveillance or censorship.\nAre you describing a Faustian bargain: Apple makes billions of dollars in China but at the cost of its principles?\nExactly. The company has its back against the wall. Apple became wildly profitable and valuable in part because it was able to capitalize on China both as a sales market and as a manufacturing hub.\nBut that success has come with requirements that undercut the values that Apple executives espouse, and that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, says Apple is all about. Apple has reaped riches from China, but is now grappling with enormous compromises.\nIs this how Apple imagined it would be in China?\nI don\u2019t think anyone at Apple envisioned how entrenched the company would become in China or the risks that Apple would be exposed to. In the beginning, Apple was setting up a few factories and had relatively small product sales in China. Now Apple is completely dependent on the country, and that gives the government a lot of power over Apple.\nBut it\u2019s also inaccurate to say that Apple has no leverage. China wants iPhones to be available there, and it also values the millions of jobs that Apple\u2019s supply chain creates.\nRead more about this Apple investigation:\nFive takeaways from Apple\u2019s compromises in China\nJack\u2019sTwitter thread, including a glimpse of legal documents and a lengthy statement from Apple.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nThe name is Bond.

        "title": "The Epic Case Against Apple Wraps Up",
        "fulltext": "For the past three weeks,Applehas been defending itself in federal court againstclaims brought by Epic Games, the maker of the blockbuster video game Fortnite, that Apple abuses its power by charging app makers unfairly high commissions to appear in its App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said she hoped to deliver a verdict in mid-August.\nThe crux of the case is about market definition. Since Epic\u2019s games are played on many non-Apple devices, its complaint about Apple as a monopolist is not clear-cut; a company that relies exclusively on Apple for distribution may have a stronger claim.\nTo that end, this case could be seen as a dress rehearsal for future antitrust cases, even if the judge rules in Apple\u2019s favor. And if the judge finds for Epic, it would probably not force immediate changes to the $100 billion market for iPhone apps, since any ruling is set to be tied up in appeals for years. Regardless, the evidence revealed in the past few weeks is likely to feature in court battles to come.\nAfter the trial wrapped up yesterday, DealBook spoke with Kellen Browning, a technology reporter for The Times, about the companies\u2019 arguments, what the judge said and how asometimes-naked bananabecame a topic of debate in the California courtroom. Here is an edited version of the discussion.\nEpic has argued that the case is about iPhone apps, while Apple has argued that it\u2019s about gaming. Why is the distinction important?\nIf the case is about iPhone apps in general, then Epic can claim that Apple has a monopoly over distribution. But if the case is just about the distribution of gaming apps or games more narrowly, then Apple has been able to argue that there are many different places that people can get their games.\nWhy was there so much discussion of Apple\u2019s security features and review process?\nOne of Apple\u2019s arguments was that it has really good security and it thoroughly reviews its apps, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to do that as effectively if Epic were allowed to essentially offer its own app store within Apple\u2019s App Store (and bypass Apple\u2019s commission). In response, Epic showed internal emails between Apple executives discussing times when Apple\u2019s review failed to pick up problematic apps.\nEssentially, Apple said, \u201cYou know, sometimes we make mistakes, but overall we\u2019re pretty good.\u201d And \u2014 have you heard about Peely?\nThe banana?\nYes. Apple responded to Epic\u2019s saying, \u201cHere\u2019s some evidence that the content of your game store may be inappropriate, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to police it.\u201d In that line of argument, they brought up Peely, a character in Fortnite, which is a banana that sometimes wears a tuxedo, and sometimes doesn\u2019t. And so there was this whole back-and-forth over whether it\u2019s appropriate to show the \u201cnaked\u201d banana in court. The judge was making Peely jokes for the rest of the trial.\nDid the judge ask any searching questions?\nThe judge asked Tim Cook at one point whether the decision toreduce Apple\u2019s commission for some smaller developerswas because of this sort of scrutiny. He acknowledged that, to some extent, concerns about regulation or scrutiny were in the back of his mind. The judge also talked about how it seemed that Apple hadn\u2019t felt any competitive pressure to lower its 30 percent commission fee, based on other game platforms lowering their fees, which has happened a few times.\nRead The Times\u2019s full story onthe last day of the Epic vs. Apple trial.\nAirlines begin skirting Belarus after it forced down a plane.Carriers said they wouldavoid the country\u2019s airspaceafter it compelled a Ryanair flight bound for Lithuania to land in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, to seize a dissident journalist. The detour is likely to be costly for airlines that fly between Europe and Asia.\nNew York City schools eliminate remote learning for the coming school year.All students and staff will beback in buildings full timecome September, a milestone for America\u2019s largest school system and a crucial step in reopening the city\u2019s economy \u2014 especially for working parents.\nCompanies are favoring carrots over sticks to get workers vaccinated.Businesses are increasinglyturning to cash stipendsfor inoculated employees, though some lawyersworry about the legalityof such bonuses. United Airlines has created a sweepstakes for travelers who share their vaccination status, with the chance towin free flights.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren proposes tripling the I.R.S.\u2019s annual budget.The Massachusetts Democratunveiled legislationto increase the agency\u2019s funding to$31.5 billionto support President Biden\u2019s plan to help it pursue tax evasion by corporations and the wealthy.\nFlorida will fine social networks that bar political candidates.The new lawis a direct challenge to the suspension of Donald Trump by Facebook and Twitter, and also prevents those platforms from banning some news outlets from posting their content. It\u2019s likely to be challenged on constitutional grounds.\nAfter aharrowing few daysfor cryptocurrency investors, many will have taken comfort yesterday when Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said, \u201cI have some Bitcoin.\u201d The statement generatedheadlinesandattentionbecause Dalio had dwelled on Bitcoin\u2019s limitations last year: \u201cI might be missing something about Bitcoin so I\u2019d love to be corrected,\u201dhe said in November.\nTiming is everything.It\u2019s worth noting that Dalio\u2019s remarks were streamed to attendees of CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus conference yesterday, but had been recorded on May 6. Bitcoin has lost about a third of its value since then.\nCrypto gets more attractive as the dollar loses its allure,Dalio said. The U.S. dollar may one day lose its position as the global reserve currency, he said, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be good for crypto. If governments sense that people would rather \u201chave Bitcoin than a bond,\u201d a crackdown will follow, he suggested.\nA digital dollar from Uncle Sam could be coming, the Fed governor Lael Brainard saidat the conference. \u201cWe must explore \u2014 and try to anticipate \u2014 the extent to which households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 needs and preferences may migrate further to digital payments,\u201d she said. Brainard argued that a central bank digital currency would be safer and more stable than \u201ca predominance of private moneys.\u201d\nIn other crypto news, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey,called cryptocurrencies \u201cdangerous,\u201da group of Bitcoin miners (and Elon Musk) met to discussthe industry\u2019s climate impact, and the volume of chatter about crypto on Reddit now surpassesdiscussions about meme stocks.\n\u2014 Usha Rodrigues, a law professor at the University of Georgia, at a House hearingon the blank-check boom.\nBowery Farming, a high-tech vertical farming company that grows greens indoors, has raised $300 million in funding at a valuation of $2.3 billion, it will announce today. The round was led by Fidelity.\nNot your typical farmer.Irving Fain, Bowery\u2019s founder and C.E.O., began his career in investment banking, directed digital marketing at iHeartMedia and founded CrowdTwist, a brand analytics software company. He started the \u201csmart\u201d farm company, which uses technology to control and monitor growth, in 2014. The company\u2019s farms are built near cities and employ workers with no agricultural experience to worktech-enabled greenhouses.\n\u201cWhen you look at climate change, population growth, and urbanization, it\u2019s clear that our agricultural system needs to change,\u201d Fain told DealBook. Small-scale vertical farms in urban areas can\u2019t feed everyone, but they are \u201csimpler, safer, more reliable and more sustainable,\u201d he said.\nStars are betting on it.Bowery\u2019s latest funding round boasts celebrity investors like the actress Natalie Portman, the chef Jose\u0301 Andre\u0301s and the singer-songwriter and actor Justin Timberlake. Itsgreens and herbsare sold in more than 850 stores, and it has recorded sales growth of some 750 percent since the start of 2020.\nWhen it comes to scrutiny of companies\u2019 environmental, social and governance policies, or E.S.G., \u201cthere\u2019s so much activity going on,\u201d Jennifer Semko, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie in Washington, told DealBook. She cited increased attention on E.S.G. issues from employees, consumers, shareholders, stakeholders and governments around the world. \u201cCompanies need to be better prepared,\u201d she said.\nE.S.G. matters are a growing litigation risk.In a recent Baker McKenzie survey of litigation risks atmultinational companies, only the energy and mining sectors were highly attuned to the issues, Semko said. It\u2019s \u201ca little surprising,\u201d she said, given that companies in every sector are facing questions about the environment and much more \u2014 everything from ethical sourcing to social justice.\nInsurers are also looking at E.S.G. as a risk factor,said Paul Schiavone of Allianz. Ina new report, his company named E.S.G. as one of themajor risk trendsto financial service firms, and Schiavone says he believes that as these issues get more attention, good corporate citizens will be rewarded for \u201cfriendliness\u201d of all kinds. Companies that pay attention to E.S.G. concerns may face fewer regulatory investigations, lawsuits and other disruptions \u2014 all matters of interest to insurers.\nInvestor interest alone isn\u2019t enough to prompt companies to open up about E.S.G.,said Allison Herren Lee, an S.E.C. commissioner. Speaking to an accounting trade groupyesterday, she dismissed what she called the \u201cmost prevalent myth\u201d about E.S.G. reporting issues. Securities laws require that companies disclose material information to investors, but it is \u201csimply not true\u201d that companies reveal much about E.S.G. unless it is specifically mandated, she said.\nDeals\nAuthentic Brands, the owner of Brooks Brothers and Forever 21, is reportedly weighing going public this year.

        "fulltext": "It was a grenade lobbed into the tenuous peace between Apple and Facebook \u2014a software updatethat explicitly askediPhoneusers whether an app should be allowed to track their digital movements across the other apps and sites that they use.\nApple pitched the feature, App Tracking Transparency, as a triumph for privacy. But for Facebook, it was an attack striking a key source of revenue: the personal data of its users.\nThe dispute represents afurther deterioration in the relationsbetween the two companies and their chief executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook.\nIn arecent episode of The Daily, Mike Isaac, a technology correspondent for The New York Times, asked a question at the heart of this conflict: \u201cDo people care about privacy?\u201d The answer, as he explained, will determine the conflict\u2019s trajectory \u2014 and the limitations on Big Tech\u2019s power in a largely unregulated, hypercompetitive fight for market dominance.\ntranscript\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\n\nToday, the story of how a seemingly routine software update became a major battle in the long-running war between Apple and Facebook. Astead Herndon spoke with our colleague, Mike Isaac, about what\u2019s at the heart of the conflict and why the stakes have become so high for both companies.\nIt\u2019s Tuesday, May 11.\nSo Mike, can you tell me about this thing that Apple premiered the other day? It seemed pretty small, but from what I\u2019m gathering, it\u2019s not that small.\nYeah. So the other day, Apple rolls out this ad that seems pretty innocuous, I guess, at first glance.\nWhen you\u2019re using apps on your iPhone, you may start to see this. It\u2019s the new App Tracking Transparency prompt.\nThere\u2019s this nice-sounding woman\u2019s voice telling folks, hey, we\u2019re going to introduce this new software. And you might start noticing this prompt on the iPhone when you open certain apps.\n\u2014a choice on how apps use and share your data.\nIt\u2019ll say you can allow apps to track you, or you can ask them not to track you.\n\u2014data like your age, location, health information, spending habits, and your browsing history, to name a few.\nThey basically walk folks through this idea that\u2014\n\u2014they collect thousands of pieces of information about you to create a digital profile that they sell to others.\nSome apps on the iPhone are building entire profiles of information on you and tracking your behavior across different apps rather than when you\u2019re using the apps themselves.\nThis has been happening without your knowledge or permission. Your information is for sale. You have become the product.\nAnd what Apple is doing is essentially very kindly pointing out\u2014\nThat\u2019s why iPhone users will now be asked a single, simple question\u2014 allow apps to track you or not?\nHere\u2019s a button that you can use that will put right in front of you when you open the app to turn all that off. And for the first time, you can find it without having to dig into your settings. And look how great it is that we\u2019re putting this in front of you.\nWe believe that you should have a choice. App Tracking Transparency\u2014 a simple new feature that puts your data back in your control.\nAnd seems fine, whatever. OK. But over at Facebook, they start freaking out and losing their minds over this.\n\nSo why is Facebook freaking out?\nI mean, because Apple is basically, for the first time, giving the millions of people that use iPhones a really easy choice to opt out of advertisers using their data to track them across the internet. And for Facebook, that\u2019s basically the entire business model of how Facebook operates. Facebook\u2019s whole business is tracking you across the internet to make the ads that are served to you the most accurate as possible. You can think of Facebook\u2019s actual customers as ad companies and advertisers who pay to place ads in your feed and my feed when we use the app.\nTargeted ads have become a part of our lives. I think about how Instagram feeds me advertisements for sneakers and plants and matching jumpsuits because they\u2019ve been tracking me across those other apps. So you\u2019re saying if I click this button, would that be saying that I no longer wanted that?\nI didn\u2019t know you were a jumpsuit guy. But no, I think companies like Facebook, which owns Instagram, they say they track you in order to make your personalized advertising experience even better. And so you see the ads you want to see in your feed. What I think Apple is getting at here is essentially making that exchange more in your face, basically, saying, look, this is something that has been going on. If you want to opt out of it, that\u2019s fine, but you should at least have the choice to do so. So this fundamental thing can now go away with this software update and with the click of a button that people push when they open up the app. And that\u2019s existential. That\u2019s the whole ballgame for Facebook\u2019s business.\nSo that\u2019s how Facebook sees this move by Apple, but are they right? Should we think of this as Apple directly targeting Facebook?\nI mean, I think so. Basically, this is the biggest in a long line of long-simmering back-and-forths between the company as they\u2019ve been in a cold war for the past 10 years.\nA cold war? I didn\u2019t know that. What do you mean?\nSo rewind back to 2010, 2011 era of Facebook and Apple coexisting with one another. At this point, they\u2019re far from enemies. They\u2019re actually pretty friendly. Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg would go on these long walks in the apricot groves in Silicon Valley, and it was very\u2014 mentor-mentee sort of thing. I think Jobs was seen as an elder statesman at the time to young founders, especially like Mark.\nFacebook is this up-and-coming company used by hundreds of millions of people. Apple has created the most popular consumer device used by millions of people. And they essentially have a kind of complementary relationship, really a symbiotic relationship. You can\u2019t use the iPhone without apps like Facebook, and you can\u2019t access apps like Facebook without a great smartphone to do it. And Apple was the one to provide it. And really, at this point, they seemed far from any sort of antagonism towards one another. But over time, they started kind of playing in each other\u2019s spaces.\nIf you remember 2010, 2011\u2014 this was the time that I moved from my Blackberry to getting an actual smartphone then. I remember I bought an iPhone specifically to start using Instagram, which is kind of embarrassing. But this was when everyone was making that switch. And Mark Zuckerberg, he realized, I don\u2019t own the operating system. We will always be subservient to Apple\u2019s rules or to Google\u2019s rules, and we need to change that. So he ends up developing their own smartphone, which Apple sort of is like, oh, OK, now you\u2019re in our business now. Or another instance was basically messaging. Apple\u2019s iMessage was used by hundreds of millions of people, and Facebook wants to be an owner of messaging services too. And so they start competing in little areas that didn\u2019t seem as obvious before.\nSo originally, these are two companies and two C.E.O.s that think of themselves as very distinct, have a good relationship. But you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a change in the industry that pushed them closer and closer to one another where they\u2019re now making services that they see as directly competitive to one another.\nYeah, 100 percent. Another thing that happens around this time is that Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, passes away. He dies of pancreatic cancer. And his successor, Tim Cook, his number two, comes in and takes over the business. And Tim Cook is a very different C.E.O. He doesn\u2019t feel that people\u2019s data and information should be combed through by advertising companies and data brokers who want to use that you serve you ads. And I think that these two companies that might have had a friendly relationship, that becomes a little bit icier, I would say. But I really think the crux of the turning point for these two companies came in 2016, 2017.\n\nFor months, Facebook has been under mounting pressure to be more transparent after revelations Russia used its platform to try to meddle in the 2016 election.\nSo Donald Trump was elected president at the end of 2016, and then slowly, information starts coming out about what role Facebook played in that election.\nOne of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016.\nPeople start discovering, oh, Facebook was used as a conduit for misinformation around how Americans think about each other.\nThey say a Russian group posted more than 80,000 times during and after the election campaign.\nA group that claimed to be part of Texas but was, in fact, paid for by Russians in rubles.\nThose ads, with a price tag of $100,000, pushed divisive social issues from immigration to race and gay rights.\nAnd then there\u2019s the Cambridge Analytica situation.\nCambridge Analytica drilled deep, looking for a trove of social media data on Americans to help Republican presidential campaigns fine-tune their messages and win votes.\nSo back in 2018, The Times unearths what is essentially a data leak in Facebook\u2019s business.\nStarting in 2014, Cambridge Analytica funded a personality test on Facebook and paid people to take it. Once a user answered questions, the app captured their friend\u2019s information too. The New York Times has viewed a portion of the raw data involved in this breach, so we know it exists. And we have every reason to believe it is still in the hands of Cambridge Analytica despite their denials.\nCambridge Analytica was this crucial moment where Facebook was essentially pilloried by the entire world for being just totally reckless with user data. And I think that really had an effect on Cook and on folks at Apple. I think that really poisoned their idea of what Facebook was. It\u2019s not this idyllic little company where they\u2019re just trying to connect the world and make everything pollyannish. I think it became a darker thing. And at that point, Apple decided not only is privacy important to us, we\u2019re going to make that a cornerstone of how we market ourselves compared to other companies like Facebook.\nCan you explain why specifically Apple would care that Facebook was in this contentious moment?\nI think there\u2019s the personal and then the professional. One, I think Tim Cook actually does have a distaste for Facebook\u2019s business model at its core. But I also think there\u2019s really a professional business reason for doing this. And I was talking to a Silicon Valley exec a few months ago, and basically, they told me, look, if your competitor is on the ropes like Facebook is, you take a punch at them. You take a shot at them. And essentially, you hit them while they\u2019re down because you can make your company look better at the same time. And I think there was part of Apple that recognized we have an opportunity here. And if we can use ourselves as a foil against, quote unquote, the invasive, data-hungry company that is Facebook, we can end up looking much better here. And that\u2019s exactly what they did.\nSo what does Apple actually do, then, to capitalize on Facebook\u2019s moment of weakness at this time?\nSo basically, Apple has these events every year where they preview their software. And one year, they trot out these new features. One of them is for Safari, their web browser. It basically says, we\u2019re going to kill off tracking cookies in Safari. What that means is essentially, if you use the mobile web browsers on Apple\u2019s phones, we\u2019re not going to let companies like Facebook or Google track you around the internet using those web browsers.\nThank you for explaining cookies. I\u2019ve never understood that my whole life.\nI did my job for one. Yeah. And that was definitely a big move. That was Apple saying, look, we\u2019re cracking down on tracking in our web browsers. Safari is used by millions, if not billions, of people who have iPhones around the world. The other thing that they do is\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you remember when Screen Time came out, basically the thing that tells us how terrible we are for being on our phone all week. They specifically introduced this product saying, we have a way to keep you on your phone less. And in the demo, I believe they used Instagram as the example app saying, essentially, you spent way too much time on Instagram this week. Maybe you need to chill out a little bit. And inside Facebook, people are like, what? What are you doing? Why are you targeting us? Where is this coming from? So they have these Easter eggs in their presentations and stuff and a side-eyed version of a tech fight for a little while, but then I think it gets more overt.\nFrom Chicago, this is Revolution, Apple changing the world.\nTim Cook goes on MSNBC.\nTim, thank you for coming. I think they\u2019re all excited to get new iPhones from you.\nOne of our colleagues, Kara Swisher, actually is interviewing him at this point and says, Zuckerberg is getting hauled into Congress, and they\u2019re getting essentially questioned for their role in the 2016 election and how they use data. And the host asks\u2014\nIf you were Mark Zuckerberg, what would you do?\nWhat would I do?\nAnd Cook, without missing a beat, says\u2014\nI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\nOK.\nI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. Basically\u2014\nWow.\nBasically, that\u2019s not us. That\u2019s not what we do.\nWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy. Privacy, to us, is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty. And it\u2019s something that is unique to America.\nWe believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. And that\u2019s basically like saying, unlike Facebook, we actually care about your privacy.\nThat seems more explicit.\nRight. And at that point, Mark Zuckerberg responds.\nThe reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay.\nHe goes on The Ezra Klein Show and basically throws it back in Cook\u2019s face and says\u2014\nI mean, look, if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.\nThe whole point of advertising is that we\u2019re making our service free, and you don\u2019t have to pay $1,200 or whatever exorbitant price to use our product, unlike some other companies in Cupertino, California, basically making the case that Facebook is the common man\u2019s social network, free to use, and everyone can enjoy it. Just be willing to be targeted by personalized advertising.\nI think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you, because that sounds ridiculous to me.\nSo they trade some more shots in the press. And then in 2019, both sides think they need to have a talk. They need to come to terms and come to a peace between each other. And every year, there\u2019s this retreat called Sun Valley that, basically, all the billionaires go to to commune with one another. And so Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg and their respective teams decide this is where we\u2019re going to hash it out. So they get together in this room with a small group of executives from both companies. And Mark basically says to Tim, what would you do in this situation? The whole world is coming down on us. What would you do? And Tim\u2019s response is essentially, I think you should delete every bit of information about people that you\u2019ve collected outside of your main Facebook apps.\nWow.\nYeah. He\u2019s basically telling Mark, in so many words, your entire business model is busted. And you need to fix it by destroying at least half of it. One person said that Mark seemed stunned. The C.E.O. of Apple telling you that your whole business model is broken and wrong probably wasn\u2019t the best way to start out peace talks in this summit that they were supposed to have.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019s very interested in a peace talk to respond in such a fashion.\nRight. And so the next thing that Tim Cook does\u2014\nTogether, we must send a universal humanistic response to those who claim a right to users\u2019 private information about what should not and will not be tolerated.\n\u2014is announce this App Tracking Transparency feature.\nAt its foundation, ATT is about returning control to users, about giving them a say over how their data is handled.\n\u2014that Facebook feels, rightly, is targeted directly at Facebook and its business.\nSome may well think that sharing this degree of information is worth it for more targeted ads. Many others, I suspect, will not. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation\u2014\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nAll right. So Mike, Apple premieres this new privacy initiative that Facebook takes as a direct statement of competition. What happens next?\nFacebook starts really fighting back. For the past few years at this point, Facebook has been on the ropes. Apple has been the one throwing all the real punches. And Facebook essentially says, look, if you\u2019re going after our business, if you\u2019re going to the jugular at this point, we\u2019ve got to do something.\nFacebook just now publishing a blog post saying it\u2019s speaking up on behalf of small businesses, saying, quote, \u201cwe believe Apple is behaving anti-competitively by\u2014\u201d\nThis seems like a very perilous escalation that Facebook is pushing here. Maybe they have to because what Apple plans to do strikes at the core of Facebook\u2019s business model.\nWhat they\u2019re saying is that once you eliminate that kind of targeting, then the ads just don\u2019t become as valuable anymore, which is\u2014\nSo Facebook starts talking to all its advertisers and a lot of the small businesses on the platform who buy ads on Facebook, basically saying, this is a huge deal. Bad things are coming for us. We need to push back on this. So it becomes corralling the advertisers and essentially creating this public P.R. campaign against Apple.\nname is Monique Wilsondebriano. My husband and I are the founders and owners of Charleston Gourmet Burger Company. And today, I want to talk to you about the update from Apple and the impact that it is going to have on small businesses.\nSo Facebook is basically saying, we\u2019re standing up for small businesses.\nWe\u2019re all frustrated. We\u2019re all dealing with Covid. Unfortunately, there\u2019s this other thing that\u2019s coming up, which is an update to Apple\u2019s iOS.\nUsing our ad targeting platform on Facebook is good for the economy, and it\u2019s good for these small businesses that are on the ropes.\nThere is no possible way that our company could have reached the level of success that it is today without personalized ads.\nWe should all be pushing back against the big, bad Apple at this point.\n\nThe idea that this multibillion-dollar corporation in Facebook is painting itself as a champion for small business seems kind of odd to me. It seems like it would raise some eyebrows. What are they doing there?\nYeah, you\u2019re not alone there. But Facebook does have an actual point. Small businesses make up the majority of sellers on their platform. Small businesses on Facebook do rely on ad targeting tools to basically sell themselves and market themselves across the internet, especially during the pandemic when some retail shops might not have otherwise been able to reach people. So to some degree, there\u2019s a point there, even if it\u2019s a very self-serving way of posturing themselves like Facebook is using. But I think the other thing that Facebook is trying to point out here is that this really isn\u2019t about privacy for Apple. This is really them just making a big power move.\nWhat do you mean there?\nWell, they positioned themselves as privacy advocates and warriors, but folks at Facebook are really frustrated because, for instance, Apple has an enormous business in China. Vast amounts of iPhones are sold in China, which arguably one of the most privacy-invasive governments and regimes on Earth, where the contract is that they monitor the behaviors of their citizens. They\u2019re able to control what types of speech is being said online. They can censor certain types of speech against the Chinese government. And one of the things that Apple even had to do to operate in China was concede to a rule the Chinese government made where iCloud data must be stored in mainland China rather than servers in the U.S. or abroad as well as the keys to that data stored in mainland China. So rather than perhaps pull out of China entirely, which is one way they could have gone, they essentially had to concede and say, this is how we operate. This is how we have to do it in order to stay here.\nSo just in operating in China, Apple is being hypocritical in and of itself, some Facebook execs would say. Another point is Apple has this humongous search deal with Google that has lasted for years. Basically, if you open up your iPhone, Google search actually powers a lot of the things underlying in Apple\u2019s software. So Siri is powered by Google search. So it can give you answers instantly because Apple just doesn\u2019t have the search prowess of some of these companies like Google. And Google is just as privacy-invasive as Facebook, folks would say. You\u2019re fine with getting in bed with Google, but for some reason, Facebook is the big bad guy here.\nIt seems as if they\u2019re saying, Apple is situationally looking the other way when it\u2019s an advantage to them.\nYeah, absolutely. And on top of that, you have Apple basically deciding to slowly beef up its existing small advertising business. Not many people know that Apple have an actual advertising business, but it\u2019s significant. It\u2019s inside of the App Store. You can essentially advertise against searches for apps inside of Apple\u2019s store. So it\u2019s not a huge business for Apple, but still, it\u2019s this thing where companies like Facebook see Apple cracking down on the types of tracking and advertising capabilities of other companies while simultaneously improving Apple\u2019s own advertising business. And they scratch their head. They say, what\u2019s up with that?\nIf Apple has these deals with Google and with China, if it\u2019s making this ad technology that is similar to what Facebook has, what then was the upside for them portraying themselves as a champion of privacy? Why did they make that choice if Facebook was going to come back and say, hey, but you\u2019re doing the same thing too?\nI think at the end of the day, Apple\u2019s argument is stronger. It is easier for people to identify with, oh, hey, privacy is a good thing. I would prefer to be tracked less on my phone and in my activities than more. And Facebook\u2019s argument is just, frankly, more nebulous. We\u2019re standing up for small businesses. Therefore, we have to track you, or you shouldn\u2019t be provided the option to opt out of being tracked. That doesn\u2019t really track, so to speak, I guess. And so I think at the end of the day, Apple basically can wield this larger club of we advocate for privacy. We care about not monitoring your data for the most part. And the average consumer probably doesn\u2019t know or care about a Google search deal or the search ads in Apple\u2019s App Store that are pretty in the weeds and mostly cared about by businesses and ad tech people.\nOK. So this is just a calculated marketing thing from Apple. And it seems in the way that you\u2019re describing that they might be pulling this off, that they are both appealing to a customer that, on the surface, cares about privacy with things like this new tool that they\u2019ve introduced, while at the same time, they are expanding their businesses in ways that compete with Facebook, compete with Instagram, and help them make money on the other side even if it goes against those privacy goals.\nI absolutely agree. And I the\u2014 this is something I\u2019ve asked myself for a long time, this paradox of, do people care about privacy? Do normal folks who are using their computers or their smartphones or who aren\u2019t steeped in tech jargon all day like I might be\u2014 is this something that they actually are concerned with? My guess is that they don\u2019t like the idea of something tracking them across the internet. The idea that someone\u2019s watching you at all times is uncomfortable. I don\u2019t like that. At the same time, people are using Facebook and Instagram in record numbers. Facebook did\u2014 I want to say $27 billion of revenue in the last quarter alone. They\u2019re shattering records for user growth and revenue numbers every quarter. So there\u2019s this tension, I think, in consumers where we want privacy, we gravitate towards this idea that we shouldn\u2019t be tracked, but we also want the convenience and the entertainment that a lot of these apps bring. So I do think there\u2019s a tension in it, and I think Apple is capitalizing on that tension to some degree.\nSo it seems like the public will go as far as to click on that button and block these apps from tracking them in many cases, but not as far as to throw their whole iPhone away or get off the internet or the apps that are tracking them altogether. So Apple still wins, and their competitors still lose because of a single button.\nI mean, I think that\u2019s right. The App Tracking Transparency prompt just rolled out very recently. Facebook is still in a watch and wait period, as are these other advertising companies. They want to see how people behave. The way that the prompt is framed, it\u2019s pretty probably likely that people are going to opt out of it.\nIt\u2019s like one of those leading poll questions that says, would you like this good thing to happen to you? Yeah, sure.\nExactly. Of course I do. And I think that\u2019s what Facebook is expecting\u2014 everyone to be like, of course I don\u2019t want to be tracked. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing already. There\u2019s a survey or two floating around that says most users on iOS are opting out of this tracking option. So I think Apple wins this round. What I\u2019m curious about are the fights to come.\nWhat are some of those?\nYeah, look, these companies fight each other in a lot of different grounds. Messaging is one of them, gaming, podcasting. I think one big one that is a real question mark is V.R. and A.R., virtual reality and augmented reality. Both Apple and Facebook have secret wings in which they do all this high-tech development. And I think that\u2019s going to be the battle of the next 5 to 10 years for both of them. And that\u2019s still very much up in the air. All of the tech companies are essentially converging into this one area in which they compete with one another. The days of 2010, 2011 where they happily coexisted as friendly companies where the C.E.O. of Google might sit on Apple\u2019s board, and they all were friendly rather than frenemies or even outright enemies, those are long over.\nWhy did that have to change? Everyone was making a ton of money. Everyone was growing their business. Why was that not satisfactory?\nI think about this a lot. I feel like it\u2019s really fundamental to how Silicon Valley operates. I think everyone loves to compete. If you are not expanding into a new territory, that means your competitor is, and you\u2019re ceding territory. All of the companies in Silicon Valley basically see a space and go after it. And if you\u2019re not doing it, that means someone else is. It says something about Silicon Valley. It says something about capitalism. It says something about how these C.E.O.s think and act. But competition is really the only code I think these C.E.O.s out here really live and abide by. And there\u2019s no real rules around it except for you compete to win. And they all just respect that as that\u2019s how it is out here.\nRight. I\u2019m asking why was it unsatisfactory to each maintain the slice of the pie, and you\u2019re saying that Silicon Valley is structured that\u2014 our economy is structured in a way where these folks want the whole pie.\nYeah, go big or go home.\nI don\u2019t want a slice of the pie. I want the whole pie. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re saying.\nThank you, Mike. I appreciate your time.\nYeah. Thanks for having me.\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today.\nWeeks of unrest in Jerusalem turned into a wider conflict on Monday when militants in Gaza fired rockets toward the city, and the Israeli military responded with airstrikes. Officials in Gaza said that at least 20 people were killed by the Israeli counterattack. The violence is tied to an attempt by Israelis to evict Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem to make room for Jewish settlers.\n\nFor many, those evictions have become a symbol of the broader historical battle between Israelis and the Palestinians and since April has prompted angry clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the streets of East Jerusalem.\nToday\u2019s episode was produced by Stella Tan, Michael Simon Johnson, Diana Nguyen, and Eric Krupke. It was edited by Paige Cowett and engineered by Chris Wood.\n\nThat\u2019s it for The Daily. I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\nAfter the episode aired, we called someone who thinks deeply about both privacy and the economic forces behind this competition: Shoshana Zuboff, author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\u201d In the following interview, we ask Ms. Zuboff about the significance of this update in regards to privacy protections long term, the prospect of platform regulation and her vision for a less-extractive digital future.\nOur conversation has been condensed and lightly edited.\nIn your book, you describe personal data as the primary source of economic power for platform companies like Facebook that monetize the intimate details of our digital lives. How significant is App Tracking Transparency in limiting that power?\nIt\u2019s significant. But what I think a lot of folks reading the headlines perhaps don\u2019t understand is that what this App Tracking Transparency notification does on your iPhone is it limits applications from tracking us across to other applications and across devices.\nWhat this does not do is prevent these very same applications, including Facebook, which is the big whale in this discussion, from collecting data within their own application. This is a massive surveillance empire worth hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. But we call it an app.\nAnd App Tracking Transparency has no bearing on Facebook\u2019s, or any other application\u2019s, ability to continue tracking you, collecting every aspect of your behavior, your activities, your thoughts and feelings.\nSo, yes, it does take a big bite out of some of the things that they currently do, especially as they reach for this rich diversity of data, which is so important to them. But does it limit their ability to illegitimately convert our lives into data, which they then declare as their private property? No.\nDo you think of this as a turning point?\nThe jury\u2019s still out. I think that what this does is it puts Apple at a crossroads at a new level of intensity.\nWhy does it matter that these big tech companies can mine personal data for profit?\nAs we allow these companies to amass this huge scale of human-generated data, we\u2019re changing the nature of our society.\nBecause, first of all, we\u2019re allowing them to create these huge asymmetries of knowledge about people. Instead of this being a golden age of the democratization of knowledge, it\u2019s turned into something very different from what any of us expected. The last 20 years have seen, especially the last decade, the wholesale destruction of privacy.\nAnd operationally, what happens is they get to a point where they know so much about us that they can fashion targeting mechanisms. We\u2019re not just talking about targeted ads. We\u2019re talking about subliminal cues, psychological microtargeting, real time rewards and punishments, algorithmic recommendation tools and engineered social comparison dynamics.\nWe have seen the scourge of disinformation on social media, wenow know from research, driving a huge number of unnecessary Covid deaths because of disinformation campaigns and also having a huge role in producing the seditious tragedy ofJan. 6.What is so important for folks to understand is that these are all connected points in one process. And the process is called how knowledge becomes power.\nApple now has overone billion active iPhone users. Are you concerned about the company\u2019s growing control of our means of information access?\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about it. Apple is thewealthiestand most powerful corporation, certainly in modern history, perhaps in the history of capitalism. And Apple now exerts unilateral, essentially unaccountable control over critical communications infrastructures, by its complete control of the operating system for its smartphones and other devices.\nI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that Apple is not a government. Apple is a company. It\u2019s a corporation. And in a corporation, C.E.O.s come and go, boards change their membership. Business cycles and business crises occur. And today, Apple can look privacy preserving. And a year from now, we could be having a conversation about how Apple has reneged on all of these privacy values because there\u2019s an economic crisis, and with a new C.E.O. and a different board, Apple completely changes.\nIn what ways does Apple uphold or contradict itsstated mottothat \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right?\u201d\nI had a data scientist who said to me the other day, \u201cLook, the underlying norm of all software and apps designed now is data collection.\u201d For all intents and purposes, all of them are designed to engage in surveillance.\nApple still makes the majority of its revenues through its sales of iPhones and other devices. Nevertheless, an increasing portion of its revenue comes from services, and a big chunk of services is selling apps. So even if it\u2019s not a surveillance capitalist, it is a powerful enabler. A powerful accessory to this crime of surveillance capitalism.\nAnd, of course, there are other ways in which Apple and Mr. Cook really violate the principles that he so eloquently states.Apple in Chinais obviously a huge example of that.Apple\u2019s relationship with Google. So Apple is deeply compromised.\nThe question in my mind is now under the spotlight that Mr. Cook has chosen to shine on himself and this corporation: Are they going to move to truly fill the shoes of what it would take to be a privacy god, or are they going to continue to sort of fudge this along and play both sides?\nBut just to clarify, do you think Apple is actually interested in preserving privacy, or do you think the company sees the introduction of updates like App Tracking Transparency as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage over Facebook?\nI don\u2019t think we should ever expect a corporation to do anything that is not self-serving. Corporations are, by definition, self-serving.\nThey\u2019ve already made it clear that they\u2019re looking at a way to expand their own advertising model, which is different from online targeted advertising.They\u2019re putting down the elements here of an alternative advertising paradigm.This is an opportunity for that new paradigm to now converge with their stated values and not rely on massive scale collection of human generated data in secret.\nWhat would you like to see Apple doing differently?\nHere is a historic opportunity for Mr. Cook and Apple to say, \u201cWe are going to become the hub for an alternative ecosystem.\u201d This alternative ecosystem is waiting for leadership.\nApple is the corporation that can provide that leadership, and it can immediately form alliances with other large, medium and even smaller companies to found an ecosystem where the whole investment profile changes. Investors are ready for this because investors are anticipating regulation that is going to take a bite out of surveillance profits.\nAnd that means Apple has a golden opportunity to start with its own app store. Most purveyors of products feel that they have a responsibility to sell products that are safe. Apple could finally take responsibility for what it sells in its App Store and say we are only going to sell applications that observe privacy-preserving principles. It can help developers on alternative models of monetization. It can work with investors to develop alternative models of investment.\nApple could become an actual collaborator with lawmakers, making personnel available so that lawmakers and their staffs have a forensic understanding of the kind of enforcement operations new regulations are going to require.\nHow do you feel about the regulatory possibilities that are emerging at this moment?\nI feel great about it. What theE.U. is doingis really taking us to the frontier of the regulatory effort, and I think of it as really something that we have to achieve in this decade or in the third decade of the digital century.\nOver the years, you know, we\u2019ve kind of had to flinch a little bit when we watched our elected officials interrogating the tech executives because they seemed so outmatched. Well, those tables really have turned. Andin March, what we saw for the first time was congresspeople that really have grasped the economic model here and the unaccountable power that has accrued to these companies. And for the first time, we heard them saying we understand this information is a byproduct of your economics. And this is going to end and we\u2019re going to end it.\nApple\u2019s products are expensive. Is there a premium on privacy that only some can afford?\nAndroid, of course, is by far the dominant smartphone in most countries. We see people who can\u2019t afford privacy. And the idea of privacy as a luxury is a profoundly intolerable idea.\nCan you talk about how the pandemic has empowered these tech companies in their data collection?\nWhat\u2019s happening in this remote education space now is truly frightening.\nThe huge irony here is that the outbreak of the pandemic was exactly the same time frame in which theNew Mexico attorney general filed his class-action suitagainst Google Classroom, citing its illicit data extraction practices aimed at children.\nNow you\u2019ve got this whole sector called school safety technology. And then another sector called proctoring systems, which are these for-profit companies that attach to Google Classroom. When you dig into what these systems are doing, they\u2019re being paid by school systems, school districts for these services and, the so-called safety systems, they\u2019re tracking everything from notifications from social media, email files, chats, posts, messages, all documents, anything to do with the remote schooling activities. And then the proctoring systems, they\u2019re doing facial recognition, gaze and eye movements to track attention. They\u2019re producing what they call \u201csuspicion scores.\u201d They\u2019re also taking microphones. They\u2019re taking cameras. They\u2019re insisting that cameras record your surroundings and broadcast that to the proctor.\nAnd students and their families have no pushback because they\u2019re saying that students can\u2019t even access the data. They\u2019re not even doing a performative statement where they\u2019re agreeing to limit retention or third party sharing. They can just do whatever they want.\nAnd during the pandemic, this data collection touches almost every facet of our lives, from remote work to school to socializing. Do you feel like that ubiquity is in some ways immobilizing?\nI feel the ubiquity is a vehicle for spreading resistance.Big, professional polls[are] showing this decidedly isnot the end of \u201ctechlash.\u201d It was at least some confirmation for my hypothesis that the more we\u2019re exposed to it and dependent on it, the more that nexus becomes a vehicle for precipitating resistance, repugnance and revulsion."

        "title": "Americans Actually Want Privacy. Shocking.",
        "fulltext": "Many of the biggest tech firms have long insisted that consumers care more about free services than the privacy they surrender to use them.\nCompanies like Facebook pointed to their own exponential growth and insisted that consumers were voting with their feet.\nTurns out, that was nonsense.\nWhen offered an actual choice in the new operating system that runs iPhones, Americans are all in on privacy.\nJust6 percentof U.S. daily users of Apple\u2019s latest mobile software are opting to allow companies like Facebook and its many affiliates to hoover up data about them and sell it to advertisers, according to Flurry Analytics. (The figure is higher globally, at about 15 percent.)\nFacebook tracks users everywhere online because it can sell ads at a higher rate to marketers when it has highly detailed personal information, known as targeted advertising. That\u2019s why advertisements on Facebook are often creepily specific \u2014 a Google search for jeans might later yield ads for Gap jeans in the style, fit and colors you like. Facebook and others can inform advertisers how effective the ads are and whether your personal traits will match well with subsequent ads for charcoal grills, Barbie dolls, gardening equipment or Billy Joel tickets.\nSince late last year, Facebook has been carrying on a very publicfitover Apple\u2019s new privacy option, arguing that it hurts small businesses. The logic is that without the extensive personal information users provide back to Facebook for dispersal to data brokers and marketers, mom-and-pop shops simplycannot successfully hawkhandbags, burger seasoning or plumbing services.\nOf course, the social network\u2019s objections are really about Facebook\u2019s ad sales business, which generated$25.4 billionin the first three months of 2021 alone. Anything,Facebook professes, that threatens its ability to trail users as they browse retail, travel, news and other sites could threaten the company\u2019s ability to offer its social media sites \u201cfree of charge.\u201d\n\u201cFacebook is really saying: What can we do to protect our business model?\u201d said Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely unsurprising that they would oppose a change that introduces more control to consumers and less opportunity to collect data that can be fed back to advertisers, even if that\u2019s what consumers are saying that\u2019s what they want.\u201d\nEarly data shows that consumers overwhelmingly want more privacy. Apple\u2019s new operating system for phones forces each app to ask permission to track users across the internet \u2014 a choice that was previously available but difficult to find.\nAlmost all users opted out.\nClay Gendron, an analyst at Southern New Hampshire University, said the choice to opt out of tracking was an easy one for him. Apps \u201care asking me to opt in to being tracked so I can have better \u2018curated\u2019 ads,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like they are telling me I should be grateful and want them to sell my data to be a better target to advertise to. It\u2019s just a comically terrible value proposition.\u201d\nOther app companies includingEtsyandPandoratry a different approach by reminding users in mobile pop-ups that their free services are supported by targeted advertising. TheWeather Networkimplies that tracking users helps it save lives.TwitterandNextdoorsimply want customers to have the most \u201crelevant\u201d ads.\nBut customers shouldn\u2019t be guilted into helping people sell them stuff. Without knowing that a user spent 20 minutes browsing cooking gadgets on Sur La Table, advertisers can do a pretty good job of guessing who is most likely to want to see meal kit ads, through a type of marketing known as contextual advertising. That relies on clues they can more easily glean, such as general age, gender, location and income level.\nAdvertisers are willing to pay much more for ads targeted based on users\u2019 behavior. But there\u2019s evidence that websites don\u2019t see much of a revenue bump from that upcharge. According to a2019 study, sites may reap only a 4 percent reward for targeted ads after middlemen take their cut, belying app developers\u2019 arguments that their business is reliant on tracking.\nThere\u2019s the very real likelihood that marketers could use the savings from lower advertising prices on Apple devices to reach customers in more creative ways than just sticking ads on Facebook and Twitter. That might include traditional media and other apps \u2014 a potential benefit to smaller developers.\nConsumers have no federal rights to privacy, leaving tech companies to put in place policies as they see fit. And critics allege Apple may be coming out with the changes to get ahead of regulatory pressure and an ongoing antitrust lawsuit over its app store. Advertising is only a small part of Apple\u2019s business, meaning it can afford to take a cut in revenue while sticking it to competitors.\nIronically, Apple will have to act even more like a regulator itself to ensure that app developers are following the rules of its new software. Snapchat\u2019s parent, for instance,reportedlystudied ways to circumvent Apple\u2019s rules about tracking users, as did anindustry groupfor Chinese app developers.\nUsers should have more control over their data, and Apple\u2019s solution is a step forward. Between phishing, robocalls and texts, malware and nagging pop-ups, there is enough manipulation online already without eerily specific ads that follow you around the web.\nGoogle, which like Facebook has a huge part of its business in advertising, tookbaby stepsthis week toward adding privacy features to its Android mobile software, including options to obscure precise location data and show more detail about the information that apps are collecting. But it needs to get serious about consumers\u2019 rights or risk losing customers to Apple.\nCompanies did just fine for decades marketing to consumers without access to their every movement or keyboard and mouse click. And with 94 percent of Americans saying they liked it that way, it\u2019s time for advertisers to listen.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "The Week in Business: A Plan for Paid Family Leave",
        "fulltext": "Good morning and happy May. Is anyone else itching for a vacation, or just a chance to go \u2026 elsewhere? Good news: If you\u2019re vaccinated, you could escape to Europe (and help boost its ailing tourism industry) as soon as this summer. Here\u2019s what you need to know for the week ahead in business and tech news. \u2014Charlotte Cowles\nIn his first address to Congress, President Biden detailed hisAmerican Families Plan, the third huge spending proposal that he has put forth in his 100 days in office. (The first was the$1.9 trillion stimulus package,signed into law in March, and the second was theAmerican Jobs Plan, which focuses on infrastructure and has yet to pass Congress.) The latest proposal includes financing for universal prekindergarten, federal paid family leave, a permanent expanded child tax credit, subsidized child care for low- and middle-income families andfree community college, among other initiatives. To pay for it, Mr. Biden wants to raise taxes on the rich. But most Republicans are opposed to tax increases and say the plan costs too much.\nMore signs of life from the economy. The country\u2019s first-quarter gross domestic product wasup 6.4 percent, at an annualized rate, according to the Commerce Department. That\u2019s almost back to its prepandemic high. Consumer spending is also on the rise, and some analysts believe that it could grow more than 9 percent this year \u2014 a record \u2014 as health and job conditions continue to improve, and travel and dining open back up.\nThe pandemic has beengreat for the tech giants. Amazon\u2019s latest quarterly report showedsuch blockbuster sales\u2014 up 44 percent from the previous year \u2014 that it beat even the most optimistic forecasts. Meanwhile,Apple\u2019s profits grew 54 percent, mostly thanks to soaring iPhone sales. AndFacebook nearly doubled its revenueduring the same time period, while Twitter\u2019sjumped 28 percent. (Both companies have barred former President Donald J. Trump and some extremist figures from posting on their platforms since January, but it clearly hasn\u2019t hurt their bottom lines.)\nThe fight between Apple and Epic Games, which makes the popular video game Fortnite, heads to a federal court in California this week. The disputebegan last yearwhen Epic started selling Fortnite directly to its customers, violating its contract with Apple, which makes a 30 percent commission from App Store sales. Apple retaliated by kicking Fortnight off its store, and Epic fought back with a lawsuit. The case will be closely watched by other companies and lawmakers who have raised concerns about the App Store\u2019s anti-competitive practices. Those include European regulators, whoon Friday accused Appleof violating antitrust laws by imposing unfair rules and fees on rival music-streaming services.\nFor the good of your fellow humans, don\u2019t stockpile toilet paper. But bear in mind that it\u2019s about toget more expensive. Companies like Procter & Gamble, General Mills and Kimberly-Clark are all raising prices on everyday necessities like tampons, toilet paper, diapers and cereal this year to make up for increasing costs of production and shipping. Those costs grew during the pandemic, particularly when supply chains were pinched, but companies were reluctant to pass them along to struggling consumers. Now that the economy is starting to stabilize, expect some price adjustments to make up for the past year.\nThe travel industry is ready for takeoff \u2014 if you\u2019re vaccinated, that is. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventioneased rules for cruise lines to resume operations, allowing some ships to set sail as soon as mid-July if they attest that 98 percent of the crew and 95 percent of passengers are fully vaccinated. And the European Union said that American tourists with vaccine certificateswould be allowed to visit the blocthis summer, more than a year since it banned nonessential travel from most countries.\nThe Food and Drug Administration announceda long-anticipated banon selling menthol cigarettes as well as all flavored cigars. (Possession will remain legal, however.) Amazonwill increase paybetween 50 cents and $3 an hour for half a million of its workers. And the Federal Reserveleft interest rates near zero, playing down a rise in inflation and promising to continue support for the recovering economy."

        "title": "Can a Smartwatch Save Your Life?",
        "fulltext": "On a recent Saturday, my 87-year-old mother was feeling a bit woozy, so she pressed a button on the side of herApple watchto reveal her ECG, a recording of her heart\u2019s electric rhythm. Thirty seconds later, three messages appeared on the watch\u2019s screen. One showed the characteristic zigzag spikes of the ECG, or electrocardiogram. The second revealed that her heart rate, usually 80 beats per minutes, was down to only 40. The third said the results were \u201cinconclusive,\u201d with the advice: \u201cCall your doctor.\u201d\nMy mother is ahardy octogenarian. She walks about a mile every day, works out with a trainer (currently via Zoom) three times a week and, as she often used to say, planks nearly as well as her former sorority sister, the lateRuth Bader Ginsburg.\nAfter leaving a message with her doctor\u2019s office, she called my brother, a doctor who lives nearby, and told him she was exhausted and \u201cjust not feeling right.\u201d He came over immediately and took her to the emergency room.\nThere, the hospital\u2019s electrocardiogram, which provides a more detailed readout than thewatch, showed that the electrical signals in the top part of the heart were not being transmitted properly to the bottom. Her heart was beating, but too slowly. The staff rushed her to the cardiac care unit, where doctors implanted a pacemaker the next morning.\nWhen she called a longtime friend to tell her the story, the friend responded that she\u2019d likewise had a recent smartwatch scare: her heart rate was sky-high, reaching 182. Her doctor had her wear a Holter monitor, a medical-grade portable ECG device that monitors heart rhythm continuously, for four days and advised her to keep a diary of symptoms, such as chest pain or a skipped heartbeat. She didn\u2019t notice any, and the report from the Holter device revealed that everything was fine.\nThe advent of smartwatches that retrieve heart physiology both excites and worries physicians. In addition to Apple, a number of companies make wearable ECG monitors for home use, includingSamsung,Withings,FitbitandAliveCor. And for every story like my mother\u2019s, in which a warning leads to the placement a potentially lifesaving pacemaker, there are many more like her friend\u2019s, in which minor variations in heartbeats lead to needless work-ups, treatments with risky side effects and lots of unnecessary anxiety.\nSo are these wearables worth it?\nConclusive evidence about their accuracy and cost effectiveness is lacking, though an Apple-sponsoredstudy from 2019 published in The New England Journal of Medicinesuggested they may help to detect some kinds of abnormal heart rhythms, particularly in the elderly. A slew of additional studies are underway, including ones to assesswhether a smartwatch can actually help to save lives, or whethermobility measures such as step count lead to fewer heart attacksand hospitalizations.\nMost of these at-home ECG watches are designed to record heart rate and detectatrial fibrillation, the most common irregular heart rhythm, which affects up to six million Americans. A-fib, as it\u2019s called, increases the risk of strokes, leading to 150,000 deaths and 450,000 hospitalizations a year. But doctors say that many people have an irregular heartbeat every now and then that doesn\u2019t have clinical implications.\nLike many new technologies that uncover things in the body that doctors don\u2019t yet fully understand, these devices may alert the user about an irregular heartbeat, but not all irregularities are dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s like we just invented the microscope and are seeing microorganisms, and we don\u2019t know what they are,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale. \u201cWe are seeing things, and we aren\u2019t sure if it denotes extra risk.\u201d\nMost watches wait to send an alert until there have been about five abnormal beats within an hour or so, rather than after every altered rhythm. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean the abnormality is dangerous.\n\u201cAs a cardiologist, I really like at-home devices,\u201d said Dr. Gary Rogal, medical director of cardiovascular services at RWJBarnabas Health in West Orange, N.J., whose team cared for my mother. But he clarified he likes them only for patients in whom he feels there\u2019s an indication to look for something, such as those with an existing heart condition or a family history of heart disease. \u201cI would never subscribe to the concept that everyone should be monitored. You\u2019ll see stuff and it will make you crazy, but you\u2019re probably fine.\u201d\nThe American Heart Association agrees that smartwatch monitors could be beneficial, even lifesaving, for some, but Dr. Mariell Jessup, the group\u2019s chief science and medical officer, said, \u201cwe do not have enough data yet to recommend it for everyone.\u201d\nEven electrocardiograms performed at a doctor\u2019s office aren\u2019t routinely recommended for everyone. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a group of experts that advises on screening tests, saysthere is not enough evidence to show that routine ECGs are effectiveand worries about the costs, and potential dangers, of further testing.\nAnd doctors worry that as more and more people wear these devices that might spot meaningless heart arrhythmias, there could be a flood of unnecessary follow-up testing and too much treatment.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me up at night,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Ross, a professor of medicine and public health at Yale who is among a team of investigatorsconducting a randomized clinical trialthat compares a group wearing the Apple watch to a control group wearing a smartwatch without the ECG app. \u201cIf someone with an occasional abnormal rhythm that would never have caused a stroke undergoes an extensive work-up or is put on a blood thinner, the risk of a dangerous bleed or other harm outweighs the benefits of potentially preventing a stroke.\u201d\nDr. Steven Lubitz, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, fears that customers will think the watches provide a safeguard for overall heart health and assume, for example, they check for signs of heart attacks, which they do not.\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s story is the hope for all of these devices. In her case, the technology led to a diagnosis of a dangerously slow heart rate,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date, most of the tech work on heart rate has beenfocused on detecting A-fib. Similar rigor may be required to validate the detection of other health conditions.\u201d\nWe may be on the verge of entering a new era of medicine in which patients can glance at their wrists to check their emails and heart rhythms and notify their physicians if something seems awry. In the perfect health care world, cardiologists envision a day where they canprescribe a watch or other small clip-on device to high-risk patientsand insurance would cover the cost. Otherwise, the advent of new technology would only help those who can afford it, exacerbating health inequities.\nAs Dr. Ross noted, \u201cI want to see more scrutiny, to know whether these digital devices that consumers can purchase are making our patients\u2019 lives better.\u201d\nTwo weeks after her surgery, my mother was doing her one-minute planks and lifting weights with her Zoom personal trainer. Maybe, without the watch, my mother would have been OK and just felt really tired until she called her doctor on Monday. Or maybe not."
