        "title": "Apple Scales Back Its Ambitions for a Self-Driving Car",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As new employees were brought into Apple\u2019s secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the company\u2019s next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry.\nThese days, Apple\u2019s automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said inan interview with Bloombergin June that Apple is \u201cfocusing on autonomous systems.\u201d\nA notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\nFive people familiar with Apple\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cTitan,\u201d discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple\u2019s plans.\nThe project\u2019s reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.\nApple\u2019s testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the company\u2019s main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif.\nApple\u2019s in-house shuttle service, which isn\u2019t operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world.\nApple has a history of tinkering with a technology until its engineers figure out what to do with it. The company worked on touch screens for years, for example, before that technology became an essential part of the iPhone.\nBut the initial scale of Apple\u2019s driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle.\nIt was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware.\nFrom the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays.\nThe team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.\nApple even looked into reinventing the wheel. A team within Titan investigated the possibility of using spherical wheels \u2014 round like a globe \u2014 instead of the traditional, round ones, because spherical wheels could allow the car better lateral movement.\nBut the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.\nThere was disagreement about whether Apple should develop a fully autonomous vehicle or a semiautonomous car that could drive itself for stretches but allow the driver to retake control.\nSteve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people.\nA similar debate raged inside Google\u2019s self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldn\u2019t be trusted to retake control in an emergency.\nEven though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apple\u2019s own programming language, or the industry standard, C++.\nMr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment.\nLast year, Apple started torein in the project. The company tapped Bob Mansfield, a longtime executive who over the years had led hardware engineering for some of Apple\u2019s most successful products, to oversee Titan.\nMr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.\nMore recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production.\nApple\u2019s headlong foray into autonomous vehicles underscores one of the biggest challenges facing the company: finding the next breakthrough product. As Apple celebrates the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, the company remains heavily dependent on smartphone sales for growth. It has introduced new products like the Apple Watch andexpanded revenue from services, but the iPhone still accounts for more than half of its sales.\nIn April, the California Department of Motor Vehiclesgranted Apple a test permitto allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015Lexus RX 450hsport utility vehicles. There will be a safety driver monitoring the car during testing.\nWhile many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet.\nWith expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield. Still, one of the biggest challenges is holding onto talented engineers because self-driving technology is one of the hottest things in Silicon Valley, and Apple is hardly the only company working on it."

        "title": "Apple, Citing U.S. Sanctions, Removes Popular Apps in Iran",
        "fulltext": "TEHRAN \u2014 Officially, Apple has no presence in Iran. Because of American sanctions against the country, the company\u2019s iPhones are not legally available for sale here, and Apple does not offer a version of its App Store in the country.\nThat has not stopped Iranians from snapping up millions of iPhones smuggled in from places like Dubai and Hong Kong. Nor has it kept Iranian app developers from creating thousands of apps for local users and offering them through App Stores outside Iran.\nNow, Apple is moving aggressively to shut down Iranian apps. The crackdown here follows the company\u2019s recentremoval of apps in China that allowed residents to evade censorsand gain access to the global internet, and were deemed illegal by the Chinese government.\nOn Thursday, Apple removedSnapp, a ride-hailing app similar to Uber that is popular in Iran, from its app stores. That followed the removal in recent weeks of apps for food delivery, shopping and other services.\nIn a message to Iranian developers whose apps were affected by the ban, Apple said, \u201cUnder the U.S. sanctions regulations, the App Store cannot host, distribute or do business with apps or developers connected to certain U.S. embargoed countries.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, confirmed the message\u2019s authenticity. He declined further comment.\nMahdi Taghizadeh, a founder of DelionFoods, an online food delivery service, said his app was among those taken down.\n\u201cWe work so hard, and have to fight all the time, and now this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNo one with an iPhone can download any of the popular apps any more. Imagine if in the U.S. you wouldn\u2019t be able to get Uber on your phone.\u201d\nMr. Taghizadeh hasprotested the move online, starting a campaign on Twitter, #StopRemovingIranianApps, to press Apple to end the crackdown. (Although the Iranian government has blocked Twitter in the country, determined users find ways to reach it.)\nGoogle, which allows Android developers to publish apps in Iran so long as they do not involve purchases, does not appear to have taken a similar action against Iranian apps in its Play store, and itsformal Playguidelines allow apps to be distributed in the country.\nIn addition to blocking Twitter, the Iranian government has long blocked Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube service.\nWhen it comes to technology, American sanctions against Iran over its nuclear weapons program are complicated. The Obama administration eased restrictions on American tech companies that offered internet services in Iran as a way of encouraging a free flow of information, especially among younger Iranians.\nThe Trump administration has modified the overall sanctions, and President Trump signed a new sanctions bill into law this month. It is unclear whether the administration meant to impose new restrictions on technology companies.\nEuropean countries lifted all sanctions against Iran after the 2016 nuclear agreement was reached.\nApple told Iranian developers in February to remove any payment options in their apps to prevent Iranian money from entering the United States in violation of the sanctions. Iran had developed its own internal online payment system,shaparak, in response to the sanctions. After the Apple notice, almost all Iranian apps, including Snapp, switched to shaparak, cash and other methods of payment.\n\u201cThe full removal of Iranian apps by Apple means our work will be much more complicated,\u201d said Mr. Taghizadeh. His company had started an online campaign to attract more customers, but has decided to halt those efforts for now. \u201cWhat is the point when people can\u2019t download your app?\u201d\nIran\u2019s new telecommunications minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, complained on Twitter about Apple\u2019s decision to remove the apps and said he was planning to pursue the issue.\nMr. Azari Jahromiwrote in Persianthat \u201c11 percent of the cellphone market in Iran belongs to Apple.\u201d He added: \u201cRespecting customer rights is a principle today that Apple hasn\u2019t abided by. We will legally pursue the omission of apps.\u201d\nMr. Azari Jahromi is Iran\u2019s youngest minister. He hinted last week that Twitter and YouTube might be unblocked in the country, but he also said the decision was not his to make.\nTwitter declined to comment, and YouTube had no immediate comment on the minister\u2019s remarks.\nApple is not formally represented in Iran, because of the American trade restrictions. Samsung, one of its key competitors,opened a large sales center in the country in February."

        "title": "China Casts a Wary Eye at an iPhone Cash Cow, the App Store",
        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 In China, where Western-owned online services like Facebook and Google have long been blocked, Apple\u2019s app store is a lucrative exception. Apple offers gaming, dining and dating apps in a country where most rivals are locally owned \u2014 and where it can reap big fees from iPhone users.\nThat business is now facing a number of threats.\nThe latest came this week, when a law firm representing more than two dozen app developers asked the Chinese authorities to investigate whether Apple\u2019s app store policies violated local pricing and antitrust laws.\nWhile it is not clear whether the government will respond, the call follows several other developments that have put a spotlight on the software and content that Apple offers in China. They include tighter regulations from the country\u2019s censors and a high-profile public spat with a powerful and deeply connected Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings.\nThe challenges point to Apple\u2019s difficulties in China, which is a major market for the company.Sales in Chinahave fallen as customerswait for new iPhonesand as domestic rivals make bigger and better devices. Apple, in response, has shifted its strategy to become increasingly dependent on services instead of hardware sales, making it more vulnerable to the whims of Chinese regulators.\n\u201cApple has been more successful in China than any Western tech company because their business model \u2014 selling devices that integrate software and hardware \u2014 couldn\u2019t be copied and couldn\u2019t be blocked,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst who runs the website Stratechery.\n\u201cDevices are sold once,\u201d Mr. Thompson added, \u201cbut services are delivered over time, which means they can be interrupted or held hostage at any time.\u201d\nApple faces a number of issues with its software businesses in China. Regulatorsshut down Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies serviceshere just six months after they were introduced. Apple has also removed a number of apps from its Chinese app store at the request of the government, includingVPN softwarethat can help internet users evade censorship, and news appscreated by The New York Times.\nApple has made other moves to stay on the good side of Beijing. Itinvested $1 billionin the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing and announced plans last month toopen a data centerin China to comply with a new cybersecurity law.\nGreater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is one of Apple\u2019s largest markets after the United States. Its mainland app store has been a crucial part of its success. In June, the app store in the mainland accounted for almost a third of Apple\u2019s worldwide app store revenue, according to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps.\nWhile China has many locally owned app stores that sell software for phones running Google\u2019s mobile operating system Android, Apple has the business for its iOS platform to itself. As in other markets, Apple makes money from services bought over the platform, including purchases made within apps themselves.\nBut officials in China have shown a growing sensitivity to foreign companies \u2014 particularly in the technology field \u2014 that enjoy a strong market share in the country. Two years ago,Qualcomm, the American chip maker, agreed to paya $975 million finefor violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law after being accused of abusing its dominant market position.\nThe complaint from Chinese app developers filed this week accused Apple of removing apps from its store without providing reasonable explanations and of taking disproportionate commissions on in-app purchases. The complaint wasearlier reported by The Financial Times.\nA statement from Dare & Sure Law Firm, a Beijing-based firm that said it had filed the complaint on behalf of 28 app developers, said, \u201cSteve Jobs and Apple\u2019s \u2018American dream\u2019 have inspired the people. So why are these young Chinese software developers who also want to pursue the \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019 of becoming entrepreneurs and improving their families\u2019 quality of life through honest work any different?\u201d\nLin Wei, a lawyer at Dare & Sure, said the firm had not received a response from either the National Development and Reform Commission or from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the two government agencies with which the complaint was lodged. Neither agency responded to multiple telephone calls on Thursday seeking comment.\nApple said in a statement that, \u201cWe continue to expand our local developer relations team in China and are working hard to help developers be successful on the App Store,\u201d adding that its guidelines applied \u201cequally to all developers in every country where we operate.\u201d\nWhether any official action will be taken is unclear. China\u2019s antimonopoly law is less than a decade old, and experts are still waiting to see how it will be implemented. But according to Hu Gang, secretary general of the research center of the Internet Society of China, a Beijing-based organization backed by the Chinese government, the authorities are likely to pursue the complaint.\n\u201cApple took advantage of its position of unilateral dominance to set unfair conditions for its competitors, and collected a huge commission in the process of doing so,\u201d Mr. Hu said. \u201cThis kind of operation is not tenable according to typical business logic.\u201d\n\u201cThe relevant departments will definitely accept the complaint,\u201d Mr. Hu added. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d\nThe complaint follows the recent tussle between Apple and Tencent Holdings, which brought the American company\u2019s position in China into sharp relief.\nTencent owns the messaging service WeChat, which is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese smartphone owners to communicate, shop and pay bills, among many other services.\nIn January, Tencent gave users the option to open \u201cmini-apps\u201d in WeChat, essentially allowing iOS users to bypass Apple\u2019s app store.\nThen, in April, Apple ordered Tencent to shutter its popular \u201ctipping\u201d function, which allowed WeChat users to reward content generators like emoji creators or bloggers with small monetary gifts using WeChat\u2019s in-app payment system. Apple said in a statement at the time that WeChat could still permit users to tip, as long as the function used Apple\u2019s purchase system.\nThe American company has since moved to cool those tensions. In a conference call last week, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, praised Tencent and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.\u201d"

        "title": "Dear iPhone: Here\u2019s Why We\u2019re Still Together After 10 Years",
        "fulltext": "Dear iPhone: It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re still together after 10 years, which is eons in the tech industry.\nWhat\u2019s the glue that keeps us together? For one, I rarely get lost now that I always have a GPS device in my pocket. After lots of practice with your camera, I\u2019ve become a decent photographer. And I\u2019m more punctual and responsive thanks to constant access to my calendar and email.\nSince Steve Jobsintroduced the iPhone in 2007, the smartphone has become a close \u2014 if not the closest \u2014 digital pal for millions of people around the world. With more than 1.2 billion iPhones sold to date, it has also become one of the best-selling gadgets ever. And even though Apple\u2019s phones typically cost several times more than rival handsets, the company is No. 2 in sales in the smartphone industry after Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cPeople spend hours on it every day, so they can justify paying more for what they believe to be the best device,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who has studied Apple for years and called the company\u2019s positioning of the iPhone \u201cunique.\u201d\nYet the iPhone is now in a precarious position. Gone is the thrill of downloading yet another app. It isn\u2019t as exciting anymore if the screens of the gadget get bigger or the device becomes thinner. And the middle age of the iPhone is reflected in its sales, whichdipped for the first time last year. It doesn\u2019t help that Apple also faces fierce competition, especially in markets like China and India where people are flocking to cheaper smartphones that are increasingly capable and attractive.\nMany eyes are now on Apple\u2019s 10th anniversary event for the iPhone, which is expected to be held next month. There, Apple is set to introduce major upgrades for the next iPhones, which could stoke our appetites again for the gadget. Or not.\nChief among the changes for the new iPhones: refreshed versions, including a premium model priced at around $999, according to people briefed on the product, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apple made room for a bigger screen on that model by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction, the people said.\nHere\u2019s a look back at the last 10 years of why the iPhone still has us in its grip \u2014 so much that people keep coming back for more.\nThe role of Apple stores in keeping people loyal to iPhones cannot be overstated. The Apple stores include the so-called Genius Bar for getting repairs, so when things go wrong with an iPhone, you can simply schedule a repair appointment at the nearest location.\nTheGenius Baris a boon to average people who need occasional help with their tech. Getting support directly from Apple means you may have your problems resolved immediately, rather than having to bring the phone to a wireless carrier or mail the phone to a repair center and wait for it to return, like you typically have to do with phones made by other companies.\nSecurity experts agree that the iPhone\u2019s operating system is architecturally more secure than Android. The main reason is that Apple\u2019s iOS can only run apps that Apple approved to be distributed in the App Store. By contrast, Android phones are capable of running software from outside of Google\u2019s official app store, and apps from unauthorized sources are more likely to carry malware.\nThe trade-off for stronger security, of course, is flexibility. Android users are free to tinker with their devices using custom software, while iPhone customers can only use apps that play by Apple\u2019s rules.\n\u201cThe iPhone is still arguably the best phone for regular people who just want their device to work without having to worry about lots of technical settings or malware,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research.\nSoftware updates are another factor in security. Apple issues its own software updates, making it easy for iPhones to get the latest security enhancements. By contrast, Android device makers have to coordinate software updates with carriers, making the process more complicated and time consuming.\nThe upshot: About87 percentof Apple devices are running the latest iOS today, while only about13 percentof Android users are running Nougat, the latest Google operating system.\nFor the last few years, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to privacy. Apple, he said, derives most of its profit from sales of hardware, not trading your user data. To further prove his point, Apple engaged in amajor legal battlelast year with the F.B.I., resisting the agency\u2019s request to weaken iPhone encryption for a criminal investigation.\nSome critics havepoked holesin Apple\u2019sprivacy commitment. For one, the company collects plenty of data about how people use technology, including information that can be used for marketing and advertising services.\nStill, privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation andElectronic Privacy Information Center, have praised Apple for making efforts to protect consumer privacy with features like built-in encryption and browsing technologies that block advertising trackers.\nIPhones work well with other Apple devices like Macs and the Apple TV. Once you invest in other Apple products, it\u2019s tough to leave the ecosystem. The Apple Watch makes it especially tough: It requires an iPhone to work properly. So if you were to switch to Android, prepare for your smart watch to transform into a dumb watch.\nLess sticky is Apple\u2019s ecosystem of apps and web services. For every major Apple app, including Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple Photos, there are alternatives like Google Maps, Spotify and Google Photos. It\u2019s difficult to resist using iMessage, Apple\u2019s default text messaging service. But there are plenty of alternatives like WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal.\nThe iPhone has become a brand associated with reliability and satisfaction. A survey conducted last December by the research firm451 Researchfound that among smartphone owners, iPhone customers were the most satisfied, followed by owners of devices from Samsung, Motorola and LG.\nMr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein said Apple had created a \u201cbrand halo\u201d for the iPhone by positioning it as a premium product with easy-to-use software and high-quality features, components and capabilities.\nNotably, among current iPhone customers surveyed by 451 Research, 91 percent of those who planned on buying a new smartphone in the near future said they intended to buy another iPhone."

        "title": "Matthew Prince of Cloudflare on the Dangers of Fast Growth",
        "fulltext": "This interview withMatthew Prince, chief executive ofCloudflare, a cybersecurity firm, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.\nQ. What were your early years like?\nA.I grew up in a small town in Utah. There were just 60 of us in our graduating class. I did debate and a little bit of theater. I was also a skier and worked on the weekends as an assistant ski instructor.\nTell me about your parents.\nBoth my parents are entrepreneurs. My dad has done a million things over the years. He\u2019s been a journalist. He started his own stock brokerage firm. He owns more than 30 restaurants across three states now. I definitely saw the struggles of entrepreneurship. Restaurants are a really tough business.\nMy mom owned a collection of gift stores, and I would work for her when I was in school. She has a really great eye for spotting the next trend.\nHow have they influenced your leadership style?\nMy dad was always good at what I would describe as panicking early, which I think of as looking way out over the horizon and thinking through a decision and the 50 steps down the road. That\u2019s served me really well.\nMy mom would always say that it\u2019s better to have a couple of nice things than a lot of mediocre things. We\u2019ve applied that lesson at work, to do a few things really well.\nDid you have an idea what you wanted to do for a career when you went to college?\nWhen I was 7 years old, my grandmother gave me an Apple II Plus for Christmas, and I took to it like a duck to water. Computers made a lot of sense to me. My mom used to sneak me into computer science classes at the University of Utah, pretending that she was taking the continuing education classes, and I would basically do all the work.\nSo I planned to study computer science. But I took a couple of courses and I was bored out of my mind. So I transferred my major to English literature, and kept computer science as a minor.\nWhen I graduated, I had job offers at a bunch of tech companies that I thought weren\u2019t going to go anywhere, like Netscape and Yahoo and Microsoft. And I remember thinking that I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life sitting in front of a computer writing code. So I decided to go to law school.\nI eventually found my way to the world of start-ups. I became pretty hooked on starting something from scratch. Working at a start-up is almost like a drug. There\u2019s something very powerful about going from an idea on a piece of paper to enough money in a bank account to fund it, to building a team.\nI started working on Cloudflare as a business-school project in 2009, and my co-founders and I opened an office in California in January 2010.\nWhat are some leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned?\nThe three of us who started Cloudflare each have our strengths and weaknesses. But together we formed a really great foundation. The way my co-founder Michelle [Zatlyn] describes it is that when you\u2019re starting a business, you\u2019ve got a certain surface area that you\u2019ve got to cover.\nIt\u2019s kind of like a Venn diagram. You want people who can cover as much of that surface area as possible. You don\u2019t want them so completely disparate that they can\u2019t even communicate, so you need a little bit of overlap. If you\u2019ve got too much overlap, then you end up fighting over whose job it is.\nWhat else?\nWhen the company was just eight of us, a younger engineer suggested a new tradition \u2014 every Friday after work, we go get drinks at a local pub, talk about the week and get to know each other outside of work.\nMichelle and I vetoed that idea, and people said, \u201cWhy? Are you the fun police?\u201d I explained that when you look at successful organizations, they\u2019re defined by their ability to pull from the broadest possible pool of people. At some point, we\u2019re going to want to hire a 50-year-old single mom or dad who has to pick up their daughter from soccer practice on Friday afternoons.\nIf they can\u2019t feel like they\u2019re part of the team, then they\u2019re not going to come work for us. That\u2019s going to massively narrow the pool of people we can hire from. We wanted to make Cloudflare a place where, no matter who you were, you could come here and work, and you\u2019d be judged on that work. We weren\u2019t trying to recreate college.\nI also watched other companies stumble because they grow too fast. If you\u2019re growing faster than doubling the number of employees in any 12-month period, then inherently you\u2019re going to have more new people than old people. And in the short term, maybe that\u2019s fine. But the culture can start to suffer because there\u2019s nothing foundational to keep you stable.\nWe have a rule across the organization, and on a team level, to never grow faster than doubling in any 12-month period. For start-ups like us, there\u2019s constant pressure to grow faster, but if you do that, then there are no culture-keepers of the organization.\nHow do you hire?\nI look for an incredibly high degree of curiosity \u2014 people who just relentlessly want to learn new things and put themselves in new situations \u2014 and a high degree of empathy. If people are curious and empathetic, they can learn just about anything.\nOne of the best ways to tell whether someone\u2019s curious and empathetic is to ask them for the questions they have. You can see how their mind works and how thoughtful they are.\nWhat career and life advice do you give to new college grads?\nReally understand your strengths and weaknesses, and surround yourself with people who complement you and challenge you. That will help you continue to grow.\nAs I look back on my career, I\u2019ve always had partners in crime. Starting a company on your own can be horrifically lonely."

We wanted to get the jump on ruining people\u2019s weekends.\nMike:Ahoy, Farhad! Yes, I\u2019m curious how this experiment goes. Normally, I enjoyed being the first thing people woke up to on a lazy Saturday, but perhaps folks want a nice overview of the week they had and what they may have missed while still on the clock.\nOh, and I\u2019ll be on vacation next week, so please don\u2019t let any huge news happen in my absence. Our editor might have a nervous breakdown if there\u2019s news.(Editor\u2019s note: True.)\nFarhad:OK, that\u2019s it for inane banter. Let\u2019s get to tech news.\nFirst: Despite some bluster from the president, it looks like the government is going to let Amazon keep getting bigger.The Federal Trade Commission saidthat it had investigated Amazon\u2019s proposed purchase of Whole Foods Market on antitrust grounds and found nothing wrong.\nThis was not a huge surprise; investors expected the deal to go through. But President Trumphas been criticizing Amazon and its C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, for months\u2014 he has repeatedly argued that Bezos\u2019 newspaper, The Washington Post, has been critical of Trump only because Bezos wants favorable treatment for his companies. But it looks like Trump\u2019s bark was worse than his bite.\nAmazon promptly followed this up by announcing it wouldlower the pricesof some goods at Whole Foods, starting on Monday.\nMike:I think this is a bigger deal than people realize. Look at what Amazon is buying here: a bunch of grocery stores, yes. But as I tweeted this week, it really feels like a huge real estate deal to me.\nWhole Foods owns or leases more than 400 retail locations throughout the United States, each of which sits on anywhere from 25,000 to 50,000 square feet of land. That\u2019s a lot of space. Imagine, as many have said, that Amazon decides to parcel off a piece of each store as a holding zone for Amazon packages or perhaps instant Prime deliveries.\nOne of Amazon\u2019s biggest challenges has been so-called last-mile delivery, or dropping off the item I ordered at my house. Having multiple distribution outlets in city centers could speed up local delivery times.\nThe other thing I keep thinking about are those large kitchens in every Whole Foods. What would keep Amazon from diving into the business of delivering prepared meals, or even meal kits like the ones Blue Apron offers? The possibilities are endless.\nThat said, the deal hasn\u2019t closed quite yet. We\u2019ll see what happens.\nFarhad:In other retail news,Google and Walmart announced that they would team up to take on Amazon. Google makes a device called Google Home, a voice-activated home assistant that\u2019s meant to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo assistant. Google\u2019s device is great at Googly things like searching for obscure facts about the War of 1812, but it\u2019s not very good at one of the main things people want from a home computer \u2014 shopping for stuff by voice. Amazon\u2019s Echo is obviously very good at that.\nMike:I guess this is interesting, if only Google knew how to do, um, shopping stuff well. They\u2019ve tooled around with it for years but have failed to really make it a priority.\nFarhad:Enter, Walmart. Customers can now connect their Google and Walmart accounts, letting Walmart learn stuff about your shopping habits from your Google history (yeah, I\u2019m not sure who would do this) and also letting you buy stuff from Walmart by voice. The items will be delivered to you through Google Express, Google\u2019s fast-shipping service.\nFor both companies, this sounds like a fine short-term hedge against Amazon. But they can\u2019t expect this to actually work out in the long run, can they? Amazon has more items and manages the logistics of the whole shopping process. Two companies with different interests working as one seems a bit kludgy to me.\nMike:I imagine if this actually works, the two companies won\u2019t be super interested in staying close partners forever. Aren\u2019t Walmart\u2019s margins thin enough that it makes cutting Google in a bit more difficult? Unless, that is, Google is getting paid with our precious personal shopping data, rather than, you know, actual cash.\nIn any case, I\u2019m curious to see if this actually makes a dent. Amazon is already my default for so much of my online shopping.\nFarhad:Remember the Apple self-driving car? Over the last few years, we\u2019ve heard endless rumors of Apple plowing huge sums into making a car. And then we began to hear rumors of Apple\u2019s project falling apart.\nThis week, our colleague Daisuke Wakabayashi took an in-depth look at the project and found that it was indeed in disarray, with its once huge ambitions now scaled back enormously. Weirdly, this reminds me of your career.\nMike:Hey! I\u2019m comfortable being a B-team tech reporter. It allows me time to pursue my true passion: collecting \u201960s-era Japanese action figures.\nFarhad:But seriously, where Apple once had ambitions to make its own car, now it is working just on the autonomous systems to power other cars \u2014 similar to what Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff, aims to do. Daisuke reported that Apple will first test its tech on its own employees: It\u2019s building a self-driving shuttle to ferry employees between its buildings.\nMike:So Apple is building its own version ofDisney World\u2019s monorail, I guess? How retro.\nBuilding a car is hard. Building a self-driving car is even harder. And building a self-driving car from scratch, in house, when you\u2019re a tech company that has only ever built phones and computers, seems near impossible. But perhaps I\u2019m being too pessimistic.\nFarhad:Finally, there was yet more Uber news.Recode reportedthat the company had moved closer to settling on a new C.E.O., with Jeff Immelt, the former chief of G.E., now getting support from the majority of the Uber board. What do you think \u2014 is Immelt going to be the guy? And if not him, who else?\nMike:I don\u2019t want to go into it too much, so as not to tip my hand. But it says something to me that only Immelt\u2019s name is being leaked. We\u2019ll see what happens.\nFarhad:And then there are Uber\u2019s numbers. It\u2019s been operating without a chief and lots of other top executives for months, but that doesn\u2019t seem to beaffecting its business.\nThe company is private, but it regularly releases a summary of its financial data to investors. Its latest report shows that Uber\u2019s quarterly revenue after paying out drivers rose to $1.75 billion from $1.5 billion last year, and requests for rides have increased 150 percent since last year. This is despite my columntelling people not to ride Uberuntil it gets its house in order.\nHonestly, Mike, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m yelling into a void. But really, why is Uber doing so well despite acting so badly? Do customers really just not care? Is there some danger in the numbers we aren\u2019t seeing?\nMike:It\u2019s hard to act according to all your values in every single facet of your life, so maybe folks rationalize it and pick their battles, which doesn\u2019t include taking a stance on Uber.\nThat, or more likely: People just don\u2019t care. Uber is incredibly convenient and works well if you\u2019ve got the money to spend on it. Why go back to waiting on yellow cabs or fighting your way onto a crowded bus if you don\u2019t have to?\nFarhad:I guess that makes sense. Anyway, have a good vacation! I hope, for our editor\u2019s sake, Uber holds on to all news until you return."

How are things with you? I\u2019m in New York this week, and from what I\u2019ve heard, you are too. But I haven\u2019t seen you around the office, so \u2026 working hard as usual?\nMike:I spent much of Thursday working from the hotel room up the street, mostly because every time I come here I spend most of the time talking to our lovely New York-based colleagues and not getting any actual work done. Plus, I went to like three museums. To, uh, look at tech stuff.\nWhat about you? Are you Mr. Office Dweller now?\nFarhad:Oh, I\u2019m just messing with you. I\u2019ve been to the office a total of three hours this week. Look, if they want me in more, they should make us clock in on one of those punch card machines.\nO.K., before we get to tech news, we have an announcement to make: The Bits Newsletter \u2014 that is, this thing you\u2019re reading \u2014is changing! Instead of a daily roundup of news, Bits subscribers will now get just our weekly chat. It will come in every Friday morning instead of on Saturdays. Congratulations to us!\nMike:I\u2019m already getting a lot of, um, fan mail about the change. Which reminds me; I hope \u201clame jester\u201d and \u201cinane banter\u201d are cool, new slang phrases the kids use to compliment people.\nFarhad:Anyway, let\u2019s get to tech news. Three big stories this week: Apple is becoming a media company. Uber is becoming a basket case. And just about every tech company took up the fight against neo-Nazis.\nMike:That\u2019s a lot to unpack. Can we start with the easy one?\nFarhad:Let\u2019s start with Apple. The tech giant has been inching into the content business recently. It owns \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d (you have to watchthe Adele episode), and of course there\u2019s \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d about which the less said the better.\nMike:I think, as a general rule, I am against TV shows that incorporate puns into the title.\nFarhad:Butas The Wall Street Journal reported this week, Apple has much bigger plans. It is considering investing as much as $1 billion into new content over the next year, letting it make or acquire as many as 10 TV shows.\nAs The Journal noted, Apple is starting way behind Netflix and Amazon, which have huge stables of original movies and TV shows they\u2019ve been producing for some time. Sure, Amazon has \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201d but will it have \u201cPlanet of the Apps 2: Social Media Marketing\u201d?\nMike:How about \u201cPlanet of the Apps 2: The Appening\u201d? Or maybe \u201c2 App 2 Furious\u201d?\nSeriously, though, I hope Apple hires some good content executives from places like Netflix and Amazon. Bring in Ted Sarandos, chief content officer from Netflix, who seems to have a good eye for spotting at least some hit shows. Or someone from high up at HBO. Or heck, just buy Netflix outright! Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?\nAnyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.\nFarhad:O.K., let\u2019s move on to Uber. The last few weeks in the saga of the troubled ride-hailing company have been marked by lawsuits and boardroom intrigue, but I have to admit \u2014 I\u2019m totally lost. Can you bring us up to speed on the most interesting new stuff?\nMike:Where to begin? At the beginning of the week, we broke the news that Uber\u2019s board wasmulling a few competing outside investmentsto cash out existing investors, a process that has yet to be resolved.\nThen, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.\nBut Kalanick isn\u2019t slinking away. Hefiled a response to Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit Thursday evening. The drama is showing no signs of slowing down.\nIn sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.\nFarhad:O.K., finally, let\u2019s talk about neo-Nazis. After the racist protests and car-ramming in Charlottesville, Va., last week, a number of internet companies took action against white supremacist organizations. The domain-name companyGoDaddy kicked off The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist site, which then tried to get a domain from Google \u2014 which also promptly kicked the site to the curb. Then Cloudflare, a company that protects against network attacks, also canceled The Daily Stormer\u2019s account.\nThere were lots of others: Facebook deleted an event page for the Charlottesville rally and even prevented people from sharing a Daily Stormer article. Crowdfunding sites blocked neo-Nazi fund-raising efforts, an Uber driver kicked some white supremacists out of his car, Airbnb blocked people it suspected of renting rooms to hold white supremacist parties, and the dating siteOKCupid deleted one racist\u2019s dating profile.\nSome went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.\nThere was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.\nI understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.\nTo me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.\nWhat do you think?\nMike:I\u2019m fine with Nazis getting banned from these networks. I understand the free speech argument, but it\u2019s hard to support when the rhetoric also includes the elimination of races other than whites. Go look at theVice News video on Charlottesvillefor some perspective.\nLet me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?\nMaybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon. But it\u2019s just peculiar to me to turn to, say, Tim Cook, instead of dialing up your local representative.\nFarhad:Maybe it\u2019s time to get away.\nMike:I have a plan for that. This weekend, I\u2019ll sit back, relax and open some more newsletter fan mail."

        "title": "Spotify\u2019s Ability to Turn a Decent Profit Is Still in Doubt",
        "fulltext": "Spotify\u2019s business model is an unfinished symphony.\nThe digital-streaming service is closer to listing on the New York Stock Exchange now that it has secured licensing deals with all three major musical labels, including Warner Music, which signed up on Thursday. But with the likes of Universal and Sony reportedly budging only slightly on royalties, Spotify\u2019s ability to turn a decent profit is still in doubt.\nThe company, a loss-making Swedish start-up led by Daniel Ek, renegotiated the licensing agreements in the hope of cutting the amount of money it pays in royalties. But if the terms of the Warner deal are anything like those reported for previous agreements, concerns about Spotify\u2019s future profitability will persist.\nThe company has 140 million active users, 60 million of whom are paying subscribers, and made just over 2.9 billion euros in revenue in 2016. But its \u20ac2.5 billion cost of revenue \u2013 mostly payments to labels, publishers and other suppliers \u2013 meant little was left over to cover product development, marketing and administrative costs. The result was an operating loss of \u20ac350 million.\nYoung tech companies often put expansion before profitability. Take Netflix and Uber. But Spotify looks set to stay loss-making until at least the next round of royalty negotiations. Universal and Sony Music have accepted a cut to 52 cents a dollar from 55 cents, The Financial Timesreported. Assume those terms apply across the board, and Spotify would still have made an operating loss of more than \u20ac260 million last year, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.\nTrue, labels may have to compromise further if they want to maintain pricing power in the face of tech behemoths like Apple Music. But a bet on Spotify is a gamble that the company can either substantially raise subscription prices or persuade artists and their labels to take a much smaller slice of the digital-streaming pie. The first will be difficult if Spotify\u2019s cash-rich rival Apple keeps subsidizing its music offering. And there\u2019s slim chance of the second coming true anytime soon if the recent round of royalty negotiations are anything to go by. Investors may decide this is one gig they can miss."

Is there a way to divert those contacts into my personal mailbox so I can just check there instead of having to plow through all my inboxes and possibly get pulled into work drama?\nA.Apple has built a few ways in iOS for finding important messages. If you are using the Mail app that came with the iPhone, one way to isolate mail from specific people is toadd them to the program\u2019s V.I.P. mailbox list. When a message from one of the designated email addresses arrives, it appears in a mailbox labeled \u201cV.I.P.\u201d on your Mailboxes screen, along with your work, personal and other accounts. You then only have to open the V.I.P. mailbox to see the messages you want.\nTo add someone to your list of very important personal correspondents, open the Mail app on your iPhone and select a previous message from one of the people you wish to hear from on your vacation. Tap the sender\u2019s name and on the screen of contact details that appears, scroll down and tap \u201cAdd to V.I.P.\u201d\nIf you have done all that and do not see a V.I.P. mailbox listed in the Mail apps\u2019s list of mailboxes, it may be hidden from view. To find it, tap the Edit button on the upper-right corner of the Mailboxes screen and tap the button next to V.I.P. to make it visible in the list, then tap the Done button.\nYou can also add people to your V.I.P. list by tapping the encircled \u201ci\u201d on the right side of the V.I.P. mailbox line in the Mailboxes list. On the next screen, select \u201cAdd V.I.P.\u2026\u201d and choose an address from your contacts list.\nTo get push notifications that someone on your V.I.P. list has sent a message, tap the V.I.P. Alerts button and choose the style of onscreen alert you wish to see.

        "title": "A Family Memoir Makes the Case That Autism Is Different, Not Less",
        "fulltext": "TO SIRI WITH LOVEA Mother, Her Autistic Son, and the Kindness of MachinesBy Judith Newman228 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.\nIn just the third paragraph of what turns into an uncommonly riotous and moving book, Judith Newman dives headlong into the highly charged debate over whether to replace the term \u201cautistic\u201d with more cautious, politically correct language: \u201ca man with autism, a woman with autism.\u201d\nNewman understands the impulse behind such \u201cperson-first\u201d nomenclature, but she\u2019s not buying it. The phrase \u201cperson with autism,\u201d she writes, \u201csuggests that autism is something bad that one needs distance from. You\u2019d never say \u2018a person with left-handedness\u2019 or \u2018a person with Jewishness.\u2019 Then again, you might say a \u2018person with cancer.\u2019 \u2026 There\u2019s also something about this pseudo-delicacy that is patronizing as hell.\u201d\nWhat follows are 200 pages of powerfully wrought indelicacies about life with Gus, her autistic teenage son, that will make readers squirm and laugh \u2014 yes, out loud. Newman will also make them face questions everyone\u2019s ducking (vasectomies for autistic men?) before sweeping them, finally, into a soul-spilling high tide.\nGus has the good fortune to be born into a family of eccentrics \u2014 a character among characters \u2014 led by Judith, an only child who grew up with pet iguanas, knew dogs better than children, got married at 30 to John, a 60-year-old divorced British opera singer who doesn\u2019t like mess or noise, and eventually settled into a nearby apartment in Manhattan: a two-apartment marriage arrangement. Judith contends that John may be somewhere on the spectrum. John disagrees. Smart money\u2019s with Judith.\nThey produced a set of fraternal twins in Henry and Gus, setting up quickly apparent distinctions between a typically developing, hyper-precocious child and his \u201cdelayed\u201d brother, whose troubling deficits they managed to deny creatively for years. Judith would press concerned specialists \u2014 \u201cwell, at least he\u2019s not autistic, right?\u201d \u2014 which she calls \u201cthe mental health equivalent of \u2018Does my ass look fat in these jeans?\u2019 \u201d After the official diagnosis arrives when the boys are 6, \u201cJohn \u2014 gruff, stalwart, very British \u2014 climbed into bed with Gus that night and sobbed.\u201d That\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with this small memoir: whipsaws of brilliant zingers and heart punches that make it distinctive among the fast-growing library of autism lit. A columnist for the Book Review, Newman is courageous in exposing herself, humorous (if a bit flippant) in rendering pain, and ingenious in enlisting every feature of her family life to show that autistic people, like the rest of the Newman ensemble, are different, not less.\nAutism memoirs are generally written from one of two perspectives,person withorparent of, and Newman\u2019s is among the best of the parenting breed. That\u2019s not only because she is a top-drawer prose stylist with good comic timing. As she removes the zone of privacy from herself and her family, she is edging into the world her son occupies. Those with autism often say whatever is on their mind \u2014 no filter \u2014 and have difficulty lying even when it\u2019s in their self-interest. In this way, Newman the writer becomes autistic, and ends up serving the interest of the reader.\nAn early scene sets the mark, with Henry and Gus \u2014 14 at that point \u2014 at a supermarket meat counter with Newman, observing the butcher as he slices. Gus holds forth excitedly, jumping in rhythm (he hops when he\u2019s happy), about his father\u2019s imminent arrival from London: which flight, what terminal, then a precise rundown of the subway trains and stops from Kennedy Airport to Manhattan, until \u201che\u2019ll arrive at 77 Bleecker in the morning and then he and Mommy will do sex.\u201d\nSuddenly, the butcher \u201cis interested. \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\nThere are alarmed looks from the people waiting in line, and Newman sees in their eyes the way the world sees her and hers: \u201cthe obnoxious teenager, pretending he doesn\u2019t know us; the crazy jumping bean, nattering on about the A train; the frazzled, fanny-pack-sporting mother, now part of an unappetizing visual of two ancients on a booty call.\u201d\nThe reader soon learns the progress this scene represents, the culmination of long years working on language attainment with Gus, who, as Newman points out, is an \u201caverage\u201d autistic kid \u2014 by far the majority, squarely between the poles of \u201cthe eccentric genius who will one day be running NASA!\u201d and \u201cthe person so impaired he is smashing his head against the wall and finger painting with the blood.\u201d\nAverage, but fascinating, as is the world of autism that Newman outlines between the wealth of family moments, racing across the history of autism \u2014 first diagnosed 70-odd years ago, as a crushing but rare disability \u2014 to the confusing present, with one in 68 kids, and one in every 42 boys, on \u201cthe spectrum.\u201d Many have begun to wonder if the malady isn\u2019t as much withus, the so-called neurotypical, as with them, especially as neurological clues emerge that every deficit seems to create an equal and opposite strength: a compensatory ability, like the enhanced memory capacity or visual acuity or pattern-recognition gifts common to autism. Maybe the inability to talk, present in about a quarter of all those on the spectrum, is more akin to Stephen Hawking than to a toddler in an adult body. And it may be \u2014 as in civil rights movements \u2014 that the barrier due to fall is the way we, the wider society, often define difference as a deficit.\nYet Newman is no dogmatist who celebrates every difference as a delight and inalienable right. In some of the book\u2019s hardest-eyed passages, she writes about how much Gus will never do, and shouldn\u2019t, including reproducing: \u201cIt is very hard to say this out loud. Let me try. I do not want Gus to have children.\u201d But does that mean no sex? And is that her choice? Late in the book, as a girl in Gus\u2019s school takes him under her affectionate wing, the reader watches it all through Newman\u2019s trepidation, followed by the dawning recognition that her son is someone \u201cwho may never be able to be responsible for another life, but who is nevertheless capable of deep affection, caring and considering. Sure, those emotions started with machinery and electronics \u2014 trains, buses, iPods, computers \u2014 and, particularly with Siri, a loving friend who never would hurt him.\u201d\nHence, the title \u2013 drawn directly from a New York Times article Newman wrote in 2014, about Gus\u2019s bond with Siri, Apple\u2019s \u201cintelligent personal assistant,\u201d who could endlessly answer his questions, keep her son company and express \u2014 in that flat, sweet Siri voice \u2014 the gift of common courtesy. It went viral and led to this book. Why? Because the autistic boy displayed the dream/nightmare of this era: humans bonding with machines to get what they\u2019re not getting from flesh-and-blood interactions. In this chapter, late in the book, Newman gallops through all the continuing experiments that use technology to lift and unleash the autistic (including my own effort to build augmentative technologies).\nThis is fertile terrain, born of the gradual recognition that technology\u2019s great promise may in fact be to summon, capture and display our most human qualities, both the darkness and the light, to pave avenues of deepened connection with others. Here\u2019s where the autistic, with their search for alternatives to traditional human connection, are actually innovators.\nDoes it dehumanize us if tenderness is tried out first with a machine? While his hyper-aware twin is showing standard bright-future achievements, Gus tentatively feels his way through life. But make no mistake. Gus\u2019s deft fingers \u2014 rendered with unsentimental affection by his mom \u2014 are feeling things others will miss.\nAt one point, Gus says, \u201cGood night, Siri, will you sleep well tonight?\u201d Siri replies: \u201cI don\u2019t need much sleep, but it\u2019s nice of you to ask.\u201d\nNewman\u2019s response could speak for the entire book: \u201cVery nice.\u201d"
