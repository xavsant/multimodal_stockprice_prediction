        "title": "Apple Reports Decline in Sales and Profit Amid iPhone Struggles in China",
        "fulltext": "Difficulties have been piling up for Apple. In recent months, it has been sued by theJustice Department,fined by European regulatorsand challenged bythe resurgence of a Chinese smartphone competitor.\nOn Thursday, the company added to its list of problems, reporting that its business was in a slump.\nApple said sales fell 4percent to $90.8 billion for the three months that ended in March. Revenue from iPhones, iPads and wearables like the Apple Watch declined from the same quarter last year, while sales of software and services rose. Profit fell 2 percent to $23.64 billion, Apple\u2019s first quarterly decline in a year.\nApple\u2019s struggles were most worrisome in China, the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone market, where sales fell 8 percent. The iPhone\u2019s popularity there has waned since Huawei, which the Trump administration restricted from working with U.S. technology firms, introduced a new smartphone with 5G abilities last year. Last quarter, Apple\u2019s share of smartphones sold in China fell 4 percent, according to Counterpoint, a technology research firm.\nShares of Apple rose 6.5 percent because the results slightly exceeded Wall Street predictions for quarterly sales and profit and were better in China than feared. The company said that it would repurchase $110 billion of stock and that its sales were on track to increase in the current quarter.\nThe poor results stood in contrast to the strong performances of other big tech companies. Over the past two weeks, Amazon reported thatits quarterly profits had tripled,Microsoft increased quarterly salesfrom cloud computing by a third and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, announced that itwould pay its first dividend.\nThose companies\u2019 sales have accelerated in part because of their investments in generative artificial intelligence. The technology, which can write essays and software code, is one that Apple hasn\u2019t yet incorporated into its products. Investors hope that will change in June when Apple holds its annual developers\u2019 conference and reveals its newest software.\n\u201cThis is a bellwether stock that is going through a volatile time,\u201d said Scott Acheychek, the chief operating officer at REX Shares, a provider of exchanged-traded funds. \u201cApple needs a win to change this narrative, and if they can get a segment of A.I. across their devices, that could be it. The question is: What is their path forward?\u201d\nDuring a call with analysts, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, sought to reassure investors that Apple believed in the promise of generative A.I. He said the company was making significant investments in the technology and would share news about its developments with customers soon.\n\u201cWe have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services,\u201d Mr. Cook said. He said the company would lean on its custom chips and seek to provide a solution that protected customers\u2019 privacy.\nApple\u2019s business continues to be carried by its success selling customers apps and services. Across its 2.2 billion devices in use around the world, the company has sold more than a billion subscriptions for everything from dating apps like Tinder to its own services like Apple Music. Sales of software and services rose 14 percent to $23.9 billion last quarter, it said.\nBut the App Store, which is one of the biggest pieces of the company\u2019s service business, is being challenged by regulators worldwide. The store is the only way to distribute apps on iPhones, and Apple collects a 30 percent commission on every app sold.\nOn March 4, the European Commissionfined Apple 1.8 billion euros($1.95 billion) for thwarting competition by preventing music streaming rivals from offering users promotions and subscription upgrades. The commission is alsoinvestigating Applefor potential violations of a new competition law that requires the company to allow competing app stores and alternative payment systems.\nNext week, a federal judge will hold a hearing to determine whether Apple is subverting a 2021 court order to allow alternative ways to pay for services in apps. Apple said developers could use other payment systems but would have to pay a 27 percent commission. Epic Games and other companies said the fee violated the court\u2019s ruling.\nAnalysts don\u2019t expect the regulatory challenges to hurt Apple\u2019s business. But they have been a distraction from the company\u2019s efforts to focus customer attention on its devices.\nIn January, Apple beganselling an augmented-reality headset, the Vision Pro. The device, which costs $3,500, was a small contributor to the company\u2019s sales in the period, analysts said. It isn\u2019t expected to be purchased in large quantities for at least four years."

        "title": "Some iPhone Customers Could Get Up to $349 in an Apple Settlement",
        "fulltext": "Some Apple customers who owned an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus and experienced audio issues may be entitled to up to $349 as part of a proposed $35 million settlement on a class-action lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claimed that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus had audio issues related to the \u201caudio IC\u201d chip in those devices, according to asettlement administrator\u2019s website. The settlement received preliminary approval last year.\nApple has denied the allegations of audio problems and has denied any wrongdoing, according to the website. The company did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment about the settlement.\nIn a joint statement, Andrea Gold and Greg Coleman, lawyers for the six original plaintiffs in the case, said they were \u201cproud of the nationwide class action settlement that is pending final approval before the court.\u201d\nCustomers included in the settlement may have received an email or postcard notification about the lawsuit.\nCustomers residing in the United States who owned an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus between Sept. 16, 2016, and Jan. 3, 2023, and who reported covered audio issues to Apple, or paid Apple for repairs or replacements for covered issues, may be eligible for a portion of the settlement.\nCustomers who want to be included in the settlement must submit a form online or have the envelope postmarked by June 3, 2024, according to the administrator. After filing, customers can select how they would like to be paid, whether by electronic check or physical check.\nTo apply for a claim, peoplecan visit the settlement administrator\u2019s websiteordownload a form,complete and print it out and mail it to the address provided on the form.\nThe form requires users to submit contact information, such as a home and email address, and to select a payment option.\nA $35 million settlement fund will be established. Users who paid Apple out of pocket for repairs or replacements for audio issues for their iPhone 7 or 7 Plus could receive a payment of at least $50 and up to $349. Customers who reported audio issues to the company, but did not pay Apple for out of pocket repairs or replacements, will receive payments of up to $125.\nA judge will hold a final approval hearing, which is scheduled for July 18, 2024, according to the administrator\u2019s site. People who qualify would receive their payments electronically or by check.\nThe deadline to submit a claim, object or be excluded from the settlement is June 3, 2024.\nKirsten Noyescontributed research."

        "title": "Apple Will Revamp Siri to Catch Up to Its Chatbot Competitors",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s top software executives decided early last year that Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, needed a brain transplant.\nThe decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI\u2019s new chatbot,ChatGPT. The product\u2019s use ofgenerative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company\u2019s work, who didn\u2019t have permission to speak publicly.\nIntroduced in 2011 asthe original virtual assistantin every iPhone, Siri had been limited for years to individual requests and had never been able to follow a conversation. It often misunderstood questions. ChatGPT, on the other hand, knew that if someone asked for the weather in San Francisco and then said, \u201cWhat about New York?\u201d that user wanted another forecast.\nThe realization thatnew technology had leapfrogged Siriset in motion the tech giant\u2019s most significant reorganization in more than a decade. Determined to catch up in the tech industry\u2019s A.I. race, Apple has made generative A.I. a tent pole project \u2014 the company\u2019s special, internal label that it uses to organize employees around once-in-a-decade initiatives.\nApple is expected to show off its A.I. work at its annual developers conference on June 10 when it releases an improved Siri that is more conversational and versatile, according to three people familiar with the company\u2019s work, who didn\u2019t have permission to speak publicly. Siri\u2019s underlying technology will include a new generative A.I. system that will allow it to chat rather than respond to questions one at a time.\nThe update to Siri is at the forefront of a broader effort to embrace generative A.I. across Apple\u2019s business. The company is also increasing the memory in this year\u2019s iPhones to support its new Siri capabilities. And it has discussedlicensing complementary A.I. modelsthat power chatbots from several companies, including Google, Cohere and OpenAI.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nApple executives worry that new A.I. technology threatens the company\u2019s dominance of the global smartphone market because it has the potential to become the primary operating system, displacing the iPhone\u2019s iOS software, said two people familiar with the thinking of Apple\u2019s leadership, who didn\u2019t have permission to speak publicly. This new technology could also create an ecosystem of A.I. apps, known as agents, that can order Ubers or make calendar appointments, undermining Apple\u2019s App Store, which generates about $24 billion in annual sales.\nApple also fears that if it fails to develop its own A.I. system, the iPhone could become a \u201cdumb brick\u201d compared with other technology. While it is unclear how many people regularly use Siri, the iPhone currently takes 85 percent of global smartphone profits and generates more than $200 billion in sales.\nThat sense of urgency contributed toApple\u2019s decision to cancel its other big bet\u2014 a $10 billion project to develop a self-driving car \u2014 and reassign hundreds of engineers to work on A.I.\nApple has also explored creating servers that are powered by its iPhone and Mac processors, two of these people said. Doing so could help Apple save money and create consistency between the tools used for processes in the cloud and on its devices.\nRather than compete directly with ChatGPT by releasing a chatbot that does things like write poetry, the three people familiar with its work said, Apple has focused on making Siri better at handling tasks that it already does, including setting timers, creating calendar appointments and adding items to a grocery list. It also would be able to summarize text messages.\nApple plans to bill the improved Siri as more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers. The strategy will also save money. OpenAI spends about12 centsfor about 1,000 words that ChatGPT generates because of cloud computing costs.\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\nBut Apple faces risks by relying on a smaller A.I. system housed on iPhones rather than a larger one stored in a data center. Research has found that smaller A.I. systems could be more likely to make errors, known as hallucinations, than larger ones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been the Siri vision to have a conversational interface that understands language and context, but it\u2019s a hard problem,\u201d said Tom Gruber, a co-founder of Siri who worked at Apple until 2018. \u201cNow that the technology has changed, it should be possible to do a much better job of that. So long as it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all effort to answer anything, then they should be able to avoid trouble.\u201d\nApple has several advantages in the A.I. race, including more than two billion devices in use around the world where it can distribute A.I. products. It also has a leading semiconductor team that has been making sophisticated chips capable of powering A.I. tasks like facial recognition.\nBut for the past decade, Apple has struggled to develop a comprehensive A.I. strategy, and Siri has not had major improvements since its introduction. The assistant\u2019s struggles blunted the appeal of the company\u2019s HomePod smart speaker because it couldn\u2019t consistently perform simple tasks like fulfilling a song request.\nThe Siri team has failed to get the kind of attention and resources that went to other groups inside Apple, said John Burkey, who worked on Siri for two years before founding a generative A.I. platform, Brighten.ai. The company\u2019s divisions, such as software and hardware, operate independently of one another and share limited information. But A.I. needs to be threaded through products to succeed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in Apple\u2019s DNA,\u201d Mr. Burkey said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blind spot.\u201d\nApple has also struggled to recruit and retain leading A.I. researchers. Over the years, it has acquired A.I. companies led by leaders in the field, but they all left after a few years.\nThe reasons for their departures vary, but one factor is Apple\u2019s secrecy. The company publishes fewer papers on its A.I. work than Google, Meta and Microsoft, and it doesn\u2019t participate in conferences in the same way that its rivals do.\n\u201cResearch scientists say: \u2018What are my other options? Can I go back into academia? Can I go to a research institute, some place where I can work a bit more in the open?\u2019\u201d said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a leading A.I. researcher, who left Apple in 2020 to return to Carnegie Mellon University.\nIn recent months, Apple has increased the number of A.I. papers it has published. But prominent A.I. researchers have questioned the value of the papers, saying they are more about creating the impression of meaningful work than providing examples of what Apple may bring to market.\nTsu-Jui Fu, an Apple intern and A.I. doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote one ofApple\u2019s recent A.I. papers. He spent last summer developing a system for editing photos with written commands rather than Photoshop tools. He said that Apple supported the project by providing him with the necessary G.P.U.s to train the system, but that he had no interaction with the A.I. team working on Apple products.\nThough he said he had interviewed for full-time jobs at Adobe and Nvidia, he plans to return to Apple after he graduates because he thinks he can make a bigger difference there.\n\u201cA.I. product and research is emerging in Apple, but most companies are very mature,\u201d Mr. Fu said in an interview with The Times. \u201cAt Apple, I can have more room to lead a project instead of just being a member of a team doing something.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to hear from lawyers working with generative A.I., including contract lawyers who have been brought on for assignments related to A.I. We won\u2019t publish your name or any part of your submission without contacting you first.\n"

        "title": "What Will Warren Buffett Bet on Next?",
        "fulltext": "Tens of thousands of investors are flocking to Omaha this weekend, which can mean only one thing: It\u2019s time for Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, dubbed the \u201cWoodstock for capitalists.\u201d\nThe allure had long been the chance to see Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger live, answering attendees\u2019 questions with a time-tested buddy-comedy act. But this year\u2019s event will be the first without Munger, whodied in Novemberat age 99 \u2014 and comes amid growing questions about Berkshire post-Buffett, who\u2019s 93.\nBuffett will have a different crew answering questions alongside him on Saturday.Berkshire\u2019s vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, will be on hand for much of the day. Shareholders most likely will be focused on what Abel, Buffett\u2019s appointed successor as C.E.O. and the head of the conglomerate\u2019s noninsurance operations, has to say.\nIn Buffett\u2019sannual letterto investors, he noted challenges to Berkshire\u2019s biggest businesses, including the BNSF railroad (falling shipment volumes) and its utility business (forest fires). Last month, the company\u2019s enormous real estate brokerage, HomeServices of America, also agreed topay $250 millionto settle lawsuits over inflated home-sales commissions.\nShareholders may want to hear what Jain, as the longtime mastermind behind Berkshire\u2019s vitalreinsurance operations, has to say about the business that makes most of Buffett\u2019s investing possible.\nExpect lots of questions about Berkshire\u2019s signature investments.The company\u2019s stock performance this year has outpaced that of Apple (one of Buffett\u2019s biggest investments; more on that below), Microsoft and Tesla, as well as the S&P 500.\nBut withinterest rates remaining higher for longerand many tech giants\u2019 shares losing steam, shareholders will want to know where Buffett sees future opportunities. That may include the company\u2019s investments in the oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum and five Japanese trading houses,whose stocks have soared.\nAttendees may also want Buffett to explain what may be his most consequential admission in recent years: Berkshire is now so big that it\u2019s unlikely to find any major acquisitions \u2014 the historical source of Buffett\u2019s outsize investment returns \u2014 to spend its $163 billion cash pile on. \u201cAll in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance,\u201d he wrote in this year\u2019s annual letter.\nAnd there may be questions about Buffett\u2019s stock-picking lieutenants.Todd Combs and Ted Weschler have been managing portions of Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio for years. But theirperformance has long laggedbehind that of Buffett himself and the S&P 500, according to the Financial Times, raising questions about Berkshire\u2019s future value proposition.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s investigation into TD Bank reportedly focuses on fentanyl.Investigators found that Chinese drug traffickers and crime groups used the Canadian bank to launder hundreds of millions in illicit drug proceeds,The Wall Street Journal reports. The accusation adds to the scrutiny of the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering practices, which is at the center of other regulatory investigations in the U.S. and Canada.\nPresident Biden makes his first public comments on campus protests.Bidencondemned the violence on Thursdaywhile defending the right to demonstrate peacefully. The president is eager to keep the issue from eroding his support with young voters but he has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans for not speaking out.\nArguments in the Google antitrust case conclude on Friday.The Justice Department says the company competed unfairly in making deals with Apple and other companies to lock in search functionality on smartphones and web browsers. Google counters that it earned its market edge through innovation. The trial is thebiggest challenge yet to Big Tech\u2019s dominance, and the judge\u2019s verdict, expected later this year, could change how Google does business.\nAfter a rocky stretch, Apple is predicting a return to growth in 2024. That, and an unprecedented $110 billion share-buyback promise, have lifted shares by more than 6 percent in premarket trading this morning despiteanother sales declineand big worries about China.\nApple is the latest Big Tech giant to report results in recent weeks \u2014 next up is Nvidia on May 22. Investors are zeroing in on when huge investments, especially in artificial intelligence, will pay off.\nApple\u2019s rally belies a litany of challenges,including a sluggish market for smartphones and wearables, intensifying competition in China, heightened regulatory scrutiny,a lackluster debutfor the Vision Pro headset and questions about its A.I. efforts. (The company is expected to reveal how it will incorporate A.I. into its devices at a developers conference next month.)\nAdd it up, and sales have declined at the king of growth stocks in five of the past six quarters and shares are down nearly 7 percent this year. Abig question on Wall Street: What will Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway do with its $157 billion Apple stake?\nThe big takeaways from Thursday\u2019s earnings report:\nSales fell 4percent on an annualized basis to $90.8 billion last quarter, and profit dipped by 2 percent to $23.6 billion. Both reductions exceeded analysts expectations.\nApple reported $16.4 billion of revenues in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. That\u2019s up compared to the previous quarter, driven by the iPhone. Investors are worried about Apple\u2019s hold on the world\u2019s No. 2 smartphone market, where consumers are shifting to local rivals amid a wider crackdown on foreign-made tech.\nThe company also sought to reassure on generative A.I.Apple isn\u2019t investing the vast sums that rival tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, are spending on the technology. That has helped protect its profit outlook, but it has also left investors unsure about its strategy.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., tried to express confidence that the company would catch up by deploying A.I. across its devices and services. \u201cApple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services\u201d \u2014 including its in-house chips \u2014 will give the company an edge, he told analysts.\nAfter weeks of anticipation, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have made it official: They\u2019ve formally expressed interest inbuying Paramount for about $26 billion.\nThat puts extra pressure on the Paramount board\u2019s special committee that\u2019s evaluating the company\u2019s future. Those directors are already facing a deadline on Friday for exclusive deal talks with Skydance, the studio led by the tech scion David Ellison (and the preferred suitor of Paramount\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone).\nIs the Sony-Apollo bid a game-changer?Sony has deep experience in entertainment, with Apollo providing a big slug of capital. Sony plans to be the majority shareholder, making Paramount a division within its broader film and television empire and putting franchises like \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d under one roof.\nThat said, the $26 billion figure is preliminary: Sony and Apollo haven\u2019t started due diligence, which could affect their ultimate takeover proposal.\nThere are regulatory concerns,including whether the Sony-Apollo bid would be hamstrung by federal restrictions on foreign ownership of broadcast networks like Paramount\u2019s CBS.\nApollo and Sony believe workarounds are available; one could be having Apollo, which has already been approved for network ownership after acquiring Cox Media Group, own the license for CBS. Still, theF.C.C. blockeda takeover bid of the broadcaster Tegna because of Apollo\u2019s role in financing that transaction.\nWhat happens next?Here are some possibilities:\nParamount\u2019s special committee signs a deal with Skydance that includes a low breakup fee and a so-called go-shop provision that lets it negotiate with Sony and Apollo. That would likely give Skydance a chance to match, setting up a bidding war and, if Sony and Apollo won, a mandatory payout to Skydance. (It could also lead to a lower price than what a traditional auction would have fetched, giving already irate shareholders more reason to gripe \u2014 or sue.)\nParamount could let the exclusivity period with Skydance expire at midnight tonight and open its books to Sony and Apollo. That, of course, risks the Sony-Apollo duonotmaking a formal bid \u2014 and Skydance walking away.\n\u2014 What the N.B.A. is set to get from two newbroadcasting agreementswith Disney and Amazon, three times the size of its current deal, according to Bloomberg. The league is also reportedly considering another package with Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast.\nExxon Mobil\u2019s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources is set to close on Friday. The F.T.C. gave its blessing, but the regulator extracted an unusual concession: It barred Scott Sheffield, the shale oil producer\u2019s former C.E.O., from joining Exxon\u2019s board, saying he colluded with OPEC to manipulate oil prices.\nThe accusations could lead to criminal charges and send ashudderthrough the industry as deal making hits record highs.\nThe F.T.C.\u2019s case:The agencysaidthat its merger review found Sheffield\u2019s text messages, public statements and in-person meetings with OPEC officials were evidence he tried to distort the global market for oil prices and to profit from it. \u201cAmerican consumers shouldn\u2019t pay unfair prices at the pump simply to pad a corporate executive\u2019s pocketbook,\u201d said Kyle Mach, the F.T.C.\u2019s deputy competition chief. The F.T.C. reportedly plans torefer Sheffield\u2019s case to the Justice Department.\nPioneer said the F.T.C. doesn\u2019t understand the oil industry.Itdisputed the accusations but said it and Sheffield wouldn\u2019t do anything to stop the Exxon deal going through.\nOthers accused the regulator of overreach.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s New iPad Ad Leaves Its Creative Audience Feeling \u2026 Flat",
        "fulltext": "The trumpet is the first thing to be squished. Then the industrial compressor flattens a row of paint cans, buckles a piano and levels what appears to be a marble bust. In a final act of destruction, it pops the eyes out of a ball-shaped yellow emoji.\nWhen the compressor rises, it reveals Apple\u2019s latest commodity: the updated iPad Pro.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, posted the advertisement, called \u201cCrush,\u201d on Tuesday after the company held an event to announce new tablets. \u201cMeet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we\u2019ve ever created,\u201d Mr. Cook wrote, adding, \u201cJust imagine all the things it\u2019ll be used to create.\u201d\nMeet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we\u2019ve ever created, the most advanced display we\u2019ve ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip. Just imagine all the things it\u2019ll be used to create.pic.twitter.com/6PeGXNoKgG\nFor decades, Apple has been the toast of the creative class. It has won over designers, musicians and film editors with promises that its products would help them \u201cThink Different.\u201d\nBut some creators took a different message from the one-minute iPad ad. Rather than seeing a device that could help them create, as Mr. Cook suggested, they saw a metaphor for how Big Tech has cashed in on their work by crushing or co-opting the artistic tools that humanity has used for centuries.\nThe image was especially unnerving at a time when artists fear that generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry and create movies, might take away their jobs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual in its cruelty,\u201d said Justin Ouellette, a software designer in Portland, Ore., who does animation work and is a longtime Apple product user. \u201cA lot of people see this as a betrayal of its commitment to human creative expression and a tone deafness to the pressures those artists feel at this time.\u201d\nApple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIt was the latest in a series of recent promotional slip-ups by a company that is widely considered to be a marketing juggernaut. Itsmarketing of the Apple Vision Pro, released in January, struggled to help that device break through with many customers. Last year, Apple was criticized for making an awkward sketch that castOctavia Spencer as Mother Earth, lording over a corporate meeting about the company\u2019s effort to become carbon neutral by 2030.\nApple has been regarded as an advertising visionary since the 1980s. Its \u201c1984\u201d Super Bowl commercialto introduce the Macintosh computer is among the most famous commercials ever made. The ad, which was developed by the Chiat/Day agency, showed an actor throwing a sledgehammer through a screen projecting the face of a \u201cBig Brother\u201d figure that was meant to be a metaphor for IBM.\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 after 12 years away, he sought to reclaim its marketing magic. Together he and Lee Clow, the advertising creative behind the \u201c1984\u201d spot, developed the\u201cThink Different\u201dcampaign. It paved the way to the famous \u201cGet a Mac\u201d spots, featuring aMac and PC, and the originaliPhone ad, which showed people in classic films and television shows picking up a phone and saying, \u201cHello.\u201d\nApple\u2019s marketing pitched its products as easy to use. It billed PCs and Android phones as devices for business executives working on spreadsheets, while Macs and iPhones were tools for film editors, photographers and writers.\nBut Apple\u2019s advertising has been uneven over the last dozen years or so. Ityanked a 2012 campaignthat showcased its Apple Store \u201cgeniuses\u201d on planes. Critics dismissed a subsequent spot, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California,\u201d as \u201clame.\u201d\nIn the wake of those hiccups, Mr. Cook shifted oversight of advertising from Phil Schiller, the company\u2019s longtime head of marketing, to Tor Myhren, a former president and chief creative officer at Grey, the ad agency that created the E-Trade baby.\nUnder Mr. Myhren, who joined in 2016, Apple has developed some of its ads with its own creative team and others in collaboration with an outside agency, Media Arts Lab. It has been recognized at the Cannes Lions Awards, the leading event for the ad industry, for a spot on AirPods called \u201cBounce,\u201d which showed a man bounding off the sidewalk as he listened to music. Last year, Apple was named Creative Brand of the Year because of its \u201cR.I.P. Leon\u201d ad, in which a man sent an iPhone message saying a lizard in his care had died, then deleted it when the lizard suddenly rolled over off its back.\nMr. Myhren and Media Arts Lab didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about who was behind the \u201cCrush\u201d spot.\nMichael J. Miraflor, the chief brand officer at Hannah Grey, a venture capital firm, said on X that Apple\u2019s ad had effectively offended and turned off its core customer base, achieving the opposite of what it had done with its \u201c1984\u201d commercial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even that it\u2019s boring or banal,\u201d Mr. Miraflorwrote. \u201cIt makes me feel \u2026 bad? Bummed out?\u201d"

        "title": "U.S. Antitrust Case Against Google Is Just the Start",
        "fulltext": "The U.S. government\u2019s landmark antitrust trial against Google\u2019s search businessis nearing its conclusion. But the parade of major federal cases challenging Big Tech\u2019s power is just getting going.\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission started investigating Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, for monopolistic behavior. The government has since sued all four companies \u2014 Google twice \u2014 in what it says is an effort to rein in their power and promote more competition.\nThe companies have denied the claims and are fighting back.\nClosing arguments wrap up on Friday in Google\u2019s first antitrust suit on allegations that it has a monopoly in internet search.The judge\u2019s ruling, expected in the coming weeks or months, is likely to set precedents for the remaining cases.\nHere\u2019s the latest on the state of the U.S. government v. Big Tech.\nIn September, theF.T.C. and 17 states sued Amazon, accusing it of protecting a monopoly by squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace and favoring its own services. The practices also harmed consumers, the F.T.C. argued, and resulted in some cases of \u201cartificially higher prices\u201d because Amazon prevented those selling goods on its site from offering the same products on other online sites for less.\nA judge in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington set the beginning of the trial for October 2026.\nAmazon has asked the judge to dismiss the case and has argued that it often offers low prices to consumers and doesn\u2019t hurt sellers on its marketplace. The lawsuit shows a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of retail,\u201d the company has argued.\nThe chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan, who isfamous in certain circlesfor a 2017 Yale Law Journal antitrust paper on how to rein in Amazon, has vowed to take on Big Tech monopolies.\nAmazon has described the F.T.C.\u2019s lawsuit as \u201cmisguided\u201d and warned that if agency prevailed in its suit, it would \u201cforce Amazon to engage in practices that actuallyharmconsumers and the many businesses that sell in our store.\u201d\nIn March, theDepartment of Justice sued Apple, accusing the company of using a monopoly in the smartphone market to block competition, inflate prices for consumers and stifle competition. The department joined 15 states and the District of Columbia in its suit after a nearly two-year investigation.\nIn the suit, filed in U.S. District Court of New Jersey, the department said Apple blocked companies from offering applications that competed with Apple products like cloud-based streaming apps, messaging and the digital wallet.\nApple has said that it plans to file a motion to dismiss the case and that its business decisions don\u2019t violate antitrust laws. It has also argued that those decisions make the iPhone a better experience.\n\u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201d\nIn addition to the search lawsuit, the Justice Department filed aseparate suit against Google in January over online advertising. That case is expected to go to trial in September.\nThe department and eight states sued in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying Google acquired rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company\u2019s ad technology.\nLast month, Google asked a federal judge to dismiss the case, arguing that the ad technology market is competitive and that the lawsuit could harm innovation and thousands of small businesses that rely on the online advertising market.\nIn the search lawsuit, if the judge rules against Google, he will need to suggest changes to the company\u2019s business to fix anything determined illegal.\nThe F.T.C. sued Meta in December 2020, accusing the company of creating a monopoly in social media by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The mergers deprived consumers of alternative social media platforms, the F.T.C. argued.\nThe lawsuit has taken more twists and turns that the other Big Tech antitrust cases. It was filed in U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia before the company changed its name to Meta, from Facebook. In 2021, Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint, saying the F.T.C. didn\u2019t adequately define the market that it accused Meta of monopolizing. But he allowed the agency to refile its lawsuit, and it moved forward the next year.\nThe F.T.C. joined 40 states inaccusing Facebook of buyingboth Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago toillegally squash competitionthat could have one day challenged the company\u2019s dominance. The regulators have called for the deals to be unwound.\nMeta has argued that it didn\u2019t acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to kill competition and that it has invested heavily in developing innovations for the apps."

        "title": "\u2018Someone\u2019s Going to End Up Dead\u2019: Settlements Over Fatal Astroworld Concert",
        "fulltext": "A lawyer for Live Nation, the concert company, said in court on Wednesday that settlements had been reached in all but one of the lawsuits over the deaths of 10 people who were fatally crushed during a performance by Travis Scott at the 2021 Astroworld festival in Houston.\nThe disclosure came as lawyers were preparing for the first trial over the deaths. A lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case confirmed that a settlement had been reached with the defendants, including Mr. Scott, Live Nation and Apple, which live-streamed the event.\nThe trial had been expected to present a jury with harrowing testimony about the chaotic conditions at the Nov. 5, 2021, concert and the warnings raised by some of those working there. The victims, including two teenagers and a 9-year-old boy, suffocated in the midst of the heaving crowd while Mr. Scott performed.\nFor more than two years, details have slowly emerged in court filings and police reports, revealing the behind-the-scenes arguments and backstage wrangling that accompanied one of the worst concert disasters in the United States.\nSome of the organizers of the Astroworld festival knew that the space was too small, according to evidence uncovered during the preparations for trial. Mr. Scott kept performing as people were suffocating, it showed, signaling a plan to continue the show until after Drake had performed despite efforts to stop the show earlier. A police investigation pointed to what the plaintiffs identified as a potential reason: a $4.5 million contract with Apple requiring Mr. Scott to finish the show in order to get paid.\nMr. Scott had been expected to attend at least part of the trial.\nThe plaintiffs in the first case were the family and the estate of Madison Dubiski, a 23-year-old from the Houston area who died at the concert. The lawyers in that case argued that the organizers and promoters had created a dangerously unsafe environment while trying to maximize the size of the crowds and their profit.\n\u201cThe parties were able to reach agreement on a confidential settlement,\u201d one of the lawyers, Jason Itkin, said in a statement. \u201cThe parties will cooperate in the future to honor Madison Dubiski\u2019s legacy and promote improvements in concert safety.\u201d\nOnly the family of the 9-year-old boy, Ezra Blount, has yet to settle with all the defendants. A trial in his case could still eventually take place. \u201cThe Blount family is ready for trial,\u201d Scott West, a lawyer for the boy\u2019s family, told the judge overseeing the cases on Wednesday.\nWhile the judge, Kristen Hawkins, has imposed a strict gag order, preventing those involved from commenting, information has come out already in court filings about just how badly things went wrong at the outdoor venue.\n\u201cStage right of main is getting crushed,\u201d a security contractor, Reece Wheeler, texted a security director just before Mr. Scott began performing at 9 p.m., according to a description in one of the plaintiffs\u2019 filings. \u201cThis is bad. Pulled tons over the rail unconscious.\u201d\n\u201cI would pull the plug but that\u2019s just me,\u201d he wrote a minute later. \u201cI know they\u2019ll try to fight through it but I would want it on the record that I didn\u2019t advise this to continue. Someone\u2019s going to end up dead.\u201d\nSeriously injured concertgoers began arriving at the medical tent around 9:15 p.m., according to police reports, among them Ezra Blount.\nThe concert did not end until about 10:13 p.m.\nThe plaintiffs in the Dubiski case had argued that organizers knew they had sold tickets to more people than could safely fit into the venue, provided inadequate security during the event and then failed to stop the show when it was already clear that people were being crushed.\nLawyers for Mr. Scott have said the performer was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the deaths of his fans but was not responsible for the festival design or security. They argued that even if the show had been stopped \u201c10 minutes earlier\u201d it would not have prevented the devastation.\n\u201cNo one disputes that tragedy struck the Astroworld Festival,\u201d Mr. Scott\u2019s lawyers argued in legal motions before the trial. \u201cBut promoting and performing at a concert do not equate to the power to control a crowd or to design a venue safely.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs also sued Apple, arguing that the company\u2019s decision to livestream the event had come late in the process, after tickets had been sold and the projected crowd was already expected to fill the space; the production stage, they said, may have contributed to packing the crowd in even tighter. Though it was outdoors, trees ran along each side of the crowd, narrowing the space where people could see.\nHouston Police Department investigators also concluded that Mr. Scott\u2019s $4.5 million contract with Apple appeared to require him to finish the show.\nThe dozens of defendants have denied responsibility for what happened. But they have not all been aligned. For example, lawyers representing the venue operator, ASM Global, successfully fought an effort by Mr. Scott and his companies to remove themselves from the case, pointing to evidence that one of Mr. Scott\u2019s associates had kept the show going despite police efforts to stop it.\nMr. Scott and his company, the lawyers wrote, \u201cshould not have moved for summary judgment, they should have issued a public apology to the City of Houston.\u201d (The court denied Mr. Scott\u2019s request for summary judgment last month.)\nA grand jury last year declined to criminally indict Mr. Scott or others involved in putting on the festival. After that, the Houston police released 1,200 pages of reports, including summaries of interviews, from their investigation into the Astroworld disaster.\nSeveral people involved in the festival told the police that they had raised alarms about the potential for dangerous overcrowding before the show started. They also warned of the crushing conditions as the music got underway just after 9 p.m., particularly in the one section of the crowd where all 10 deaths occurred.\nAs Mr. Scott began his first song, \u201cEscape Plan,\u201d people were already pleading for help and collapsing in piles of bodies, according to the police reports and court documents.\nIn their filings, the plaintiffs argued that the organizers had used flawed crowd-capacity calculations and created an unusual festival layout that made it likely that tens of thousands of people would move at one time to the single stage created just for Mr. Scott\u2019s nighttime performance.\n\u201cI feel like there is no way we are going to fit 50k in front of that stage,\u201d Seyth Boardman, who was in charge of risk and security, wrote in a text message to the festival\u2019s operations director, Emily Ockenden, a few days before the show. \u201cEspecially with all of the trees!\u201d\nThe next day, Ms. Ockenden texted with an employee who was drawing up the capacity plan for the site. \u201cI need to show 40k at stage 2 and 50 at stage 1,\u201d where Mr. Scott would perform, she wrote.\nBut the space was not large enough, the employee replied. \u201cStage 1 you got 40,105,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cEven if I cheat it on stage right, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get another 10k.\u201d\nAt the start of the show, there were roughly 55,000 people in attendance, according to the police, some of whom had broken into the event without tickets.\nThe concert was allowed to go on for well over an hour as people struggled to breathe and some collapsed \u2014 and long after police officers on the scene had begun calling for the show to stop.\nAccording to a timeline in the police report, a police commander told Mr. Boardman, the risk and security director, to stop the show around 9:40 p.m. Mr. Boardman passed that message along to those who were communicating with Mr. Scott.\n\u201cThere are more crush victims than I have ever seen in my 25-year career,\u201d Mr. Boardman told a man identified in filings as a close associate of Mr. Scott at about 9:51 p.m., according to a police transcript of a recording made during the concert. He said the show had to end by 10 o\u2019clock but appeared to get pushback.\n\u201cI want him to end the show,\u201d Mr. Boardman said. \u201cI want him to end the show.\u201d\nLater, a different message circulated backstage, according to filings and police records: Mr. Scott would continue performing until after an appearance onstage by the rapper Drake.\nWho made the decisions to go on with the show, despite the risks known in advance, and then to continue the music as people were dying appeared likely to be key elements of the trial before the settlement was reached."

        "fulltext": "Apple doesn\u2019t make mistakes often and seldom apologizes, but on Thursday, its head of advertising said the company had erred in making a new iPad commercial that showed an industrial compressor flattening tools for art, music and creativity.\n\u201cCreativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it\u2019s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\u201d said Tor Myhren, the company\u2019s vice president of marketing communications, in astatementprovided to the publication AdAge. \u201cOur goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we\u2019re sorry.\u201d\nMr. Myhren said Apple would no longer run the ad on TV.\nThe company had faced a barrage of criticism from designers, actors and artists who saw the ad as a metaphor for how Big Tech has cashed in on their work by crushing or co-opting the artistic tools that humanity has used for centuries.\nThey found the crushing of a trumpet, piano, paints and a sculpture particularly unnerving at a time when artists fear that generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry and create movies, might take away their jobs.\nApple had intended the ad to send the opposite message, that its ultrathin iPad Pro could power an array of creative activities that previously required individual tools.\nApple introduced the iPad commercial, called \u201cCrush,\u201d on Tuesday after revealing an update to its tablet lineup. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a post on X that it was a thin, advanced and powerful device. \u201cJust imagine all the things it\u2019ll be used to create,\u201d he wrote.\nThe reversal joins a series of rare apologies by Apple over the past 15 years, including one in 2012 fromMr. Cookfor the shortcomings of its new Maps app. The app\u2019s problems included incorrect directions and the wrong location for certain landmarks.\nMr. Cook\u2019s apology for Maps broke with Apple\u2019s previous policy of resisting pressure after mistakes. In 2010, Apple was criticized for releasing an iPhone that would drop calls. Steve Jobs, the company\u2019s co-founder and Mr. Cook\u2019s predecessor, went on the offensive,saying at a news conferencethat the problem was not the phone but the way some customers were holding it.\nThe company, which had spent decades encouraging filmmakers, musicians and artists to use its devices, heard an immediate outcry from that group."

        "fulltext": "ByMax EddyMay 15, 2024\nIf you\u2019re spending precious seconds scrolling through your camera roll in search of a photo from last year, it\u2019s time to organize your images.\nHere are my tips for starting that daunting (but doable) process. \u2192\nBefore you start,get your photos all in one place.If you have photos scattered across various apps, centralize the images.\nThe most straightforward way to do that is to use the photo-storage software that\u2019s already on your phone. If you have an iPhone, that\u2019s Apple Photos. For Android users, it\u2019s Google Photos. The tools in these free apps will be more than enough for most people to manage a photo collection.\nClear out the clutter, starting with old screenshots and receipts.Type in \u201cscreenshot\u201d in the search bar in Apple Photos or Google Photos to quickly pull up the screenshots in your collection.\nThen get rid of duplicate images. If you\u2019re working on an iPhone, tapAlbumsin the bottom menu. Then, scroll toUtilitiesand selectDuplicates. You can combine those photos by tappingMerge.\nEven after you\u2019ve cleaned out the junk, it can be hard to find specific images in your library.\nHelp yourself find things by favoriting \u2014 and unfavoriting \u2014 regularly. Did you take a picture of where you parked your car to help you remember it? Favorite it, and then delete the picture when you\u2019re done.\nYou can hide sensitive photos, too. In Apple Photos, tap and hold on an image, and selectHidefrom the menu. Your Hidden folder is at the bottom of yourAlbumstab and requires authentication before viewing.\nIn Google Photos tapping and holding on an image move it to the Archive or the Locked folder. Photos in the Archive are not in the main gallery but appear in search results, while those in your Locked folder need authentication to view and don\u2019t show up in search.\nRead the full articleandsign up for Wirecutter\u2019s newsletter."
