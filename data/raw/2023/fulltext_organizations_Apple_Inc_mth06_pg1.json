        "title": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018Whatever It Takes\u2019 Strategy Boosts Oil Prices",
        "fulltext": "Crude oil and natural gas rebounded this morning after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, announceda million-barrel-per-day production cutat this weekend\u2019s OPEC Plus summit in an effort to boost sagging energy prices.\nBut the negotiations that led to the move \u2014 and a more complicated adjustment of the cartel\u2019s production quotas \u2014 hint at the tensions between many of the world\u2019s top crude-producing countries, with global oil prices in the balance.\nSaudi Arabia is largely going it alone.The United Arab Emirates saw its production quota grow, after years of lobbying for such a move, while other countries had their targets reduced. The complex arrangement followed a flurry of negotiations throughout one of thetensest OPEC meetingsin recent memory, with African producers unhappy with the U.A.E.\u2019s efforts to increase its production quotas.\nThe arrangement that emerged on Sunday was a Riyadh-led compromise, which Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi oil minister,called \u201ca Saudi lollipop\u201dthat is meant to sweeten prices for oil traders. Though the cut is meant only for July, it could be extended.\nHovering over the talks was the steep drop in oil prices: Brent crude, the global benchmark, is around $77 a barrel, after trading around $120 a year ago.\nSaudi Arabia is in \u201cwhatever it takes mode,\u201dHelima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Global Markets, wrote in an investor note this morning. That the country is \u201cwilling to shoulder it alone adds to the credibility of the cut and signals real barrels coming off the market.\u201d\nAnalysts calculate that Brent needs to stay above $80 in order for Saudi Arabia to keep its budget balanced and to finance the ambitious infrastructure program backed by the country\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\nMeanwhile, Saudi officials have been fixated on squeezing short sellers betting against oil prices, with Abdulaziz warning such investors last month to \u201cwatch out.\u201d\nThe long-term impact of the move isn\u2019t clear.Goldman Sachs analysts say it couldboost the price of Brentby $1 to $6 per barrel. But such a rise is unlikely to hurt consumers or turn gasoline costs into a potent political threat in the U.S., where prices at the pump are down 25 percent over the past year.\nAt the same time, Russia \u2014 despite having its quotas cut \u2014 is widely thought to be pumping huge amounts of cheap crude to bolster its war-battered economy. And the prospect of slowing global economic growth, particularly in China, is keeping a lid on oil prices.\nThe market braces for a glut of Treasuries.Now that President Biden has signed the debt ceiling deal into law, the Treasury is expected to begin selling more than $1 trillion in new securities. Some warn the auctionscould jack up short-term borrowing costsand drain liquidity from parts of the market, with Bank of America predicting that the effect would be equivalent to a 0.25-percent interest rate increase by the Fed.\nApple is poised to join the metaverse.The iPhone maker is expected to unveil itsvirtual reality headset, a set of high-tech goggles that blend the virtual and physical worlds, at its developers\u2019 conference on Monday. The company could also reportedly reveal an app designed to help usersbetter monitor their mental and physical healthas part of a push into the sector.\nHollywood directors and studios agree to a tentative labor deal.TheDirectors Guild of Americasaid it had made gains in negotiating an agreement on wages, streaming residuals and protecting workers against the rise of artificial intelligence. The pact averts the possibility of three major unions striking simultaneously.\nBig banks will reportedly be required to boost capital.Regulators are close to adoptingnew rules thatcould raise the limit by about 20 percentin a bid to bolster the banking system after a number of midsize lenders failed this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The biggest increases are expected to focus on large lenders with substantial trading businesses.\nAllstate quits California because of worsening climate and building costs.The nation\u2019s fourth biggest insurer hasstopped offering new home, condominium and commercial policiesin the state because of the risk of wildfires and the high cost of repairing homes. The decision follows a similar move by State Farm last week.\nHeated rhetoric from U.S. and Chinese officialsover the weekend was a marked contrast from the cordiality that greeted JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon \u2014 and effusiveness, in the case of Elon Musk \u2014 at business events the two held in China during the week.\nThe dissonance illustrates the challenge of companies trying to work with, and in, the world\u2019s second-largest economy as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing.\nU.S. and Chinese military leaders talked tough:\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed that American warships would continue patrols near China, even as he called for more dialogue.\nChina\u2019s defense minister, Li Shangfu, declined to meet with Austin at a security conference in Singapore they both attended. And senior officials in the People\u2019s Liberation Army criticized public U.S. support for Taiwan and what they called American surveillance of the Chinese coast.\nThere\u2019s an apparent divide between Washington and corporate America\u2019s approaches.Both Mr. Dimon and Mr. Musk, whomet with senior government officialsduring their trips, played down the idea ofdecoupling the U.S. and Chinese economies. And their companies continue to do big business there: Tesla counts China asone of its biggest markets, while JPMorgan isdeepening its tiesto the country.\nThe era of corporate America influencing U.S. policy on China may be over.In decades past, Wall Street leaders like John Thornton and Hank Paulson of Goldman Sachs and Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone were reportedly able to temper efforts by Washington to take a tough line on China.\nThe Trump and Biden administrations have appeared to favor harder-hitting approaches, including sanctions. China has responded in kind, imposing its own trade restrictions and carrying out raids on consulting firms\u2019 offices that have startled international business.\nWashington has sought to lower the temperature in recent weeks.President Biden sent the C.I.A. director,Bill Burns, on a secret trip to China for talks. And, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo held meetings with her Chinese counterparts in Washington. But corporate chiefs seem wary of prospects for any easing of tension in the near term: Mr. Dimon conceded that the situation is \u201cfar more complex now\u201d and foresaw less trade between the two countries.\nAs CNN continues to be roiled by internal tension \u2014 including some stoked by a lengthy new profile of its chief,Chris Licht\u2014 the network\u2019s former leader, Jeff Zucker, isplotting his next moves, The Times\u2019s Ben Mullin reports. (While he keeps an eye on his former stomping grounds, of course.)\nMr. Zucker is now a media investor with $1 billion to spend.He leads RedBird IMI, which is backed by the private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners and International Media Investments, a fund with ties to Abu Dhabi\u2019s government.\nMr. Zucker is now one of at least three prospective suitors for a majority stake in Air Mail, the media company founded by the former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, and has had discussions to invest in the online publishers Puck and Semafor. He has also held talks in recent months with Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.\nHe has told confidants that he\u2019s interested in building what is essentially a digital equivalent to Cond\u00e9 Nast, with a stable of publications catering to different audiences.\nWhat about CNN?In Mr. Zucker\u2019s nine years as the network\u2019s president, he reshaped the outlet and claimed credit for its successes. Since his ouster last year, he has regularly and harshly criticized Mr. Licht, and he has told associates that he would be interested in buying CNN should it come up for sale. (Mullins also reports that while CNN\u2019s president, Mr. Zucker held preliminary talks with Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019s Emerson Collective about a potential spinout of the network from its then-parent, AT&T.)\nBut Mr. Zucker says he\u2019s not interested in acquiring CNN now, given what he says is damage from cost-cutting imposed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the network\u2019s current owner. It\u2019s also unclear whether Warner Bros. Discovery would even want to sell: While divesting CNN could help clear the path for the conglomerate to sell itself to a buyer like Comcast, the regulatory outlook for big-ticket M.&A. is murky at best. And selling CNN in the near term \u2014 DealBook hears the price tag could be $8 billion \u2014 might risk a rock-bottom price.\n\u2014 The amount Twitter generated in advertising revenue over a five-week stretch beginning April 1, a decline of 59 percent over the same period last year,according to an internal presentationviewed by The Times. Reviving the company\u2019s ad business will be one of the big challenges for Linda Yaccarino, who starts on Monday as Twitter\u2019s C.E.O.\nIt will be a relatively sedate week for data and earnings.

        "title": "Why I Can\u2019t Bet Against Apple\u2019s Mixed-Reality Prowess",
        "fulltext": "I\u2019ll confess that when Apple introduced itsmixed-reality Vision Pro headsets on Monday, one of my first thoughts was: Man, that thing looks weird.\nI wasn\u2019t alone. On social media, the reaction to the Vision Pro was less than kind. Skeptics mocked the device\u2019s snowboard-goggle-like appearance, its steep price tag ($3,500) and Apple\u2019s lofty pitch about the \u201cspatial computing\u201d era its arrival heralded. There were comparisons to the robot WALL-E, and Twitter memes about people watching pornography in virtual reality.\nI get it. I\u2019ve been a virtual reality skeptic for years, and I have long wonderedwhy the technology hasn\u2019t gone mainstream, even as headset quality has improved. I was always dubious about Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pitch for the metaverse, which had \u201cpersonal conquest\u201d vibes more so than \u201cactual market demand\u201d vibes. And if you had asked me before Monday\u2019s announcement whether I thought Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset signified the beginning of a huge, earthshaking platform shift, on the order of the original iPhone\u2019s arrival, I would have said no.\nBut after seeing Apple demonstrate the Vision Pro on Monday \u2014 and reading thegenerallypositivereviewsfrom folks who have tested it \u2014 I now think itcouldbe a big deal, and possibly even the first hint of a revolutionary new computing platform.\nThere are plenty of reasons the Vision Pro could flop. It could be too expensive, too ugly, too isolating. Persuading developers to build good, useful smartphone apps is easier than persuading them to build apps for a device you have to strap to your head, for an audience that has never really materialized at a meaningful scale. And Apple could discover what Meta has found so far with its forays into productivity-based V.R. apps \u2014 that there just aren\u2019t a ton of people in the world who are interested in reading their emails in V.R.\nBut I can\u2019t dismiss the possibility that despite its limitations \u2014 such as the need to tote around a connected battery pack \u2014 the Vision Pro could be a hit.\nIs it expensive? Yes. But so arelots of first-generation gadgets, and the \u201cPro\u201d in the name suggests that a less expensive, more consumer-oriented model may be on the way.\nIs it fun and impressive to use? Early testers seem to think so, although they haven\u2019t had much time with it, and they\u2019re a fairly excitable group. The real test will come when the devices are shipped to users (early next year, according to Apple) and people start working them into their daily routines.\nPart of my open-mindedness to the Vision Pro, I admit, is due to a kind of tech columnist PTSD. In 2013, before the first Apple Watch was released,I wrote a columnconfidently declaring that smartwatches were a dumb idea. I mocked their looks, dismissed them as expensive toys and boldly proclaimed that Apple would be crazy to invest heavily in a product category that I couldn\u2019t imagine resonating beyond young, moneyed Silicon Valley nerds. (Apple is now the No. 1 watch brand in the world, and it sells an estimated 40 million watches every year. I wear one, as do many of my friends and relatives.)\nObviously, my Apple Watch prediction was extremely, comically wrong, for a few reasons.\nFirst, I underestimated Apple\u2019s ability to expand a market, turning a niche product category into a mainstream one. In 2013, there were other smartwatches on the market, and none of them had been huge hits, so I came to the conclusion that the Apple Watch wouldn\u2019t be a huge hit, either. I looked at the bulky, ugly aesthetics of existing smartwatches and concluded that the kinds of people who were willing to wear them on their wrists every day \u2014 nerds like me \u2014 weren\u2019t a big enough market to matter.\nBut I neglected to remember that Apple isApple, and that it has repeatedly demonstrated that it can, through sheer force of will, turn a niche product for nerds into a thing that everyone wants.\nThat\u2019s a testament to the company\u2019s famous product and marketing prowess. And it\u2019s part of why I\u2019m reluctant to dismiss the Vision Pro\u2019s chances.\nSure, there are good virtual and mixed-reality headsets out there, and evensome decent appsfor them. But those headsets aren\u2019t made by Apple, and they haven\u2019t been seamlessly integrated into the entire Apple ecosystem the way that Vision Pro will be. Having all of your iPhone contacts, iMessages and iOS settings integrated into a mixed-reality headset from the moment you turn it on could mean the difference between a device you actually use every day, and a novelty toy you shove into a closet after a few weeks.\nAnother error I made with the Apple Watch back in 2013 was that I forgot that human behavior is not fixed, and that our ideas of what is considered fashionable and socially acceptable change all the time in response to new technologies.\nBack then, part of what I was reacting to was a social norm. At the time, it might have been considered rude to glance at your watch during a meeting, or while having dinner with your family. But a decade later, that action no longer registers (to me, at least) as inappropriate, because so many people now have Apple Watches that many people have developed new norms around it.\nNow, we assume that people who check their watches at dinner are probably trying to avoid pulling out their phones, which would be ruder and more disruptive. In other words, mass adoption killed the taboo.\nThe same thing could happen with mixed-reality headsets. Sure, you might feel self-conscious putting on a Vision Pro today. But a few years from now, if a third of your co-workers are joining Zoom calls with their headsets, and you see people watching V.R. movies on every flight you take, it might not feel so dumb.\nApple has a knack for entering a product category at just the right time. The iPhone wasn\u2019t the first smartphone in 2007, or even the first touch-screen smartphone. The iPad wasn\u2019t the first tablet. But in both cases, the company brought excitement and sex appeal to products that hadn\u2019t previously had it. Apple let other companies make some of the expensive mistakes, and it focused on making a great product.\nThe same thing could happen with Apple and the Vision Pro. Meta, Magic Leap and other companies have plowed billions of dollars into basic research and development for virtual and mixed reality headsets, learning from the failures of earlier devices like Google Glass. They\u2019ve improved many of the device components, and the actual headsets are now more attractive. But they haven\u2019t had a huge commercial hit.\nThat may be because virtual and augmented reality are fundamentally bad ideas, and the market for these devices may be destined to remain small. But it could be that the market just needed Apple to arrive. A few years from now, if you\u2019re reading this on your Vision Pro, or in an Apple device attached directly to your corneas, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you."

        "fulltext": "\u201cI will not live in the pod,\u201d runs a mantra on right-wing Twitter. \u201cI will not eat the bugs.\u201d It\u2019s an anathema against the various corporate and governmental forces that supposedly want us all to abandon private property, red meat and other American freedoms in favor of a more sustainable future munching millipedes and living in tiny modular habitats, all under the benevolent eye of Greta Thunberg and the World Economic Forum.\nThe pod/bug refusal, to my mind, rather overstates the power of degrowthers and one-world panjandrums: You can findenthusiasm for bug dietsand you\u2019ll-own-nothing-and-be-happymantrasin certain environmentalist and Euro-socialist circles, but it\u2019s usually more of a mood or a set of conference talking points than an operational agenda.\nBut there\u2019s one genuinely powerful force seeking a more podlike, nutshell-bounded human future. It\u2019s the technicians of Silicon Valley, backed by billions in digital-age ambition, who\u2019ll seemingly stop at nothing until human beings live inside their goggles.\nThe latest example of this ambition is the Apple Vision Pro, launched with much fanfare andsleek and creepy advertisingthis week, which promises an immersive visual experience inside a $3,499 headset. It\u2019s in direct competition with Facebook turned Meta\u2019s long-runningattemptsto make its headset-mediated metaverse happen. And both projects are successors to Google Glass, which was supposed to be the next big digital thing a decade agobut dieda slow death amid lackluster sales and public derision against the \u201cglasshole\u201d look.\nThat derision was good, it was necessary, it was humanist and hopeful and essential. And our health as a society and species depends on sustaining it, no matter how sleek the goggles get.\nThere are two possible futures for the virtual reality headset. In one, it remains an expensive, niche product used in specialized ways by hard-core gamers, remote workers looking for an edge and digital engineers and artists seeking absolute immersion in their work. In the other, the headset gradually displaces the smartphone as a normal means of interacting with virtual reality in public and semipublic settings: Subways are crowded with headset-wearers, spouses sit with his-and-hers headsets on the couch at night, nursing home common rooms are filled with seniors lost in V.R.-mediated memories, teenagers hang out headsetted in basements or (more likely) just \u201chang out\u201d virtually from the safety of their own bedrooms, showing up as avatars inside one another\u2019s goggles.\nObviously, Apple, Meta and Google are all invested in the second future. The big money in Silicon Valley comes from controlling crucial platforms and getting other companies to pay for the privilege of having their programs or apps allowed inside, and if enough people migrate to the metaverse then the winner of the headset wars will be the king of infinite money as well as infinite virtual space. So the clear goal of this competition is a future where the Vision Pro or the next Meta headset or some other competitor locks down an iPhone-level market, not just a boutique clientele.\nThat\u2019s presumably why Apple designed its headsetto show users\u2019 eyesto people around them \u2014 so that you can imagine yourself to be still engaging socially while you\u2019re goggling. It\u2019s why Mark Zuckerberg, inresponseto the Apple launch, told Meta employees that he wanted their headsets to stay cheaper and their users to be \u201cactive and doing things\u201d while goggling, not just sitting on a couch. The rival firms clearly want people to integrate their headsets into everyday existence, the way we\u2019ve already integrated our laptops, tablets and phones.\nUnfortunately, that rational commercial goal is in deep tension with the flourishing of the human race. Back when Google Glass debuted,one could already foreseewhere the augmented or virtual reality experience would take humanity \u2014 toward deepened isolation, depressive solipsism, masturbatory anomie. Now we have much more evidence that the less immersive virtual reality created by smartphones and social media is toxic in large doses \u2014to children and adolescents especially, but to the rest of us to some degree as well.\nOf course, you can construct a case whereactuallythe more immersive world of headset life will be healthier than the half-real world of screens and swipes and posting. Or you can take a Singularitarian stance and argue that all future human progress will take place in virtual universes, so let\u2019s start the leap right now. The digital revolution hasn\u2019t failed to deliver the promised utopia, you can say; the revolution just hasn\u2019t been completed.\nHere, just slip on these goggles \u2026\nAgainst these blandishments, the best defense is still the social contempt that greeted Google Glass, mixed perhaps with some of the fatigue with face coverings that eventually turned all but the most committed Covidians against masking.Thou shalt not hide the human faceisn\u2019t an absolute command, but it should be a general expectation, and the scenes in the Vision Pro introduction video where the laughing dad watches his kids play through his goggles to better film them for a rewind performance later should never lose their antisocial and dystopian vibes.\nThis is not a rejection of technological progress. It\u2019s a rejection of the social regress and dehumanization that comes when we let technology master us instead of the other way around.\nNo matter how we respond to them, the headsets will not go away, and a general social stigma against their use as everyday devices will not stand in the way of them benefiting certain people in certain circumstances.\nSo let those benefits be discovered by the few. But for the many, facing the disappearance of the human face into a goggled imaginarium, it\u2019s important to nurture the feelings that have kept the headset market limited so far, and to appreciate the warning that they\u2019re giving us.\nSome internet-age technologies offer glamour at first and only reveal their dark side over time. But this wolf comes as a wolf.\nJosef Adalian and Lane Brownon TV\u2019s streaming debacle.\nHelen Shawon the mysteriesof a Tennessee Williams interviewer.\nPhilippe Lemoineon finding Ukraine\u2019s 38th parallel.\nJohn Psmithon the allureof medieval Chinese civil wars.\nLeah Libresco SargeantchampionsRian Johnson\u2019s \u201cPoker Face.\u201d\nTom Johnson on childhoodin the Tudor era.\n\u201cThe fear of job loss due variously to mechanization, automation, computerization or A.I. has been a recurring panic for hundreds of years, since the original onset of machinery such as the mechanical loom. Even though every new major technology has led to more jobs at higher wages throughout history, each wave of this panic is accompanied by claims that \u2018this time is different\u2019 \u2014thisis the time it will finally happen,thisis the technology that will finally deliver the hammer blow to human labor. And yet, it never happens.\n[\u2026]\n\u201cBut this time is different, you\u2019re thinking.This time, with A.I., we have the technology that can replace ALL human labor.\n\u201cBut \u2026 think of what it would mean for literally all existing human labor to be replaced by machines.\n\u201cIt would mean a takeoff rate of economic productivity growth that would be absolutely stratospheric, far beyond any historical precedent. Prices of existing goods and services would drop across the board to virtually zero. Consumer welfare would skyrocket. Consumer spending power would skyrocket. New demand in the economy would explode. Entrepreneurs would create dizzying arrays of new industries, products and services, and employ as many peopleandA.I. as they could as fast as possible to meet all the new demand.\n\u201cSuppose A.I. once again replacesthatlabor? The cycle would repeat, driving consumer welfare, economic growth, and job and wage growth even higher.

        "fulltext": "For the second time in two months, Donald Trump will surrender to the authorities to face legal charges, dropping another bomb into the 2024 presidential race. Within minutes, he was fund-raising on the back of the news.\nThe indictment hasn\u2019t yet been unsealed, but some details are known.The former president and front-runner for the Republican nominationfaces seven criminal chargesthat he mishandled classified documents from his time in the White House and obstructed the government\u2019s efforts to reclaim them. He is expected to turn himself in to the authorities on Tuesday.\nMr. Trump himself broke the news last night, a sign his inner circle had beenbracing for the indictmentfor weeks.\nOn his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called the charges \u201celection interference at the highest level,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m an innocent man.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s legal troubles keep piling up.But this indictment holds greater \u201clegal gravity and political peril,\u201dwrites The Times\u2019s Peter Baker. It\u2019s not just a first in American history for a former president, but also involves the nation\u2019s secrets.\nHere\u2019s a recap of the other legal matters he faces:\nA federal grand jury last monthorderedMr. Trump to pay $5 million to the journalist E. Jean Carroll in a civil case that he sexually abused and then defamed her; Carroll\u2019s legal team has sued Mr. Trump again over subsequent comments he made about her.\nIn April, the New York authorities charged Mr. Trump with falsifying business documents in connection with hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\nMr. Trump is also under investigation in Georgia for possible election tampering in the state; a decision isexpected later this summer.\nMr. Trump\u2019s Republican challengers came to his defense.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, his nearest rival in the polls, accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to take on a political rival. And Vivek Ramaswamy, the anti-woke financier, said he wouldpardon Mr. Trump if elected president.\nMr. Trump gained in the polls the last time he was charged.It is unclear if the public will be so supportive this time. AYahoo-YouGov pollshowed nearly two-thirds of Americans view the charges of removing classified documents and obstructing the investigation as a serious criminal matter; a similar percentage feel that he should not serve as president if convicted.\nSo far, big-money conservative donors have stayed mum on the latest charges. Manyhave desertedMr. Trump after backing him in previous election cycles.\nThe wildfire haze is moving on from the Northeast.Cities including New York and Philadelphia have seenair conditions improve, though the noxious smoke is spreading south and west; the F.A.A. has lifted ground stops at LaGuardia and Newark airports. But scientists confirmed that theEl Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenonhas started, portending hotter temperatures through next year.\nChina suffers from alackof inflation.New monthly data shows thatproducer prices fell 4.6 percentin May, the sharpest year-on-year drop in seven years, while consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent. Though a contrast from Western countries grappling with rapid inflation, the trend suggests China\u2019s faltering economy may soonsuffer from deflation.\nThe White House reportedly braces for the death of its student loan forgiveness program.Biden administration officials are privately worrying that the Supreme Court maystrike down its proposal,which would eliminate up to $20,000 in education debt per person for millions of Americans, according to The Wall Street Journal. The White House is preparing less legally risky alternatives to help borrowers.\nG.M. electric vehicles will gain access to Tesla\u2019s charging network.The move, which follows a similar announcement by Ford, willvastly expand charger accessibilityfor G.M. But some in the industry fear that wider adoption of Tesla\u2019s plugs, which are now likely to become the industry standard, will give Elon Musk\u2019s company even greater power over the E.V. market.\nInvestors shrugged off lousy labor market data and a new round of inflation warnings to push the S&P 500 into bull market territory on Thursday. But that enthusiasm seems to be waning on Friday morning as stock futures suggest markets will open lower.\nThe bear market lasted 248 trading days, thelongest such run since 1948. Since its October low, the S&P 500 has gained 20.04 percent, just enough to tip into a bull market. The benchmark index is still roughly 10 percent away from a record high; some market observers say, therefore, that it\u2019spremature to call this a true bull market.\nInvestor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has underpinned this rally. According to Deutsche Bank analysts, the FANG+ Index \u2014 a collection of big cap tech stocks, many of which are expanding into A.I. \u2014 is up nearly 80 percent since ChatGPT debuted in November.\nNow to the bad news \u2026A growing number of economists believe that next week\u2019s Consumer Price Index report will show an uptick in core inflation. That could pressure the Fed to raise interest rates further \u2014 if not next week, in July.\nAnd there are signs of economic weakness. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 261,000 new jobless claims,the highest number since October 2021.\nExpect a prolonged period of economic uncertainty.That wasthe messagefrom Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister and president of the E.C.B., in a speech on Thursday at M.I.T.\nThe economist, who once famously vowed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, has a bearish view of the future. He warned that industrialized economies face a \u201cvolatile cocktail\u201d of persistent inflation, high budget deficits, high interest rates and low potential growth as central banks grapple with a climate crisis, the reshoring of supply chains and the impact of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nRegulators and crypto executives are making their cases in the court of public opinion after the S.E.C. sued Binance and Coinbase, two of the sector\u2019s biggest exchanges, this week in an intensifying crackdown on the industry.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this story before,\u201dthe S.E.C. chairmanGary Genslersaid on Thursday at a fintech conference, likening widespread noncompliance in crypto to the era of \u201chucksters\u201d and fraud a century ago. He rejected claims that digital asset businesses cannot comply with the existing rules or do not realize that they apply: \u201cWhen crypto asset market participants go on Twitter or TV and say they lacked \u2018fair notice\u2019 that their conduct could be illegal, don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nCoinbase\u2019s boss says that new regulations are needed.Its C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, addressed the event on Wednesday, saying the rules are opaque and need to be updated. The S.E.C. case is certainly a drag on his company: Moody\u2019s, the ratings agency,downgraded Coinbaseon Thursday to negative from stable because of the charges.\nBinance is regrouping.The company\u2019s American division said on Thursday that it wouldno longer allow customers to trade in U.S. dollars, after banks stopped working with it. At the same time, the S.E.C. says it is trying to find \u201calternative means\u201d to serve legal papers to Binance andChangpeng Zhao, the company\u2019s C.E.O., telling a federal court that it was difficult to determine where he was.\nWho\u2019s judging?The S.E.C.\u2019s case against Coinbase in New York was assigned to District Judge Jennifer Rearden. Hernomination last year angered some Democratic lawmakersbecause she represented Chevron as a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. She\u2019s also handling the government\u2019s appeal of thesale of the failed crypto broker Voyagerto Binance\u2019s U.S. arm and put the deal on hold in March.\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court for D.C. is presiding over the Binance case, and is best known for overseeing the criminal proceedings against two Mr. Trump advisers, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Next week, she will hold a hearing on an S.E.C. request to freeze Binance\u2019s assets.\n\u2014Steven Schwartz, a lawyer who has practiced in New York for 30 years. He told a federal judge that he regrets using the chatbot to write a legal brief that was found to be filled with fake judicial opinions and legal citations.\nApple unveiled its first headset for augmented/virtual/mixed reality this week, but none of those words appears in a nine-minute video on its website about the $3,500 Vision Pro goggles.

        "title": "Apple Debuts Its Next Big Product, a Virtual Reality Headset",
        "fulltext": "Apple lived up to months of expectations on Monday when it introduced new high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. The $3,500 device, called the Vision Pro, will offer \u201caugmented reality\u201d and introduce \u201cspatial computing,\u201d Apple said.\nBut conspicuously absent from the company\u2019s carefully choreographed announcement were the words \u201cvirtual reality,\u201d underscoring the challenges the tech giant is likely to face in marketing the device to a mass audience.\nInterest in virtual reality picked up briefly after the idea of the metaverse \u2014 an immersive online world popularized by science fiction \u2014 was introduced to mainstream audiences during the pandemic. But the concept lost steam as people returned to their prepandemic lives, investors pivoted to artificial intelligence and it became clear how much technological innovation would be required to achieve such a futuristic vision.\nPast virtual reality offerings, including Google Glass, Magic Leap, Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens and Meta\u2019s Quest Pro, have been either commercial failures or only modest successes. And companies have so far failed to demonstrate what is indispensable about virtual reality.\nAnalysts do not anticipate the Vision Pro, which will be available early next year, to have significant mainstream appeal \u2014 at least at first. The $3,500 price could dissuade many consumers.\nCarolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies, said she did not think the headset \u201cis going to be for mass-market consumers.\u201d Instead, she said, \u201cit will be for early adopters \u2014 where Apple most often starts \u2014 and developers.\u201d\nIf the device lacks broad appeal, it could still be a useful trial run for Apple, which could eventually create a virtual reality product aimed at a wider group of consumers, like a lightweight pair of glasses.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Apple has super-huge expectations,\u201d said Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Research. \u201cThey know this is an evolution that\u2019s going to take some time.\u201d\nApple could also vault to the forefront of the XR market \u2014 a term for extended reality, similar to virtual reality, Mr. Fieldhack said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be seen as the best, best in class,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be extraordinary improvements in the display quality, resolution, refresh rates, probably the lightness, feel \u2014 all the things that are the hiccups of XR to date, a lot of them are going to be addressed.\u201d\nThe likely challenges that the Vision Pro will face on the market did not squelch the enthusiasm of thousands of attendees of Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference Monday. At the company\u2019s spaceship-shaped headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., they cheered and whooped as Apple executives discussed the device\u2019s features.\nIn a mostly prerecorded presentation that lasted more than two hours and touched on an array of other products, Apple repeatedly said using the new VR goggles felt like \u201cmagic.\u201d\n\u201cThere are certain products that shift the way we look at technology and the role it plays in our lives,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary product.\u201d\nThe headset, which looks like a pair of ski goggles, will have a three-dimensional interface in which users can view their surroundings and virtual reality at the same time, or toggle between the two to emphasize one mode or block it out entirely. It will feature the same kinds of applications, like FaceTime and Safari, as other Apple devices, with screens hovering in the air in front of users\u2019 faces and growing larger or smaller at will. A wire attached to the headset plugs into a battery pack, providing two hours of battery life.\nThe company said people could unlock the device by scanning their eyes. Customers will use their eyes, voice and fingers to move displays and open apps, without any additional hardware. Apple said the Vision Pro would be a useful tool for work and entertainment, with a powerful sound and visual system akin to a personalized movie theater.\nSome have speculated that the Vision Pro could build off Apple\u2019s growing content portfolio and feature exclusive content, like movies, games or television shows. In a brief appearance, Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, did not promise anything other than making Disney+ available on the Vision Pro when it launches.\nApple also announced a series of other updates and new products, like a 15-inch MacBook Air laptop and improved computer chips for its desktop computers. The company introduced updated operating systems for its computers, AirPods, watches and iPhones, with features like a Journal app, FaceTime video messages and a standby mode with a larger clock on a phone\u2019s home screen.\nLargely absent from the event were mentions of artificial intelligence. Apple debuted improvements to its Siri voice command system \u2014 like the ability for it to recognize family pets in clusters of photos \u2014 as well as a better autocorrect texting function and live transcriptions of voice mail.\nBut unlike other big tech companies, Apple avoided an in-depth discussion of what A.I. will mean to the company."

        "title": "Why Is Apple Getting \u2018Spatial\u2019?",
        "fulltext": "Shop Talk\nBySarah KesslerJune 23, 2023\nThis month, Apple unveiled its first headset for what most people would call augmented reality, virtual reality or, if you prefer, mixed reality. But none of those words are uttered in the nine-minute video about the device on Apple\u2019s website.\nLet me explain \u2192\nInstead, it refers to\u201cspatial computing,\u201d a \u201cspatial operating system,\u201d \u201cspatial experiences\u201d and \u201cspatial audio.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a reason Apple has eschewed the established terminology in favor of more obscure phrasing.\nAnd it\u2019s not because its device is doing something drastically different from headsets like Meta\u2019s Quest Pro or Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens, according to Marcus Collins, an advertising executive and the author of \u201cFor the Culture.\u201d\nWhen it comes to spatial computing, Collins said,\u201cno one knows what that is \u2014 and that provides Apple the opportunity to define it.\u201d\nCollins used an NFT as an example: If someone tells you about \u201ca digitized receipt of membership,\u201d he said, you might ask follow-up questions like: What is that? How does it work?\nBut if someone says, \u201cI\u2019m launching an NFT,\u201d you might refer to what you already know about nonfungible tokens and be more likely to say, \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m good.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Apple has strategically renamed a category. Before the App Store, for instance, people didn\u2019t talk about apps; they talked about \u201csoftware programs.\u201d\nNor is it the only tech giant to employ the strategy.In 2013, Facebook used \u201cgraph search\u201d to describe its version of, well, search. (It didn\u2019t become widely accepted.)\nJim Prosser, a communications consultant who has led teams at Twitter, SoFi and Google, said the intended audience for \u201cspatial computing\u201d might be investors and the news media more than consumers.\n\u201cThey are pitching a product to people,\u201d he said.\u201cFor tech press, industry analysts and investors, they\u2019re pitching a concept.\u201d\nV.R. and A.R. have some baggage, including decades of sci-fi connotations and products by other companies that have not sold well.\nSo are we heading into the era of \u201cspatial computing\u201d? As with all new buzzwords, that\u2019s not ultimately up to corporate marketing arms. It\u2019s up to people who might use it.\n\u201cWe decide what is acceptable, what\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThat\u2019s how culture works.\u201d\nShop Talkexplores idioms of the business world.
