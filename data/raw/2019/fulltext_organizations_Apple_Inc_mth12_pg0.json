        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At a hearing this summer about the rising power of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, Representative David Cicilline zeroed in on Amazon. Unhappy with a response from one of the company\u2019s top lawyers, he delivered a biting retort.\n\u201cI may remind you, sir: You are under oath,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said.\nTech companies are under various antitrust investigations, including by the Justice Department, theFederal Trade Commissionand state attorneys general. Those inquiries could lead to lawsuits against the companies to enforce existing laws.\nBut Mr. Cicilline has a more ambitious goal \u2014 one that may be the greater threat, in the long run, to Big Tech\u2019s practices and profits. He\u2019s trying to build evidence, and a bipartisan consensus, for changing the laws themselves.\nWhen his party took control of the House this year, Mr. Cicilline, a five-term Rhode Island Democrat, becamechairman of the subcommitteethat oversees antitrust law. In June, he opened an investigation into possible anticompetitive practices by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.\nUnder his direction, the panel has held hearings and collected thousands of documents from the companies. The lawmakers have requested countless more records, including emails among top executives.\nHe has made clear to the companies that he is not messing around. When he found theJuly testimony of industry witnessesincomplete, Mr. Cicilline sent the companies follow-up questions. His list: 181 questions for Google, 45 for Facebook, 158 for Amazon and 43 for Apple.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only group,\u201d the 58-year-old lawmaker said in a recent interview, \u201cthat has the ability to actually propose the solution.\u201d\nAntitrust experts say this is the most serious congressional inquiry into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades. Among the people at Mr. Cicilline\u2019s side are Slade Bond, the subcommittee\u2019s top lawyer, and Lina Khan, a young antitrust scholar whose writingmakes the case for curbing Big Tech\u2019s market power.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long game being played here \u2014 interrogate, educate and prepare for antitrust reform,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\nMr. Cicilline seems an unlikely inquisitor of Big Tech. He is a criminal defense lawyer turned politician \u2014 in the Rhode Island General Assembly, as mayor of Providence and then in Congress. He has no track record in antitrust.\nBut people familiar with Mr. Cicilline are not really surprised by his recent turn. Darrell West has closely followed Mr. Cicilline\u2019s career since the early 1980s, when Mr. West was a young assistant professor of political science at Brown University and Mr. Cicilline was his student.\nThe political scientist\u2019s report card on Mr. Cicilline: intelligent and hardworking with grade-A political instincts.\nHis sure sense of political timing was notably evident when Mr. Cicilline ran to unseat Vincent A. Cianci Jr., the longtime Providence mayor known as Buddy. Mr. Cicilline announced his candidacy before Mr. Cianci was indicted on racketeering charges, Mr. West recalled. Mr. Cicilline was elected to the first of his two terms as mayor in 2002, while Mr. Cianci went to federal prison.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been impressed by how canny he is at sizing up the moment,\u201d said Mr. West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that now again.\u201d\nAfter the 2016 election, with Donald J. Trump in the White House and Republicans in the majority in the House, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, urged Mr. Cicilline to become the ranking minority member on the antitrust subcommittee. Mr. Cicilline said he was reluctant at first. Antitrust had been dormant in Congress for years.\nBut as they talked, Mr. Cicilline became convinced that the stagnant incomes of middle-class workers and the growing wealth gap in America were at least partly related to an increasing concentration of economic power. He decided to take on the assignment.\nOver the next two years, one antitrust topic kept coming up: the market clout of the tech giants. Until then, most of Mr. Cicilline\u2019s experience with tech had been as a consumer. He drives a Tesla, writes his own tweets, and sometimes buys books and movies on Amazon.\n\u201cThe more I learned, the more alarming it became,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said.\nHis panel plans to complete its investigation and publish its findings and recommendations early next year. The prospect for legislative action someday hinges on several unknowns. The most significant include what the subcommittee finds, the 2020 election results and the strength of public support for curbing the tech giants.\nThere is no realistic chance that antitrust legislation will be taken up next year, in the heat of a presidential election campaign. But the House investigation does point to a renewed congressional interest in the economic and social impact of concentrated market power and wealth, after years of neglect.\nIn the past, congressional inquiries laid the foundation for antitrust reform. Investigations led bySenator Philip A. Hart, a Michigan Democrat, in the 1960s and 1970s paved the way for antitrust actions in industries from telephones to breakfast cereals, and for new legislation that strengthened oversight of corporate mergers. They also led to new powers for the Justice Department.\n\u201cThat was a major contribution to antitrust enforcement, and today\u2019s House investigation could be an important step in the same direction,\u201d said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the F.T.C.\nThe congressional antitrust revival is not just a preoccupation of Democrats like Mr. Cicilline. Republicans also say it is time for scrutiny of the tech companies.\nIn September, when the House teamsent lengthy information requeststo the chief executives of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, the letters bore the signatures of four congressmen: Mr. Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on Judiciary; Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on the antitrust subcommittee; and Mr. Cicilline.\nAt the hearings, the comments and questions from the Republican and Democrats have shown divisions. The Republicans emphasize that being big is not being bad and that success should not be punished. The Democrats speak of competitors stifled and consumers exploited.\nThey do share concerns. \u201cThese are some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, and it\u2019s important for us to understand the dynamics of this new industry,\u201d Mr. Collins said in an interview.\nSpecifically, he said, the tech giants should be restrained from buying up nascent competitors.\nIn their investigations of Facebook, the F.T.C. and the states are examining that issue. Did the social network buy Instagram, the photo-sharing service, and WhatsApp, the messaging service, as steps in a strategy to squelch emerging rivals?\nLimiting the freedom of large tech companies to acquire upstart competitors, legal experts say, would require modifying the antitrust laws.\nIn the House hearings, the topic of \u201cpredatory acquisitions\u201d has come up repeatedly. Another idea discussed by some expert witnesses at the House hearings is the creation of a new regulator empowered to respond more quickly to allegations of anticompetitive behavior.\nAntitrust traditionalists regard both proposals with skepticism. The changes would be a shift from the current enforcement model, in which courts rule on individual cases. Instead, government officials would need to predict the path of innovation, said Maureen Ohlhausen, a former F.T.C. commissioner who testified at one of the hearings led by Mr. Cicilline.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what markets are good at, not government,\u201d said Ms. Ohlhausen, a partner at Baker Botts, echoing the view of the tech companies and free-market adherents.\nMr. Nadler, Mr. Cicilline\u2019s boss as head of the Judiciary Committee, was reluctant to say where the inquiry would lead. He called the investigation \u201cthe beginning of a long process.\u201d\nNot even Mr. Cicilline is sure where it will go.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly easy to identify the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cCrafting the solutions is much more difficult.\u201d\nBut he is glad that he agreed to Mr. Nadler\u2019s recommendation.\n\u201cIt turned out, of course, to be a really good decision,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said."

        "title": "It Seemed Like a Popular Chat App. It\u2019s Secretly a Spy Tool.",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It is billed as an easy and secure way to chat by video or text message with friends and family, even in a country that has restricted popular messaging services like WhatsApp and Skype.\nBut the service, ToTok, is actually a spying tool, according to American officials familiar with a classified intelligence assessment and a New York Times investigation into the app and its developers. It is used by the government of theUnited Arab Emiratesto try to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those who install it on their phones.\nToTok, introduced only months ago, was downloaded millions of times from the Apple and Google app stores by users throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. While the majority of its users are in the Emirates, ToTok surged to become one of the most downloaded social apps in the United States last week, according to app rankings and App Annie, a research firm.\nToTok amounts to the latest escalation in a digital arms race among wealthy authoritarian governments, interviews with current and former American foreign officials and a forensic investigation showed. The governments are pursuing more effective and convenient methods to spy on foreign adversaries, criminal and terrorist networks, journalists and critics \u2014 efforts that have ensnared people all over the world in their surveillance nets.\nPersian Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Qatar previouslyturned to private firms\u2014 including Israeli and American contractors \u2014 to hack rivals and, increasingly, their own citizens. The development of ToTok, experts said, showed that the governments can cut out the intermediary to spy directly on their targets, who voluntarily, if unwittingly, hand over their information.\nA technical analysis and interviews with computer security experts showed that the firm behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is most likely a front company affiliated with DarkMatter, an Abu Dhabi-based cyberintelligence and hacking firm where Emirati intelligence officials, former National Security Agency employees and former Israeli military intelligence operatives work. DarkMatteris under F.B.I. investigation, according to former employees and law enforcement officials, for possible cybercrimes. The American intelligence assessment and the technical analysis also linked ToTok to Pax AI, an Abu Dhabi-based data mining firm that appears to be tied to DarkMatter.\nPax AI\u2019s headquarters operate from the same Abu Dhabi building as the Emirates\u2019 signals intelligence agency, which until recently was where DarkMatter was based.\nThe U.A.E. is one of America\u2019s closest allies in the Middle East, seen by the Trump administration as a bulwark against Iran and a close counterterrorism partner. Its ruling family promotes the country as an example of a modern, moderate Arab nation, but it has also been at the forefront of using surveillance technology to crack down on internal dissent \u2014 including hacking Western journalists,emptying the banking accountsof critics, and holding human rights activists inprolonged solitary confinement over Facebook posts.\nThe government blocks specific functions of apps like WhatsApp and Skype, a reality that has made ToTok particularly appealing in the country. Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant,recently promotedToTok in advertisements.\nSpokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Emirati government declined to comment. Calls to a phone number for Breej Holding rang unanswered, and Pax employees did not respond to emails and messages. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said that \u201cwhile the F.B.I. does not comment on specific apps, we always want to make users aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that these mechanisms can pose.\u201d\nWhen The Times initially contacted Apple and Google representatives with questions about ToTok\u2019s connection to the Emirati government, they said they would investigate. On Thursday, Google removed the app from its Play store after determining ToTok violated unspecified policies. Apple removed ToTok from its App Store on Friday and was still researching the app, a spokesman said. ToTok users who already downloaded the app will still be able to use it until they remove it from their phones.\nIt was unclear when American intelligence services first determined that ToTok was a tool of Emirati intelligence, but one person familiar with the assessment said that American officials have warned some allies about its dangers. It is not clear whether American officials have confronted their counterparts in the Emirati government about the app. One digital security expert in the Middle East, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss powerful hacking tools, said that senior Emirati officials told him that ToTok was indeed an app developed to track its users in the Emirates and beyond.\nToTok appears to have been relatively easy to develop, according to a forensic analysis performed for The Times by Patrick Wardle, a former National Security Agency hacker who works as a private security researcher. It appears to be a copy of a Chinese messaging app offering free video calls, YeeCall, slightly customized for English and Arabic audiences.\nToTok is a cleverly designed tool for mass surveillance, according to the technical analysis and interviews, in that it functions much like the myriad other Apple and Android apps that track users\u2019 location and contacts.\nOn the surface, ToTok tracks users\u2019 location by offering an accurate weather forecast. It hunts for new contacts any time a user opens the app, under the pretense that it is helping connect with their friends, much like how Instagram flags Facebook friends. It has access to users\u2019 microphones, cameras, calendar and other phone data. Even its name is an apparent play on the popular Chinese app TikTok.\nThough billed as \u201cfast and secure,\u201d ToTok makes no claim of end-to-end encryption, like WhatsApp, Signal or Skype. The only hint that the app discloses user data is buried in the privacy policy: \u201cWe may share your personal data with group companies.\u201d\nSo instead of paying hackers to gain access to a target\u2019s phone \u2014 the going rate is up to $2.5 million for a hacking tool that can remotely access Android phones, according torecent price lists\u2014 ToTok gave the Emirati government a way to persuade millions of users to hand over their most personal information for free.\n\u201cThere is a beauty in this approach,\u201d said Mr. Wardle, now a security researcher at Jamf, a software company. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hack people to spy on them if you can get people to willingly download this app to their phone. By uploading contacts, video chats, location, what more intelligence do you need?\u201d\nIn an intelligence-gathering operation, Mr. Wardle said, ToTok would be Phase 1. Much like the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk metadata collection program \u2014 whichwas quietly shut down this year\u2014 ToTok allows intelligence analysts toanalyze users\u2019 calls and contacts in search of patterns, though its collection is far more invasive. It is unclear whether ToTok allows the Emiratis to record video or audio calls of its users.\nEach day, billions of people freely forgo privacy for the convenience of using apps on their phones.The Privacy Projectby the Times\u2019s Opinion section published an investigation last week revealing how app makers and third partiestrack the minute-by-minute movementsof mobile phone users.\nPrivate companies collected that data for targeted marketing. In ToTok\u2019s case \u2014 according to current and former officials and digital crumbs the developers left behind \u2014 much of the information is funneled to intelligence analysts working on behalf of the Emirati state.\nIn recent months, semiofficial state publications began promoting ToTok as the free app long sought by Emiratis. This month, users of a messaging service in the Emirates requiring paid subscriptions, Botim,received an alerttelling users to switch to ToTok \u2014 which it called a \u201cfree, fast and secure\u201d messaging app. Accompanying the message was a link to install it.\nThe marketing seems to have paid off.\nIn reviews, Emiratis expressed gratitude to ToTok\u2019s developers for finally bringing them a free messaging app. \u201cBlessings! Your app is the best App so far that has enable me and my family to stay connected!!!\u201d one wrote. \u201cKudos,\u201d another wrote. \u201cFinally, an app that works in the UAE!\u201d\nToTok\u2019s popularity extended beyond the Emirates. According to recent Google Play rankings, it was among the top 50 free apps in Saudi Arabia, Britain, India, Sweden and other countries. Some analysts said it was particularly popular in the Middle East because \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 it was unaffiliated with a large, powerful nation.\nThough the app is a tool for the Emirati government, the exact relationship between the firms behind it is murky. Pax employees are made up of European, Asian and Emirati data scientists, and the company is run by Andrew Jackson, an Irish data scientist who previously worked at Palantir, a Silicon Valley firm that works with the Pentagon and American spy agencies.\nIts affiliate company, DarkMatter, is in effect an arm of the Emirati government. Its operations have included hacking government ministries in Iran, Qatar and Turkey; executives of FIFA, the world soccer organization; journalists and dissidents.\nLast month, the Emirati government announced thatDarkMatter would combine with two dozen other companiesto create a defense conglomerate focused on repelling cyberattacks.\nThe F.B.I. is investigating American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes, according to people familiar with the investigation. The inquiry intensified after former National Security Agency hackers working for the company grew concerned about its activities and contacted the bureau. Reutersfirst reportedthe program they worked on, Project Raven.\nAt Pax, data scientists openly brag about their work on LinkedIn. One who listed his title as \u201cdata science team lead\u201d said he had created a \u201cmessage intelligence platform\u201d that reads billions of messages to answer four questions: \u201cwho you are, what you do, how do you think, and what is your relationship with others.\u201d\n\u201cWith the answers to these four questions, we know everything about one person,\u201d wrote the data scientist, Jingyan Wang.\nOther Pax employees describe their experience creating tools that can search government data sets for faces from billions of video feeds and pinpoint Arabic dialects from transcribed video messages.\nNone mention an affiliation with ToTok.\nMark Mazzetti reported from Washington, Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco and Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv. Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon."

        "title": "Why the Impact of the Trump Taxes Remains Partly Hidden",
        "fulltext": "Armed with legions of lobbyists, companies have beenpushing hard \u2014and successfully \u2014 to weaken new federal taxes that take aim at overseas tax havens.\nMany of them have managed to avoid publicly disclosing how much they owe under the new taxes. Without such figures, it becomes virtually impossible for outsiders to work out how much companies are saving from the watered down tax rules.\nIn theory, this opacity should not exist. United States securities regulations have long required public companies to disclose even relatively minor tax expenses. Over the past year, this requirement has led to a small number of companies revealing the effect of the new taxes on overseas income.\nYet many others \u2014 including some longtime users of tax havens \u2014 appear to have found ways around disclosing how the overseas taxes will affect them.\nPresident Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law did not just cut taxes for companies. It also introduced new provisions aimed at discouraging the practice of routing income through countries with ultralow taxes.\nOne of those was a tax on \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d known as GILTI, which acts as a minimum tax on certain profits that companies earn abroad. GILTI was expected to hit corporations that appeared to be paying almost no tax on their overseas income.\nIn 2016, for example, Facebook\u2019s foreign taxes were only 3 percent of its foreign profits. By taxing income that flows through offshore havens, the GILTI initiative was supposed to bring in tens of billions of dollars for the United States Treasury and to partially offset the revenue lost from the 2017 law\u2019s deep tax cuts.\nUnited States securities laws require publicly traded companies to provide detailed explanations of their taxes in their annual reports. Specifically, companies must reveal any individual tax expenses (or benefits) that exceed 5 percent of what is known as their statutory income tax expense.\nSay a company had $100 in income. At today\u2019s 21 percent corporate federal income tax rate, its federal income tax expense would be $21. Under the disclosure rule, that company would have to divulge any particular tax expenses that exceeded $1.05 (5 percent of $21).\nFor companies that were big users of tax havens before the passage of the 2017 law, the GILTI tax was expected to be a significant new expense \u2014 and one that would presumably have to be individually disclosed. A small number of companies, including Netflix and Bristol Myers, the pharmaceutical giant, did so in their 2018 annual reports.\nBut many of the companies that were most likely to face a large bill from the new tax \u2014 like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 have not disclosed how much the GILTI tax took out of their earnings.\nThe lack of disclosure may be masking the financial impact of how the Trump administration is writing rules governing how the 2017 tax package is enacted. Under pressure from corporate lobbyists, the Treasury Department has allowed multinational companies to partly or completely avoid taxes on certain overseas income.\nTax experts told The New York Times that the impact of those weakened rules, while hard to measure precisely, is likely to exceed $100 billion.\nThe companies\u2019 silence about what they actually are paying under the GILTI makes it hard to quantify the true costs of the Treasury\u2019s rules.\nIt\u2019s possible that some companies did not reveal how much the GILTI tax was costing them because, after accounting for tax credits and other factors, the amount fell below the 5 percent threshold. Microsoft said that was the case with its GILTI tax in its 2019 fiscal year.\nBut other companies appear to have bundled GILTI together with other tax expenses and benefits in a way that makes the cost invisible. Facebook, for example, quantifies \u201cthe effect of non-U. S. operations\u201d on its overall tax liability. And Apple provides a number for its taxes on \u201cearnings of foreign subsidiaries.\u201d\nThe cost of the GILTI tax is most likely lumped into those categories, tax experts said. Over the years, they say, corporate auditors \u2014 who have to review and sign off on companies\u2019 financial disclosures \u2014 have adopted a loose reading of the tax-disclosure rule, enabling companies to combine items that are not directly related.\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Apple said in an emailed statement, \u201cSince 2008, Apple\u2019s corporate taxes have totaled over $100 billion. We pay all that we owe according to tax laws wherever we operate.\u201d"

        "title": "The Watch Is Smart, but It Can\u2019t Replace Your Doctor",
        "fulltext": "The Apple Watchhas been quite successfulas a smart watch. The company would also like it to succeed as a medical device. The recentlypublished resultsof the Apple Heart Study in the New England Journal of Medicine show there\u2019s still a long way to go.\nAn estimated six million people in the United States \u2014 nearly 2 percent \u2014 haveatrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that brings increased risk of events like clots, heart attacks and strokes.It\u2019s thought thatabout 700,000of people with the condition don\u2019t know they have it.\nA selling point of the watch is a sensor that canmonitor a wearer\u2019s pulseand potentially detect atrial fibrillation.\nTo test the device\u2019s ability to aid diagnosis, a group of researchers enrolled almost 420,000 Apple Watch wearers in a study. (Some of the researchers were Apple employees, and Apple sponsored the research.)Participants were monitored for about four months. Over that time, 2,161 of the study participants were notified of an irregular pulse, representing just over 0.5 percent of the sample.\nThose peoplewere offered telemedicine visitsand, if their symptoms were mild, were offered electrocardiogram patches to wear for up to a week to help confirm a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Participants mailed the patches back and, if the results indicated an emergency, were contacted immediately and instructed to receive care. If the results were positive for atrial fibrillation but did not require immediate medical attention, the participants were offered a second telemedicine visit and instructed to see their regular physician.\nBut only 450 of the 2,161 people who were notified about having an irregular pulse returned their sensor patches for evaluation. This means that among those who signed up for the study, wore the watch and got a health alert, almost 80 percent ignored it.\nOf the 450 participants who returned patches, atrial fibrillation was confirmed in 34 percent, or 153 people. Those 153 are about 0.04 percent of the 420,000 participants.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the Apple device failed. It probably led some participants to be diagnosed sooner than they might have. How many, and how much of a difference this made in their health, though, is debatable.\nManynews outlets reportingon the study mentioned atopline result: a \u201cpositive predictive value\u201d of 84 percent. That statistic refers to the chance that someone actually has the condition if he or she gets a positive test result.\nBut this result wasn\u2019t calculated from any of the numbers above. It specifically refers to the subset of patients who had an irregular pulse notification while wearing their confirmatory patch. That\u2019s a very small minority of participants. Of the 86 who got a notification while wearing a patch, 72 had confirmed evidence of atrial fibrillation. (Dividing 72 by 86 yields 0.84, which is how you get a positive predictive value of 84 percent.)\nPositive predictive values, although useful when talking to patients, are not always a good measure of a test\u2019s effectiveness. When you test a device on a group where everyone has a disease, for instance, all positive results are correct.\nOther test characteristics like sensitivity (if you have a disease, how likely the test is to be positive) and specificity (if you don\u2019t have a disease, how likely the test is to be negative) are more effective in evaluating the overall quality of a test. This study, unfortunately, was not designed to determine those characteristics.\nOther methods to screen and diagnose people with atrial fibrillation are available. Asystematic reviewof mobile health devices for atrial fibrillation found 22 studies between 2014 and 2019 that reported on many of them. Some had sensitivities and specificities pretty close to the ideal of 100. None are close to as large as this study, though.\nEven blood pressure monitors, ubiquitous in physician\u2019s offices, can screen for atrial fibrillation. Asystematic review of themfound that they had sensitivities greater than 85 percent and specificities greater than 90 percent.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. Experts aren\u2019t even sure if screening is a good idea to begin with.\nAfter all, if we felt strongly enough about detecting asymptomatic people who might have atrial fibrillation, we could screen everyone with electrocardiograms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Forcehas considered doing thisamong adults 65 and older, who are at higher risk for stroke. The group found that theevidence was insufficientto recommend doing so, because it\u2019s not clear that this level of screening is better than current care. Just taking a pulse as part of a checkup is a pretty good screen all by itself.\nThere is also a concern that electrocardiogram screening could turn up a lot of false positives, leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary further testing, which incurs its own risks. Remember that even with the Apple Watch, most of the people who got notifications did not have atrial fibrillation.\nMoreover, the task force was focusing on a population where we might intervene: older people. Patients at high risk of stroke who have atrial fibrillation (i.e., older people) might be treated with anticoagulation. For younger ones at lower risk, it\u2019s not immediately clear how we would treat them, or if we should.\nAnd it\u2019s younger people who are more likely to have a smart watch.\nWe should be clear that we\u2019re focusing on atrial fibrillation that isn\u2019t otherwise noticed by patients or doctors. Those who are already diagnosed and those who are symptomatic should absolutely be managed by physicians, and many will be treated with medications or procedures. Diagnosed and symptomatic disease should not be minimized or ignored.\nThere are positive messages from this study. There\u2019s potential to use commercial devices to monitor and assess people outside of the clinical setting, and there\u2019s clearly an appetite for it as well. But for now and based on these results, while there may be reasons to own an Apple Watch, using it as a widespread screen for atrial fibrillation probably isn\u2019t one."

        "title": "Chuck Peddle Dies at 82; His $25 Chip Helped Start the PC Age",
        "fulltext": "Chuck Peddle, the engineer and entrepreneur who helped launch the age of the personal computer after designing a microprocessor that sold for a mere $25, died on Dec. 15 at his home in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 82.\nHis partner, Kathleen Shaeffer, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.\nIn 1974, Mr. Peddle and several other engineers were designing a new silicon chip at the Motorola Corporation in Phoenix when the company sent him a letter demanding that he shut the project down.\nMr. Peddle envisioned an ultra-low-cost chip that could bring digital technology to a new breed of consumer devices, from cash registers to personal computers. But his bosses saw it as unwanted in-house competition for the $300 processor Motorola had unveiled that year.\nSo Mr. Peddle moved the project toMOS Technology, a rival chip maker near Valley Forge, Pa., taking seven other Motorola engineers with him. There they built a processor called the 6502. Priced at $25 \u2014 the cost of a dinner for four, and the equivalent of about $130 today \u2014 this chip soon powered the first big wave of personal computers in both the United States and Britain, including the Apple II and the Commodore PET.\n\u201cThe market needed a cheap one,\u201d Mr. Peddle saidin a 2014 interview with the Computer History Museum.\nIn later years Intel, the Northern California chip giant, would come to dominate the personal computer business. But the market was seeded in Valley Forge, not Silicon Valley.\n\u201cChuck Peddle is one of the great unsung heroes of the personal computer age,\u201d said Doug Fairbairn, a director at theComputer History Museumin Mountain View, Calif. \u201cVirtually all of the early, successful, mass-market personal computers were built around the 6502, not chips from Intel or anyone else.\u201d\nCharles Ingerham Peddle was born on Nov. 25, 1937, in Bangor, Maine, the oldest son of Thomas and Maxine (Denno) Peddle. His father was a salesman, his mother a commercial illustrator. In high school Chuck dreamed of being a radio announcer. (Television was still in its infancy.) But after traveling to Boston for an audition, he realized that his talents lay elsewhere. At the suggestion of a neighbor, he enrolled in the engineering school at the University of Maine.\nAfter graduation, his aim was twofold: He wanted to live in California, and he wanted to build computers. So he took a job with General Electric, where he helped design early space vehicles, electronic cash registers and so-called time-share computers, massive mainframes that could be shared across companies, schools and other organizations.\nLater, at Motorola, he worked on the 6800 chip, a $300 processor used in pinball machines and other arcade games, before turning his attention to a lower-cost processor. When the company sent him a letter killing the project, he responded with a letter of his own. He told Motorola that because it was abandoning the project, all the work he had done now belonged to him.\nWhen he first took the idea to MOS Technology, one of the company\u2019s founders,L.J. Sevin, turned him down, worried that Motorola would sue. So Mr. Peddle took the project to the other founder,John Paivinen, with whom he had worked at General Electric. Mr. Paivinen gave his approval.\nAfter Mr. Paivinen had brought Mr. Peddle and the other Motorola engineers to Valley Forge and they built their low-cost chip, Motorola sued, just as Mr. Sevin had predicted. MOS fought the suit for years before paying a $200,000 fine.\nBy then, its $25 chip was feeding the rise of the personal computer. At MOS, Mr. Peddle built a personal computer around his new chip called the KIM-1 (the letters stood for Keyboard Input Monitor), and he started selling chips to a pair of young entrepreneurs,Steve Jobsand Steve Wozniak, who were building a company called Apple.\nIn 1976, MOS was acquired by a calculator company,Commodore Business Machines, and Mr. Peddle became its chief engineer. Soon after, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Wozniak offered to sell Apple to Commodore, but Commodore declined. Mr. Peddle and his new company built their own personal computer around the 6502: the Commodore PET, which sold for $495.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the personal computer market really took off,\u201d Bill Seiler, who worked alongside Mr. Peddle on the first Commodore computer, said in a phone interview.\nThe 6502 also powered the Atari gaming console, which brought video games into the home, and the BBC Micro, which introduced personal computers to Britain.\nIn the early 1980s, Mr. Peddle founded another PC company, Sirius Systems Technology, where he designed a machine called the Victor. In later years he built NNA Corporation, which made a computer with removable hard drives, letting people carry data from place to place \u2014 a forerunner of the USB stick.\nIn addition to Ms. Shaeffer, Mr. Peddle is survived by three brothers, Douglass, Duncan and Shelton Peddle; a sister, Marthalie Furber-Peddle; three sons, Thomas and Robert Peddle and Vernon Prestia; three daughters, Debbie and Diane Peddle and Cheryl Prestia; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce.\nThe PC age is now on the wane, but Mr. Peddle\u2019s big idea is just getting started. \u201cHis big thing was distributed intelligence, putting microprocessors in everything,\u201d Mr. Seiler said. \u201cAnd nowadays, microprocessors are going into everything.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "When I contemplate what my ideal world might look like, I imagine one in which everyone just minds their business and does their own thing, so long as they aren\u2019t causing any harm \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 to others. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t conflict or that bad things never happen: Humans will still annoy one another and argue, many marriages will still end in divorce, studio execs will still make up excuses to tell thesame story about Batman or Batman-adjacent charactersfor the hundredth time.\nBut mostly, life is free from -isms and -phobias; boundaries are respected, voting rights aren\u2019t suppressed. And truly, no one cares what you look like, whom you sleep with, where you come from or what religion you do or don\u2019t practice.\nThat, to me, is The Dream.\nSome version of my dream has trickled into popular culture as of late: In the R-rated high school comedy \u201cBooksmart,\u201d where kids of varying ethnicities, sexualities and gender expressions coexist relatively harmoniously, and there\u2019s nary a bully in sight. In the R-rated middle-school comedy \u201cGood Boys,\u201d featuring 12-year-olds who drop F-bombs left and right but already understand the concept of consent. In \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d where no one bats an eye at a character\u2019s pansexuality in an extremely small town.\nMore recently, the HBO series adaptation of Tom Perrotta\u2019s novel \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d features an average white jock who is an outlier on his new college campus, where everyone around him got the memo long ago that it\u2019s not O.K. to casually throw around the word \u201cretarded\u201d or treat women like disposable objects.\nIt all feels like an extension of the ways the issues dominating the cultural and political discourse of the last few years \u2014 #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, gender identity and so on \u2014 have become fully embedded in Hollywood scripts.\nYet \u201cBooksmart\u201d and its ilk also feel different: The more common trend among shows and movies tackling these subjects is to reflect the polarizing and fractious realm we\u2019re currently experiencing, as in the Netflix mini-series about the Central Park Five case, \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d or in \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d Apple +\u2019s thinly veiled satire about, among things, the disgraced \u201cToday Show\u201d host Matt Lauer. Or, as with HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d or Netflix\u2019s \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d they emphasize how power and wealth encourage terrible behavior.\nIn contrast, movies like \u201cBooksmart\u201d posit a world where we\u2019re long past debating the humanity of people who aren\u2019t thin, white, straight, wealthy and male. Each takes on the language and sensibilities of the socially progressive, while marking the presence of women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. people in all spaces as a given \u2014 the norm, unremarkable.\nFor the most part, this development is refreshing to me, a 30-something millennial who grew up on a steady diet of pop culture that typically includes, at the very least,questionable dialoguethat doesn\u2019t hold up through a 2019 lens.\nBoth \u201cBooksmart\u201d and \u201cGood Boys\u201d are self-aware counterparts to many of their tween/teen movie forebears. In \u201cBooksmart,\u201d Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) are overachievers who decide to finally let loose and party on graduation weekend after learning their less studious classmates still managed to get into top colleges.\nAs in \u201cGood Boys,\u201d their peers represent a wide spectrum of types and demographics. Among them: the laid-back, androgynous skater girl Ryan, whom Amy has a crush on; the goofy slacker Nick (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2019s son Mason Gooding), whom Molly has a crush on; the overly dramatic theater nerds George and Alan. In high school movies made as recently as a dozen years ago \u2014 and going back decades \u2014 these characters would be siloed and pitted against one another. The flamboyant George and Alan would be subject to casually homophobic jokes; Molly\u2019s weight might be central to the plot. Almost all of them would probably have been white.\nYet the kids tease Molly not because of what she looks like, but because her quest to be a perfect student teeters on the verge of Tracy Flick-level proportions. At the climactic graduation party \u2014 that enduring staple of the genre \u2014 where every senior from school seems to be in attendance, there is no sense of a division among the types. Molly and Amy are happily welcomed into the fold, the other kids genuinely and pleasantly surprised to see them finally being social.\n\u201cGood Boys,\u201d about three best friends \u2014 Max (Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (Keith L. Williams) and Thor (Brady Noon) \u2014 adjusting to middle school, has its own vision of an enlightened world. What little bullying occurs is tame and slur free (unless you consider being labeled a \u201cmisogynist\u201d a slur). A yellow-vested watchdog group called the Student Coalition Against Bullying is depicted less so as the geeky subset of the school (the acronym is \u201cS.C.A.B.\u201d) than as an endearing example of youth activism (Lucas joins the group at the end).\nThe cynical takeaway is that movies like these are pandering to social progressives (for what it\u2019s worth, both appear to be set in California suburbs). But Olivia Wilde, the 35-year-old director of \u201cBooksmart,\u201dencouraged her young cast membersto offer input on the script, to keep it as true to the experiences of today\u2019s younger generation as possible. It seems a lot of kids reallyaremore chill than previous generations when it comes to self-expression, and they think a lot about language and how others might respond to the things they say and do.\nQueer children are coming out at much younger ages.Signaling one\u2019s preferred pronounsis becoming the norm. A Pew Research study from earlier this year found that43 percent of Generation Z Republicanssurveyed believe black people are treated less fairly than whites \u2014 more than twice as many as Generation X, Boomer and Silent-Generation Republicans, and 10 percent more than Millennial Republicans.\nThis shift helps explain the HBO drama \u201cMrs. Fletcher,\u201d which concluded its first season earlier this month. Its depiction of an inclusivity-driven college campus through the eyes of Brendan (Jackson White), who stands in stark contrast to the rest of his peers, gives the impression that the power imbalance has tipped significantly in favor of the more open-minded.\nIn the third episode, Brendan makes an awkward joke about planning to surf during a tsunami during a lunchtime chat about climate change with a few of the school\u2019s football players. Instead of laughing along, they look at him weirdly, and one of them quickly restarts the discussion, as if Brendan hadn\u2019t said anything at all.\nIn the penultimate episode, he has sex for the first time with Chloe (Jasmine Cephas-Jones), a girl he\u2019s been flirting with since he got to school. In the middle of the act, Brendan begins to choke her, and she breaks off the encounter by punching him. He insists she was \u201cinto it,\u201d but she shoots him down quickly. \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even notice I was there.\u201d She refuses to see him again, and her friends prevent him from trying to contact her.\nThe elimination of prejudice, at least in these movies and shows, isn\u2019t limited to young characters. On \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which begins its final season in January, the absence of anxiety over a character\u2019s sexuality feels like a reprieve. For the show\u2019s co-creator, Dan Levy, who stars as the pansexual character David Rose, this was a deliberate decision. \u201cI wanted to show a projection of our own world that was kinder,\u201dhe told Entertainment Weekly, \u201cshow how much people can grow and the capacity with which people can love when they are not fearing for their lives.\u201d\nThere are occasional drawbacks to indulging in this fantasy. As Alison Wilmore wrote in Buzzfeed last spring, the premise of \u201cBooksmart\u201dignores the role class plays in the life of high schoolers. If Molly and Amy\u2019s peers still managed to get into schools like Stanford while being hard partyers and underachievers, it seems likely the reason stems from nepotism, wealth or even, perhaps,bribery.\nBut it\u2019s easy to understand why more creators are drawn to this kind of projection, now. In an episode of the educational series \u201cMaster Class,\u201d the showrunner Shonda Rhimes explains that she considered the political climate while creating \u201cScandal\u201d; the reason she felt comfortable depicting Washington as full of \u201cmonsters\u201d and \u201cmetaphorical monsters,\u201d she said, was because \u201cwe were in the midst of the glow of \u2018Yes We Can,\u2019 Obama White House.\u201d\nOn the flip side, she continued, the optimism at the heart of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 the successful bipartisan compromises, for one \u2014 flourished during an era when the atmosphere was much darker and pessimistic.\nIn any given political moment, viewers will turn to Hollywood for an escape, and right now, it seems, is when many of us want that diversion to err on the side of hopefulness. For the most part, this is a good thing. As the saying goes, you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple AirPods Pro Review: The \u2018Hearable\u2019 at Its Best",
        "fulltext": "We are living in an era of \u201chearables\u201d \u2014 earphones embedded with special sensors that talk to our phones. AndApple\u2019s AirPods, those tiny white earbuds that live in a case the size of a Tic Tac box, are leading the trend.\nFor several years, I have found AirPods to be as convenient as they are useful. When Apple introduced them in 2016, it popularized wireless earphones with a special chip that connected them to an iPhone. When I popped them in my ears, they seamlessly connected with my device. And when I put them back in their case, their batteries replenished.\nNow the AirPods are getting smarter \u2014 and costlier. The earlier-generation AirPods cost around $150. The latest model,AirPods Pro, is more expensive at $249.\nBut the new earphones, released about a month ago, offer noise-canceling technology. They use microphones to listen for ambient sound and to generate the opposite sound in your ears to reduce noise, like the roaring engines of an airplane and background chatter in an office.\nThe AirPods Pro also have a neat new feature known as transparency mode, which you activate by holding down a button on an earbud stem. The earphones then use their microphones to amplify the sounds around you, so you can hear your surroundings more clearly while listening to a podcast or music. This turned out to be my favorite new feature.\nHow good are the new AirPods for that much money? Compared with other high-end headphones, the AirPods aren\u2019t the best at canceling noise. Yet they are competent and a good overall value, and so far, no one can beat the convenience of their compact design.\nFor several weeks, I compared the AirPods Pro with Bose headphones and a pair of older AirPods in various situations, including my daily commutes and on an international flight. Here\u2019s how that went.\nFor me, noise-canceling headphones are most useful on a plane. The noises from the engines combined with the conversations of loquacious seat neighbors make it difficult to sleep.\nSo I wore the new AirPods on a recent 14-hour flight. I found several downsides. For one, the noise-canceling somewhat muffled the noise of the plane engines, but not enough to allow me to sleep. And because the AirPods are wireless, I couldn\u2019t plug them into the screen in front of my seat to watch movies.\nOn the flight, I preferred Bose\u2019s $350QuietComfort 35, which are large wireless headphones worn over the ears. They significantly cut down on the engine noise, and they have a cord that could be plugged in to my seat\u2019s audio jack to watch in-flight entertainment. But the Bose headphones are bulkier, though they have always fit fine in my carry-on bag.\nAs for the older AirPods, I never felt they were adequate to hear music or podcasts amid the engine noise. In the past, I left AirPods at home whenever I traveled.\nVerdict:For frequent travelers, I recommend bigger, more effective noise-canceling headphones like those from Bose.\nI wore the new AirPods Pro on several trains on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. With noise-canceling turned on, the earbuds sounded good and did a fine job drowning out the conversations around me. But when the train came to a screeching halt, the earbuds were ineffective at muffling the earsplitting noise.\nIn similar tests, my Bose headphones sounded great on the train, but they, too, couldn\u2019t muffle loud braking. This is to be expected: In general, noise-canceling technology reduces low-frequency sounds, not high-frequency noises like screeches or babies screaming.\nOn BART, when I wore normal AirPods, I could barely hear anything playing from the earbuds. I often didn\u2019t bother to use them on the train.\nVerdict:On noisy trains, the AirPods Pro are just as good as other noise-canceling earphones, and they are much better than normal AirPods.\nThe new AirPods were great to use outdoors. By turning on transparency mode, I was able to listen for cars while crossing the street and remain attentive while walking around less safe neighborhoods.\nIn contrast, the Bose headphones lacked a transparency mode (though some other Bose models have the feature). I often just took them off outdoors for safety purposes.\nVerdict:The AirPods Pro became my go-to earphones for running errands like going out to the grocery store and walking my dogs. A bonus: They were easier to grab on the go because of their smaller size.\nAfter some experimentation, I learned that transparency mode was the best for taking phone conversations on the new AirPods. People\u2019s voices sounded loud and clear in the earphones, but just as important, I was able to hear myself better, which helped me be more mindful about enunciating words and made me feel more confident over all.\nWhenever I took calls on the Bose headphones, I could hear the person I was calling very clearly, but I sounded muffled to myself, which was jarring.\nI also enjoyed taking calls on older AirPods, partly because they connected with my phone quickly when a call came in. But being able to hear myself better in transparency mode on the Pro model made a big difference.\nVerdict:If you talk on the phone frequently, the AirPods Pro make an excellent headset.\nWhile there are bulkier headphones on the market that do a better job at noise-canceling, the AirPods Pro are adequate in most situations, and their compact size makes them more convenient. They are a major improvement; I hesitate to recommend older versions because the new model is far superior.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s one big thing that hasn\u2019t changed. In myreview of the previous AirPods, I noted that after about two years, my first-generation AirPods started dying because their batteries had worn out. They could not be revived because the batteries could not be replaced.\nApple confirmed the batteries could also not be replaced on the AirPods Pro. That\u2019s because, in part, their design involves embedding the batteries, circuit boards, microphones and antennas directly into a tightly sealed, tiny package.\nSo if you buy the AirPods Pro, be warned: You will most likely have to pay up all over again in two years."

        "title": "Big Tech Is Under Attack, and Investors Couldn\u2019t Care Less",
        "fulltext": "It was December 2018, and the towering giants of tech were looking wobbly.\nApple\u2019s shares were tumbling, and it hadn\u2019t yet delivered the bad news about a sales slowdown in China for the iPhone, a device that had helped make it the modern era\u2019s first trillion-dollar company. Facebook could not escape the shadow of the dueling electoral scandals of Cambridge Analytica and Russian disinformation. And Amazon\u2019s stock was sagging as the president of the United States regularly attacked the company.\nJust as it appeared that the big tech companies\u2019 endless upward march had finally come to an end, they led a remarkable rally.\nThis year, the S&P 500 tech sector is up more than 40 percent, handily outpacing the 25 percent gain for the benchmark index over all, which is itself the third-best annual return of the past two decades.\nApple stock is up 70 percent, and it set a high-water mark last week. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is up 28.5 percent, and set its own record on Monday. Microsoft shares have soared 49 percent in 2019, and Amazon is up 16 percent.\nAnd Facebook \u2014 whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has spent much of the past two years telling lawmakers why his company can be trusted on issues as varied aspersonal dataandcryptocurrency\u2014 is up 53 percent.\nTech has surged in part thanks to the tide of rate cuts unleashed by the Federal Reserve, which has lifted all boats. The gains also reflect the relief investors are feeling that the trade war\u2019s worst outcomes haven\u2019t come to pass.\nThe trade-sensitive chip maker AMD more than doubled on such a swing in sentiment, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 so far this year. Lam Research, which produces semiconductor manufacturing equipment, is up more than 90 percent, the second-best showing.\nBut the giants of technology \u2014 companies like Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 are the stocks that have made the market\u2019s year. Their bulk gives them outsize sway over indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by market capitalization. In other words, price moves of bigger companies move the index the most.\nThe rise in value of these five companies alone accounted for more than 20 percent of the total returns of the S&P 500 this year, through the end of November.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for mega-cap tech for sure,\u201d said Richard Bodzy, a portfolio manager at Putnam Investments whose top two holdings are Microsoft and Apple.\nFew would have predicted such robust results a year ago.\nBetween October 2018 and January, Apple\u2019s share price crashed roughly 40 percent. The stock plummeted nearly 10 percent in a single day \u2014 Jan. 3 \u2014 after the company cut its outlook for sales for the first time in over a decade, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.\nFacebook\u2019s stock dropped 43 percent from its 2018 peak to the market\u2019s trough last December, as it faced months of scrutiny related to the use of its platform by Russians seeking to influence the 2016 American presidential campaign as well as the collection of users\u2019 data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The tumble included a 19 percent nose dive \u2014the company\u2019s worst day ever\u2014 on July 26, after executives said future profits would be hurt as it ramped up spending on security.\nAmazon shares lost roughly 34 percent of their value between September 2018 and Christmas. President Trump has assailed the company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. Mr. Trump publicly accused Amazon of avoiding taxes and called The Post, which has aggressively covered the Trump administration, a lobbyist for the company. On Monday, Amazonsaid Mr. Trumphad pressured the Pentagon to cut it out of a multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract.\nWith a slump of roughly 19 percent, Microsoft stood out for its relative resilience. Some investors dumped their shares late last year as the company\u2019s juggernaut web services division experienced a temporary deceleration in sales growth.\nBut, just when things looked bleakest, stocks began to rise.\nIn January, the Federal Reserve swiveled away from its 2018 policy of raising rates, toward its eventual decision to chop them three times in 2019. The Fed\u2019s efforts buoyed shares broadly, helping to set off the best start for the S&P 500 since the late 1980s.\nThe Fed chose to cut rates, in part, because of rising threats to economic growth. Those concerns also drove investors to buy shares in mega-cap tech companies.\n\u201cThey are more economically resilient,\u201d said Jeb Breece, principal at Spears Abacus, an independent money management firm in Manhattan. \u201cA dollar of tech earnings seems like more of a sure bet than a dollar of Midwestern steel earnings.\u201d\nAnd earnings among the tech giants have held up better than some had feared. After ugly results in the first and second quarters, Facebook\u2019s third quarter topped expectations for profit and revenue.\nApple\u2019s results have also been better than expected recently, and Microsoft in particular has notched supercharged results. Its Azure cloud computing business has helped push the company\u2019s profit growth rate up to almost 30 percent for the last three quarters.\nThat has driven Apple and Microsoft \u2014 which also happen to be the largest companies in the United States, by market cap \u2014 to their best performances in a decade.\nThe recent climbs have left these tech giants with some of the largest market values on earth. Apple and Microsoft both have a market value of over $1 trillion. Alphabet is worth more than $900 billion.\nThe sheer scale of these companies is part of what makes their rise this year so remarkable. While huge share price surges are common in the market for smaller capitalization companies, these are giants.\nThe law of large numbers means it is far more difficult to generate large percentage increases in value. A unique confluence of factors allowed these companies to break that law this year. But observers say it\u2019s unlikely they will regularly clock such large gains.\n\u201cHow does Microsoft double again? You\u2019re adding a trillion dollars,\u201d Mr. Breece said. \u201cYou\u2019re just getting to huge numbers.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Apple Scrapped the Release of Its Oscar Contender, \u2018The Banker\u2019",
        "fulltext": "Apple has struggled to find its footing as it tries to go Hollywood. Critics were lukewarm at best about\u201cThe Morning Show,\u201dthe star-studded, big-budget flagship series on Apple TV Plus, the streaming platform that went live Nov. 1. And now one of Apple\u2019s first films, \u201cThe Banker,\u201d starring Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie, is in limbo after the company pulled it from a theatrical run that was scheduled to start Friday.\nIt seemed like just the right project for Apple to introduce itself as a player in the movie business. With two stars from the \u201cAvengers\u201d series leading the cast, \u201cThe Banker\u201d is based on the real-life story of two black entrepreneurs who triumphed over the racist business practices of mid-20th-century America. Apple had announced a theatrical release and started an awards push, only tohalt the planafter a daughter of one of the film\u2019s protagonists raised allegations of sexual abuse involving her family.\nIt\u2019s an inopportune stumble for the company, which has pitted itself against Netflix and Amazon, not to mention the Walt Disney Company, as it tries to make headway in a business that has nothing to do with the selling of iPhones and MacBook Pros.\nOn Nov. 20, Apple pulled \u201cThe Banker\u201d from the prestigious closing-night slot at the American Film Institute\u2019s annual festival in Los Angeles. The company said it and the filmmakers needed time to look into the accusations by Cynthia Garrett, whose father was the basis forBernard Garrett, the character played by Mr. Mackie.\nTwo days later, Apple scrapped the December release. Since then, the company has declined to comment on whether it will put \u201cThe Banker\u201d in theaters or make it available on Apple TV Plus. Under the original plan, the moviewas scheduledfor a January debut on the platform.\nMs. Garrett, a television personality who runs a ministry in Los Angeles, accused her half brother, Bernard Garrett Jr., a son of the man played by Mr. Mackie and one of the film\u2019s co-producers, of sexually abusing her and her younger sister when they were children in the 1970s. Apple removed his name from publicity materials, and he no longer appears as a producer of \u201cThe Banker\u201d on the website IMDB, which lists film credits.\nMr. Garrett denied the accusations, saying in an email, \u201cThese allegations against me simply are not true.\u201d\nAdapting true stories for the screen has long been a fraught endeavor, with films like Oliver Stone\u2019s\u201cJ.F.K.\u201dand Norman Jewison\u2019s\u201cThe Hurricane\u201ddrawing criticism for mixing fact and fiction. Universal Pictures faced complaints this year over\u201cGreen Book,\u201da fact-based film centered on the relationship between a black concert pianist, Donald Shirley, and his white chauffeur in midcentury America. Although the Shirley family condemned the portrayal, Universal backed the film through awards-campaign season, and it won theOscarfor best picture.\nMs. Garrett, who was a V.J. at VH1 in the 1990s and the host of the NBC talk show \u201cLater\u201d in 2000, said Apple was right to shelve \u201cThe Banker.\u201d\n\u201cI applaud Apple for doing the right thing and choosing to stand with women and children,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cAs a woman of color, I feel pretty vindicated by the fact that Apple recognized us.\u201d\nBut some people in Hollywood have questioned whether Apple was overly cautious.\n\u201cWhen you are in the business of distributing content, unless you have an indefensible claim against you, you don\u2019t let issues and protests get in the way,\u201d said Blair Westlake, a media strategist and a former media executive at Universal Studios and Microsoft. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s regrettable that Apple would let the displeasure and concerns of a small group of people, which may be justified and fact based, change their business plans.\n\u201cOnce you open that door, any other topic or film could run the same risk,\u201d Mr. Westlake continued. \u201cIt will likely have a chilling effect on those wishing to produce content for them.\u201d\nTim Bajarin, the president of Creative Strategies, a Silicon Valley market research firm, said the company was right to tread carefully.\n\u201cLike Disney, Apple has a relatively squeaky-clean position with consumers, and they are known for protecting their customers, guarding their privacy and their security,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Apple\u2019s position of cautiousness is important at this early stage in their streaming business. They don\u2019t need the negative criticism on a particular movie. They need to prove their capabilities, and that their quality and their content is acceptable.\u201d\nThe botched rollout is a blow to Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, film-industry veterans who run Apple\u2019s streaming service. The company\u2019s move into Hollywood has emphasized the television shows it has created with a group of name producers including Oprah Winfrey and J.J. Abrams. But Apple is making a side-bet that it can succeed with movies.\nIn an interview last month, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht described the company\u2019s film strategy as modest and carefully considered \u2014 no more than 12 movies a year, each given a tailor-made promotional push. They contrasted the strategy with that of Netflix, a company that spends billions on content andmakes roughly 90 feature-length movies annually,including documentaries and animated films.\n\u201cNetflix has chosen to be in the volume business,\u201d Mr. Erlicht said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t event-ize 80 movies a year. Each and every one of our movies will be special.\u201d\nWith its largely positive message and strong performances by its two stars, \u201cThe Banker\u201d had the potential to be a box-office and streaming hit while generating some Oscar buzz.\n\u201cYou have an incredibly exciting and entertaining story with an A-plus cast, but it\u2019s also saying something about the world we used to live in and the world we still live in today,\u201d Matt Dentler, the head of Apple\u2019s film division, said in an interview before the original release plan was canceled.\nThe film\u2019s journey to almost making it to the screen goes back to 1995, when the original screenwriter, David Lewis Smith, conducted eight hours of taped interviews with the elder Mr. Garrett. Mr. Garrett described his rise as an entrepreneur in California decades ago, his efforts to buy banks in Texas and how he and his business partner, Joseph Morris, wound up drawing the attention of the federal authorities. Both served time at Terminal Island prison in Los Angeles and testified before Congress in 1965.\nThe tapes made by Mr. Smith, along with more than 1,000 pages of the congressional transcript, became source material for the script. In 1996, Mr. Garrett signed a deal giving the rights to his life story to New Day, a production company he formed with Bernard Garrett Jr. and Mr. Smith. (The New York Times reviewed a copy of the contract.) The project languished until 2012, when the producer Joel Viertel bought the rights from New Day.\nAs part of that deal, Mr. Viertel acquired the life rights of Bernard Garrett Jr. and his mother, Eunice Garrett, played in the film by Nia Long. The producer enlisted the screenwriter and director George Nolfi in 2015, along with the screenwriter Niceole R. Levy.\nAccording to two people close to the project, the filmmakers met with the younger Mr. Garrett only once \u2014 for dinner in Los Angeles, at Mr. Nolfi\u2019s request \u2014 before filming started in September 2018. The shoot wrapped in November 2018, and Apple bought the worldwide rights in June for $20 million based on an eight-minute sizzle reel. Before his half sister made the filmmakers aware of her accusations, Mr. Garrett was set to have a role in promoting \u201cThe Banker.\u201d He took part in apanel discussionhosted by the film site IndieWire on Nov. 5.\nThere is no character in the film based on Cynthia Garrett\u2019s mother, Linda Garrett, the second of Bernard Garrett\u2019s three wives. Married in 1962, the two stayed together for more than a decade, Ms. Garrett said. In her telling of events, it was her mother, not Eunice, who helped Mr. Garrett make the business deals central to \u201cThe Banker.\u201d\nThe filmmakers learned of Ms. Garrett\u2019s objections on Nov. 8, when she posted them in theYouTube comment sectionbeneath a trailer for \u201cThe Banker.\u201d In her comment, Ms. Garrett accused the filmmakers of stealing her mother\u2019s story without permission.\nOn Monday, the filmmakers issued a statement signed by 53 members of the cast and crew. It read in part, \u201cThough we have no way of knowing what may have transpired between Mr. Garrett\u2019s children in the 1970s, including the allegations of abuse we have recently been made aware of, our hearts go out to anyone who has suffered.\u201d\nInterviewed on Thursday, Ms. Garrett, who said she had not seen the movie, held firm.\n\u201cMy sister and I spoke up about our sexual abuse because we don\u2019t feel that a predator should profit off of stealing our mom\u2019s and our life story with our father,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple to me. All the rest of this, the chain of title and the movie rights, all these other arguments, they are just cloud cover.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "This week, Google Maps could not find me, and it seemed really pissed off.\nI switched all of the location-access buttons on my iPhone from \u201cWhile Using the App\u201d to \u201cAsk Next Time,\u201d causing my most useful app to launch a series of increasingly desperate pop-up entreaties, begging me to make my life easier by letting it automatically locate me (rather than giving it access to my location only when I type in where I am and where I want to go).\nI cannot imagine its stalker rage if I had clicked \u201cNever\u201d allow the app to track my location.\nTough luck, Google Maps. Because, as 2019 ends, I am breaking up with opt-in by taking up a well-worn Silicon Valley bromide as my digital mantra: Only the paranoid survive.\nThat was, of course, the motto made famous by Intel\u2019s legendary founder and former chief executive, Andy Grove, who later turned the line into a book that was actually about being hypervigilant as inevitable \u201ccrisis points\u201d occur at your company.\nMr. Grove saw much trouble in becoming lax, especially after triumph. \u201cBusiness success contains the seeds of its own destruction,\u201d wrote the canny entrepreneur who immigrated from Hungary having escaped Nazi death camps and later Soviet oppression. \u201cSuccess breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still a good piece of advice, but these days it seems as though there is an entirely new way of reading that line when it comes to a different issue in tech: The surveillance economy that continues to spread like a virus worldwide, even as consumers are less aware than ever of its implications.\nThat includes me, who should know better. I have two-factor authentication. I cover my camera lens on my computer. I redo all my security settings regularly. And, if you read any of my columns this year, you know I am wary of \u2014 you might even say mean about \u2014 various consumer abuses by giant social-media companies, search behemoths and testosterone-jacked e-commerce companies.\nStill, as much as I know about tech, I\u2019m often lazy and use its tools without care, even as each day seems to bring new headlines about privacy incursions sometimes done for commercial reasons, sometimes for malevolent ones, and sometimes just as a result of tech\u2019s latest changes.\nThe common denominator? The data we generate every day that they then suck up like Dyson vacuum cleaners on steroids.\ntranscript\nWe\u2019ve published a lot of stories in the last year about privacy. Like, a lot. And almost every time we do, we hear a version of the same thing. \u201cIt amazes me how often I hear from people, I have nothing to hide. I have nothing to fear from people spying on me.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m a law-abiding citizen, so I\u2019m not so worried about it. Send what you\u2019ve got, Big Brother.\u201d In a yearlong series, we\u2019ve shown you how your privacy is being invaded at an industrial scale. \u201cYou are followed 24/7, 365 days a year.\u201d \u201cEverything you do is being watched.\u201d I mean, even we\u2019re doing it to you right now. Despite that, you haven\u2019t gone through the settings on your phone, have you? You probably don\u2019t use a VPN, and I know you don\u2019t read the terms and conditions before clicking Accept. But while you\u2019re busy not thinking about it, your private information is being raided, traded and used against you in terrifying ways. \u201cI was shocked. We should be very scared.\u201d So ask yourself this: How much of your private information are you really comfortable giving away? \u201cLet me look on the internet. They\u2019ll know I\u2019m searching for it.\u201d In this video, we\u2019re going to test your privacy comfort level. Seriously, where is your red line? \u201cThey know a lot more about you than you may even know about yourself.\u201d Because there\u2019s a lot more at stake than you think, and time is running out to do anything about it. \u201cSo you think you have nothing to hide? You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t even think about that.\u201d \u201cOpen up Budweiser and pour yourself the most inviting glass of beer you\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d For a long time, advertising was an art of guesswork. The madmen could only hope that you were thirsty. But now, they can tell exactly how you\u2019re feeling. To show you what I mean, I want to tell you about a little experiment we did. He\u2019s our guinea pig. \u201cHi.\u201d His name is Farhad Manjoo. \u201cI\u2019m an opinion columnist at The New York Times and I write about technology.\u201d And at the start of the year, he volunteered. \u201cWell, I was asked to volunteer to have all of my information tracked and then, you know, publish all that in the newspaper.\u201d Using a special browser, we were able to see what websites Farhad visited. But more importantly, what those websites could see about him. \u201cSo I started the day on Google and did a search. And nine trackers were downloaded onto my computer.\u201d Yes, trackers. These are tiny text files or even just a pixel sometimes. And, \u201cTrackers do what it sounds like they do. They track you. They can get my I.P. address or the device I\u2019m using or the screen size. They were able to determine my location very precisely. Next, I went to HuffPo, and I was swarmed. The trackers kind of multiplied. There were dozens and dozens.\u201d Every site Farhad visited, the trackers followed him. \u201cWashington Post, Google, Vanity Fair.\u201d By the way, you know all of this is happening to you right now, don\u2019t you? as you\u2019re watching this video? You\u2019re just not supposed to know about it. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just \u2014 the trackers are just kind of, you know, on my heels as I go around the web.\u201d O.K., so different companies know the model of your phone. Big deal. Well, it gets worse. With all of your private data, the trackers send it away to \u201cMostly advertising companies.\u201d So there\u2019s this gigantic digital marketplace where your personal information is auctioned off to advertisers. Your data\u2019s like one of these tuna, except instead of humans arguing over you, it\u2019s algorithms. It all happens in a split second, every time you load a web page. \u201cThe fact that parts of me are being bought and sold in this marketplace is very creepy.\u201d The companies say this data is all scattered into many little pieces and so it stays anonymous. But in buying and selling to each other, the companies can assemble those pieces and begin to build complete profiles of you. \u201cThey can have kind of almost direct access to your subconscious.\u201d And that\u2019s where this gets kind of dark. Where companies once had to hope you were in the mood to buy, now they can use your data to predict your mood and take advantage of it. Would you be O.K. if a company could tell you were depressed because of the food you just ordered? Or if your health insurance provider could raise your premiums because it knew you skipped too many days at the gym? What about if your ride-share app was monitoring your phone\u2019s battery? There\u2019s nothing stopping them from using that information to jack up prices when you\u2019re low on juice and most desperate for a ride. The companies have all of this information about you, and legally. I mean, you agreed to it in those terms and conditions you didn\u2019t read. It\u2019s nothing short of mind control. \u201cI often wonder when I\u2019m using a site like Facebook, whether the thoughts I\u2019m having are independent thoughts. Like, was it my idea to go to this place for a vacation, or was it Facebook\u2019s idea?\u201d If being tracked by a beer company doesn\u2019t cross the line for you, let\u2019s see how you feel when we take it up a level. \u201cPolice departments use modern science to protect you, such as teletype, photography.\u201d The technology the police are using these days, well, it\u2019s gotten a bit more sophisticated than this. This next story starts in Bryant Park, Midtown New York, on a Tuesday lunchtime. \u201cThat day was a typical late winter day.\u201d Well, not that typical. Our New York Times Opinion reporters were busy collecting footage from the public webcams in the park. We ran it through facial recognition software, and that software, it scans nearly 3,000 faces in the footage and matched them against a collection of publicly available images. And it didn\u2019t take long to find a match. \u201cThat is me.\u201d For this guy. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Richard Madonna. I\u2019m a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry. I had an email and a voice mail from The New York Times. What it said was, were you in Bryant Park last Tuesday at 1 o\u2019clock? So I went to my calendar, and sure enough, it said, 1 o\u2019clock, Bryant Park Grill.\u201d In case you\u2019re wondering, all of this is legal, and the software cost us less than $100 on Amazon. \u201cThat was a little spooky.\u201d Now anyone can collect the biometric information of members of the public and dig into their lives. \u201cThere was a picture of the side of my head taken from above. Clearly, it was enough to identify with my website picture, which was actually taken probably six or seven years ago.\u201d Now, maybe this is news to you, but law enforcement agencies figured this out 20 years ago. Today, they\u2019ve got access to photographs of tens of millions of Americans. Images they run against descriptions of suspects thousands of times a year. Researchers have told us there\u2019s a 50-50 chance your face is in that database. So what happens when someone who looks a bit like you commits a crime? Does it bother you that the photo from your driver\u2019s license puts you in an infinite police lineup? Do public spaces feel the same when you know you can\u2019t escape surveillance? Now, obviously, this technology comes with potential benefits, like catching criminals. But never before have law enforcement agencies had powers like this. And right now, there\u2019s no legislation that puts a limit on it. So have we reached your comfort level yet? Maybe you are O.K. with companies manipulating your emotions and your face being in a police database. Fine. But let\u2019s try taking this up just one more level. This guy knew what it was like to live under constant surveillance. For more than a decade, F.B.I. agents dug into his private life, wiretapped his home and his hotel rooms. Except, of course, Martin Luther King Jr. was no criminal. He was just advocating for civil rights. The government didn\u2019t like that, so they went looking for information to discredit him. \u201cGovernments have always been looking at people. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s new.\u201d This is Kara Swisher, by the way. \u201cI\u2019m a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times and I\u2019m a longtime technology journalist. Anytime the government can overreach in terms of surveilling citizenry, they have done in the history of the world.\u201d And the last time? It wasn\u2019t that long ago. \u201cNew details on that whistle-blower who leaked top-secret documents \u2014\u201d \u201cUncovering a massive government surveillance program of phone records and internet use \u2014\u201d \u201cWhen you call Grandma in Nebraska, the N.S.A. knows.\u201d \u201cYou know, a lot of people were surprised that the government was surveilling its citizens so extensively. I wasn\u2019t. What I think was surprising about what this stuff that Edward Snowden revealed was how extensive the government\u2019s surveillance was.\u201d Extensive? The government had spent a whole decade reading the metadata on your emails, your texts and your phone calls. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression: Why rob a bank? Well, that\u2019s where the money is. There\u2019s never been a time in history when more information about you was available because of information you willingly give up.\u201d And this hasn\u2019t stopped, by the way. The Patriot Act, which contains all these powers, was quietly renewed again at the end of 2019. \u201cCan you imagine today, the ability to track Martin Luther King just if he had a cellphone, just if he appeared at a hotel, just if he moved through the world?\u201d Just imagine today\u2019s surveillance technology in the hands of J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s F.B.I. They could have identified protesters, published their names and intimidated them, all to keep them from marching in the streets. And as crazy as it seems, America might still look a lot more like this. This is why your privacy matters. Surveillance is a means of control and suppression. So how do you feel now? Did any of that cross a line for you? I hope so. But do you know what? Your personal comfort level isn\u2019t actually the most important thing here. This goes way beyond just you or me. Together as a society, we need to draw a line in the sand. Otherwise companies, law enforcement and the government will keep pushing past it. \u201cYou know, in reality, there is no line. There is very little kind of legal limit, and we don\u2019t have a lot of moral or ethical boundaries about this stuff.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s actually no right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution, even though people in this country do think they have one.\u201d Bills are already making their way through Congress, but it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019ll get real privacy protections when tech companies spend tens of millions lobbying our government. \u201cHow are we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy? Because there are some trade-offs involved.\u201d People in power want you to believe that your privacy is something you have to compromise in order to be safe, but it\u2019s not impossible to have both at the same time. So how about this? We demand lawmakers pass a Privacy Bill of Rights, a document that enshrines our right to choose what information is public and what remains ours. First, it should declare that privacy is essential to democracy and liberty. Next, it must give you, me and everyone the ability to discover who is using our data and how. And finally, it must declare that our privacy is not something that can be traded in exchange for free access to a social media app or a phone. If you and I don\u2019t stand up for our rights to privacy now, we will find ourselves sleepwalking into mass surveillance. And even if you do have nothing to hide, that affects you, too. \u201cEverybody has secrets.\u201d \u201cEven if everything you do is perfectly legal and on the up and up and you don\u2019t have anything to hide, when you know you\u2019re being watched, I think you subconsciously change your behavior, and it has this kind of chilling effect.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s really at stake here, our freedom to speak and act and think how we want. A society of surveillance is just one step away from a society of submission.\nPrivacy has been losing badly, as users have become the online equivalent of cheap dates to these giant tech companies. We trade the lucrative digital essence of ourselves for much less in the form of free maps or nifty games or compelling communications apps.\nWe\u2019re digitally sloppy, even if it can be very dangerous, as evidenced by a disturbing New York Timesstory this weekabout an Emirati secure messaging app called ToTok, which is used by millions across the Middle East and has also recently become one of the most downloaded in the United States.\nThe name was obviously used to place the app adjacent to the hugely popular TikTok, already under scrutiny by American officials because of its Chinese origins and possible link to the Beijing government. In the case of ToTok, according to the Times report, it turns out that it is a spy tool \u201cused by the government of the United Arab Emirates to try to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those who install it on their phones.\u201d\nThe app\u2019s skein of developers is opaque, but apparently it is controlled by a sinister sounding company linked to the Emirate government called DarkMatter. (Yes, that is actually its name, akin to calling the villain in a movie Mr. Really Bad Guy.)\nAfter the Times inquiry, Google and Apple, United States tech giants that are the prime distributors of apps worldwide, removed ToTok from their online stores. But the damage was done \u2014 and by the users themselves.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to hack people to spy on them if you can get people to willingly download this app to their phone,\u201d Patrick Ward, who did a forensic analysis for the Times, said in the report. \u201cBy uploading contacts, video chats, location, what more intelligence do you need?\u201d\nIndeed, anyone who wants to spy needs very little, as all of us continue availing ourselves to tech\u2019s many wonders while promiscuously shedding our data.\nThat much was clear in the eye-opening investigation of smartphones by Times Opinion last week called \u201cOne Nation, Tracked.\u201d The Opinion report was even more dire than the ToTok story: One dataset of 12 million phones with 50 billion location pings from a basic location-data company showed clearly that there is no such thing as privacy. At all. Ever. Not on the beaches of Southern California, not at the Pentagon, not at the White House.\n\u201cNow, as the decade ends, tens of millions of Americans, including many children, find themselves carrying spies in their pockets during the day and leaving them beside their beds at night \u2014 even though the corporations that control their data are far less accountable than the government would be,\u201d noted the report, which included a look at how to track President Trump, the citizens of Pasadena and protesters in Hong Kong, as well as how to try to stop it all. This is what freaked me out enough to go back and tighten the security on my own phone.\nYes, it\u2019s up to us to protect ourselves, since there are no federal laws that actually do it. Europe has been far ahead on privacy with its General Data Protection Regulation, but things will finally start to change for Californians like me when the California Consumer Privacy Act goes into effect next week.\nThe law will bring some relief, since it will give citizens of the state more control over personal data: we will know what is being collected, where it is sold and even the right to ask for such data to be deleted. It also adds special protections for minors, prohibiting the sale of personal information of those under 16 years old. (Enforcement starts in July, but it is still vulnerable to changes as it rolls out.)\nCalifornia\u2019s law will become the de facto law of the land on privacy until the federal government acts, which is a long way from happening. Promises that bills will be rolled out in the House and Senate came and went this year.\nSome legislators say 2020 will be the year it will all happen, but the record so far is not encouraging. Which is why I\u2019ll opt out of waiting and keep fending off my app stalkers by myself. Only the paranoid survive, for sure, but so do the patient.\nFollow@privacyprojecton Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section onFacebookandInstagram.\n"
