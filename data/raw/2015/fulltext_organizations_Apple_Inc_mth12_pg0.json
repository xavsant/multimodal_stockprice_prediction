        "title": "Apple Executive Seeks a Touch of Chic at Retail Stores",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Angela Ahrendts,Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail, got a private demonstration of the fancy wireless speaker,the Phantom, and its sound quality seven weeks ago. On the spot, she said she wanted the space-pod-like device, which starts at $1,990, to be sold in Apple\u2019s retail stores.\n\u201cShe moved incredibly fast, from our first meeting to figuring out how the Phantom would be displayed,\u201d Quentin Sanni\u00e9, the co-founder of Devialet, the French audio company that makes the white and chrome speaker, said of Ms. Ahrendts.\nThis week, the Phantom will appear in 14 Apple stores in the United States, and the company is discussing how widely to roll out the product next year. The device will get the sort of prominent display treatment that is typically reserved in Apple stores for the company\u2019s Beats audio accessories.\nThe move is an indication of how Ms. Ahrendts,who started at Apple last year, is changing the playbook at some of the company\u2019s stores this holiday season and the direction she\u2019s going in: ultraluxe.\nApple\u2019s stores typically spotlight the company\u2019s devices, with the most expensive audio accessories topping out in the hundreds of dollars. The Phantom is the first high-end non-Apple gadget that Ms. Ahrendts, the former chief executive of the fashion house Burberry, has brought in since she took the job. It buttresses some of her other recent moves to create more of a luxury Apple retail experience, including initiatingprivate try-on appointmentsfor the most expensive Apple watches, reducing the numbers and types of accessories that are sold, and pushing manufacturers to make special packaging for gadgets carried in Apple\u2019s stores.\nMs. Ahrendts \u201cis shaving off some rough edges and completing our sense that the Apple Store is a premium experience,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.\nHer role in bringing in the Phantom also gives a glimpse into how Ms. Ahrendts has been operating within the world\u2019s biggest company.Since joining Apple, the 55-year-old executive has beenrelatively quietpublicly. But she moved swiftly and nearly unilaterally on the Phantom, showing how she can push for the products that will shape the store experience.\nThe products that Apple stores carry are important because they make up the only customer experience that Apple can fully control, Mr. Dawson said. \u201cThe stores are the best physical manifestation of the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cAngela is bringing her sensibility to that experience.\u201d\nApple declined to comment and declined to make Ms. Ahrendts available for an interview. In a public appearance last month at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Ms. Ahrendts said she had been working toward Apple\u2019s stores becoming \u201csleeker and smarter,\u201d as well as unifying Apple\u2019s in-store and online shopping experiences.\nApple has traditionally sold the most expensive accessories online only, like the $2,700B&O BeoPlay A9 MKII speaker. \u201cI asked Tim a very simple question: Why do we do it this way?\u201d she said of her boss,Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Cook told her he did not know, she said.\nMs. Ahrendts\u2019s push will have implications for Apple\u2019s growth. As of September, the company had 463 retail stores worldwide and was focused on expanding in China. The stores account for about 12 percent of Apple\u2019s annual $234 billion in sales, Mr. Dawson estimated. Store revenue rose about 39 percent over the last 12 months, according to eMarketer, with Apple stores generating $5,775 a square foot, or more than any other retailer in the world, beating out Tiffany & Company, Coach and Movado.\nMs. Ahrendts was known at Burberry for revitalizing the brand, pushing the fashion house into online retail ahead of other luxury apparel companies and forging alliances with tech companies like Apple, through which she outfitted Burberry\u2019s corporate staff with iPads. Mr. Cook hired her in 2013 to make sure that Apple\u2019s stores would evolve and expand.\nAt the time, morale had fallen at Apple\u2019s stores, the company\u2019s executiveshave said. Ron Johnson, a former Target executive who became the first head of Apple\u2019s retail stores, departed the company in 2011. After a search, he was replaced by John Browett, who had run the British electronics retailer Dixons. Mr. Browett slashed hours and benefits for Apple Store employees.\nSince coming aboard, Ms. Ahrendts has asked for Apple\u2019s 60,000 retail employees to air their grievances and send suggestions, and she sends them weekly three-minute video updates to improve communication. She has started a program so employees can move to other stores worldwide. Ms. Ahrendts has also overseen the opening of new Apple stores, including 14 in China and Hong Kong. For customers, she reduced Apple\u2019s long lines by creating an online reservation system.\nBy bringing the Phantom to Apple, Ms. Ahrendts is giving the technology crowd something to love as well. Phantom\u2019s parent company, Devialet, is a brand used by tech executives including Tony Fadell, the chief executive of Nest; Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android; and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, said Mr. Sanni\u00e9. He said Mr. Benioff recently introduced Ms. Ahrendts to him and encouraged her to hear the Phantom.\nFor Devialet, moving the Phantom into Apple\u2019s stores is significant. The Paris-based company is known for making amplifiers that can cost as much as $30,000. Until the Apple deal came along, its devices were carried in only a handful of exclusive retailers, including Colette in Paris, Harrods in London and the MoMA store in New York City.\nSince the initial meeting with Ms. Ahrendts, the process of getting the Phantom into Apple\u2019s stores has been smooth, Mr. Sanni\u00e9 said. He and his team have visited almost all of the 14 stores where the speaker will initially be sold to look at display possibilities.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have other global distribution other than the Apple store,\u201d Mr. Sanni\u00e9 said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in another chain because millions go to the Apple store looking for excellence, the very best products. This is the best exposure we could want.\u201d"

        "title": "F.B.I. Chief Says Texas Gunman Used Encryption to Text Overseas Terrorist",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Wednesday that investigators could not read more than 100 text messages exchanged by one of the attackers in ashooting this year in Garland, Tex., because they were encrypted, adding fuel to law enforcement agencies\u2019 contention that they need a way to circumvent commercially available encryption technology.\nMr. Comey, who two months ago appeared to have lost a battle inside the Obama administration over forcing companies like Apple and Google to give investigators a way to decode messages, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that one of the attackers \u201cexchanged 109 messages with an overseas terrorist\u201d the morning of the shooting.\n\u201cWe have no idea what he said because those messages were encrypted,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cAnd to this day, I can\u2019t tell you what he said with that terrorist 109 times the morning of that attack. That is a big problem. We have to grapple with it.\u201d\nThe testimony was the first time Mr. Comey, a longtime critic of the technologies that he contends are creating a \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem for law enforcement agencies, had cited a specific example of a terrorist using encrypted communications. He said he would not comment on whether similar technology was involved in the time before the Paris attacks or the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif.\nIn the Texas shootings, two men armed with rifles and wearing armor opened fire near an exhibit that was showing cartoon images of the Prophet Muhammad. Depictions of the prophet are considered offensive in most interpretations of Islam. The attackers were killed by the police, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility.\nThere is no indication that the F.B.I. saw that such messages were exchanged before the shootings began or recognized that one of the suspects was talking to a foreign terrorist group member \u2014 something that might have been detected even if the authorities could not read the messages themselves.\nThe White House concluded recently that there was merit to the arguments of companies like Apple that it is extremely difficult to create a \u201cback door\u201d for police or intelligence agencies to read such conversations without also creating a breach that Russian, Chinese or other determined hackers could exploit.\nBut Mr. Comey argued in his testimony on Wednesday that the technology companies\u2019 defense of \u201cend-to-end encryption,\u201d in which only specific users of a phone or computer hold the keys, was rooted in business decisions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business model question,\u201d he said. \u201cGood people have made a decision to design products and sell products where court orders are ineffective. And I\u2019m not impugning their motives. I understand they see it as a competitive issue or they think it\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d\nBut he asked if that model could be changed, and \u201cif that can\u2019t be done voluntarily, what are the other alternatives?\u201d\nFor Mr. Comey, whose 10-year term extends well beyond President Obama\u2019s, the recent attacks have provided renewed arguments to pressure technology companies.\nCyrus R. Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, and William J. Bratton, New York City\u2019s police commissioner, have faulted the encryption used by Apple, Facebook and Google for thwarting terrorism investigations.\nBut to many business executives and some technology experts, their accusations seemed premature, because there was little evidence that encryption had been used in the planning of any attacks.\n\u201cIt was fairly clear, months ago, that law enforcement was laying the public relations groundwork to blame encryption for whatever happened to go wrong,\u201d said Paul Kocher, a cryptographer and president of the Rambus Cryptography Research division, who has called for stronger encryption. \u201cBut in a couple cases, they blamed encryption and got it wrong.\u201d\nIn the case of the attacks in Paris last month, there is still no evidence that the attackers used encrypted messages to plot their attacks. In fact, a cellphone belonging to one of the attackers suggested that they had communicated using unencrypted text messages. There is also no evidence that the married couple who waged the attack in a San Bernardino office building last week communicated digitally about the attacks.\nYet it is clear that terrorists are looking for the strongest encryption they can find. In a technology tutorial produced by the Islamic State militant group that was circulated last January, the group offered its members a guide to encrypted messaging apps, pointing out which it believed were \u201csafest,\u201d \u201csafe,\u201d \u201cmoderately safe\u201d and \u201cunsafe,\u201d according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorists\u2019 communications.\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Mr. Vance\u2019s office published a report asking why Apple could not roll back its latest encryption system, which puts the keys to unlock encrypted iPhone communications on the device itself so that Apple cannot unlock the communications for law enforcement even if presented with a court order.\nIn the past, Apple could unlock communications under such circumstances, but the current scheme forces law enforcement agents to go directly to their target to read their communications.\nBut even if Apple rolled back its technology \u2014 which Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, has emphatically insisted will never happen \u2014 it is unclear whether it would make it easier for American law enforcement to track terrorists.\nOf the encrypted mobile apps recommended in the Islamic State tutorial, the top five \u201csafest\u201d encryption schemes recommended by the group were made by companies outside the United States \u2014 in places like Switzerland, where a United States court order would not be enforceable.\n\u201cWe have far more to lose by having our information attacked than gained from weakening everyone\u2019s information security,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. He added that rolling back encryption in those products would only drive terrorists to use other products, or create their own.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t delete encryption software off the Internet or delete all the textbooks telling people how to write it,\u201d Mr. Kocher said."

        "title": "\u2018Steve Jobs\u2019 Flops at Box Office, and Silicon Valley Cheers",
        "fulltext": "The movie \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d had all the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster.\nIt had astarry cast(Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Michael Fassbender). The screenplay was by the acclaimed writer Aaron Sorkin (who also wrote \u201cThe Social Network\u201d). And it received rave reviews (\u201c\u2018Steve Jobs\u2019 is a rich and potent document of the times,\u201dwrote my colleagueA.O. Scott.)\nBut the movie tanked at the box office, earning about $18 million in the seven weeks after its Oct. 9 release. Perhaps Hollywood had overestimated the public\u2019s fascination with the man. Perhaps the film came a couple of years too late or a couple of decades too early. Or perhaps we have Steve Jobs fatigue, after all the books, movies and documentaries on the visionary Apple co-founder.\nBut perhaps most surprising is the way in which Silicon Valley relished in, and contributed to, the film\u2019s demise.\nBefore the film\u2019s release,Ron Conway, a high-tech investor and self-appointed custodian of the technology scene, emailed prominent people in the industry and implored them not to support the film because he thought it portrayed Mr. Jobs in a disrespectful and unflattering light. According to two people who received the email, Mr. Conway went so far as to suggest actual tweets they could use. Mr. Conway did not respond to a request for comment.\nMarc Andreessen, a high-profile venture capitalist known for his voluble Twitter account, followed suit. \u201cThe Steve Jobs \u2018biopic\u2019 is deliberately fabricated nonsense,\u201d hetweeted.\nWhat was also surprising was how veteran technology journalists took issue with the film\u2019s depiction of Mr. Jobs. They attacked the film and its makers like piranha that had just come off a two-week juice cleanse.\nWalt Mossberg, who was a technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal for many years before co-founding ReCode, wrote a 1,400-word column on how Mr. Sorkin \u201cchose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs\u2019 character,\u201d proclaiming over and over that the Steve Jobs portrayed in the film \u201cisn\u2019t the man I knew.\u201d\nSteven Levy, who covered Apple for Newsweek and Rolling Stone, said that the Steve Jobs portrayed wasn\u2019t \u201cthe person I knew.\u201d\nAnd Larry Magid, who covered Apple as a syndicated technology columnist for The San Jose Mercury News, wrote in Forbes that the movie was \u201cnot about the man I knew.\u201d\nIt felt like a contest among high school classmates vying to be the football captain\u2019s best friend.\nHere\u2019s the thing: They didn\u2019t know Steve Jobs. None ofus did. I don\u2019t care if you had a sleepover party at his house once a week while you watched rom-coms and did each other\u2019s nails. Or if he granted you a 15-second interview after one of his product introductions. The reality is, Steve Jobs was trying to sell things, and he was an absolute master at using the media to do that.\nSure, these folks knew a version of Mr. Jobs that he wanted to show, and they knew his products, perhaps better than anyone. But the only people who may have known the true Steve Jobs were his family and a few close friends. And even they had different reactions to the film.\nHis wife, Laurene Powell Jobs,reportedlytried to have the movie killed numerous times and wasunusually publicabout how she disliked the film. And yet his daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, chose tospeak to Mr. Sorkinfor the film, sharing, as Mr. Sorkin said in an interview, \u201cstories about her father that weren\u2019t necessarily flattering.\u201d\nIt seems odd to me that given all the hagiography written about Mr. Jobs and his wonderful gadgets, the tech media would not allow for a more balanced portrayal of their idol.\nMore suspect, still, is how they have downplayed some of Mr. Job\u2019s flaws, including how he had practically disowned his daughter, Lisa, during her formative years.\nMr. Sorkin chose to focus on this aspect in the film, noting that the real Steve Jobs denied his paternity to Lisa, whom he had with his former girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan. Mr. Jobs went asfar as to tellTime magazine that, \u201cTwenty-eight percent of the male population of the United States could be the father,\u201d in reference to Lisa.\n(Despite claiming to \u201cknow\u201d Mr. Jobs after \u201cscores of hours in private conversations,\u201d Mr. Mossberg of ReCode said in his column: \u201cI know very little about his relationship with his daughter Lisa.\u201d)\nPutting aside how well people did or did not know him, the truth is, there will never be a Steve Jobs movie that could ever satisfy the tech media and Apple worshipers.\nIn the same waythey hatedWalter Isaacson\u2019s biography, \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d because it wasn\u2019t a glowing tribute of the man they idolized, they were going to hate \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d the movie, no matter who wrote, directed or starred in it.They hatedthe Ashton Kutcher biopic of Mr. Jobs (I personally agree with them here) andthey hatedthe documentary \u201cThe Man in the Machine\u201d by the Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney.\nEven when people who were close to the real Mr. Jobs offered positive reviews of the movie, like Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple who is depicted in the film by Seth Rogen, Apple fans attacked there, too, saying that Mr. Wozniak\u2019s viewpointshould be disregardedbecause he was paid $200,000 to consult on the film.\nSo when the film was declared a bomb, you could almost hear the venture capitalists and reporters in Silicon Valley breaking out the champagne and patting themselves on the back.\n\u201cAnother wannabe Steve Jobs movie goes into the dustbin of history,\u201d declared the blogPatently Apple. \u201cShould have gone straight to home video,\u201dwrote the blogDaring Fireball, the esoteric authority on all things Apple.\nThat sounds like the Apple faithfuls I know."

        "title": "Apple Pushes Against British Talk of Softening Encryption",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With governments threatening crackdowns on encrypted communications after the jihadist-inspired attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Paris, Apple on Monday pushed back hard, arguing that lawmakers who talk about gaining court-ordered access to iPhone communications do not understand the technology.\n\u201cThe best minds in the world cannot rewrite the laws of mathematics,\u201d the company told the British Parliament, submitting formal comments on aproposed lawthat would require the company to supply a way to break into the iMessage and FaceTime conversations of iPhone users.\n\u201cWe believe it would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat,\u201d Apple wrote.\nApple\u2019s statement came as questions about encryption \u2014 considered an arcane component of cybersecurity just a few months ago \u2014 has become a central issue in the American presidential campaign.\nTwiceinthe past three weeks, Hillary Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, according to polls, has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with Washington to find a way out of their standoff over encrypted communications.\nRepublican candidates have almost all called for giving intelligence and law enforcement agencies the kind of access to text messages and data stored on cellphones that they have long enjoyed with telecommunications providers, like AT&T and Verizon. Congress is calling for hearings, and there is talk of legislation, though it seems unlikely to include the kind of demands for access that Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, advocates.\nThe arguments made by Apple are not new, but the political context is. In the aftermath of the two most recent terrorist attacks, the political pendulum has swung away from protecting privacy \u2014 the direction Europe was moving after Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, leaked classified documents on government surveillance \u2014 and more toward law enforcement.\nThe technology companies argue that although the political winds may be changing, the technological challenge has not: To create an opening for government investigators is to also create a vulnerability that Chinese, Iranian, Russian or North Korean hackers could exploit.\nMrs. Clinton rejected that argument recently, arguing that if the companies wanted to put their best minds to the problem, they would solve it.\nBut in the British filing, and in aninterviewon \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, argued that politicians calling for such access do not understand the damage they would cause.\nSo far, Mr. Cook still has a partial ally in President Obama. The White House determined in October that, despite a recommendation from the F.B.I. to put forward legislation requiring access to encrypted communications, it would not seek legal changes. That rankled the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who has long warned about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem, andoffered up evidencea week ago that an attack in Texas this year had been plotted over encrypted text messages, which he said investigators still could not crack.\nApple pushed back on Mr. Comey\u2019s arguments in its submission to the British government. \u201cSome would portray this as an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement,\u201d it wrote. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. Law enforcement today has access to more data \u2014 data which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justice \u2014 than ever before in the history of our world.\u201d\nThat data, many experts say, includes phone \u201cmetadata\u201d about who is calling whom, GPS coordinates for individuals, and access to unencrypted data stored on so-called cloud services. But the arguments in Britain and the United States have focused largely on systems designed by Apple and its competitors, including Google and Microsoft, that automatically encrypt data exchanges, and put the keys to those communications into the hands of the users, not the companies.\nApple contended that if Britain went ahead with its legal changes, the company, and its competitors, may find themselves violating American laws to comply with British law \u2014 or vice versa. \u201cThis would immobilize substantial portions of the tech sector and spark serious international conflicts,\u201d it argued."

        "title": "Below the Line: Scoring \u2018Steve Jobs\u2019",
        "fulltext": "What should the soundtrack be to the life of a tech visionary? In the Danny Boyle film \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d there is no simple answer. The film captures the life of the co-founder of Apple in an unusual way, focusing on three product launches during Mr. Jobs\u2019s career, in 1984, 1989 and 1998. We stay behind the scenes at these launches, with the tensions and emotional beats of the movie played out in hallways and dressing rooms. And the score, by Daniel Pemberton, aims to capture Mr. Jobs\u2019s mood as well as set up the stakes of his involvement with Apple and beyond.\nMr. Pemberton, who also scored this year\u2019s big-screen adaptation of the television series \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\u201d joined \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d before shooting began and discussed with Mr. Boyle the idea of dividing the score into three styles to capture the film\u2019s three-act structure. The first act would represent Mr. Jobs\u2019s vision of the future. The second act (which takes place after Mr. Jobs has been removed from Apple and as he is trying to get his own computer company off the ground) would be tied to revenge \u00e0 la Shakespearean tragedy. And the third act would represent wisdom as Mr. Jobs learns more about himself and understands the heights that computers could reach.\n1984\nFor this section, Mr. Pemberton had the idea to compose the score using only equipment from 1984, \u201cwhich was a nightmare,\u201d he said in an interview. The year was seen as one of optimism at what technology could bring. \u201cA computer at that time felt quite futuristic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it felt like the synthesizer was a very good way to capture that feeling.\u201d\nHe used a collection of synthesizers from the period (like a Yamaha CS-80, which Vangelis used for the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d soundtrack) and had to write the score in a way that would incorporate their benefits and limitations. One of those limitations was that the equipment couldn\u2019t save the settings for specific sounds. Mr. Pemberton had to photograph the settings so he would know how to reset them for the recording.\n\u201cThe music of the first act is quite simple, but the sounds are hopefully evocative of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can replicate that now digitally, but there\u2019s something about using the original equipment that has a different sound.\u201d\nAnother synth, the Roland SH-1000, had an unstable sound quality that he appreciated. \u201cIf the heating\u2019s on, it goes out of tune,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what gives it this evocative feeling. We think technology is so binary, but it\u2019s not. There are still these weird variables.\u201d\n1989\n\u201cIn the beginning of the film, we used old technology,\u201d Mr. Pemberton said, \u201cand then in the second act we used the oldest computer of all time, the orchestra.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWe had the notion of trying to write an opera for the second act. It felt like one of those ideas that was either going to be really brilliant or totally disastrous.\u201d\nHe wrote several different pieces as options. \u201cSome of them we found were too dramatic and would fight too much with the dialogue,\u201d he said. They settled on a couple of pieces that had a great sense of momentum. It can be felt in \u201cThe Circus of Machines I,\u201d with its strong but familiar classical feel. The music serves as a backdrop to Aaron Sorkin\u2019s dialogue, which Mr. Pemberton sees as the libretto in a way.\n\u201cThe most important thing in this film is the dialogue,\u201d Mr. Pemberton said. \u201cYou have to give that respect and space. The first time I read the script, I remember thinking, this is amazing. But what am I gonna do? Where can I put any music?\u201d\nBut Mr. Pemberton said scoring the film with an opera style turned out to be effective in changing the mood of the second act and allowing for a different perspective on Mr. Jobs\u2019s personality.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a showmanship side of him which I think this score reflects pretty well.\u201d\n1998\nWhen the film reaches this year, the computer now does what it promised it would do in 1984, so Mr. Pemberton decided to do something he called \u201cin the box,\u201d which was trying to compose and construct as much of the score for this act in the computer.\n\u201cI wanted to embrace where technology was by this stage,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pemberton saw the third act as more introspective. He composed pieces with more internal sound design using software and plug-in synthesizers. A digitally peppy sound comes through in \u201c1998. The New Mac,\u201d a piece that announces the changing times. But as the work progressed, Mr. Pemberton discussed with Mr. Boyle the idea of taking some bits of composition from the first act and enhancing them for the third. \u201cThe purity of the three-act structure got remixed a bit,\u201d Mr. Pemberton said. \u201cThe most important thing for us was telling the story most effectively.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Applehas won an exclusive streaming deal withTaylor Swiftto show a concert film from her world tour.\nOn Sunday, Apple and Ms. Swift announced that subscribers of the company\u2019s new streaming service, Apple Music, would have access to a film directed by Jonas Akerlund that was taped two weeks ago at Ms. Swift\u2019s show at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia. The film, which will become available next Sunday, includes backstage scenes as well as those of the many musical guests she brought onstage throughout the tour.\nMs. Swift\u2019s tour for her latest album, \u201c1989,\u201d finished its worldwide run on Saturday. It had more than $240 million in gross ticket sales, according to Pollstar, a trade publication that tracks concert data.\nThe deal deepens the ties between Apple and Ms. Swift, who in June wrote a blog post criticizing the company over its plan not to pay music royalties during free trials of Apple Music. Within hours of her post, Applereversed courseon the royalties, and later Apple Music became the only streaming outlet to offer \u201c1989.\u201d\nOn Monday, Beats 1, Apple\u2019s Internet radio station, will also broadcast an interview with Ms. Swift conducted byZane Lowe, the influential BBC D.J. who joined Apple this year to lead the station.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. But it follows other arrangements that Apple has struck with star musicians to publicize Apple Music and produce programming for its service. The rapper Drake and the producer Pharrell Williams have been involved with Apple Music since its introduction in June, and last month Apple introduced a television commercial featuring the country singerKenny Chesney.\nEver the skilled promoter, Ms. Swift announced the deal on Sunday, her 26th birthday, on her Twitter account. \u201cThank you so much for all the birthday wishes,\u201dshe wrote. \u201cI have a little surprise for you.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.How do you turn on the split-screen mode in the new Mac system?\nA.Apple\u2019sOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) softwareincludes aSplit Viewfeature that lets you quickly and evenly divide the screen between two programs. When you use the Split View feature, you don\u2019t have to fuss with window sizes or placement, or have other open windows distract you. (A similar version of the multitasking featureis also available for some iPad models running iOS 9.)\nTo jump into the Split View mode, select the open window of the first program you want to use and in the upper-left corner, click and hold the green button; Apple also calls this the \u201cfull-screen button.\u201d If nothing happens when you press down on the green button, open the Mac\u2019s System Preferences from the Apple menu or Dock icon, click Mission Control and make sure the setting for \u201cDisplays have separate Spaces\u201d is enabled. (Keep in mind that not all programs support Split View, including some older versions of Microsoft Word.)\nThe window shrinks while you hold down the mouse button or trackpad. Drag the shrunken window to the side of the screen you prefer and let go of the mouse button or trackpad. Next, in the desktop half of your screen, click another window to have it pop up and fill the other half of the screen next to the first program you chose. You can now see both program windows filling the screen and switch back and forth between them by clicking.\nIf you already had one program open in the full-screen view, you can go to the Split View by openingMission Control; click the Mission Control icon in the Dock or press the designated Mission Control key on an Apple keyboard. When the Mission Control view is open, drag the window of an open program onto the thumbnail of the program open in full-screen mode.\nTo get out of the Split View mode, click the green button on one of the windows to go back to the standard Mac desktop mode. You can also press the Mac\u2019s Escape (Esc) key."

        "title": "With Taps on the Wrist, Apple Watch Points to the Future",
        "fulltext": "THERE was never any doubt that I would buy anAppleWatch on the day it was released. I\u2019m a White House correspondent for The New York Times, but I\u2019m also that early-adopter guy.\nBuying the watch has led to the inevitable questions from friends and family: \u201cWhat do you think? Should I get one of those?\u201d\nMy search for an answer reminds me of a similar period nearly a decade ago, in the months after I stood in line for several hours at an Apple Store in Arlington, Va., to be among the first to spend $599 on the originaliPhone. The Apple employees cheered as I emerged with the phone.\nThe next day, I was on a Southwest flight to New Hampshire to coverFred Thompson, the late actor and senator, who was then running for president. As I sat in my aisle seat, playing with the phone, a crowd formed. First the flight attendants. Then passengers. They all wanted to see the crazy new device in action.\nBut back then, it was hard to recommend to my fellow reporters on the campaign trail that they ditch their BlackBerrys. The iPhone\u2019s on-screen keyboard made typing a clunky business. The phone couldn\u2019t connect with most workplace email systems. Cell service (limited to AT&T) was slow and flaky at best. Battery life was short. There was no App Store. The iPhone didn\u2019t even have a \u201ccut and paste\u201d feature.\nThere was just a sense \u2014 largely unrealized at the time \u2014 that somehow this device was the future, while using my thumb to scroll through a black-and-white list of emails on my BlackBerry was the past. Surfing the web, reading email, listening to music, checking the weather and stocks \u2014 all on one device. It was revolutionary.\nWhen colleagues asked, I was honest about the limitations even as I gushed about the technological potential. Most of my friends listened politely, tried to type on the screen with their thumbs, and then stuck with the BlackBerry.\nThe watch feels as if it is at a similar place.\nFor the same $599, which gets you a model with a 42-millimeter stainless-steel case, the Apple Watch is a slave to a user\u2019s iPhone, relying on the larger device for processing and communications. It has no GPS or cellular capability. It can run apps, but slowly. And without any keyboard, it requires voice dictation, which is still far from perfect. In most cases, opening an app on the iPhone is still a far better experience.\nLike the original iPhone, the watch also feels like a physical compromise. The case is bigger and bulkier than the ideal device you would want to strap to your wrist. And while battery life is amazing for a device this small \u2014 routinely almost 24 hours on a single charge \u2014 it still requires that I remember to pop the watch onto a charger every night.\nAnd yet, after almost eight months, the Apple Watch feels like the future to me.\nMore than anything else, the watch has changed the way I communicate via email and text messages. Using Apple\u2019s VIP feature, I direct all of the most important messages to my watch, which alerts me with a subtle tap on my wrist or a soft ding. I ignore most after a quick glance. (Sorry, Mom.) Many get a quick \u201cO.K.\u201d or \u201cSounds good.\u201d I pull out my phone only for the ones I need to respond to at length.\nThe same is true for phone calls, which appear on my watch while my phone remains tucked away in my pocket, or still at my desk on the other side of the office. It\u2019s like Caller ID for my wrist.\nThe watch has also become my first stop for personal scheduling. I use it to check the weather (the current temperature is right there on the watch face) and to see at a glance what my next appointment is. My OpenTable app taps my wrist when a restaurant reservation is coming up. The eBay app lets me know when I\u2019ve won, or lost, an auction \u2014 no phone required. Tracking deliveries is effortless.\nBy far, the most futuristic achievement on the watch is Apple Pay, which works flawlessly. Buy something, double-click the button on the watch and wave it next to the cash register. Ding. It\u2019s like magic \u2014 where it is accepted. But because that\u2019s a very limited universe of retail stores and restaurants, I still have to carry around my wallet, full of credit cards.\nA few apps have become second nature now. I regularly use the watch\u2019s timer when I cook: \u201cSiri, set a timer for 45 minutes.\u201d My boarding passes are now on my watch, which means I don\u2019t have to fumble for my phone in theairport securityline. When I record the White House press secretary during anAir Force Onegaggle, I don\u2019t have to hold my iPhone close to his mouth. I just hold up my wrist. (It looks kind of funny, but works well.) Changing the temperature of my Nest thermostats at home is easier on my watch than on my phone.\nSo what\u2019s the answer? Should you buy an Apple Watch now?\nI\u2019m tempted to say \u201cno\u201d for most people. Most of what it does, your phone already does better. And the Apple Watch, even with recent sales, is pricier than competing smartwatches that do similar things. By that logic, you should wait until next year, when Apple\u2019s relentless drive to innovate will have improved the watch\u2019s hardware and software. Or wait until 2019, when the fifth generation of the device has unimagined new features.\nBut after eight months, I\u2019m convinced that people will eventually view a smartwatch as an essential purchase. And waiting endlessly for the \u201cnext great thing\u201d means missing out on all the small ways that the watch already can improve your life. So unless you want to be one of those people who hang on to their BlackBerrys forever, go ahead and get one. You won\u2019t regret it."

        "title": "Boston Consulting\u2019s Most Innovative Companies: Lessons From a Decade of Ranking",
        "fulltext": "Innovation is an essential yet elusive ingredient in corporate success, and one that is notoriously difficult to measure.\nBut for the past decade, the Boston Consulting Group has picked up the challenge, publishing a ranking of the 50 most innovative companies in the world and an accompanying analysis of successful innovators. The 2015\n                                        ranking and report,published on Wednesday, shows the top two companies,AppleandGoogle,\n                                        are the same pair as last year.\nAmerican corporations account for six of the top 10. In addition to Apple and Google, they are Tesla (ranked third),Microsoft(fourth),Gilead Sciences(eighth) andAmazon(ninth). But the company that has climbed the most since last year, up 35 places to the 12th spot, is the Chinese company Tencent.\nTechnology companies occupy the most slots at the top of the list, but car companies are a rising presence. Besides Tesla, the top auto innovators includeToyota(sixth),BMW(seventh) and Daimler (10th). The automotive ascent on the list has been evident for the last three years, said Andrew Taylor, a senior partner at Boston\n                                        Consulting Group and co-author of the report.\n\u201cCars have become delivery systems for technology,\u201d Mr. Taylor explained, including hybrid and electric power systems, driver-assisting safety features, heads-up displays and touch screens for entertainment\n                                        and information. \u201cThe amount of consumer-facing technology is incredible compared with five years ago,\u201d he added.\nThe rankings are determined largely by a survey of 1,500 chief executives and senior executives worldwide. They are asked what companies in their own industry and in general they consider most innovative. They can\u2019t\n                                        name their own company. The rest of the ranking formula, 40 percent, is based on a company\u2019s total return to shareholders over five years.\nBut the ranking questions are only a few of the dozens included in the annual survey. The Boston Consulting Group report is grounded mainly in answers to the wider set of responses, supplemented by the management consultant\u2019s\n                                        other research.\nReading the report, two themes seem most prominent: speed and technology. The executives were asked which of more than a dozen \u201careas of innovation, research and development or product development will have the\n                                        most impact on your industry over the next three to five years?\u201d The top three choices were \u201cspeed of adopting new technology,\u201d \u201cbig-data analytics\u201d and \u201ctechnology platforms.\u201d\nIn the survey and in follow-up interviews with executives, Mr. Taylor said, \u201cThe word that keeps coming up is speed\u201d \u2014 accelerating traditional innovation processes to rapidly develop products and\n                                        experiment with ideas.\nTechnology, Mr. Taylor noted, opens the door to faster innovation \u2014 as even industrial companies, for example, use sensors and software to build more intelligence and flexibility into their products. And techniques\n                                        originally employed by software engineers, like agile programming and quickly building prototypes and testing them on customers, are being embraced in many industries. \u201cIt\u2019s all about learning fast,\u201d\n                                        Mr. Taylor said.\nHowever achieved, innovation seems to be increasingly valued by senior executives. This year, 79 percent replied that innovation was either their company\u2019s top priority or among the top three. That is the highest\n                                        percentage since the survey began in 2005, when the innovation priority share was 66 percent.\nHave they just browbeaten by the term over the years, so that nearly everyone would say yes? That is not the explanation Mr. Taylor offered.\nInstead, he suggested that so many of the other steps to create higher corporate value \u2014 like acquisitions, cost-cutting and outsourcing, restructuring and financial engineering \u2014 have run their course\n                                        at many major companies. \u201cAs the toolkit gets narrower, innovation rises to the top,\u201d he said. And Wall Street investors, he added, bid up the shares of companies that produce strong organic growth\n                                        through innovation, like Apple and Google."
