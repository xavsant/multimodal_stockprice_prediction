        "fulltext": "A decade ago, Apple\u2019s iPhone helped make a music-tech star out of Shazam, the app that, almost like magic, could identify a song just by hearing a few seconds of it.\nNow, Shazam is about to become the property of Apple.\nThe tech giant is close to to acquiring Shazam, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it. News of the deal was first reported byTechCrunch.\nThe price was not known, but was expected to be far less than the $1 billion that Shazam was valued at in its most recent fund-raising round in 2015. Over the years, Shazam has been a frequent subject of speculation about aninitial public offering.\nA spokesman for Apple declined to comment, and representatives of Shazam could not be immediately reached.\nShazam\u2019s technology was introduced in 2002 as a dial-up service that would listen to a song for 30 seconds and send its user a text message identifying it. It eventually became one of themost popularmobile apps on Apple\u2019s App Store.\nIt even became a hit with music executives, who consulted it to see how listeners were responding to new songs, and used its maps feature to see whether that new track was doing better in, say, Buffalo or Detroit.\nShazam has lost some of its shine to newer services like Spotify and Snapchat, but remains a popular feature. Last year, the company said that it had surpassed abillion mobile downloadsand was used by \u201chundreds of millions of people each month.\u201d\nIn 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses."

        "title": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care",
        "fulltext": "When Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.\nPeople often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\nIntrigued, Mr. Poston, who already owned an Apple Watch, registered for the heart study right away. Thenhe took to Twitterto encourage others to do likewise \u2014 suggesting that it was part of a breakthrough in health care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201d\nApple, Google, Microsoft and other tech giants have transformed the way billions of us communicate, shop, socialize and work. Now, as consumers, medical centers and insurers increasingly embrace health-tracking apps, tech companies want a bigger share of themore than $3 trillionspent annually on health care in the United States, too. TheApple Heart Studyreflects that intensified effort.\nThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.\nIn the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.\nEach tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.\n\u201cThe big-picture reason that a lot of these tech companies are getting into health care now is because the market is too big, too important and much too personal to their users for them to ignore,\u201d saidJohn Prendergass, associate director of health care investment at Ben Franklin Technology Partners, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia.\nPhysicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of hype,\u201d saidDr. Eric Topol,a digital medicine expert who directs the Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of learning these tools: Who do they help? Who do they not help? Who do they provide just angst, anxiety, false positives?\u201d\nThe tech industry is certainly no stranger to health.IBM,IntelandMicrosofthave long provided enterprise services to the health care industry.\nBut now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\nThis year, Amazon was one of the investors in afinancing round for Grail, a cancer-detection start-up, which raised more than $900 million.Apple acquired Beddit, a maker of sleep-tracking technology, for an undisclosed amount.\nAnd Alphabet, perhaps the most active American consumer tech giant in health and biotech, acquiredSenosis Health, a developer of apps that use smartphone sensors to monitor certain health signals, also for an undisclosed amount.\nAlphabet also has a research unit,Verily Life Sciences, dedicated to developing new tools to collect and analyze health data.\nThis year, Verily introduced a health research device, theVerily Study Watch, with sensors that can collect data on heart rate, gait and skin temperature. Now, the watch is to be used in a research study, called Project Baseline and financed by Verily, to follow about 10,000 volunteers.\nParticipants in theProject Baselinestudy will also be asked to use sleep sensors in their beds, and to have blood,genetic and mental health tests. Using data analytics and machine learning, researchers hope to get a more detailed picture of the progression of diseases like cancer.\n\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.\nApple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\n\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.\nIn 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.\nDr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\n\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.\nStanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.\nIf the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.\nMicrosoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.\nThis year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\nAs part of the effort, Microsoftworked with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centerto develop digital services intended to reduce drudgery for physicians and improve patients\u2019 experiences. One project involves a virtual assistant that would take notes on conversations between a doctor and a patient, analyze the conversation and then send a summary to the patient\u2019s electronic medical record. The medical center is also pilot-testing an app that notifies doctors when one of their patients has filled a prescription at a U.P.M.C. pharmacy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.\nFacebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.\nLast year, Facebook made it more appealing for pharmaceutical companies to advertise their medicines on the platform by introducing arolling scrollfeature where drug makers can list their drug\u2019s side effects in an ad. Such riskdisclosures are requiredby federal drug marketing rules.\nAnd this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.\nAmazon has been less public about its plans in health. But industry analysts have speculated that Amazon couldenter the pharmacy business.\nDr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201d"

        "title": "Is Apple Slowing Down Old iPhones? Questions and Answers",
        "fulltext": "For years, some consumers have suspected Apple of a nefarious plot: The company, they said, was slowing down their older iPhones to get them to buy new ones. Now, many of them feel vindicated.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Apple said that it had released a \u201cfeature\u201d that occasionally reduces processing power on older devices to prevent them from unexpectedly shutting down. The reduction, Apple said, was necessary because older batteries could otherwise periodically overload. The statement came after reports onRedditandGeekbenchwere picked up by technology news sites.\nSome users saw the announcement as proof that the company had engaged in \u201cplanned obsolescence,\u201d a scheme to degrade the old devices to force users to upgrade. Others felt betrayed. And still others were simply confused.\nHere is a Q. and A. with Brian X. Chen, the lead consumer technology writer for The New York Times, about what the announcement really means.\nCan you translate? Is Apple saying that it intentionally slows down older iPhones as new ones are released?\nWhat Apple is acknowledging is a power management technique in which the iPhone scales back processing power to keep the device running for longer when its battery health is low. Lithium ion batteries have a limited number of charge \u201ccycles\u201d before they can no longer be recharged properly. Apple\u2019swebsitesays the battery loses about 20 percent of its original capacity after 500 charge cycles.\nIn other words, if your iPhone is beginning to run out of battery capacity, these slowdowns might kick in to keep it running for longer or prevent it from shutting down unexpectedly.\nApple is not admitting to planned obsolescence. If Apple explicitly said that they injected code into older iPhones to slow them down because new ones came out, that would be admission. All it is admitting to now is trying to keep the old iPhones running for longer.\nDoes this changeyour conclusion last monththat this is not a conspiracy to force users to buy new phones?\nThe premise of my previous column was that the vast majority ofslowdown problems are fixablewithout buying a new phone. That point stands, and now we have even more information supporting that premise: a battery replacement also helps.\nHow many users does this affect?\nApple has said the power management technique works on iPhone 6, 6S, SE and 7.\nWhat else could be slowing the older phones down?\nOften, a buggy operating system upgrade can cause glitches when running apps. Another common cause is having little available device storage. Smartphones rely on flash storage, which keeps data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When stored, that data is scattered across the drive. So when you call it up by opening an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.\nSome users say that installing bigger batteries seems to fix the problem. Does that make sense? What else can users do to, short of buying new phones?\nI would recommend paying a third-party repair shop to replace the aged battery with a fresh one. This will cost between $20 and $70, depending on where you live and which iPhone you own. Repair shops will probably recommend against installing a battery that has a larger capacity than the original, as there can be risks of damage.\nThe other solutions I wrote about in my last column included doing a clean install of the operating system and freeing up storage on the device. There is a scenario where you absolutely can\u2019t get around buying a new phone: App and game makers design their software to work better on newer, faster devices. So if you have an older smartphone and you want a brand-new game with heavy graphics to work as well as it possibly could, you\u2019ll want a new phone.\nIs this unusual? Do other smartphone makers \u2014 or, more broadly, electronics companies \u2014 do this, too?\nI don\u2019t find the power management technique that surprising or unusual. You have probably noticed that when your smartphone (iPhone or Android) is running out of battery, like when there is less than 10 percent, the device begins to run more slowly. That is partly to keep it running for longer.\nCould Apple have avoided this by, say, using a different type of battery?\nWe all dream about the day that the tech industry will adopt a longer-lasting,smarter batterythan lithium ion. But battery technologies have to pass rigorous safety testing \u2014 if something goes wrong, they are miniature bombs. (You saw what happened with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7.)Lithium ion, though flawed, is still the safest and most easily reproducible battery technology on the market.\nApple is known for its masterful marketing. Do you think it has handled this controversy well?\nNo, it could have avoided controversy by being more transparent to begin with. It could have notified people that a power management mode was kicking in to keep their iPhones running for longer because their batteries are running out of juice. That would also inform people that they should be getting their batteries replaced. Because Apple was not transparent, it\u2019s natural for people to suspect it of deliberately crippling their devices to get them to buy new ones.\nThis episode is a good reminder that even digital devices need maintenance. Many people believe that because gadgets lack moving parts, they should keep working as intended. But we still need to take care of them. Last year I wrote a column aboutmaintaining our devices, which included tips like replacing aging batteries, freeing up storage and, in the case of desktop computers, removing the cover and blowing out dust.\n[Want more advice and tips on the technology changing how you live?Sign up for the Bits Newsletter here.]"

        "fulltext": "As the streaming wars begin to heat up, Apple has picked up its third TV show in two months.\nThe latest is a space drama from Ronald D. Moore, the executive producer behind audience favorites like the rebooted \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cOutlander.\u201d\nLast month, Apple secured thehighly sought-after rightsto a project about a morning TV show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. For its first acquisition, in October, itordered up a revivalof Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1980s anthology series, \u201cAmazing Stories.\u201d\nIt will probably be at least a year before any of these shows are available to be viewed, and it is still not clear how they will be distributed to customers. But the eagerness of Apple to add shows to its developing slate is further proof of how intense thecompetition for content has become.\nOn Thursday, Disney announced thatit was acquiring21st Century Fox in an effort to bolster its own ambitious streaming plan. Netflix, the leader of the streaming pack, has said it plans to spend up to $8 billion on content next year. Apple hasroughly $1 billion to spendon original programming.\nThere is no title for Mr. Moore\u2019s project, but he has a strong track record. His \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d was a critically acclaimed reboot of the schlocky 1970s show, and \u201cOutlander\u201d has been a consistent hit for the cable network Starz. Mr. Moore cut his teeth as a producer on series like \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d and \u201cStar Trek: Deep Space Nine.\u201d\nThe show will be produced by Sony and Mr. Moore\u2019s production company, Tall Ship Productions.

        "title": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet",
        "fulltext": "Proteststo preserve net neutrality, or rules that ensure equal access to the internet, migrated online on Tuesday, with numerous online companies posting calls on their sites for action to stop a vote later this week.\nReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.\nBut the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\nHarold Feld, a senior vice president atPublic Knowledge, a nonprofit group that supports net neutrality, said the biggest tech companies were less vocal because they were facing more regulatory battles than in past years. Social media sites have been criticized for allowing foreign actors to interfere in the presidential election of 2016. The biggest tech companies also face complaints from some lawmakers that they have become too large and powerful.\n\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\n\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.\nThere also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.\nBut consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.\nHere is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.\nGoogle has kept a pretty low profile in the recent net neutrality debate. The company issued a statement last month when the proposed changes were announced, saying that the current rules were \u201cworking well\u201d and that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the new proposal. But for the most part, the company has been working withinthe Internet Association, an industry group that includes Facebook, Amazon and other large online companies.\nIt\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.\nApple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.\nApple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\n\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201d\nDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.\nBut the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.\nThis week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\n\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201d\nMicrosoftsent a 23-page letterto the commission later in July outlining the company\u2019s argument that the commission should not change its stance on net neutrality. \u201cNow is not the time for the commission to abandon 15 years of progress toward protecting the economic future of our country,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNow is not the time for the commission to abandon its open internet rules.\u201d\nThe company has otherwise kept a relatively low profile on the issue. On Nov. 28, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer,tweetedthat \u201cMicrosoft believes in preserving the open internet & opposes weakening net neutrality protections.\u201d\nAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\n\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\n\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.\nNetflix, once among the most vocal of net neutrality boosters, is perhaps the most conspicuous in its relative silence. In recent months, the company\u2019s chief executive,Reed Hastings, has saidnet neutrality is no longer the company\u2019s \u201cprimary battle,\u201d partly because Netflix is now large enough that it can secure the deals it needs with internet access providers to ensure its service is delivered smoothly to customers.\nOn Nov. 21, the companyposted a noteon its primary Twitter account in support of net neutrality.\nOne Twitter userrespondedby saying the company should do more \u201cto tell people how it will potentially affect them.\u201d\nJonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions."

        "title": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami",
        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!\nBut don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.\nFortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.\nWait, how would that work?\nThe above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.\nTo those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.\nThese giants will see immediate and broad benefits from the tax bill. Multinational corporations with a lot of money parked offshore \u2014 Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet collectively hold abouta half-trillion in cash\u2014 get a windfall from the bill. Under the new plan, offshore cash will be taxed at a one-time rate of 15.5 percent, a substantial break from the 35 percent the companies would have had to pay if they\u2019d brought the money back to the United States under current law.\nThere has been some debate aboutwhether the bill might actually hurt tech giants in the long run, because it introduces a 10.5 percent tax on future foreign profits, thus reducing some of the benefits of theoffshoreaccounting wizardrythese companies have engaged in over the last decade.\nBut Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201d\nApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.\nBut some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\n\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201d\nThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.\nAmong other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.\nJed Kolko, the chief economist of the job-search site Indeed.com, said technology is changing work in a few ways.First, it\u2019s altering the type of work that people do\u2014 for instance, creating a boom in e-commerce warehouse jobs in large metro areas while reducing opportunities for retail workers in rural areas. Technology has also created more uncertainty around when people work and how much they\u2019ll get paid. This happens in gig jobs like ride-hailing, but also at fast-food restaurants that use scheduling software, which gives workersunpredictable hoursand little chance to live life outside work.\nIn the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.\nBut the Republican plan largely ignores these issues \u2014 even though economists and techies have lately become more interested in policy fixes for many of the economic problems arising from tech. For instance, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,has said that Apple has a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201dto look out for job growth in America. Some tech luminaries havebecome obsessed with the idea of universal basic income\u2014 giving a paycheck to everyone to stave off trouble if the robots do take over. There\u2019s rising interest in new models forunemployment insurance, skills training and other policies that address short-term job displacement caused by tech.\nAnd United States Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents a portion of Silicon Valley \u2014 he won his seat last year with the support of a number of tech bigwigs \u2014has outlined a plan for vastly expanding the earned-income tax creditto support those left behind by the tech boom. The plan aims to compensate the bottom 20 percent of earners for economic stagnation going back to the late 1970s.\n\u201cAnyone who could earn $12,000 a year driving part time for Uber would get a matching $12,000 from the government,\u201d Mr. Ferenstein, who was involved in crafting Representative Khanna\u2019s plan,wrote recently.\nIt\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.\nIn other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami."

        "title": "Freed From the iPhone, the Apple Watch Finds a Medical Purpose",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the last months of Steve Jobs\u2019s life, the Apple co-founder fought cancer while managing diabetes.\nBecause he hated pricking his finger to draw blood, Mr. Jobs authorized an Apple research team to develop a noninvasive glucose reader with technology that could potentially be incorporated into a wristwatch, according to people familiar with the events, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.\nIt was one ofmany medical applications that Apple consideredfor the Apple Watch, which debuted in 2015. Yet because many of the health features proved unreliable or required too many compromises in the watch\u2019s size or battery life, Apple ended up positioning the device for activity tracking and notifications instead.\nNow, the Apple Watch is finding a medical purpose after all.\nIn September, Apple announced that the Apple Watch would no longer need to be tethered to a smartphone and would becomemore of a stand-alone device. Since then, a wave of device manufacturers have tapped into the watch\u2019s new features like cellular connectivity to develop medical accessories \u2014 such as an electrocardiogram for monitoring heart activity \u2014 so people can manage chronic conditions straight from their wrist.\nWhat\u2019s happening with the Apple Watch is one of the first signs of a leap forward in the utility of wearable devices. Many people had wondered why they would need a smart watch at all when most already carried more powerful smartphones with them. But as the Apple Watch becomes capable of handling more medical tasks on its own, they may now have an answer.\n\u201cThis is an important step in the evolution of wearables,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, an advisory and research firm. \u201cThe Apple Watch can now be on you all the time doing this type of medical monitoring.\u201d\nThe Apple Watch has dominated competitors in the nascent smart watch market, but it has not taken a place alongside the iPod, iPhone and iPad as the next breakthrough Apple product. Apple does not disclose specific sales numbers for the watch, but the company has said its sales have risen 50 percent compared with a year earlier for three straight quarters. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment further.\nA digital health revolution has been predicted for years, of course, and so far has been more hype than progress. But the hope is that artificial intelligence systems will sift through the vast amounts of data that medical accessories will collect from the Apple Watch and find patterns that can lead to changes in treatment and detection, enabling people to take more control of how they manage their conditions instead of relying solely on doctors.\nVic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, a start-up that makes portable electrocardiograms, said this would put patients on a more equal footing with doctors because they would have more information on their own conditions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing the nature of the relationship between patient and doctor,\u201d he said, adding that doctors will no longer be \u201chigh priests.\u201d\nLast month, AliveCorintroduced a band for the Apple Watchwith a built-in electrocardiogram, or EKG, to detect irregular heart activity such as atrial fibrillation, a form of arrhythmia and a potential cause of a stroke. AliveCor uses the watch\u2019s heart rate monitor to alert patients to take an EKG when their pulse quickens or slows unexpectedly.\nThe band, known as the KardiaBand, was the first Apple Watch accessory approved by the Food and Drug Administration. When a thumb is placed on the band\u2019s sensor, EKG readings are taken in 30 seconds and sent wirelessly to the patient\u2019s cardiologist. That helps resolve one of the biggest headaches in detecting atrial fibrillation \u2014 catching it during an episode so a cardiologist can properly assess it.\nElena Remus, 36, a digital marketing consultant from Alameda, Calif., has experienced what the KardiaBand can do. She had suffered heart palpitations on and off for the last five years, but there was little her doctors could do because they were never able to catch the incidents in real time.\nShortly after buying a KardiaBand for her Apple Watch a few weeks ago, Ms. Remus felt the onset of palpitations as she was making morning coffee. She looked down at her watch and saw that her normal heart rate of around 75 beats a minute had surged to 205 beats a minute. She started taking an EKG reading on her wrist and was finally able to record the activity, allowing her doctor to diagnose her condition as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia \u2014 or in nonmedical speak, an abnormally fast heart rhythm \u2014 and plan a course of treatment.\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to pass out at home alone,\u201d Ms. Remus said.\nApple is also looking for its own medical breakthroughs. Last month, the company announceda joint research studywith the Stanford University School of Medicine to see whether the Apple Watch\u2019s heart rate sensors could detect irregular heart activity without an electrocardiogram to notify people who might be experiencing atrial fibrillation.\nApple is also looking at potentially building an electrocardiogram into future models of the Apple Watch, according to a person familiar with the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential. It is unclear whether the EKG development, earlierreported by Bloomberg, would be introduced; such a product would most likely require F.D.A. clearance.\nSeparately, Apple is continuing research on a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, according to two people with knowledge of the project. The technology is still considered to be years away, industry experts said.\nThe current solution used by many diabetics is also coming to the Apple Watch. Dexcom, a maker of devices measuring blood sugar levels for diabetics, said it was awaiting F.D.A. approval for a continuous glucose monitor to work directly with the Apple Watch. Continuous glucose monitors use small sensors to pierce the skin to track blood sugar levels and relay those readings through a wireless transmitter.\nKevin Sayer, Dexcom\u2019s chief executive, said that patients could opt for a monitor to communicate directly with the watch for convenience, but that the big payoff could come with combining sleep or activity data from the watch with glucose readings from its device to find correlations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to unlock the potential of that data,\u201d Mr. Sayer said.\nHealth care professionals said there was a risk of too much information. Dr. Khaldoun Tarakji, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Cleveland Clinic, said doctors needed to guide patients about who would benefit from more information and how much data was the right amount.\n\u201cWe need to think about when too much information becomes just noise,\u201d said Dr. Tarakji, who has worked with AliveCor to test KardiaMobile, a portable electrocardiogram that works with iPhones.\nA flood of information, albeit potentially useful, may overwhelm doctors instead of assisting them. Initially, KardiaMobile patients sent their doctors an email each time they took an EKG reading. The flood of emails became confusing and raised questions about where the doctor should store that information. In response, AliveCor introduced a software platform for doctors that could populate the readings from patients and help detect early signs of atrial fibrillation.\n\u201cA wearable device does not equal a wearable physician,\u201d Dr. Tarakji said. \u201cAs a medical community, we have to be intelligent about how to use these new technologies.\u201d"

        "title": "China Says It\u2019s Open for Business. Foreign Firms Find It\u2019s Not That Simple.",
        "fulltext": "GUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.\nThe reality on the ground was more complex.\nChina is increasingly presenting itself as a global force: President Xi Jinpingsurprised the worldin January when he told power brokers gathered in Davos, Switzerland, that the country planned to intensify its role in the absence of American leadership.\nThat message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\n\u201cChina\u2019s door will not close to the world but open wider,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.\nBut the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.\nA government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.\nAt the conference in Guangzhou, multiple officials promoted what they called the \u201cspirit\u201d of the rulingCommunist Party\u2019s recent congress, which tightened Mr. Xi\u2019s grip on the state gave his policies an exalted status in a sign of the role the party intends to play in China\u2019s economy. The crowd in the cavernous ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel thinned out as one official after another spoke over the course of an hour.\nSurveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\n\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\n\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.\nOthers were more blunt in their assessments.\n\u201cYou can get WeChat in America, but you can\u2019t get Facebook here in China,\u201d Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China said on Wednesday, referring to the popular Chinese social media app that is used by nearly 1 billion people. Facebook, by contrast, is blocked in China, although the company isstilltryingtogetinto the country.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\nOne company that has sought to make concessions in hopes of maintaining its access to the Chinese market is Apple. The company has been criticized for recentlyremoving some apps from its China app store, including those meant to help users circumvent the country\u2019s heavily censored internet. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, expressed respect for China\u2019s rule of law at the conference on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.\nMr. Cook had come to Guangzhou from theWorld Internet Conference, which was organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China. His attendance at that event raised concerns that he was lending his support to the government\u2019s heavy-handed control over the internet.\nMr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.\nAgainst this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.\nOne thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\n\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201d\nNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\n\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\n\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.\nHis advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201d"

        "title": "The Biggest Tech Failures and Successes of 2017",
        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s face it: Technology this year was one big \u201cfail\u201d after another. And the biggest loser from all of this was you.\nIt\u2019s easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money.\nSo here\u2019s a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.\nEpic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.\nWhen security breaches happen, you typically just have to change your passwords or cancel your credit cards. But this year\u2019shacking of Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, was unprecedented.\nHackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What\u2019s worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax \u2014 if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.\nThe fallout will probably cause headaches for years. The bestdefense tacticis a hassle: You should freeze your credit with all three credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 because an identity thief could use your personal information to apply for credit at a lender or company that checks files with only one of the agencies. What\u2019s more, freezing your credit may require a small fee, and the same fees may apply to unfreezing it whenever you want to apply for new credit.\nEquifax\u2019s top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.\nJuicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year\u2019s tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.\nJuicero\u2019s product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).\nHere\u2019s how we know that most of us didn\u2019t need this: Some Juicero investors toldBloomberg Newsthat people could simply squeeze the juice bags with their hands and get roughly the same amount of juice \u2014 sometimes even faster than the machine. (In our tests, a Juicero machine took more than three minutes to squeeze a bag of kale juice, but squeezing a bag by hand took about two minutes.) Over its short life span, the Juicero plummeted in price to $400 before the start-upshut down.\nIf you need a New Year\u2019s resolution, you might considerboycotting Uber.\nTo be clear, Uber\u2019s failures have more to do with the company and its work culture than the app you are familiar with. The ride-hailing start-up was a scandal magnet this year. After Uber employees aired complaints about sexual harassment, the company did an internal investigation and fired 20 people. The New York Times also reported that the company had used a secret program, code-namedGreyball, to monitor and evade law enforcement officials.\nIt didn\u2019t end there. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet,suedUber, accusing it of stealing trade secrets. In addition, Uber recently disclosed thathackers stole57 million driver and rider accounts in October 2016 \u2014 after keeping the breach secret for more than a year.\nTravis Kalanickresignedas the company\u2019s chief executive amid a shareholder revolt. Uber\u2019s new chief, Dara Khosrowshahi, now faces the tall order of repairing the company\u2019s reputation.\nRemember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake.\nIn 2017, many of us found out that we have been unwitting readers of propaganda and fake news seeded by Russian agents. We saw the posts on tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2016, which may have influenced how we voted during the presidential election. This year,investigations by The Timesand the cybersecurity firm FireEye revealed that Russian operators had used hundreds of thousands of bots, or automated accounts pretending to be people, to post anti-Clinton messages.\nFacebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.\nOn the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.\nWhen Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn\u2019t a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous.\nBut this year, Apple nailed it with the third iteration, theApple Watch Series 3,which introduced optional cellular connectivity to make the watch work more independently from the iPhone.\nAn initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly.\nThis is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.\nFor the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn\u2019t a Nintendo. The Japanese game company\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, was a flop.\nButNintendo Switch, the convertible console that debuted this year, was a hit. The device is essentially two gadgets in one \u2014 both a console that can sit in your living room and one that you can easily take on the go. And the new Zelda and Mario games, among others, received glowing reviews.\nPeople are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console\u2019s first 10 months.\nYear after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms. That vision is finally becoming a reality.\nThese days, you can buyhigh-quality internet-connected home accessories, like light bulbs, thermostats and security cameras, that work well together and can easily be controlled with voice-powered virtual assistants including Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google\u2019s Assistant and Apple\u2019s Siri.\nThe young smart home market is growing quickly. NPD Group, a research firm, says15 percentof American households with an internet connection now own a home automation device, up from 10 percent in April 2016.\nFor decades, scanning a face to unlock a gadget was a science fiction fantasy that you saw only in movies like \u201cMinority Report\u201d or \u201cThe Incredibles.\u201d Many companies tried it with no success; the face recognition in Samsung\u2019s Galaxy smartphones, for example, could be tricked by holding a photograph of your face in front of the camera. Even worse, some older systems had problemsidentifying people with darker skin.\nThen this year,iPhone X, Apple\u2019s first premium-tier iPhone priced at about $1,000, introduced Face ID.\nThe face-recognition system sprays an object with infrared dots and then stitches the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Face ID learns more about your face over time so that it continues to work when your face changes, like when you are growing facial hair or wearing a hat or scarf. Face ID is the first example of reliable, secureface recognitionon a mainstream device."

        "fulltext": "Facing a barrage of criticism after acknowledging the existence of a feature that can reduce the processing power of old iPhones, Apple said Thursday that it would reduce the price of battery replacements to regain customers\u2019 trust.\nThe company\u2019s mea culpa came just eight days afterApple saidit had released a feature about a year ago meant to help prevent older devices \u2014 such as iPhone 6 models and iPhone SE \u2014 from unexpectedly shutting down.\nThe reduction of processing power, Apple said, was necessary because older batteries could otherwise periodically overload.\nBut some users saw Apple\u2019s revelation as vindication of their longstanding belief that the company had been purposely slowing down old iPhones to get them to buy new ones.\nIn its statement on Thursday, Apple denied that it had ever \u2014 or would ever \u2014 \u201cdo anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d\nStill, Apple apologized for what it called a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and promised it would cut the price of out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacements to $29 from $79 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later model beginning in late January; the company said the service would be available worldwide through December 2018.\nApple also said it would soon issue a software update with new features that would allow users to more clearly see the health of their iPhone\u2019s battery.\n\u201cWe know that some of you feel Apple has let you down,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe apologize.\u201d\nInThursday\u2019s statement, Apple took pains to clarify what it had apparently been trying to convey last week: that rechargeable batteries become less effective as they age; that an aged battery under the duress of a heavy workload can cause a device to shut down unexpectedly; and that the company had released a software update about a year ago \u201cthat improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns.\u201d\n\u201cWith the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.\u201d"
