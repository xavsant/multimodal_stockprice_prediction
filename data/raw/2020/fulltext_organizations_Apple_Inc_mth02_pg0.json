        "title": "Silicon Valley Heads to Europe, Nervous About New Rules",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 First came Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. Then Apple\u2019s senior vice president for artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, showed up.\nAnd on Monday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is joining in with his own trip to Brussels to meet with officials likeMargrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission.\nThe main reason so many Silicon Valley executives are paying court in the European Union\u2019s capital: E.U. lawmakers are debating a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies. That has far-reaching implications for many industries \u2014 but especially for tech behemoths like Google, Facebook and Apple that have bet big on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhile A.I. promises enormous benefits for Europe and the world, there are real concerns about the potential negative consequences,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in a speech last month when he visited Brussels. He said regulation of artificial intelligence was needed to ensure proper human oversight, but added \u201cthere is a balance to be had\u201d to ensure that rules do not stifle innovation.\nSilicon Valley executives are taking action as Europe has increasingly set the standard on tech policy and regulation. In recent years, the E.U. haspassed laws on digital privacyand penalized Google and others on antitrust matters, which has inspired tougher action elsewhere in the world. The new artificial intelligence policy is also likely to be a template that others will adopt.\nArtificial intelligence \u2014 where machines are being trained to learn how to perform jobs on their own \u2014 is seen by technologists, business leaders and government officials as one of the world\u2019s most transformative technologies. Yet it presents new risks to individual privacy and livelihoods \u2014 including the possibility that the tech will replace people in their jobs.\nA first draft of the artificial intelligence policy, which is being coordinated by Ms. Vestager, will be released on Wednesday, along with broader recommendations outlining the bloc\u2019s digital strategy for the coming years. The debate over the policies, including how to expand Europe\u2019s homegrown tech industry, is expected to last through 2020.\nThe artificial intelligence proposal is expected to outline riskier uses of the technology \u2014 such as in health care and transportation like self-driving cars \u2014 and how those will come under tougher government scrutiny.\nIn an interview, Ms. Vestager said artificial intelligence was one of the world\u2019s most promising technologies, but it presentsmany dangersbecause it requires trusting complex algorithms to make decisions based on vast amounts of data. She said there must be privacy protections, rules to prevent the technology from causing discrimination, and requirements that ensure companies using the systems can explain how they work, she said.\nShe raised particular concerns about the expanding use of facial recognition technology and said new restrictions might be needed before it was \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said she was looking forward to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s visit. While she was curious to hear his ideas about artificial intelligence and digital policy, she said, Europe was not going to wait to act.\n\u201cWe will do our best to avoid unintended consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, obviously, there will be intended consequences.\u201d\nFacebook declined to comment.\nEurope is working on the artificial intelligence policy at the direction ofUrsula von der Leyen, the new head of the European Commission, which is the executive branch for the 27-nation bloc. Ms. von der Leyen, who took office in November, immediately gave Ms. Vestager a 100-day deadline to release an initial proposal about artificial intelligence.\nThe tight time frame has raised concerns that the rules are being rushed. Artificial intelligence is not monolithic and its use varies depending on the field where it is being applied. Its effectiveness largely relies on data pulled from different sources. Overly broad regulations could stand in the way of the benefits, such as diagnosing disease, building self-driving vehicles or creating more efficient energy grids, some in the tech industry warned.\n\u201cThere is an opportunity for leadership, but it cannot just be regulatory work,\u201d said Ian Hogarth, a London-based angel investor who focuses on artificial intelligence. \u201cJust looking at this through the lens of regulations makes it hard to push the frontiers of what\u2019s possible.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s A.I. debate is part of a broader move away from an American-led view of technology. For years, American lawmakers and regulators largely left Silicon Valley companies alone, allowing the firms to grow unimpeded and with little scrutiny of problems such as the spread of disinformation on social networks.\nPolicymakers in Europe and elsewhere stepped in with a more hands-on approach, setting boundaries on privacy, antitrust and harmful internet content. Last week, Britain unveiled plans to create anew government regulator to oversee internet content.\n\u201cTechnology is fragmenting along geopolitical lines,\u201d said Prof. Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at Southampton University, who has been an adviser to the British government on artificial intelligence.\nIn the interview, Ms. Vestager compared Europe\u2019s more assertive stance in tech regulation to its regulations of agriculture. Many pesticides and chemicals that are allowed in the United States are banned in Europe.\n\u201cIt is quite the European approach to say if things are risky, then we as a society want to regulate this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main thing is for us to create societies where people feel that they can trust what is going on.\u201d\nEuropean policymakers have no shortage of ideas to wade through in drafting the artificial intelligence policy. Since 2018, 44 reports with recommendations for \u201cethical artificial intelligence\u201d have been published by various organizations, according to aPricewaterhouseCoopers report.\nIn the United States, the government has focused on providing research funding for artificial intelligence rather than drafting new regulations. This month, the latestWhite House budgetproposal earmarked roughly $1.1 billion for such research.\nMs. Vestager said her policy would include a boost to research funding, but also a framework for safeguarding areas where artificial intelligence can cause the most harm. She said she was not worried about how artificial intelligence is used to recommend a song on Spotify or a movie on Netflix, but was focused on algorithms that determined who gets a loan or what diseases are diagnosed.\nMany details will likely be fought over, such as how Europe intends to meet its goal of maximizing the benefits of artificial intelligence. Civil society groups, banks, carmakers and health providers are expected to weigh in.\nThe rules will have important consequences for Apple, Facebook and Google. The tech giants have invested heavily in artificial intelligence in recent years and have battled tohire the world\u2019s top engineers. Artificial intelligence is now in Apple products such as Siri and Face ID, helps power Google\u2019s search engine and self-driving cars, and Facebook\u2019s advertising business.\nApple declined to comment. A Google spokesman referred back to the comments made by Mr. Pichai.\nDuring Mr. Pichai\u2019s visit to Brussels last month, he was asked what the region\u2019s artificial intelligence rules should look like. He warned there would be lasting economic consequences if Europe did too much.\n\u201cThe ability of European industry to adopt and adapt A.I. for its needs is going to be very critical for the continent\u2019s future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep that in mind.\u201d\nMonika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels."

        "title": "The Gap Between the Haves and Have-Nots of Tech Widens",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, said on Monday that revenue at the company soared past $161 billion last year, it was a stark reminder of the widening gap between tech\u2019s wealthiest outfits and the rest of the industry.\nAnd there is little reason to believe that will change.\nIn the last two weeks, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon \u2014 like Alphabet, all flirting with a $1 trillion stock value on Wall Street \u2014posted record results. The final member of tech\u2019s Big Five, Facebook, which is a little more than halfway to a $1 trillion valuation, also reported strong earnings.\nWith each passing quarter, tech\u2019s wealthiest companies are building on their power, making it harder for smaller outfits to compete and for entrepreneurs to build the next Google or Facebook.\nAmazon and Microsoft are profiting from the shift to cloud computing. Apple continues to own the premium market for apps, smartphones and wearable devices, while Google and Facebook are maintaining their grip on digital advertising.\nThis gravitational pull toward a handful of companies could have far-reaching implications for the global economy. Few tech outfits can afford to make the investments necessary to keep pace with the giants. The rest? They often have to pay up for access to the giants\u2019 many, many customers and technology.\n\u201cThe strong are getting stronger, and the weak are getting weaker. It\u2019s a market of haves and have-nots,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIn 20 years covering tech, it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nDespite saber-rattling in Washington and elsewhere, it is clear that regulatory and legal scrutiny of the tech industry\u2019s most valuable companies so far has done little to hurt the bottom line. Last year\u2019s financial results could lend more weight to arguments that a handful of companies, with dominant market shares and outgunned competition, are unfairly cashing in on their control.\nAmazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook made a combined $55.2 billion in net profit in the most recent quarter. The next five most valuable tech companies made roughly $45.5 billion in their four most recent quarters. While Facebook is lagging behind the rest of the Big Five, it is still worth twice as much as the next most valuable company, Intel.\nThe picture is darker the further down tech\u2019s food chain you go. A growing number of start-ups arecutting jobsto get their expenses under control. And older tech companies, still profitable but slowly losing influence, arestruggling to adaptto the changing landscape.\nAs the rich get richer, they are also branching out. They are muscling aside or buying out rivals. And they are locking in the industry\u2019s best engineers with paydays smaller companies could never match.\nAmazon said last week that it had invested in the infrastructure neededto speed up shipping times for its Prime membersto one day from two, raising the bar even higher for retail competitors. But Monday\u2019s trading on Wall Street showed just how hard it is to stay in the trillion-dollar club. Despite its e-commerce and cloud-computing dominance, Amazon\u2019s value dipped just a bit below $1 trillion.\nApple recently earmarkedbillions of dollars to create shows and moviesfor its video subscription service in a challenge to Netflix, while Alphabet agreed tobuy the activity tracker Fitbit for $2.1 billionin November and the analytics software firm Looker for $2.6 billion in June.\n\u201cToday\u2019s dominant companies have so much power across such a broad array of markets and continue to leverage that power to expand into new markets,\u201d said Patrick Spence, chief executive of the speaker maker Sonos, ata congressional antitrust hearinglast month in Boulder, Colo.\nSonos has sued Google, accusing Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.\nTech\u2019s richest companies seem to be defying a Wall Street assumption that as a company gets bigger, it becomes difficult to find new ways to make money and maintain rapid growth. Alphabet said profits in the last quarter of 2019 were 19 percent more than a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent to $46.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company\u2019s stock fell 4 percent in after-hours trading\nTo assuage some concern about sluggishness in its main search ad business, Alphabet disclosedfor the first timedetailed revenue figures for its YouTube and cloud computing units, which are growing faster than the rest of the company. YouTube sold $15.1 billion worth of ads in 2019, up 36 percent, while its cloud unit grew more than 50 percent to $8.9 billion. Ad revenue from search increased 15 percent to $98.1 billion.\nGene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, said it was harder than ever for new challengers because the top incumbents were so effective at \u201cincremental evolution,\u201d like Apple\u2019s building subscription offerings to go with its hardware or Google\u2019s branching out into cloud computing. The big tech companies skillfully move into new markets with lower prices and more money for marketing than their new competitors. In time, they take over.\nThe outsize nature of the profits at some of these companies has driven an explosion of wealth on the stock market.\nThe total value of Microsoft shares has risen nearly 70 percent over the last year, adding more than half a trillion dollars to the company\u2019s market cap. Apple tacked on more than $550 billion in an 85 percent surge.\nAlphabet\u2019s rise of more than 30 percent has added more than $200 billion to its market cap. Amazon, which had a 20 percent jump, has been something of a laggard but still added roughly $200 billion to its market cap.\nThe large technology firms that dominate the public stock markets are at the extreme edge of a broader trend in American corporate life. Over the last half-century, the biggest American companies have captured a fatter share of profits produced by public companies, according to research from Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.\nIn 1975, the top 100 public companies snared about 49 percent of the earnings of all public companies. By 2015, that share had jumped to 84 percent, their research showed. They have not updated their numbers since then, but Ms. Kahle, in an email exchange, said she doubted the numbers had decreased.\n\u201cThere are a lot of small, unprofitable firms and a handful of large, very profitable ones,\u201d Ms. Kahle wrote in an email.\nMr. Ives foresees the five companies competing for $2 trillion in new technology spending over the coming years. It will be hard for the rest of the industry to match that.\n\u201cOver the last few years, you\u2019ve seen a fork in the road between the winners and the losers,\u201d he said.\nDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Matt Phillips from New York."

        "title": "Europe, Overrun by Foreign Tech Giants, Wants to Grow Its Own",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Across the digital economy, Europe has been missing.\nApple, based in California, and Samsung, from South Korea, make the most popular phones in Europe. Facebook owns the most widely used social networks, Google dominates online search and advertising, and Amazon controls e-commerce. European companies run their businesses on cloud infrastructure from Amazon and Microsoft. The region\u2019s wireless networks are largely made with equipment from the Chinese giant Huawei.\nThe European Union on Wednesday outlined an attempt to restore what officials called \u201ctechnological sovereignty,\u201d seeking tougher regulation of the world\u2019s biggest tech platforms, new rules for artificial intelligence and more public spending for the European tech sector.\nOfficials said the effort was a \u201cgenerational project,\u201d and the ideas reflect agrowing concern among European leadersthat countries in the region are overly dependent on services provided by companies based elsewhere. With the global economy becoming ever more centered on technology, European countries would have a harder time creating jobs and generating tax revenue to fund government services.\n\u201cWe want to find European solutions in the digital age,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union that is developing the policy, said at a news conference in Brussels.\nBut the proposals introduced on Wednesday were clearer in identifying the problem than in offering specific solutions. The commission said it would begin a consultation period that was expected to last through much of the year before any concrete legal proposals were ready.\nOfficials laid out some broad ideas that suggest the authorities will seek to nurture homegrown businesses by taking on the giants from overseas \u2014 potentially setting up more trade disputes with Washington.\nCompanies that have become \u201cgatekeepers\u201dbetween businessesand customers \u2014 like Amazon for shopping, Apple\u2019s App Store, Facebook\u2019s social network and Google\u2019s search engine \u2014 will face more scrutiny. A particular focus, officials said, will be on the data they hold that could give them an unfair advantage over rivals.\nArtificial intelligence technology \u2014 in which computers are being trained to perform increasingly complex tasks \u2014 would also receive fresh government oversight, especially where the automated systems create harmful risks, such as in health, transportation and policing. The commission said artificial intelligence systems in these \u201chigh risk\u201d areas would have to be independently tested and certified before they could be used in the 27 countries of the European Union.\n\u201cA.I. is not good or bad in itself,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission vice president who oversees the digital policy, said at a news conference in Brussels. \u201cIt all depends on why and how it is used.\u201d\nMs. Vestager called for more scrutiny of how facial recognition technology was being deployed across Europe.\nPolicymakers also outlined standards for industries to share data within the European Union, making it easier for companies and researchers to pool information they collect to better compete against the tech companies that control much of the world\u2019s data.\nEurope\u2019s ability to establish itself as a tech-industry leader will be very difficult in the face of competition from companies in the United States and China that may have more experience and resources, said Kevin Allison, who studies the intersection of technology and geopolitics at Eurasia Group in Berlin.\n\u201cIt is one thing to have ideas; it is one thing to even have a well-thought strategy \u2014 but implementing and executing the ideas is the really hard part,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where Europe has struggled.\u201d\nMr. Allison said Europe\u2019s proposals could face resistance in Washington, where there were threats of retaliation by the Trump administration against aFrench effort to tax American tech giants. \u201cThis is just going to further fuel U.S. concerns about Europe,\u201d he said.\nThe debate has gotten the attention of the tech giants. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s top executive, was in Brussels on Monday to meet with officials about the proposals. Top executives from Apple, Google and Microsoft have also visited the European capital over the past several weeks.\nThe proposal leaves many questions unanswered, including whether the European Union will seek to regulate harmful internet content, a contentious topic that raises concerns about free expression online. Some leaders in Brussels would like to hold companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter more accountable by removing some of the protections that keep them from being held legally liable for user-generated posted on their platforms.\nEurope has been a world leader in technology regulation, including privacy and antitrust, influencing how countries elsewhere are reacting to the power and influence of the world\u2019s biggest tech platforms. But as Europe has created a reputation as the world\u2019s most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust.\nIn Europe, the tech effort is part of a broader debate about the role the government should play in giving European businesses an advantage over foreign competitors. While officials in some countries, including France, Germany Italy and Poland, have called for more state intervention in the economy, others, including Ms. Vestager,have been more wary.\nPriya Guha, who works at the venture capital firm Merian Ventures and was previously the British government\u2019s top liaison to Silicon Valley, said Europe was trying to balance the potential harms of modern technology while bolstering its position in the digital economy.\n\u201cEurope is trying to consider the impact on society whilst maximizing the benefits,\u201d she said.\nAdam Satariano reported from London, and Monika Pronczuk from Brussels."

        "title": "Lawrence Tesler, Who Made Personal Computing Easier, Dies at 74",
        "fulltext": "Lawrence Tesler, a pioneering computer scientist who helped make it easier for users to interact with computers, whether cutting and pasting text or selecting text by dragging a cursor through it, died on Sunday at his home in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 74.\nThe cause was not known, his wife, Colleen Barton, said, but in recent years he had suffered the effects of an earlier bicycle accident.\nMr. Tesler worked at a number of Silicon Valley\u2019s most important companies, including Apple under Steve Jobs. But it was as a young researcher for Xerox at itsPalo Alto Research Centerin the 1970s that he did his most significant work: helping to develop today\u2019s style of computer interaction based on a graphical desktop metaphor and a mouse.\nEarly in his Xerox career (he began there in 1973), Mr. Tesler and another researcher,Tim Mott, developed a program known as Gypsy, which did away with the restrictive modes that had made text editing complicated. For example, until Gypsy, most text-editing software had one mode for entering text and another for editing it.\nMr. Tesler was passionate about simplifying interaction with computers. At Apple he was responsible for the idea that a computer mouse should have only one button. For many years the license plate on his car read, \u201cNO MODES.\u201d\nHis first breakthrough at Xerox PARC came when he took a newly hired secretary, sat her in front of a blank computer monitor and took notes while she described how she would prefer to compose documents with a computer. She proceeded to describe a very simple system, which Mr. Tesler then implemented with Mr. Mott.\nThe Gypsy program offered such innovations as the \u201ccut and paste\u201d analogy for moving blocks of text and the ability to select text by dragging the cursor through it while holding down a mouse button. It also shared with an earlier Xerox editor, Bravo, what became known as \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d printing (or WYSIWYG), a phrase Mr. Tesler used to describe a computer display that mirrored printed output.\nAnd Gypsy brought to fruition the idea of opening a computer file by simply clicking on a screen icon while pointing at it with the mouse cursor. Before that, files had to be opened by typing the file name into a command line.\n\u201cAt Xerox he pushed a lot for things to be simpler in ways that would broaden the base of users,\u201d said David Liddle, a veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist who worked with Mr. Tesler at Xerox PARC. \u201cHe was always quite focused on users who weren\u2019t also Ph.D.s in computer science.\u201d\nMr. Tesler later joined a small team of researchers run byAlan Kay, a visionary computer scientist who had pioneered the idea of a so-called Dynabook, which would become the inspiration for today\u2019s laptop computers. The group was developing a software environment called Smalltalk, and Mr. Tesler developed a system for searching for software components, which he named the browser.\n\u201cHe can be hailed as one of the true pioneers of many important aspects of personal computing,\u201d Mr. Kay said.\nAfter attending a demonstration of the Altair, an early hobbyist personal computer, at a Palo Alto hotel in 1975, Mr. Tesler returned to PARC to alert his colleagues to the arrival of low-cost systems. His warnings were largely ignored.\nHe continued to press for less costly computers. In 1978, with Adele Goldberg and Douglas Fairbairn, he designed a portable machine called NoteTaker, a forerunner of luggable computers like the Osborne, Kaypro and Compaq machines of the early 1980s. But Xerox declined to commercialize the NoteTaker; only a few prototypes were made.\nIt was Mr. Tesler who gave Mr. Jobs the celebrated demonstration of the Xerox Alto computer and the Smalltalk software system that would come to influence the design of Apple\u2019s Lisa personal computer and then its Macintosh.\nMr. Tesler left Xerox to work for Mr. Jobs at Apple in 1980.\n\u201cThe questions the Apple people were asking totally blew me away,\u201d Mr. Tesler was quoted as saying ina profile that appeared in IEEE Spectrum, the magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, in 2005. \u201cThey were the kind of questions Xerox executives should have been asking but didn\u2019t.\u201d\nIn addition to helping develop the Lisa and Macintosh, Mr. Tesler founded and ran Apple\u2019s Advanced Technology Group, after which he led the design of the Newton hand-held computer, although that proved unsuccessful. The group also created much of the technology that would become the Wi-Fi wireless standard, and Mr. Tesler led an Apple joint venture with two other companies that created Acorn RISC Machine, a partnership intended to provide a microprocessor for the Newton.\nAlthough Apple eventually sold off its holdings in that venture, it would come to dominate the market for the chips that power today\u2019s smartphones.The chip architecture created by the partnershipis today the most widely used microprocessor design in the world.\nMr. Tesler left Apple in 1997 for a start-up and later went on to work for both Amazon and Yahoo. He left Yahoo in 2008 and spent a year as a product fellow at 23andMe, the genetics information company. He was most recently an independent consultant.\nLawrence Gordon Tesler was born in the Bronx on April 24, 1945, to Isidore and Muriel (Krechmer) Tesler. His father was an anesthesiologist.\nIn 1960, while attending the Bronx High School of Science, Mr. Tesler developed a new method of generating prime numbers. He showed it to one of his teachers, who was impressed. As Mr. Tesler later recalled, he told the teacher that the method was a formula; the teacher responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not really a formula, it\u2019s an algorithm, and it can be implemented on a computer.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you find a computer?\u201d Mr. Tesler asked.\nThe teacher said he would first get him a programming manual and then figure out where to find a computer.\nOne day Mr. Tesler was sitting in the school cafeteria reading his manual, which offered instructions on how to program an IBM 650 mainframe in the most low-level, arcane machine programming language.\nA student walked up to Mr. Tesler and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m learning about programming,\u201d Mr. Tesler responded.\nThe other student alerted Mr. Tesler to a program at Columbia University, which gave high school students programming time. He was able to use a university computer for a half-hour each week, teaching himself to program before he got to college.\nHe attended Stanford, graduating in 1965 with a degree in mathematics. While there, he became involved in a number of early projects that prefigured personal computing.\nMr. Tesler had early access to a computer known as a LINC when he worked as a student programmer for the Nobel laureateJoshua Lederberg. The LINC, designed by the M.I.T. physicistWesley A. Clark, is believed by many computer historians to have been the first true personal computer.\nMr. Tesler\u2019s first start-up venture was a programming consulting company located in a shopping mall next to the Stanford campus. He also used a mainframe computer to build a system to permit the student rooting section at Stanford football games to program elaborate card stunts. It was, Mr. Kay said, a forerunner to the ways in which modern graphical displays would be programmed.\nIn 1969, with two other scientists at theStanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Mr. Tesler created a design for a small computer and proposed it to the calculator company Friden. Although intrigued, the company declined to pursue the idea.\nMr. Tesler left computing for a short while after that and moved to an Oregon commune with his daughter from a short-lived marriage. Lack of work led him back to the Bay Area, where he would join Xerox PARC.\nIn addition to Ms. Barton, a geophysicist, and his daughter, Lisa Tesler, he is survived by two brothers, Charles and Alan.\nAt Stanford and afterward, Mr. Tesler was active in both the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture. He participated in an alternative school, the Mid-Peninsula Free University, where he taught classes, including one exclusively for people born under the sign of Taurus. In 1968 he taught a class titled \u201cHow to End the IBM Monopoly.\u201d\nYears later, as a computer scientist at Xerox, he remembered his activist roots, his former colleague Ms. Goldberg said. The Central Intelligence Agency was a Xerox customer, and when agency employees arrived for a meeting, Mr. Tesler attended wearing a trench coat and a fedora."

        "fulltext": "Airbus is slowly restarting its assembly line inChina. General Motors began limited production on Saturday. Toyota followed on Monday morning.\nFitfully and painfully \u2014 and with some worried prodding from Beijing \u2014 China is trying to reopen for business.\nThe world\u2019s second-largest economy practically shut down three weeks ago as a viral outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people, unexpectedly lengthening a Chinese holiday. The freezeset off warningsthat the global economy could be in jeopardy if the world\u2019s pre-eminent manufacturing powerhouse stayed shut for long.\nNow, as some factories rumble back into action, the monumental task of restarting China is becoming clear. China\u2019s efforts to contain the virus are clashing with its push to get the country back to work, requiring the country\u2019s leaders to strike a balance between keeping people safe and getting vital industries back on track.\nChinese leaders called this past week for more emphasis onreviving the economy. But many of the factories that have reopened are operating well below capacity, say companies and experts. Quarantines, blocked roads and checkpoints are stopping millions of workers from returning to their jobs. Supply lines have been severed.\nEven to start up again, Chinese officials are requiring businesses to provide masks to workers, record their temperatures and track their movements to make sure they haven\u2019t come into contact with thecoronavirus, named COVID-19.\n\u201cThe kind of fear and freeze that has taken hold in terms of economic activity is likely to persist,\u201d said George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Center. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a good outcome.\u201d\nBy Monday, more than 70,000 people had been infected by the coronavirus and over 1,700 had died worldwide, according to officials. New infections continue to be confirmed around the world, including anAmerican who was identified with the diseasein Malaysia on Sunday who had been on a cruise ship, raising concerns about another potential cluster outside mainland China.\nAlso on Sunday, Taiwan said that a 61-year-old man who had a history of poor health but not known for travel to China had died of the coronavirus, making him the fifth fatality outside the mainland.\nStill, the pace of new cases officially confirmed in mainland China, the center of the outbreak, has slowed over the past three days.\nThe ripples have continued to spread around the world. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore warned on Friday that the city-statecould fall into recessionas a result of the outbreak. Germany, Europe\u2019s business powerhouse, on Friday reported slowingeconomic growthat the end of 2019, prompting fears the virus could delay a recovery.\nAs the new week begins, China\u2019s mighty manufacturing machine \u2014 which accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s manufacturing output \u2014 showed glimmers of revving up again.\nAirbus, the European aircraft maker, said that it began to reopen its narrow-body jet assembly operations last week in Tianjin but that it would only \u201cgradually increase production, whilst implementing all required health and safety measures.\u201d Airbus needs the production: Itacknowledged on Thursdaythat itcould not meet global demand for narrow-body jets, which airlines are clamoring for after the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jet. The Tianjin plant has a targeted production rate of six jets per month.\nVolkswagen said that it partially restarted one of its 15 assembly plants in China on Thursday and that it planned to reopen the rest gradually. G.M. said that it had begun a gradual process on Saturday to reopen its more than a dozen assembly plants in China. Hyundai said it restarted most Chinese production on Monday.\nOthers were more circumspect. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment company, said it reopened most plants in China last Monday at the request of the government authorities, but did not offer details, like whether production had resumed. Honda said it was trying to restart production on Feb. 24.\nWith the exception of factories producing medical protective equipment, which the Chinese government has asked to run around the clock, few businesses seem to be returning yet to their previous pace.\nToyota said that its four assembly plants had operated on two work shifts a day before the virus spread. But it planned to reopen three of them on Monday and Tuesday with just one shift and leave closed for now the fourth and smallest, in the western Chinese city of Chengdu.\nFoxconn, the Taiwan company that makes iPhones and other gadgets on behalf of Apple and global electronics companies, declined to detail which plants have reopened since the Chinese holiday ended butdenied a media reportthat it was aiming to reach 50 percent production levels by the end of this month. It did not respond to requests for additional comment. Apple also declined to comment, but its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said last month, without offering specifics, that some of its suppliers could be disrupted.\nChina\u2019s consumer electronics components factories slowly reopened through last week, and by Monday practically all had reopened except those in Wuhan, at the center of the epidemic, said Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, the chief executive of Instrumental, a remote quality monitoring system used by global brands to track and manage electronics manufacturing. She added, however, that many of these factories were not at full production.\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which has members across much of the industrial heartland in east-central China, said that the majority of its members had restarted at least some operations. But the bulk of these members are not at full production, mainly for lack of workers, said Ker Gibbs, the chamber\u2019s president.\nThe reopening of businesses means trying to bring together again much of China\u2019s 700 million-strong labor force after what had become a nearly three-week national holiday. China\u2019s containment efforts have effectively carved up the country.At least 760 million people\u2014 slightly over half the country\u2019s population \u2014 are under various kinds of lockdown.\nThe authorities have begun trying to reconnect the country. China\u2019s agriculture ministry demanded over the weekend the removal of road and highway blockages in rural areas that have prevented the movement of livestock and animal feed. The southern province of Jiangxi announced last Thursday that it would dismantle checkpoints at highway entrances and exits.\nBut many obstacles remain.\n\u201cI know the virus is serious. I can understand that this is a disaster for the country,\u201d said Ma Hongkui, a truck driver from northwestern China who has been stranded for weeks with dozens of other truckers in a small town in the southwestern province of Yunnan for lack of cargo. \u201cI don\u2019t know whom to ask for help.\u201d\nIn the city of Yiwu, a hub for small manufacturers in Zhejiang province and home to a sprawling wholesale merchandise market, migrant workers returning to jobs have to submit to a two-week quarantine. When theyarrive at a train station in Yiwu, they are examined by dozens of officials in makeshift hazmat suits with thermal cameras. The local government has arranged 40,000 beds to accommodate them.\nOnly those registered with an official list of companies and work units will be allowed to enter the city, according to a statement from the government last week. Lying would be punished with arrest.\nShanghai is gathering data from employers on each worker\u2019s date of return and travel history, said Zhu Zongyao, the director of the city\u2019s Big Data Center. The city\u2019s computers will automatically assess and rate the riskiness of each worker\u2019s recent travels in terms of possible exposure to the virus.\nChina is \u201cmaintaining the balance of safety for the population while at the same time getting people back to work as soon as possible,\u201d said Michael D. Crotty, the co-owner of a curtain factory in Jiangsu Province that is preparing to reopen on Monday.\nThe local authorities required Mr. Crotty\u2019s factory to obtain a 10-day supply of face masks for every worker. But suppliers in China have been giving priority to health workers and others with urgent needs. Mr. Crotty quickly arranged to import masks from all over the world.\nRequiring masks is more than onerous, said Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It could also aggravate a global shortage of masks.\n\u201cAt a time when there is such a shortage of face masks, you\u2019ve got to have a rational way of using them,\u201d he said.\nThe slow and partial reopening of factories could have a knock-on effect on businesses around the world. China Weaving Materials in Jiangxi Province said that its yarn factories would not open until Feb. 20. Other companies in China need the yarn to make fabric.\nIn neighboring Vietnam, handbag factories are running short on fabric, zippers and various metal components that come mostly from China, said Tatiana Olchanetzky, a handbag manufacturing consultant in that country.\n\u201cSome vendors might have to make workers take unpaid leave in March if materials are not arriving,\u201d she said.\nRestarting China\u2019s factories is only part of the challenge. The country has a huge services and consumer sector, including shops and restaurants enjoyed by an increasingly affluent middle class. Those businesses have also been devastated by the outbreak, which has kept many Chinese families confined to their homes.\nAmy Li, the owner of a Shanghai restaurant that specializes in northeastern Chinese cuisine, said that her eatery had little hope of reopening soon, like dozens of others nearby, and may not survive.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we can reopen,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cThe future is a matter of fate.\u201d\nPaul Mozur and Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Coronavirus Hits Apple\u2019s Financial Forecast",
        "fulltext": "Hello, New York Times tech readers. I\u2019m Nellie Bowles, the tech and culture reporter, here now with the roundup of the news.\nIt was a week that captured the central issues of tech in 2020: privacy versus the convenience of smart home devices, dependence on the smooth running of China\u2019s manufacturing industry, battles over regulation in Europe and the lockdown on internal dissent at Silicon Valley companies.\nSo to those wanting to take a break from the endless Democratic primary jockeying, settle into a good chair, because what the week brought you is a basket of beautiful tech features.\nWe begin:\nCoronavirus is starting to affect tech production lines and demand for products. Apple cut its sales expectations for the quarter, citing the virus\u2019s impact on factories and stores. The warning was a clear indication of how big the company has bet on China and how the impact of the outbreak might ripple out into the global economy,explored in an article by Daisuke Wakabayashi.\nAmazon executives are also preparing for coronavirus disruptions.An article by Karen Weise and Michael Corkeryoutlined the measures the company is taking to hedge against the potential that the impact of the virus gets worse. The Everything Store is \u201cmaking larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States,\u201d they wrote.\nBut at the same time, some suppliers are trying to lower demand, cutting back on advertising and promotions so they don\u2019t run out of stuff.\nSpeaking of Amazon: Not everyone agrees on where to draw the line between privacy and convenience, sometimes not even everyone in the same house. One couple fighting over whether to keep an Alexa-enabled Echo speaker in the home invented their own solution:a bracelet of silence that jams microphones. Wear it and it\u2019s like smart-home armor. The tale of the couple, two computer science professors, was brought to us by Kashmir Hill.\nBut if you do agree on getting something that records video and listens \u2014 especially a Ring doorbell \u2014 there are some privacy best practices, which Brian X. Chen outlined in his latest Tech Fix column. There are many, many steps required, including getting a burner phone number.And his conclusion: \u201cIf that all sounds like a lot of effort just to use a security camera, that\u2019s because the security concerns make Ring products impractical to own.\u201d\nIn Europe, leaders are very good at regulating technology, pioneering responses to issues of privacy and antitrust, but can it build tech giants of its own?My colleagues Adam Satariano and Monika Pronczuk wrote: \u201cAs Europe has created a reputation as the world\u2019s most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust.\u201d Now it is trying to change that and reclaim \u201ctechnological sovereignty.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, Silicon Valley companies have been making more trips to Brussels recently to lobby against some of that regulation:a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies, Adam wrote.\nNoam Scheiber and Kate Conger had a big storyin the The New York Times Magazine on the Great Google Revolt: what happened when a group of employees tried to make the company stop doing work they saw as unethical.\nMostly, they were fired. Dive into the article to understand how Google went from an ultra-transparent company that encouraged employee dissent to, well, not.\nThe Style section\u2019s Penelope Greentook us to deathbeds. As more people choose to die at home and more families have smartphones, deathbed photos are returning.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that people are taking back that process,\u201d said Stanley B. Burns, 81, an ophthalmologist who runs theBurns Archive, a collection of post-mortem and medical photos. \u201cBut the impulse to photograph is the same as it was for the Victorians.\u201d\nOur colleague in Opinion, Susan Fowler, shook the tech world in 2017 when she wrote a first-person account of working at Uber and suffering the indignities and discrimination of a sexist, start-up workplace.\nHer memoir, \u201cWhistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber,\u201d is out now, and theBook Review called it\u201ca powerful illustration of the obstacles our society continues to throw up in the paths of ambitious young women.\u201d\nMarker, a new business site by Medium, is rolling out some great stories this week including a series on \u201cThe New Rules of the I.P.O.\u201d\nKickstarter officially voted to unionize. There have been large efforts to organize tech labor, but many have faltered.\nSan Diego is likely to recognize Instacart workers as employees rather than independent contractors,according to a story in Bloomberg Law.\nA general reminder from The New York Times Magazine\u2019s Future of Work issue: Professional video game players are in high demand as the industry competes for talent, and now they make even more money.\nAccording to Newzoo, a games-and-e-sports analytics company,competitive e-sports revenue last year was about $1.1 billion, an almost 27 percent increase from 2018, Robert Capps wrote. So, in conclusion, get in while the getting is good.\nHow are we doing?\nWe\u2019d love your feedback on this newsletter.

        "title": "SARS Stung the Global Economy. The Coronavirus Is a Greater Menace.",
        "fulltext": "In 2002, when a lethal, pneumonialike virus known as SARS emerged in China, the country\u2019s factories were mostly churning out low-cost goods like T-shirts and sneakers for customers around the world.\nSeventeen years later, another deadly virus is spreading rapidly through the world\u2019s most populous country. But China has evolved into a principal element of the global economy, making the epidemic a substantially more potent threat to fortunes.\nInternational companies that rely on Chinese factories to make their products and depend on Chinese consumers for sales are already warning of costly problems.\nApple, Starbucks and Ikea have temporarily closed stores in China. Shopping malls are deserted, threatening sales of Nike sneakers, Under Armour clothing and McDonald\u2019s hamburgers. Factories making cars for General Motors and Toyota are delaying production as they wait for workers to return from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended by the government to halt the spread of the virus. International airlines, including American, Delta, United, Lufthansa and British Airways, have canceled flights to China.\nChina\u2019s economic growth is expected to slip this year to 5.6 percent, down from 6.1 percent last year, according to a conservative forecast from Oxford Economics that is based on the impact of the virus so far. That would, in turn, reduce global economic growth for the year by 0.2 percent, to an annual rate of 2.3 percent \u2014 the slowest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago.\nReturning from a long holiday for the first time since the coronavirus\u2019s threat became clear, Chinese investors sentshares in China down about 8 percenton Monday. Stock markets around the world have plunged in recent days as the sense takes hold that a public health crisis could morph into aneconomic shock.\nIn a sign of deepening concern, China\u2019s leaders on Sunday outlined plans to injectfresh creditinto the economy. That will include a net $22 billion to shore up money markets as well as looser borrowing terms for Chinese companies.\nThough China\u2019s factories still produce a mind-bending array of relatively simple, low-value products like clothing and plastic goods, they have long since achieved dominance in more advanced and lucrative pursuits like smartphones, computers and auto parts. The country has evolved into an essential part of the global supply chain, producing components needed by factories from Mexico to Malaysia.\nChina has also risen into an enormous consumer market, a nation of 1.4 billion people with a growing appetite for electronic gadgets, fashion apparel and trips to Disneyland.\nThe trade war waged by the Trump administration has prompted a partial decoupling of the United States and China, the two largest economies on earth. Multinational companies that have used factories in China to make their wares have sought to avoid American tariffs by shifting production to other countries \u2014 especiallyVietnam. The coronavirus mightaccelerate that trend, at least for a time, should global companies find themselves locked out of China.\nTheoutbreak of the virus in Wuhan, a city that is home to 11 million people, prompted the Chinese government to effectively quarantine the metropolis and much of surrounding Hubei province, barring people from moving around.\nUntil now, the impact on factories was limited by the fact that the outbreak was unfolding during the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year. Many businesses are closed during the holiday, while hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home to their families in the countryside.\nIn a bid to keep people home and halt the spread of the virus, the government extended the holiday through Sunday, adding three days. But the fear of the virus is so widespread and intense that many workers are likely to remain away from factory towns this week.\nA frightening epidemic coinciding with a major holiday will almost certainly spell a substantial loss of sales for China\u2019s tourism and hospitality industries. Hotels and restaurants that would normally be full of revelry are empty. Concerts and sporting events have been canceled. IMAX, the large screen film company based in Toronto, has postponed the release of five films it had intended to showcase in China during the holiday.\nEven as the holiday officially ends, business is unlikely to return to normal. Many major industrial areas \u2014 including Shanghai, Suzhou and Guangdong province \u2014 have lengthened the holiday by at least another week, preventing workers from returning.\nWith flights to China limited and emergency public health restrictions in place, the Chinese operations of multinational companies are likely to be constrained. Major banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are directing that employees who have visited mainland China stay home for two weeks.\nGeneral Motors last year sold more cars in China than in the United States. Its Chinese factories will be closed for at least another week at the request of the government. Ford Motor has told managers in China to work from home while its factories remain idled, said a company spokesman.\nAll of this could play havoc with businesses that depend on China for components, from auto factories in the American Midwest and Mexico to apparel plants in Bangladesh and Turkey.\nIf customers cannot buy what they need from China, Chinese factories could, in turn, slash orders for imported machinery, components and raw material \u2014 computer chips from Taiwan and South Korea, copper from Chile and Canada, factory equipment from Germany and Italy.\n\u201cThis could potentially disrupt global supply chains,\u201d said Rohini Malkani, an economist at DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating business. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say how long it is going to last.\u201d\nSimilar worries accompanied the outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003, when the virus emerged in the southern province of Guangdong before spreading across China and around the world, killing nearly 800 people in at least 17 countries.\nChina had just joined the World Trade Organization, gaining access to markets around the globe. It was harnessing its seemingly limitless supply of low-wage workers to produce cheap consumer goods. Its economy centered on exports. Its consumer market remained in its infancy.\nIn the years since, China\u2019s annual economic output has multiplied more than eightfold, to nearly $14 trillion from $1.7 trillion, according to the World Bank. Its share of global trade has more than doubled, to 12.8 percent last year from 5.3 percent in 2003, according to Oxford Economics.\nIts economic output per person has multiplied to roughly $9,000 last year from about $1,500 in 2003, giving households additional cash for an enormous range of consumer goods.\n\u201cChina today accounts for about one-third of global economic growth, a larger share of global growth than from the U.S., Europe and Japan combined,\u201d Andy Rothman, an economist at Matthews Asia, an investment fund manager, noted duringrecent testimonybefore a congressional panel.\nThe American semiconductor industry is particularly entrenched in China, which is both a major manufacturing hub and a market for its products. Intel\u2019s customers in China accounted for about $20 billion in revenue in 2019, or 28 percent of its total for the year.\nQualcomm, the dominant maker of chips for mobile phones, is even more dependent on China, drawing 47 percent of its annual revenue \u2014 or nearly $12 billion \u2014 from sales in the country.\nNo one knows how long the coronavirus outbreak will last, how far it will spread, or how many lives it will claim. It is impossible to calculate the extent to which it will disrupt China\u2019s economy. But China\u2019s formidable stature in the world economy means that the impact of the current outbreak is likely to substantially exceed that of SARS.\n\u201cThe knock-on effects for the global economy are going to be much larger than they were,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\nFor manufacturers, the timing of the outbreak may limit the damage. They just completed the fourth quarter, when production increases to meet demand for the winter holidays. The end of January is typically slow.\nBut the effects of the virus on supply chains, which have grown notoriously complex, are difficult to anticipate. A single part of an advanced product like a smart TV may be made of dozens of smaller components, with each of these assembled from other pieces. Companies themselves often do not know the suppliers that are three and four rungs down the chain.\n\u201cIf you run out of widgets that are essential to production processes and all those widgets come from China, then it may well be that your production lines go to a halt,\u201d said Ben May, global economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThese problems are likely to be popping up all over the world.\u201d\nThis became a problem in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which devastated manufacturers. Many companies assumed they were buying parts from a diverse range of suppliers, protecting them from shortages, only to realize that critical components were produced by single plants.\nIf that plays out in China, the consequences are likely to be great.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a potentially vast swath of a country that the whole world depends on as a manufacturing workshop,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. \u201cThe effects will be unexpected.\u201d\nApple assembles most of its products in China. The company has severely restricted travel in China for its employees, its chief executive officer, Timothy D. Cook, said on an earnings call on Tuesday.\nApple disclosed much wider volatility in its potential revenues for the current quarter in the face of uncertainties around factory production and sales of its products.\nThose uncertainties deepened on Saturday. Apple, which derives about one-sixth of its sales from China, announced that it wouldclose its 42 storesin the country.\nWalmart buys vast volumes of its products from Chinese factories while operating 430 stores in the country, including in areas shut down by quarantine. The company has reduced hours at some stores, a Walmart spokeswoman said.\n\u201cWe may still be in the early stages,\u201d of the coronavirus crisis, Judith McKenna, who runs Walmart\u2019s International business, wrote in an internal memo on Friday.\nChina is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of toys. At the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany, many Chinese suppliers expressed confidence that their factories would soon reopen, said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a family-owned manufacturer of educational products and toys in Illinois.\n\u201cBut no one\u2019s quite sure how much of this information can be relied upon,\u201d Mr. Woldenberg said.\nBecause of the trade war, the toy industry was effectively prepared for a moment in which its access to Chinese suppliers was imperiled, Mr. Woldenberg said. In December, when the Trump administration was threatening to impose an additional 15 percent tariff on Chinese imports, many toy companies sped up their orders to beat the deadline. Some shifted production to Thailand and Vietnam to avoid the tariffs altogether.\nToymakers will soon need to rebuild inventory. \u201cIf this goes on for four more months, we are talking about a big problem,\u201d said Jim Silver, chief executive of TTPM.com, a consumer research site.\nAfter SARS, China suffered several months of economic contraction and then rebounded dramatically. That might happen this time, too. The only certainty is this: Whatever happens in China will be felt widely.\n\u201cClearly China has become a much more dominant player in the world economy,\u201d said Mr. May of Oxford Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s just so much more involved in the global supply chain. Over the last decade, it has been the spender of last resort for the global economy.\u201d\nReporting was contributed by Jack Nicas, Patricia Cohen, Emily Flitter, Ian Austen, Don Clark, Michael Corkery, Julie Creswell, Neal E.

        "title": "She Wants to Break Up Big Everything",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 One night five years ago, Sarah Miller, a former Treasury Department aide, was trying to make sense of an economic recovery that had left the country in the grips of rising inequality.\nThinking back to recent news articles about corporate mergers, she Googled \u201cmonopolies in America.\u201d Her screen filled with links to articles detailing a nascent school of thinking that corporate concentration was to blame for inequality, and that a century-old approach to antitrust laws could help solve it.\nAs she read more, she felt she had found the absent piece of a puzzle. \u201cThis is probably a big deal,\u201d Ms. Miller, now 37, remembered thinking.\nIt is now common to hear Democratic presidential candidates argue that tech companies like Facebook and Google are too powerful. The Trump administration, too, isinvestigating whether those businesses, as well as Apple and Amazon, have violated antitrust laws.\nMs. Miller has been central in making the issue prominent. From her onetime seat as the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group focused on antitrust, she spent three years as a thorn in Silicon Valley\u2019s side, guiding a coalition of liberal groups that demanded federal officials break up Facebook.\nNow there\u2019s opportunity to ratchet up the pressure on policymakers even more, Ms. Miller said. So she left Open Markets at the beginning of this year to lead the American Economic Liberties Project, a new organization dedicated to pushing government to confront corporate concentration.\nThe organization is aiming to spend $3 million in its first year,funded by philanthropic organizationsincluding the Omidyar Network, linked to eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\nMs. Miller is part of a broader movement among those on the left targeting corporate power, which is reaching a pivotal moment as Democratic presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts call forthe breaking up of the tech giants. Riding that wave, Ms. Miller and her fellow activists have an ambitious goal: to rewire the American economy by targeting the biggest companies in many industries, from tech to agriculture to medicine.\n\u201cThe conversation about concentrated economic power is now firmly established within the political narrative and the elite media narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position where we need to start seriously crafting regulatory and policy responses to specific problems, specific markets, specific corporate actors.\u201d\nAmerican antitrust policy has long placed the interests of consumers above those of smaller rivals \u2014 often as measured by what a product costs \u2014 a restrained approach that has allowed companies to grow into trillion-dollar giants. But that consensus is shifting among economists and policymakers.\nStill, Ms. Miller and her colleagues are threading a narrow political needle. The push for bold antitrust actionfaces resistancefrom many on the right, who argue that people like Ms. Miller exaggerate the problem they identify \u2014 and demand excessive solutions.\n\u201cThe claim that across the board you\u2019re seeing a diminution of competition in our economy because of lack of antitrust enforcement is overstated,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s law school. He added that \u201cbreaking up existing companies is not a great way to start\u201d or \u201cterribly feasible from a legal perspective.\u201d\nThe antitrust movement also has to build more support on the left.\nK. Sabeel Rahman, the president of Demos, a progressive think tank, said the antitrust movement needed \u201ca much better articulation of what the links are between concentrated corporate power and questions of racial equity and racial justice.\u201d\nMs. Miller said she disagreed with the criticism from the right.\n\u201cIf you look at meat processing, if you look at media, if you look at plagiarism detection software, if you look at baby formula, if you look at pacemakers, everywhere you look you see markets that have been rolled up and monopolized,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\nBut she concurred with those on the left that making racial justice a part of the call for antitrust reforms was vital. She said her new group would engage in conversations \u201cwith groups that look at work through a civil rights lens\u201d as it tapped into a populist anger that emerged from the financial crisis of 2008.\nMs. Miller spent 2010 to 2012 working for the Treasury Department as it managed the recovery. She said she had found herself \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdissatisfied\u201d by what she saw as the department\u2019s failure to help homeowners while shoring up big banks.\n\u201cA lot of the values that I\u2019d seen, I didn\u2019t share with people in positions of power there,\u201d she said.\nHer political education began before the crisis, on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. After Mrs. Clinton dropped out of the race, Ms. Miller was hired by John Podesta, the Democratic power broker who was leading the Center for American Progress, one of Washington\u2019s most influential progressive groups.\nThere, she met her eventual husband, Faiz Shakir, who was running the organization\u2019s blog, ThinkProgress. Mr. Podesta officiated at their wedding.Mr. Shakir now managesthe Democratic presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nIn 2015, Ms. Miller\u2019s nighttime Google search, made after reading about corporate mergers, led her to the work of Barry Lynn.\nA former reporter, Mr. Lynn had argued for years that corporate consolidation, urged on by conservative economic policies, was harming Americans \u2014 and that antitrust law was the solution. By 2015, he was running a program at New America, a progressive think tank. Ms. Miller got in touch with him.\nShe joined his team in 2017, as Mr. Lynn\u2019s program wasbecoming independentand was renamed the Open Markets Institute. It now brings in millions of dollars in funding a year and hasbeen creditedfor an outsize role in putting antitrust on the map.\nThe movement had already become adept at producing influential journalism and research, and had built some relationships with policymakers. Ms. Miller brought more muscle to the organization's public campaigning, helping to lead an anti-Facebook coalition.\nThe coalition, called Freedom From Facebook, bought an ad in 2018 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s campus newspaper when the social network\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, delivered the institution\u2019s commencement speech. It protested a company executive at a congressional hearing. At one point, a Facebook consulting firmdistributed opposition researchsuggesting that the campaign was funded by the financier George Soros.\nMr. Lynn said Ms. Miller\u2019s new group was an outgrowth of that public outreach work \u2014 and part of the broader efforts to build a long-term movement to critique corporate power.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, let 1,000 flowers bloom,\u201d he said.\nMs. Miller and her colleagues at the American Economic Liberties Project are now looking for any opportunity to translate the attention on corporate concentration into sustained momentum for their cause. They hope to organize small businesses harmed by big companies, build links between concentration and national security issues and help a potential new Democratic administration staff up. The team includes Matt Stoller, a longtime Open Markets fellow who has focused his writing \u2014 and sometimes pugilistic Twitter persona \u2014 on the monopoly issue.\nLast month, Ms. Miller met with roughly half a dozen members of her staff in a WeWork conference room, about a block from the Treasury Department, to prepare to publicly launch their group. A spreadsheet, displayed on a television screen, showed the projects the team had in the works.\nOne staff member suggested highlighting how thecoronavirus outbreakwould strain highly concentrated medical supply chains carrying goods from China to the United States. Another updated the group on proposed federal guidelines for evaluating mergers and other activity at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.\nEventually, the conversation turned to a report the group was producing: a series of graphics showing that different brands of a certain product \u2014 like eyeglasses or coffee \u2014 were, in fact, owned by a small number of conglomerates.\nThe graphics represented the group\u2019s hope that people will understand how concentration affects their lives \u2014 and be moved to do something about it.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just wonder at it for a minute,\u201d Ms. Miller said."

        "title": "Tech Companies Detect a Surge in Online Videos of Child Sexual Abuse",
        "fulltext": "The number of reported photos, videos and other materials related to online child sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent last year, an indication that many of the world\u2019s biggest technology platforms remain infested with the illegal content.\nNearly 70 million images and videos were reported tothe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for the imagery that works with law enforcement agencies.\nThe record number was driven by a surge in illegal videos, which have always been popular among sexual predators but are now more readily detected by some companies. Over 41 million videos were reported; the number five years ago was under 350,000. The companies flagged many of the same images and videos multiple times as they were shared among users.\nThe center identified to The New York Times the companies that had detected the imagery, the first time detailed company information had been released.\nFacebook reported nearly 60 million photos and videos, more than 85 percent of the total. The number reflects both its immense user base and its aggressive approach to routing out the material, but shows that offenders continue to exploit the platform. About half of the content was not necessarily illegal, according to the company, and was reported to help law enforcement with investigations. Instagram, owned by Facebook, was responsible for an additional 1.7 million photos and videos.\nIn a statement, Antigone Davis, Facebook\u2019s global head of safety, said \u201cthe size and expertise of our team, together with our sophisticated technology, have made us industry leaders in detecting, removing and reporting these images, and thwarting people from sharing them.\u201d\n\u201cWe will continue to develop the best solutions to keep more children safe,\u201d she added.\nSnapchat, Twitter and other social media companies also submitted reports of imagery. So did companies whose services include search engines and cloud storage, including Google and Microsoft. Apple, Dropbox and the chat platform Discord also detected the illegal content.\nIn all, 164 companies submitted reports.\n\u201cThese numbers show that any service provider that allows individuals to host images and videos are susceptible to child sexual exploitation material being posted,\u201d said John Shehan, a vice president at the national center.\nHe confirmed the numbers released on Friday reflected all content reported to the center, including material that \u201cmay not meet the legal definition of child pornography.\u201d\nStill, the numbers do not paint a complete picture of the problem: The industry has been plagued by uneven and inconsistent detection practices,as The Timesreported last year. Some cloud storage services, including those owned by Amazon and Microsoft, do not scan for any of the illegal content at all, while other companies, like Snap, scans for photos but not videos.\nThe data shows broad disparities in the tech industry. Google reported more than 3.5 million combined images and videos; Yahoo more than two million; and Imgur, a photo-sharing site, more than 260,000. Dropbox, Microsoft, Snap and Twitter are the only other companies that reported more than 100,000 images and videos last year.\nApple reported dramatically fewer images than most other tech giants, just over 3,000 in total, and zero videos. These figures reflect the company\u2019s inability to scan material sent through its messaging app, which is encrypted, as well as the fact that it does not scan its file storage service, iCloud. Amazon, whose cloud services handle millions of uploads and downloads every second, sent no images or videos to the national center.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who has sponsored child protection legislation and was recently part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who asked36 tech companiesto detail their efforts in this area, called the numbers \u201cappalling and astonishing.\u201d\n\u201cThe disparate data reported here shows that we clearly cannot rely on tech companies to self-police,\u201d he said.\nAlex Stamos, who served as chief of information security at both Facebook and Yahoo, said the numbers were a reflection of companies that have put more effort into finding and removing the material from their platforms.\n\u201cI hope these numbers encourage people to do more, not less,\u201d Mr. Stamos said.\nLast year, there was actually a decrease in the total number of reports filed with the national center, falling to 16.9 million from 18.4 million in 2018. That was at least in part because tech companies improved their reporting process by bundling photos and videos instead of flagging them individually.\nA single report usually includes multiple photos and videos \u2014 for example, when the material is found in someone\u2019s email account \u2014 so the overall growth in reported imagery may signal \u201cthose that are sharing it are sharing in larger volumes,\u201d said Mr. Shehan of the national center.\nSome companies that made a small number of reports ended up finding a large volume of imagery. Dropbox, for instance, made roughly 5,000 reports last year but found over 250,000 photos and videos. For victims of child sexual abuse, the recirculating imagery can cause lasting trauma. Online offenders are known to seek out children in the photos and videos, even into adulthood. Victims, or the parents of abused minors, also receive legal notices when their images are found during investigations, serving as constant reminders of their pain.\n\u201cTo know that these images are online and that other people are enjoying your degradation for sexual gratification in some ways means you are forever being abused,\u201d said Alicia Kozakiewicz, a survivor of child sexual abuse who has been a longtime internet safety educator.\nThe growth in reported imagery, however, does not offer insights into whether more of the illegal content is being newly produced and posted online. Most imagery is detected by tech companies through automated scans that only recognize previously flagged material. And detecting videos, which last year for the first time surpassed the number of photos, is particularly difficult because the industry lacks a common standard for identifying them.\nThe number of reported videos spiked in 2018 when Facebook ramped up its detection efforts. The company was responsible for more than 90 percent of reports that year, according to law enforcement officials.\nThe continued growth in reported images from Facebook is sure to increase pressure on the company, which has been generally lauded for finding and reporting the content, but announced last year that itintended to encrypt its Messenger app. In 2019, Messenger was responsible for over 80 percent of all reports made by Facebook. Encryption would make it much more difficult to detect the illegal imagery on Messenger, which was also the largest source of reported material in 2018.\nIn September,The Times reportedthat the number of reports to the national center had grown exponentially, and that the federal response was lacking despite a 2008 law meant to address what was then called an \u201cepidemic.\u201d Throughout the country, law enforcement groups charged with investigating the crimes have been overwhelmed.\nLegislationintroduced in Decemberwould extend the length of time companies are required to retain information about illegal imagery in order to give law enforcement more opportunity to investigate. A bipartisan group of lawmakers said the bill was in response to aTimes investigationrevealing that cases often went cold after companies deleted the data. A draft of otherproposed legislationis aimed at making companies follow a set of best practices to police imagery on their platforms or risk greater legal liability.\nEven as the number of reported images and videos continues to grow, it remains difficult to assess the scope of the problem. While more companies are making efforts to detect the content, encrypted technologies and the dark web allow predators to continue trading imagery in secret.\n\u201cIf all of the companies involved were looking as aggressively as Facebook, that number of reports could be 50 million or 100 million,\u201d Mr. Stamos said.\ntranscript\nIt\u2019s not altogether uncommon in investigations for us to turn up information that is shocking and disturbing. The challenge is when, in the course of your reporting, you come across something so depraved and so shocking that it demands attention. People have to know about this, but nobody wants to hear about it.\nHow do you tell that story?\nFrom the New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\nToday: A monthslong Times investigation uncovers a digital underworld of child sexual abuse imagery that is hiding in plain sight. In part one, my colleagues Michael Keller and Gabriel Dance on the almost unfathomable scale of the problem \u2014 and just how little is being done to stop it.\nIt\u2019s Wednesday, February 19.\nGabriel, tell me how this investigation first got started.\nSo it all began with a tip. Early last year, we got a tip from a guy, and this guy was looking up bullets.\nBullets for guns.\nBullets for guns. And he was actually looking for a very specific weight of bullet on Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine. And while he was looking up these bullets, he started getting results of children being sexually abused.\nAnd the guy was horrified. He didn\u2019t understand why he was seeing these images, couldn\u2019t stand to look at them. And so he reported it to Bing \u2014 and heard nothing. And full of outrage, he writes us a letter to our tip line and described what he was looking for, described the kind of images he was getting back. He says, New York Times, can you please look into this for me?\nSo I actually emailed my colleague Michael Keller and asked him to look into it.\nSo in the tip, they had listed the search terms they\u2019d used. So we tried to replicate it. We put it into Bing. And we saw a flash on the screen of images of children. And so I wrote back to Gabe and said, yeah, this checks out. You could type words into Bing and get back explicit images of children.\nSo this is not the dark web. This is just a regular, commonplace search engine.\nThat\u2019s right. So a few things went through my head. First of all is, what we need to document this. Because, as most of us know, things on the internet change all the time. It\u2019s possible they came down soon after, etc. But we were very unsure what kind of legal liabilities we had when it came to documenting anything regarding this imagery. So we emailed Dave McCraw, who\u2019s the head counsel at The New York Times, to ask him, you know, what can we do? What can\u2019t we do? How do we go about investigating where this imagery is online?\nAnd doing it without somehow violating the law.\nThat\u2019s right. And David wrote back immediately and said, there is no journalistic privilege when investigating this. You have no protections. And you have to report it immediately to the F.B.I.\nAnd so that\u2019s what we did. We submitted a report both to the F.B.I. and also to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is the kind of government-designated clearinghouse for a lot of these reports.\nAnd what did they tell you?\nThey weren\u2019t able to tell us anything about the report we submitted. But it made us wonder, how common is it that they get these kinds of reports? How many images are out there? How many images are flagged to them each year? And they were able to tell us that. And that number was frankly shocking to us.\nThe handful of images that the tipster stumbled across was just a tiny portion of what the National Center sees every single day. They told us that in 2018 alone, they received over 45 million images and videos.\nWow.\n45 million images a year. That\u2019s more than 120,000 images and videos of children being sexually abused every day. Every single day. But to put it in perspective, 10 years ago, there were only 600,000 images and videos reported to the National Center. And at that time, they were calling it an epidemic.\nSo in just a decade, it went from 600,000 reports to 45 million?\nYeah. So we were really curious \u2014 how does a problem called an epidemic 10 years ago become such a massive issue now?\nAnd one of the first things we learned was that we did try and tackle it back then.\nThe national epidemic of grown men using the internet to solicit underage teens for sex. As more and more parents become aware of the dangers, so have lawmakers in Washington.\nIn the mid to late 2000s, as the internet was being more widely adopted, this issue of online child sexual abuse really got on the radar of Congress. There was even a bill being introduced by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nThe internet has facilitated an exploding multibillion-dollar market for child pornography.\nThere were multiple hearings.\nI\u2019m here today to testify about what many of my law enforcement colleagues are not free to come here and tell you.\nThey heard from law enforcement.\nWe are overwhelmed. We are underfunded. And we are drowning in a tidal wave of tragedy.\nThey were overwhelmed with the number of reports that were coming in.\nUnless and until the funding is made available to aggressively investigate and prosecute possession of child pornography, federal efforts will be hopelessly diluted.\nThey in many cases had the tools to see where offenders were, but not enough staff to actually go out and arrest the perpetrators.\nWe don\u2019t have the resources we need to save these children.\nHello. Thank you for inviting me to speak today. My name is Alicia Kozakiewicz. A Pittsburgh resident, I am 19 years old and a sophomore in college.\nThere was also a very chilling testimony from a victim of child sexual abuse.\nFor the benefit of those of you who don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember those headlines, I am that 13-year-old girl who was lured by an internet predator and enslaved by a sadistic pedophile monster. In the beginning, I chatted for months with Christine, a beautiful, red-haired 14-year-old girl, and we traded our school pictures. Too bad that hers were fake. Yeah, Christine was really a middle-aged pervert named John. And he had lots of practice at his little masquerade because he had it all down. The abbreviations, the music, the slang, the clothes \u2014 he knew it all. John slash Christine was to introduce me to a great friend of hers. This man was to be my abductor, my torturer. I met him on the evening of January 1, 2002. Imagine, suddenly you\u2019re in the car, terrified, and he\u2019s grabbing onto your hand and crushing it. And you cry out, but there\u2019s no one to hear. In between the beatings and the raping, he will hang you by your arms while beating you, and he will share his prized pictures with his friends over the internet.\nThe boogeyman is real, and he lives on the net. He lived in my computer, and he lives in yours. While you are sitting here, he\u2019s at home with your children.\nTask forces all over this country are poised to capture him, to put him in that prison cell with the man who hurt me. They can do it. They want to do it. Don\u2019t you?\n\nAlicia\u2019s testimony really moved people. People responded. And eventually, about a year later, the bill passes unanimously.\nAnd what is this new law supposed to do?\nSo this law, the 2008 Protect Our Children Act, is actually a pretty formidable law with some pretty ambitious goals.\nIt was supposed to, for the first time ever, secure tens of millions of dollars in annual funding for investigators working on this issue. And it required the Department of Justice to really study the problem and put out reports to outline a strategy to tackle it.\nAnd what has happened since this ambitious law was put into place?\nIn many ways, the problem has only gotten worse. Even though the number of reports has grown into the millions, funding is still pretty much what it was 10 years ago. And even though the government was supposed to do these regular reports, they\u2019ve only done two in 10 years. And that\u2019s an issue, because if you don\u2019t have anyone studying the size of the problem, you don\u2019t have anyone one raising alarm bells and saying, hey, we need more resources for this.\nSo they didn\u2019t study it. And they didn\u2019t increase the funding in a way that would match the scale at which the problem is growing.\nYeah. It really looked like they had this law in 2008, and then everyone really took their eye off the ball. So we called Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was one of the leading proponents of this bill, to figure out what happened.\nAnd we are really gobsmacked to hear that she\u2019s unaware of the extent of the failings. She sends a letter to Attorney General William Barr laying out a lot of our findings, requesting an accounting. As far as we know, she hasn\u2019t heard anything.\nSo even the person who co-wrote the law was unaware that it was pretty much failing.\nShe knew about the funding, but even she didn\u2019t know that things had gotten this bad.\nAnd we wanted to figure out now, 10 years later, what kind of effect is this having to law enforcement, to the people on the ground working these cases? And what we heard from them really shows what happens when everyone looks away.\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nGabriel, Michael \u2014 what happens when you start reaching out to law enforcement?\nSo Mike and I probably spoke with about 20 different Internet Crimes Against Children task forces. And these are the law enforcement agencies responsible with investigating child sexual abuse. To be honest, most of the time, as an investigative reporter, generally law enforcement \u2014 I mean, generally anybody, but especially law enforcement \u2014 is not particularly interested in speaking with us. Usually, they don\u2019t see much to gain. But surprisingly, when it came to this issue, they were not only willing to speak with us, but they were interested in speaking with us.\nWhy do you think that was?\nIt\u2019s partly because we were using the right terminology. And by that I mean, we were asking them about child sexual abuse imagery, not child pornography.\nAnd what exactly is the distinction?\nWell, legally, they\u2019re basically the same. But for the people who deal with this type of crime day in, day out, who see these images and who speak with survivors, they know that calling it child pornography implies a bunch of things that are generally incorrect.\nOne is that it equates it with the adult pornography industry, which is legal and made up of consenting adults, whereas children cannot consent to the sexual behavior. The other thing is that the crimes depicted are heinous, and that each one of them is essentially looking at a crime scene.\nAnd for that reason, they prefer to call it child sexual abuse imagery. But I think they also talked to us, because for the law enforcement who deal with this, they very much feel that the issue is under-covered and under-discussed, especially considering the seriousness of the crime. I mean, we had the kind of coordination and cooperation from these law enforcement officers that we rarely see from anybody whatsoever. They let us go out on raids with them. They provided us with detailed reports. They talked to us about specific cases. They were really, really open, because they felt that as a nation, we were turning our backs on children, essentially.\nAnd once you have that access, what do you find?\nWhat we learned talking with all these law enforcement officers was just how this world operates. A lot of the departments told us about the high levels of turnover they have. We had one commander who said, back when he was an investigator, he saw one image that was so shocking to him, he quit and served a tour in Iraq. That was his escape.\nTo even see this imagery once changes your life. And these people look at it all day long. And then on top of that, they have to deal with the fact that their funding has not gone up whatsoever. They\u2019re being funded at a level that means they can\u2019t do proactive investigations anymore. So they\u2019re not sitting in chat rooms trying to catch what many of them think are the worst criminals. They\u2019re unable to do anything, really, then respond to the utter flood of reports coming in from the National Center. And because of the sheer number of reports coming in, they\u2019re forced to make some truly terrible decisions on how to prioritize who they\u2019re investigating.\nLike what?\nThe F.B.I. told us that in addition to, of course, looking for anybody who\u2019s in immediate danger, they have to prioritize infants and toddlers. When we first got into this, we didn\u2019t even consider the idea of infants. And to hear that the F.B.I. \u2014 and later L.A.P.D. would say the same thing \u2014 we\u2019re prioritizing infants and toddlers, and essentially not able to respond to reports of anybody older than that. I mean, it really left us pretty speechless.\nSo we\u2019re learning a lot from speaking with law enforcement. But they also only have a small part of the picture. We also are thinking about this tip that we got, where the tipster was able just to find these images on search engines very easily. And so we still have this big question of how easy is it to come across this material.\nAnd how do you go about answering that question?\nWhen we initially started trying to replicate the tipster\u2019s search, we had to stop because we didn\u2019t want to be searching for these illegal images. But then we discovered a technology that would allow us to keep investigating without having to look at the images. It\u2019s called PhotoDNA. And it essentially creates a unique digital fingerprint for each image. And as the National Center is receiving these reports and identifying these illegal images of child sexual abuse, they keep track of these digital fingerprints. And other companies can tap into that database to see, is this image that I have, is it in that database of known images? And we stumbled upon a service from Microsoft that actually allows you to do just that. It\u2019ll take a URL of an image and tell you if it matches an image already in that database. So we wrote a computer program that would replicate that initial search from the tipster, record all of the URLs. The key part of it, though, was that it blocked all images.\nSo suddenly you can now search for these images, and find where they live on the internet, without illegally looking at them.\nRight. So we started doing this test across a number of different search engines.\nAnd to sit there and watch as the program starts ticking away, and see the first time it flashes that it got a match, and then to see a match again \u2014\nBing, from Microsoft.\n\u2014 and match again \u2014\nYahoo.\n\u2014 and match again \u2014\nAnother one called DuckDuckGo.\n\u2014 I mean, I think both our jaws dropped.\nWe didn\u2019t find any on Google. But on other search engines powered by Microsoft data, we found a number of matches.\nDozens, dozens of images.\nYou\u2019re saying the company that came up with this technology to help track these images is the very same company whose search engine allows people to find them, view them, keep viewing them.\nRight. As soon as we started running this computer program using Microsoft to detect illegal imagery, we were finding illegal imagery on Microsoft. So it was very clear that they were not using their own services to protect users from this type of image.\nAnd Microsoft told us that this was the result of a bug that they fixed. But about a week later, we reran the test and found even more images.\nWow. So it sounds like you\u2019re finding all these images on Microsoft-powered search engines. So how much of this, in the end, is just a Microsoft problem?\nIt\u2019s more complicated than that. We were performing this limited search just to test search engines on images. But we\u2019re also, at the same time, reading over 10,000 pages of court documents. These are search warrants and subpoenas from cases where people were caught trading this material.\nAnd what becomes clear pretty quickly is that every major tech company is implicated. In page after page after page, we see social media platforms \u2014\nFacebook, Kik, Tumblr.\nWe see cloud storage companies \u2014\nGoogle Drive, Dropbox. We read one case where an offender went on a Facebook group to ask for advice from other people \u2014 say, hey, how do I share this? How do I get access to it? How do I get access to children? And they say, download Kik to talk to the kids and download Dropbox. And we can share links with you.\nWow.\nAnd from these documents, it becomes clear that the companies know. I mean, there\u2019s so many cases for each company that they all know. And so the question becomes, what are they doing about it?\n\nTomorrow on \u201cThe Daily,\u201d a victim\u2019s family asks that same question.\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. President Trump has granted clemency to a new round of high profile individuals, including Bernie Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who was convicted on eight felony charges, including tax fraud. Michael Milken, the financier convicted of insider trading, and Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, who was convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat after he became president.\nYes, we have commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich. He served eight years in jail, a long time.\nAsked about Blagojevich, who Trump ordered released from prison four years early, the president mentioned his wife\u2019s public pleas on Fox News and Blagojevich\u2019s appearance on Trump\u2019s NBC TV show \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d\nI watched his wife on television. I don\u2019t know him very well, I met him a couple of times. He was on, for a short while, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d years ago. Seemed like a very nice person.\nAnd on Tuesday, after a new poll showed him surging in the Democratic primary race, Michael Bloomberg qualified for the next presidential debate, scheduled for tonight in Las Vegas. The poll, conducted by NPR, PBS and Marist College, showed Bloomberg with 19 percent support, putting him in second place behind Bernie Sanders.\nThat\u2019s it for \u201cThe Daily.\u201d I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\ntranscript\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Yesterday, my colleagues Michael Keller and Gabriel Dance described the government\u2019s failure to crack down on the explosive growth of child sexual abuse imagery online. Today: The role of the nation\u2019s biggest tech companies and why \u2014 despite pleas from victims \u2014 those illicit images can still be found online.\nIt\u2019s Thursday, February 20.\nWould it be possible \u2014 I don\u2019t want it to get too sticky, but for the sound, the \u2014\nI can turn it down, we\u2019ll just get warm.\nIf it\u2019s too warm \u2014\nLast summer, Gabriel and I got on a plane and flew out to the West Coast to meet in a lawyer\u2019s office to speak with the family that she\u2019d been representing.\nAs Mike said, like, once we started looking into it, there\u2019s so many facets.\nSo we explained to them a little bit about our reporting and why it was so important that we speak with them.\nYeah, we\u2019re here to answer your questions, too, I mean, as best we can.\nAnd who is this family?\nAll we can say is that this is a mom and a stepdad who live on the West Coast. And that\u2019s because they only felt comfortable speaking with us if we could protect their privacy.\nI mean, we started this not knowing anything about it. And I might get emotional here but \u2014 you know, as parents, we\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s the best way for our kid to deal with this.\nAnd they started to tell us a story about what happened to their daughter.\nIt was August 21, 2013. I was at work. She was shopping with our two middle children and \u2014\nSo one day, six years ago, the mom is out with her kids, doing some back to school shopping, and she gets a call from the police. And they tell her she has to come in immediately.\nJust odd. An odd call \u2014\nIt was very weird to get a call.\n\u2014 to get a phone call from a detective saying, you need to come down to the station right now. We need to talk to you. We feel your kids are in danger. And I\u2019m like, what?\nShe called me panicked, going they want to talk to us. Go talk to them. We don\u2019t have anything \u2014 we\u2019re not criminals, so.\nIt was just odd.\nSo she goes into the sheriff\u2019s office.\nAnd there\u2019s this F.B.I. agent, introduces himself. He said, you know, we think your children are in danger from their father, particularly the youngest one. And I was just shocked and had no idea what they were talking about. No idea. Mind you, I had my two other kids who I was shopping with, were in the room next door, playing or doing something, I don\u2019t know what they do. And he just went on to say that we\u2019re going to start investigating him, or we\u2019ve been investigating him.\nAnd there\u2019ll be an agent at our house Friday to tell us more.\nMhm.\nAnd she showed up Friday morning, August 23, 9:00 in the morning. Can I talk to you outside? And we talk outside. And she drops this bomb on us.\nAnd what the agent tells her is that her children\u2019s biological father had been sexually abusing her youngest child, starting at the age of four years old and going on for four years. And not only that, he had been documenting this abuse with photos and videos and had been posting them online.\nSo I remember that moment. I mean, I think I kind of doubled over or something. I was just shocked. I asked, when did this start? How long has this been going on? How did I not know? I\u2019m mom. So all of those questions and all those feelings, and I mean everything just came crashing down.\nWhat does this couple tell their children at this point?\nThe F.B.I. agent said, actually, it\u2019s better if I\u2019m the one to tell your kids.\nIn her experience, it would be best for the news to come from her, as opposed for me telling the kids directly that their dad was arrested, because kids might blame me and point the finger. I said, yeah, whatever you think.\nShe passed around her F.B.I. badge and showed the kids and built a rapport with them, and then \u2014\nShe said, you know, your dad has been arrested. I don\u2019t think we even talked about what it was for or why he was arrested, just that he was arrested and they\u2019re still investigating.\nRight.\nYou know, even to this day, I think about \u2014 again, I was married to this guy. How did I miss that? Still. And this is six years later. You know, how did I miss that? So there is a piece of that guilt that\u2019s always going to be there, I think. [SIGHS]\nYeah.\nBut it isn\u2019t your fault.\nAnd just \u2014\nIt\u2019s not your fault.\n(CRYING) And how could somebody do that to their own child?\nI still \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand a person like that.\n\nShe\u2019s just now developmentally dealing with the effects of it. She\u2019s angry, and she\u2019s acting out and \u2014\nHer daughter is now a young teenager \u2014\nShe\u2019s in counseling now, you know, so \u2014\n\u2014 and has a counselor, and is not only dealing with all of the normal things that young teenagers have to deal with, but the trauma of being sexually abused at such a young age.\nSo that\u2019s something she\u2019s just now having to learn how to say no, how to inform others that she\u2019s not comfortable with something. And she\u2019s only 13.\nAnd meanwhile, even though the physical abuse ended six years ago, the images continue to circulate to this day. And the parents know that because they get notified whenever someone is arrested having these images in their possession.\nAnd why would they be notified? What\u2019s the point? It feels like it would just be a horrendous reminder every time that this is still happening.\nOne of the abilities that victims of this crime have is to seek restitution from the offenders. So when they\u2019re notified, they and their lawyers can petition the court to get a certain sum of money, which is a really good thing. And helps to rectify some of the damage that was done.\nBut Mike, you\u2019re right.\nOh my gosh, this person in Kansas and New York. Somebody in Wisconsin saw my kid, and oh my god.\nIt is a brutal, double-edged sword, these notifications.\nOh my god. There\u2019s people out there who know about this, and they can watch it over and over.\nAnd for this young woman, her parents and their lawyer received more than 350 notices in just the last four years.\nWow. So something on the order of 100 times a year, somebody is convicted of having looked at these photos of their daughter?\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nWhat do you think should be kind of in the front of our minds? What do you think is really important for us to understand?\nThe internet technology companies need to really do something about this, because \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just \u2014\nI don\u2019t know enough about technology, but I just \u2014 where is this crap, you know?\nCertainly for the stepfather, his question, which is a legitimate question, is \u2014\nHow do we get it off?\n\u2014 why can\u2019t they just take it down?\nHow do we, how do we make it go away?\nAnd that\u2019s the same question we had. Why, six years later, are these images and videos still showing up on some of the largest technology platforms in the world?\nFigure it out. We\u2019ve got this technology. We can go to the moon and Mars and stuff. We can get this crap off the web.\nAnd are the companies doing enough to prevent it?\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nGabriel, Michael, how do you begin to answer these parents\u2019 very reasonable questions about why these images of their child\u2019s sexual abuse keep showing up online?\nSo before we can answer the question of why these images keep showing up, we needed to understand where the images were online and what companies were responsible for people sharing them. But the National Center, which you\u2019ll remember is the designated clearinghouse for this information, wouldn\u2019t tell us.\nBut they know, right? So why wouldn\u2019t they tell you? Why wouldn\u2019t they give you that information?\nPart of the reason why they don\u2019t divulge these numbers is because the companies are not required by law to look for these images.\nIt\u2019s voluntary.\nIt\u2019s voluntary to look for them.\nRight. Without the help of these companies, they have no idea where these images are, where they\u2019re coming from, how many of them there are.\nThat\u2019s right. And the National Center is concerned that if they disclose these numbers, that they might damage those relationships which they depend on.\nMhm.\nBut then we start to hear anecdotally that there is one company responsible for the majority of the reports. And that was Facebook. So we are doing everything we can to run down that number. But very few people know it. However, we ultimately do find somebody who has documentation that reveals that number.\nSo in 2018, the National Center received over 18.4 million reports of illegal imagery. And the number this person provides us shows that of those 18.4 million, nearly 12 million came from Facebook Messenger.\nWow. So the vast majority of them.\nAlmost two out of every three reports came from Facebook Messenger.\nSo just that one service of Facebook.\nThat\u2019s right, just the chat application. This doesn\u2019t include groups or wall posts or any of the other public information that you might post or share. This is specifically from the chat application.\nBut then, after we reported that number, the D.O.J. actually comes out and says that Facebook in total \u2014 so Messenger plus the other parts of the platform \u2014 are responsible for nearly 17 of the 18.4 million reports that year.\nWow. This is a Facebook problem.\nThat\u2019s what the numbers at first glance would suggest. But we realized we needed to talk to people that really understood this to know what conclusions to come to from these numbers.\n\nHello.\nSo we called up somebody who would know better than almost anybody.\nAlex.\nAlex Stamos.\nHey.\nGabe Dance. Mike Keller here.\nHey, how\u2019s it going?\nI\u2019m doing OK. I\u2019m getting back to my office.\nAlex was the former chief security officer at Facebook for the past several years. He\u2019s now a professor at Stanford University.\nSo he\u2019s somebody who very much would have seen this happening, would\u2019ve understood what was going on inside Facebook when it comes to child sexual abuse.\nAbsolutely.\nYou\u2019ve obviously worked on this area for years. Facebook is, Facebook Messenger is responsible for about 12 million of the 18.4 million reports last year to the National Center. That seems like a lot. Can you help us understand what\u2019s happening on that platform?\nYeah, so we\u2019ve been discussing one very important number \u2014 18.4 million, which is that the number of \u2014\nSo Stamos tells us something that actually is a little counterintuitive. That this huge number of reports coming from the company \u2014\nThat\u2019s not because Facebook has the majority of abuse. It\u2019s because Facebook does the most detection.\nIt\u2019s them working the hardest to find this type of content and report it.\nI expect that pretty much any platform that allows the sharing of files is going to be absolutely infested with child sexual abuse. If everybody was doing the same level of detection, we\u2019d probably be in the hundreds of millions of reports.\nWhat is he telling you? That of the 18 million, the reason why Facebook has so many is because other companies are not reporting this at all?\nEssentially, yes. What he\u2019s saying is that Facebook is reporting such a high number of images and videos because they\u2019re looking for them. And that a lot of other companies aren\u2019t even doing that.\nFacebook checks effectively every image that transfers across the platform in an unencrypted manner to see whether or not it is known child sexual abuse material.\nEvery single time somebody uploads a photo or a video to Facebook, it\u2019s scanned against a database of previously identified child sexual abuse imagery. And in doing so, Facebook is finding far, far more of this content than any other company.\nSo he\u2019s saying don\u2019t shoot the messenger here.\nThat\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. So as of now, this is the best method these companies have to identify and remove the imagery.\nMhm. What Facebook is doing?\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t every technology company do this? It seems pretty straightforward.\nWell, the short answer is that it\u2019s not baked into the business model.\nMhm.\nThat this is not something that helps them grow their base of users. It\u2019s not something that provides any source of revenue. And it\u2019s in fact something that works against both of those things, if done correctly.\nWhat do you mean?\nWell, every time Facebook detects one of these images, they shut down that account. But most \u2014\nYou\u2019re deleting your own users.\nThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re deleting your own users. And it costs money to delete your own users.\nRight. You have to spend money to hire people to find accounts that are doing something wrong that you\u2019re then going to lose as a customer.\nYou got it. So both of those things fly in the face of almost all of these companies\u2019 business models. And Stamos actually told us something else interesting.\nThe truth is that the tech industry is still pretty immature at the highest levels about the interaction between executives.\nAnd that\u2019s that these companies aren\u2019t really working together to solve this problem.\nYou know, if you look at, say, the banking industry, these big investment banks, the C.E.O.s hate each other. But they understand that their boats all rise and fall together, and so they are able to work together on what kind of regulation they\u2019d like to see. But a lot of the top executives at the tech companies really kind of personally despise one another. And it is very difficult to get them to agree to anything from a policy perspective.\nAnd in our reporting, we found some pretty egregious disparities in how different companies police this on their platforms. Amazon, who has a massive cloud storage business, for example \u2014 they handle millions of uploads and download a day \u2014 they don\u2019t scan whatsoever. Apple has an encrypted messaging platform, so that doesn\u2019t get scanned. They also choose not to scan their photos in iCloud. Snapchat, Yahoo, they don\u2019t scan for videos at all, even though everyone knows video is a big part of the problem. And it\u2019s not because the solutions don\u2019t exist, they just have chosen not to implement them.\nAnd now Facebook, the company looking for this content most aggressively, is starting to rethink its policy in doing that. Over the last few years, a lot of tech companies have realized that privacy is an important feature that a lot of their customers are expecting. And citing privacy concerns, Facebook announced that it will soon encrypt its entire Messenger platform, which would effectively blind them to doing any type of automated scanning between chat \u2014 which, again, was responsible for nearly 12 million of those 18.4 million reports.\nSo they would stop searching for this child sexual abuse material?\nRight. They would limit their own ability to be aware of it.\nAnd privacy is important enough that they would handicap their ability to find this criminal conduct and these horrible photos?\nBased on the criticism that a lot of tech companies have received over the last few years, moving towards encryption is a really attractive option for them. Because it lets them say, we really care about the privacy of your conversations, and we\u2019re going to make that more secure.\nGabriel, it occurs to me that the debate over privacy is enormous and loud. We\u2019ve done episodes of \u201cThe Daily\u201d about it, many episodes of \u201cThe Daily\u201d about it. But the child sexual abuse subject is not as well-known. It\u2019s not as widely debated. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019re talking about it. Is that reflected in this decision, the attention that these two subjects get?\nIt is. And in fact, it\u2019s one of the main reasons we chose this line of reporting. The issue of child sexual abuse imagery really brings the privacy issue to a head, because we\u2019re forced with these very, very stark decisions that we\u2019re discussing here right now. Which is that, is it more important to encrypt the communications on a platform where it\u2019s well known that children interact with adults? Is it worth it to encrypt those communications to protect people\u2019s privacy when we know what the ramifications for children are?\nBut the child protection question is also a privacy question. And when you are Facebook and you\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to encrypt conversations for the privacy of our users, the child advocates will say, well, but you\u2019re doing nothing to protect the privacy of the child in the image.\nIn fact, you\u2019re making it harder for their life to ever be private.\nExactly.\nAnd this means that next year, or whenever Facebook moves ahead with its plan to encrypt, they won\u2019t be sending nearly 17 million reports to the National Center. They\u2019ll be sending far fewer.\nRight.\nAnd that means for the family that we spoke with on the West Coast, who is receiving about 100 notifications a year that someone has been caught with images and videos of their daughter, they\u2019ll likely be getting far fewer notifications. But not because people aren\u2019t looking at these images. They still will be \u2014 the family just won\u2019t know about it.\nThat\u2019s my big thing. I want people to care about this, because there is a human factor to this obviously. We have to force people to look at it, you know, the tech companies. They have to do something about it.\nSo where does that leave this family now?\nThey feel abandoned and angry with the tech companies.\nThey have to do something about it, because knowing that that\u2019s out there, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just being traumatized all over again.\nThey keep getting these notifications that their daughter\u2019s imagery has been found.\nIt\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s lifelong. There\u2019s nothing they can do about being a victim for the rest of their life.\nAnd the way they describe it is it\u2019s like getting hit by a truck.\nThey can\u2019t stop being in a car wreck every day.\nOnly to get back up and get hit by a truck time after time after time.\nThere\u2019s no, there\u2019s no other way to say it. She\u2019s \u2014 that will be there forever until it\u2019s removed, until somebody comes up with a way to take that off.\nAnd so, what this family has decided is that \u2014\nShe doesn\u2019t know.\n\u2014 they\u2019re not telling their daughter. They\u2019re not going to tell her that her images are online.\nThere\u2019s no good it would do. There\u2019s no benefit, at least from our perspective, to tell her. I mean, she needs to worry about soccer and \u2014\nMaking the team. She worries about sleepovers and wrestling, grades.\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be worrying about the worst part of her life available on the internet.\nI don\u2019t want her to be fearful of what other people \u2014\nMight see.\n\u2014 might be seeing of her \u2014\nBe recognized.\n\u2014 when they do a Google search for a bullet, up pops her image. That\u2019s horrible.\nBut there is a clock ticking.\nI just found out when she turns 18, it isn\u2019t a choice. The F.B.I. will get ahold of her, because she\u2019s an adult victim now.\nWhen she turns 18, the federal government is going to start sending her the notifications. So what they\u2019re hoping is that in the four years until that happens, the tech companies are going to solve this problem.\nWhich is to say, get these images offline for good.\nThat\u2019s what they hope.\nMy motivation for this is we have to explain to our daughter, this is on the internet. And she has to live with that. But being able to tell her \u2014 you know, if you can tell me in five years, this will be something that was, not is, that\u2019d be great.\nThe dad asked us the question, can you tell me that when I talk to my daughter about this when she turns 18, that I can tell her that these horrific images used to be online but no longer are?\nAnd what did you say?\nWhat I wished I could tell them was yes.\nWell, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this story \u2014\nYeah.\n\u2014 to be honest with you, is \u2014\nWhat I did tell him was that that was the point of us doing this reporting. Was the hopes that something would change, and that in five years, those images would no longer be there.\nBut once we publish this article, and we see how they respond, and we see how, not only tech companies \u2014\nBut from everything we\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s only getting worse.\nWhat if it was your daughter?\nYeah, you know, put yourself in that kid\u2019s shoes.\nWhat if you were the person they\u2019re looking at the rest of your life? If we can tell that this happened, instead of this is happening, the world would be a lot better off. She\u2019ll be a lot better off.\n\nMichael, Gabriel, thank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nA few weeks ago, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released new data for 2019. It said that the number of photos, videos and other materials related to online child sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent to 70 million.\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\nFor highlights and analysis of Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Las Vegas, the first to include former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, listen to this morning\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Latest.\u201d You can find it on \u201cThe Daily\u201d feed or by searching for \u201cThe Latest,\u201d wherever you listen.\n\nThat\u2019s it for \u201cThe Daily.\u201d I\u2019m Michael Barbaro.

        "title": "Laurene Powell Jobs Is Putting Her Own Dent in the Universe",
        "fulltext": "Before I could interview Laurene Powell Jobs, she wanted to interview me.\nIt was an unusual request, but not a particularly surprising one coming from Ms. Powell Jobs. Nearly a decade after the death of her husband, the Apple co-founderSteve Jobs, she remains an intensely private person.\nWhen Mr. Jobs was alive, Ms. Powell Jobs stayed out of the public eye. She ran a natural food company, worked on education and immigration reform, and cared for their family. And while Ms. Powell Jobs has in recent years become increasingly ambitious with her business and philanthropy, she keeps a low profile, granting relatively few interviews and eschewing the spotlight. If she was going to agree to a sit-down, she wanted some sense of who would be asking the questions.\nSo on a cold morning late last year, we settled onto plush couches in the dimly lit drawing room of the Greenwich Hotel in New York, warmed by a raging fireplace. As she sipped green juice, we spoke about climate change, a shared interest in Buddhism and more. That conversation wasn\u2019t on the record. But two months later we settled onto the same couches, by the same fire, and this time my recorder was on.\nIt soon became clear why Ms. Powell Jobs is careful with her public appearances. In an era of tweets, she speaks in long, discursive paragraphs that weave together personal narrative, politics and her views on social change. She invokes Dante, Ralph Waldo Emerson andRoss Perotwithout irony. Her ideas are nuanced, and she doesn\u2019t pretend to have easy solutions to complex problems.\nMs. Powell Jobs also believes that, at least in some ways, her husband was misunderstood. The popular interpretation of one of his most popular quotes \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re here to put a dent in the universe\u201d \u2014 is, she contends, all wrong.\nThey met in 1989 when Mr. Jobs gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Ms. Powell Jobs was studying after a stint at Goldman Sachs. They married two years later in Yosemite National Park, hiking in the snow after the ceremony. Mr. Jobs was running NeXT at the time, having resigned from Apple years earlier. Over the next two decades, he returned to Apple, introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad.\nAs Mr. Jobs was busy upending the personal technology industry, Ms. Powell Jobs founded College Track, which helps underprivileged youths get into college, and Emerson Collective, an umbrella organization for her philanthropic and business interests.\nAfter Mr. Jobs died from cancer, in 2011, she spent several years out of public view. But more recently, Ms. Powell Jobs \u2014 the 35th-richest person in the world, worth some $27.5 billion \u2014 has begun to exert her influence.\nShe acquired Pop-Up Magazine and major stakes in the Atlantic magazine and in Monumental Sports, which owns the Washington Wizards and Mystics basketball teams and the Washington Capitals hockey team. She is working with the former education secretary Arne Duncan to reduce gun violence in Chicago. At the Sundance Film Festival this year, a new documentary studio backed by Ms. Powell Jobsmade a splash.\nIt\u2019s a diverse set of concerns, and reflects her belief that issues like poverty, education, personal health and environmental justice are all interconnected.\n\u201cWhen you pull one thread, you get the whole tapestry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working in the social sector, you actually cannot make any lasting forward movement if you\u2019re only focused on one thing.\u201d\nMs. Powell Jobs, 56, is acting with a sense of urgency these days. She believes that President Trump\u2019s statements and policies have unleashed dark forces that are tearing apart the very fabric of society.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a significant breakdown in Americans\u2019 ability to speak to one another and to hear one another,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s become much worse in the last three years, where there\u2019s been full license given to the otherization of our neighbor.\u201d\nHer conviction has brought Ms. Powell Jobs off the sidelines and into some of the most contentious political fights of the day. A longtime supporter of people brought into the United States as children, known as Dreamers, shebought television adsopposing Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to end a program that gave the group temporary protection from deportation. Last year,she saidMr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the media were \u201cright out of a dictator\u2019s playbook,\u201d and went on to givea speechdefending independent journalism.\nAs someone attuned to society\u2019s structural inequalities, Ms. Powell Jobs grasps the immensity of her privilege. She is a Silicon Valley billionaire, pushing back against the wealthy occupant of the White House. The very fact that such fortunes exist while others struggle to get by strikes her as unjust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right for individuals to accumulate a massive amount of wealth that\u2019s equivalent to millions and millions of other people combined,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing fair about that.\u201d\nAnd yet Ms. Powell Jobs is hardly apologetic. \u201cI inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn\u2019t care about the accumulation of wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cI am doing this in honor of his work, and I\u2019ve dedicated my life to doing the very best I can to distribute it effectively, in ways that lift up individuals and communities in a sustainable way.\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in legacy wealth buildings, and my children know that,\u201d she added. \u201cSteve wasn\u2019t interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.\u201d\nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\nWhat was your childhood like?\nI grew up in northwestern New Jersey, on a small lake. Behind my house were five miles of watershed property, all wooded with some large boulders. The lake was frozen in the winter, when we ice skated, and was swimmable and navigable by boat. We had a canoe and this little Sunfish, so I learned the basics of sailing.\nThe physical environment was a huge influence for me. My mother felt very strongly that kids needed to be outside in the fresh air. If I would try to sneak inside and read a book, she would catch me and lock away my books and force me outside. Just being outside and being surrounded by nature was a big, formative part of me.\nHow did you spend your time when you weren\u2019t outside?\nI was an early reader. In the first grade, my teacher brought me to the library, and that was my key to the wonderment of the written word. I took adventures everywhere outside of my little town in New Jersey through books, and it gave me a whole sense of the world and what was going on, and also what was possible for me.\nSchool was a happy place for me. I ended up going to a good college, even though my high school wasn\u2019t particularly outstanding. But there was a library, and everywhere I\u2019ve gone in my life, the library was the place where I felt most happy.\nI know your father was a military pilot and died in a plane collision. How did losing him so early affect the family?\nMy father died the day before his 31st birthday, when I was 3. My mom remarried, so we had a blended family growing up. My stepfather was a high school guidance counselor, and my mother was a substitute teacher for a long time.\nIt\u2019s quite a world-shaping event when you lose a parent in a tragic accident. All of us, my siblings and I, grew up knowing the impermanence of this existence. And while that\u2019s very difficult for a child to make sense of, it\u2019s the greatest blessing of my life, that I understand the temporal nature of our existence deeply, and the fragility of everything that we witness. To have the gift of the day is a very real and profound thing.\nWhat was your first job?\nIf we wanted money for anything, we had to earn it. My brothers all had paper routes, and I inherited one of them when I was really young. And then I tried everything that a child can do and get paid for it. On snow days, we\u2019d shovel people\u2019s driveways. I was a babysitter. I was a lifeguard. I was a swim instructor. When I turned 16, I first was a bus girl and then a waitress. And then for college, I had to use every source of revenue I could find: loans, scholarships, work-study and more waitressing.\nHow did you first get involved with social welfare issues?\nWhen I moved to California from New York, I lived in Palo Alto, which is right next door to East Palo Alto. It was a situation where there was one side of the community that was low income, and it has entirely different human outcomes than the other side of the town that might as well be hundreds of miles away. We know about this kind of dichotomy that exists in American cities, and Palo Alto and East Palo Alto are as divided and separated as any of these.\nThe air quality in East Palo Alto is worse than anywhere around. The land is poisoned. A lot of the Silicon Valley fabricators have used it as their dumping ground over the years. There\u2019s arsenic in the water table.\nI was completely taken with this notion that there were communities two miles away from my house that, by bad design and bad information flows, had no chance. It was a structural deficit, and structural deficits actually need to be restructured. Ross Perot had a saying that went something like \u201cNever forget there is a child on the streets in Calcutta today who\u2019s dying and who was way smarter than you.\u201d\nThis is your story, but how did Steve influence your thinking on these issues?\nI can talk about him for hours. I met Steve when I was 25 years old. And from the day we met, we were together for 22 years. So he influenced everything. I grew up with him. Just like anyone that you share your life with, there\u2019s an exchange and a robustness. We had a very, very beautiful and rich connection. We talked a lot, for hours every day. To pull out any one way in which he affected my worldview is impossible, because I have integrated so much of him.\nOne profound learning I took from him was that we don\u2019t have to accept the world that we\u2019re born into as something that is fixed and impermeable. When you zoom in, it\u2019s just atoms just like us. And they move all the time. And through energy and force of will and intention and focus, we can actually change it. Move it.\nPeople love to quote him saying, \u201cPut a dent in the universe.\u201d But that\u2019s too flippant. It\u2019s too cavalier. He was thinking of it as \u201cWe are able, each of us, to manipulate the circumstances.\u201d I think about it as looking at the design of the structures and systems that govern our society, and changing those structures. Because those structures, when they\u2019re elegantly designed, should be frictionless for people. They shouldn\u2019t require you to make huge course corrections that impede your ability to live a productive and fulfilling life. It took me a while to understand that was truly possible. But that\u2019s at the core of everything we do at Emerson Collective. We all believe that it\u2019s truly possible.\nHow did College Track, which was very narrowly focused on education, lead to Emerson Collective, which is working on a much broader set of issues?\nI came in through the education door, looking at equity and access of quality education. And of course that was connected to immigration and health and well-being, and clean air, water and soil, and access to opportunity, and also other obstacles that are thrown in the way of impoverished communities, like lack of access to financial services and health services. All of that has to be addressed in a holistic way, and that\u2019s why we started building a matrix organization. I wanted our organization to be just as connected as all the issues that we\u2019re working on.\nOur very first graduating class of seniors at College Track included students who were undocumented. They only found out when they were applying to college that they didn\u2019t have a Social Security number. They had come when they were toddlers. And then we all realized that means that they had to apply as international students. They couldn\u2019t access any state or federal funding for education, even though they had grown up here. I thought, this is an obvious glitch in our immigration system. It was obviously a federal law that needed to be changed.\nIt\u2019s been almost 20 years that you\u2019ve been working on legislation for Dreamers, and yet not much has changed.\nStudents and I collected signatures and wrote a whole petition in 2002. We brought it to Washington, D.C., and Jon Corzine in the Senate and Anna Eshoo in the House brought the petition to the nascent Dream Act legislation. I thought that it would shortly pass and that this wouldn\u2019t be an issue that our amazingly talented, promising students would have to be dealing with, and they still are, 18 painful years later. We have, as a country, failed every single time. We have failed to be generous and generative and smart about including all people in America as active citizens or even active residents. It\u2019s maddening. Really, it hurts to contemplate. But I am resolved to never give up as long as I live.\nSometimes it seems like Americans with different political views can barely talk to one another these days. How do you think about repairing that?\nOne conversation at a time. And it often starts with our own families. In my own family, there are Trump supporters. I knew I was going to be with them over Christmas, and I actually want to engage, and want to understand and I want to be able to disagree without being disagreeable. I want to be able to find the areas where we can agree.\nHow did that go?\nWe\u2019re finding lots of areas of agreement. We can agree on core American values of liberty and dignity and freedom and justice. We can talk about what it means when we\u2019re demonizing people who immigrated from their dysfunctional countries, just like everyone we\u2019re related to did. What does it mean that we want to shut the door on them? Can we examine that in ourselves, that desire to shut the door? It\u2019s not the first time that the demonization of others has been used as a political tactic. And once people remember that, then you can start looking at what Trump is saying a little bit differently.\nSomething that I find really deeply disturbing is the level of hate speech and hate crimes that are happening in elementary and middle school. And it started three years ago, right away. It\u2019s so painful. Children are listening to things that adults are saying, and it\u2019s given them permission to repeat. We have this in our own nature. We know this. This is no mystery. So giving airtime to the dark side of our nature is a painful, painful moment.\nTo what extent does the growing backlash against big philanthropy and billionaires inform your work?\nI think about it a lot. It\u2019s not right for individuals to accumulate a massive amount of wealth that\u2019s equivalent to millions and millions of other people combined. There\u2019s nothing fair about that. We saw that at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with the Rockefellers and Carnegies and Mellons and Fords of the world. That kind of accumulation of wealth is dangerous for a society. It shouldn\u2019t be this way."
