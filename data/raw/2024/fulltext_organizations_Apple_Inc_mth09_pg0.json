        "title": "In Venice, George Clooney Talks President Biden and American Politics",
        "fulltext": "Midway through a Venice news conference for the crime caper \u201cWolfs,\u201d one reporter told George Clooney that she would ask the question on everyone\u2019s minds.\n\u201cThat I look so good up close?\u201d Clooney quipped.\nThough the 63-year-old was certainly sporting a nice tan, the big question wasn\u2019t about his movie-star looks or even about \u201cWolfs,\u201d which premiered Sunday evening at the Venice Film Festival. Instead, Clooney was asked about the effect of a July 10guest essay he wrotefor The New York Times Opinion section that called on President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to step down as the Democratic nominee.\nAt the time, it was considered one of the most high-profile examples of Hollywood\u2019s big-donor class losing confidence in President Biden after his debate against Donald J. Trump in June.\nSome journalists in the Venice press room applauded Clooney at the mention of his influential essay, but the star demurred. \u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president, who did the most selfless thing that anybody\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said about President Biden, who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee for the Democratic Party in late July. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered and it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d\nAlluding to the ascension of Harris, Clooney continued, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of where we are in the state of the world right now, which I think many people are surprised by. And we\u2019re all very excited for the future.\u201d\nStill, that wasn\u2019t the only tricky question Clooney had to field during the news conference. Co-starring Brad Pitt, \u201cWolfs\u201d is an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser \u2014 the two actors play rival fixers who must reluctantly work together to cover up a crime scene. The movie was originally earmarked for a wide release in theaters before debuting on Apple TV+. But after the streamer endured a recent run of theatrically released flops like \u201cArgylle\u201d and \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d that plan was significantly cut back.\nNow, \u201cWolfs\u201d will receive only a one-week release in a limited number of theaters before it begins streaming on Sept. 27. Several reporters asked Clooney whether he was disappointed about having to forgo a big release.\n\u201cSure, we would have liked that,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Brad and I gave some of our salary back to do it,\u201d though he took issue with arecent Times reportthat said he and Pitt were paid $35 million each for the movie. \u201cIt\u2019s millions and millions and millions dollars less than what was reported,\u201d the star said. (The Times stands by its reporting.)\nClooney noted that his recent directorial effort, \u201cThe Boys in the Boat,\u201d was made for MGM before it went to Amazon and was snipped of a planned foreign release. \u201cThere are elements of this that we are figuring out,\u201d he said.\nPitt, who was also at the news conference, sounded sanguine about the release change. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be romantic about the theatrical experience,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I love the existence of the streamers because we get to see more story, more talent, it gets more eyes. It\u2019s a delicate balance, but it\u2019ll right itself.\u201d\nAnother reporter asked what could be gleaned from the current state of the industry if a movie starring Clooney and Pitt could no longer be guaranteed a wide release.\n\u201cClearly we\u2019re in decline,\u201d Clooney joked. But he noted that when he and Pitt were younger actors, \u201cthere was still a form of a studio system. \u2018ER\u2019 broke for me,\u201d he said, referring to the hospital series he starred in. \u201cI was at Warner Bros., and I got a five-picture deal at Warner Bros. You sort of get protected along the way.\u201d\nClooney cracked that his Warner Bros. deal did include the famous flop \u201cBatman & Robin,\u201d but there was still a machinery behind those moves that contemporary actors don\u2019t have access to. Still, he chose to see the upside.\n\u201cThe democratization of our industry is not a bad way to go,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cInfinitely more people\u201d are seeing movies \u201cbecause of streamers, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d"

        "title": "How to Turn Your Old iPhone Into an A.I. Phone (and Skip the Upgrade)",
        "fulltext": "The latest iPhones, unveiled by Apple at a marketing event on Monday, look virtually identical to last year\u2019s models. But Apple hopes that what\u2019s underneath \u2014 new software that brings what it describes asartificial intelligenceto the new phones \u2014 willpersuade people to upgrade.\nApple Intelligence, the company\u2019s new suite of A.I. services, automates tasks including generating images, rewriting emails and summarizing web articles. Only the iPhone 16s unveiled on Monday or last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro can run the new software because older modelsare too slow to handle those tasks, according to the company. The faster iPhone 16 devices start at $800 and will arrive in stores later this month.\nBut what if I told you there was another way to get the same perks?\nLong before Appleintroduced Apple Intelligence at a software conference in June, many apps for automatically producing text and images had been widely available. Relying on a technology known as generative A.I., which predicts what words and images belong together to write a catchy poem or generate a realistic-looking photo of a cat on a windowsill, for instance, these types of services have been trendy for the last two years.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBy downloading a handful of apps, iPhone owners can get similar benefits and hold on to their older devices longer. After I tested dozens of generative A.I. apps in the last year, here are my recommendations.\nOne of Apple Intelligence\u2019s most anticipated features is its ability to take large blocks of text and distill the main points into a few sentences. This capability could be useful for summarizing a lengthy web article or lecture notes.\nBut there\u2019s already a popular tool for summarizing web articles:Arc Search, a free browser developed by a start-up. To test it, I loaded an 8,000-word feature fromProPublica about a chemist who blew the whistle on the manufacturer 3M. When I pinched the screen, the app generated a one-sentence overview of what the article was about, followed by three bullet points summing up the highlights. While the bullet points glossed over important details you would have gotten from reading the full article, I found the summary accurate.\nFor summarizing notes, the free web app Humata AI has become popular among academic researchers and lawyers. By visitingHumata.ai on a web browser, you can upload a document such as a PDF, and from there, you can type requests in a window to ask a chatbot to summarize the most important points. In response, the chatbot will show a digital copy of the PDF and highlight relevant portions of the text.\nApple Intelligence also includes tools to rewrite text \u2014 to make an email sound more professional, for instance. Lots of free apps can handle this task proficiently.\nThe best known include theChatGPT chatbot from OpenAI, along with rivals likeGemini from GoogleandBing AI from Microsoft\u2014 all apps that can be downloaded in the App Store. Just paste text into the app and ask the chatbot to rewrite it in a different tone by typing, for instance, \u201cMake this email sound more personable for a client I\u2019ve known for many years.\u201d\n(The New York Timessued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)\nFor help with writing, I prefer a lesser-known tool, Wordtune, from the start-up AI21 Labs. Its interface, accessible on wordtune.com, is designed like a word processor for composing and editing text. You can type in a paragraph and click on buttons to expand, shorten or rewrite sentences to sound more casual or formal; the app will show a list of rewritten sentences to choose from.\nAnother of Apple Intelligence\u2019s hyped features is its ability to generate fun images, such as an emoji of yourself eating pizza, to send to friends.\nMany options for generating images exist, including a tool that most iPhone users are likely to already have: Meta AI, Meta\u2019s free chatbot that is included inside Instagram, WhatsApp and its other apps. In the search bar at the top of Instagram, you can ask the chatbot to conjure images by typing \u201c/imagine\u201d followed by a description.\nI typed \u201c/imagine me eating steak.\u201d Meta AI then loaded a tool to take photos of my face from multiple angles. It produced an obviously fake rendering of me salivating over a large, rare steak inside a restaurant.\nOther similar tools for typing prompts to generate images include Adobe Firefly, found onfirefly.adobe.com, and ChatGPT.\nAnother new Apple Intelligence tool can automatically remove photo bombers with the tap of a button.\nGoogle hasoffered a similar editing tool, Magic Eraser, inside its Google Photos photo album app for iPhone and Android users since 2023. Inside Google Photos, select your photo, tap the \u201cedit\u201d button and select the Magic Eraser tool. You can then circle the distracting objects or people you would like to erase.\nI used Magic Eraser on a photo of my corgi, Max, in a dog park \u2014 to remove a citation form from a police officer for letting Max run off leash without a permit. It replaced the maddening piece of bureaucracy with some pine needles."

        "title": "Can Apple\u2019s iPhones Pass the A.I. Test?",
        "fulltext": "Shortly before Steve Jobs\u2019s death in 2011, Applefilled a cramped auditoriumin Cupertino, Calif., for the unveiling of its fifth iPhone. The device\u2019s biggest selling point was a new software feature called Siri, which helped cause a jump in iPhone sales.\nOn Monday, Apple is planning to run that play again.\nFor the first time in more than a decade, the tech giant will unveil a suite of iPhones whose signature feature won\u2019t be an improved camera or an updated design, but new software capabilities. The system, called Apple Intelligence, will sort messages, offer writing suggestions and create a more capable Siri powered by generative artificial intelligence.\nThe new iPhones represent a big moment for generative A.I., which can answer questions, create images and write software code. As a latecomer to the A.I. party, Apple is in a position to take the technology mainstream \u2014 or sow fresh doubt about its viability if it doesn\u2019t live up to expectations.\nEarly enthusiasm for A.I. has been tempered by questions about its utility. This spring, Microsoft postponed features in anA.I. computerbecause of security vulnerabilities around the technology\u2019s recording of every second of activity. Humane, a start-up that raised $240 million for a device called the Ai Pin, waspanned by tech reviewersbecause its system was slow to fulfill requests and sometimes fielded them inaccurately.\nIn the wake of those problems, Wall Street is looking to Apple for reassurance that customers want A.I. The tech giant spent two years watching as Microsoft, Meta, Google and Samsung added A.I. to products. Apple has shown over the years that it can enter a market late and redefine it, as it did with digital music players, smartphones and smartwatches.\nApple is hoping that A.I. can rejuvenate the iPhone. It considers the opportunity in A.I. so important that it canceled one of its big bets \u2014a $10 billion project to develop a self-driving car\u2014 and reassigned hundreds of engineers to work on the technology.\nPeople are holding on to their iPhones longer as compelling new features have dwindled. The time between replacing an iPhone has expanded to nearly five years, up from three years in 2018, according to TD Securities, an investment bank. The slowdown in buying new phones has weighed on Apple\u2019s business, which relies on the iPhone for more than half of total sales.\nIn addition to Apple Intelligence, which will be available on the iPhone Pro and Pro Max, analysts say, the new iPhones will feature a new button for taking photos, a slightly larger screen and faster processors.\nWall Street analysts predict the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12 percent increase from this year.\nSimilarly optimistic forecasts tied to A.I. have backfired for other technology companies. In recent months, shares of Nvidia, Microsoft and Google have been dragged down by weaker-than-expected sales of A.I. products. The declines weighed on the rest of the stock market because artificial intelligence has become a major focus of investors.\nFor Apple, which introduced its first iPhone 17 years ago, it\u2019s unclear whether new features even matter. Nearly three-quarters of users say they buy a new iPhone because their current phone has become obsolete or been lost or damaged, according toa survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm. Only a fifth say they buy a new phone to get the latest features.\n\u201cPushing out really cool new features used to drive a huge amount of replacements, but that isn\u2019t doing it any more,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, a partner at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s become like replacing your clothes dryer or your running shoes. You replace them when they\u2019re worn out.\u201d\nApple has tried to distinguish its A.I. offering by emphasizing its ability to handle personal requests more privately. When it unveiled the technology in June, it said most requests would be fielded on the iPhone itself, where there\u2019s a lower risk that personal information could be compromised. Other requests would be routed to a cloud computing network with Apple semiconductors that the company said wouldn\u2019t store any information.\nIf a user asks Siri when her mother\u2019s flight is arriving, Apple says, its A.I. system can provide a real-time estimate by pulling the flight information from an email and checking it against current flight tracking data.\nThe company will complement those A.I. services with answers from ChatGPT. It struck a deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to fulfill impersonal user requests, like what to cook with select ingredients.\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\nApple hasn\u2019t said when its array of A.I. features will be available for the new iPhones. It also hasn\u2019t explained how it will launch the technology overseas, particularly in China, its second-most important market. It is expected to address both on Monday.\nBecause A.I. systems could process personal information, governments have been pushing to have their citizens\u2019 data stored inside their borders. China previously mandated that with its citizens\u2019 iCloud data, requiring that Applecede legal ownership over the datato a state-owned company. It is not known if it would do the same with an Apple cloud network for A.I.\n\u201cThis is a real challenge,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to be culturally or regionally customized because every country is going to have to be handled very differently. There\u2019s a lot of uncharted territory here.\u201d"

        "title": "Foldables Are Becoming Good Enough to Be Your Next Smartphone",
        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s be real. The rectangular design of the quintessential smartphone is getting stale for lots of people, including this graying gadget reviewer. That\u2019s why the next phone I buy won\u2019t be another\u201csame, same\u201d iteration of the iPhone. It will be afoldable, a phone with a bendable display that flips open like a book to increase its screen size and closes up to fit in my pocket.\nThese folding phones, from companies like Samsung, Motorola and Huawei, have beengetting buzz since their debut in 2019thanks to their novel design. But they remained niche because of issues with software and durability. And at upward of $1,500, they were too expensive.\nA shift is underway. The devices keep getting better, and some are becoming cheaper. IDC, the research firm, predicts that handset makers willship 25 million foldable phonesthis year, up nearly 40 percent from last year.\nAfter testing two different sizes of foldables that arrived in stores this summer \u2014Motorola\u2019s small $700 RazrandGoogle\u2019s jumbo $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2014 I\u2019m convinced that phones with bendable screens will become mainstream in the next few years.\nMost of the issues have disappeared. The Razr resembles a compact mirror and unfolds to become a traditional smartphone. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks like a normal smartphone when closed up, but unfolded, it transforms into a tablet.\nBoth devices demonstrate that bendable screens are no gimmick. They can become even more useful than a traditional smartphone. Above all, they are more than adequate devices for those wanting to try something different.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the new devices.\nOver the last decade,smartphones kept getting biggeras more consumers gravitated toward larger screens. (Apple, for instance, discontinued its smaller iPhone Mini last year.) But there are still plenty of people who might prefer a smaller phone, including those with dainty hands and shallow pants pockets.\nWhen the Razr is closed, you control a 3.6-inch screen on the cover of the phone. It\u2019s roomy enough to use a set of basic apps for placing a phone call, sending a text, taking a selfie or reading notifications. This is a big improvement from older compact foldables. In past phones, like the$1,380 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip from 2020, the outer screen was much tinier and showed only notifications and a clock.\nI found the small screen on the Razr to be delightful. I enjoyed using it to show people photos of my dogs and my newborn. It was best for when I wanted fewer distractions from social media apps, like TikTok and Instagram, but still wanted to keep up with messages.\nWhen unfolded, the Razr reveals a larger 6.9-inch inner screen that functions like a smartphone. This screen is slightly longer than my iPhone, so it shows more text when I\u2019m scrolling through an article. There\u2019s also a split-screen mode to run two apps side by side \u2014 to write an email while browsing a website, for instance \u2014 but it felt too cramped for typing.\nThere\u2019s a crease in the middle of the screen where it folds, which is most noticeable when light is reflecting against it. But it didn\u2019t bother me while looking at photos and videos.\nThe phone\u2019s camera took crisp, clear photos with vibrant colors in daylight. At night, photos taken in low light looked grainy and dim \u2014 not ideal if you\u2019re the clubbing type.\nThe Razr\u2019s strong battery lasted about 36 hours before it needed a charge.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the successor tolast year\u2019s Pixel Fold, which I called one of themost impressive pieces of technology of the year. The Pixel foldable caters to the opposite end of the spectrum from the Razr: It\u2019s a product for people who can\u2019t get enough screen.\nWhen the Pixel is folded, its outer screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally. That\u2019s roughly the same as a standard iPhone screen, so it works like any smartphone.\nBut when you unfold it, things get more exciting. The inner screen, measuring 8 inches diagonally, is roughly equivalent to a smaller tablet like the iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. This size is comfortable to hold for long durations while reading a book in bed or watching a movie on a plane. Again, there\u2019s a crease that is noticeable only when light reflects against it, so this wasn\u2019t an issue.\nOver all, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an incremental improvement from last year\u2019s Pixel Fold. The new model is slightly thinner and lighter. The camera produced clear photos with accurate colors in both daylight and low light. The battery lasted a full day before needing a charge, which is decent.\nThe area that Google wasn\u2019t able to improve on was price, which remains $1,800 and still feels too high. To put that in perspective, a $350 iPad and an $800 iPhone combined are cheaper. Google said the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was its most premium phone offering, in part because of the engineering involved in making the device thinner. The high price tag makes this foldable a product for tech enthusiasts, but it\u2019s a glimpse of what\u2019s to come to the masses when large, bendable screens get closer to $1,000.\nBetween the two types of foldables, I\u2019d recommend the Razr because it\u2019s more practical in terms of size and cost. It\u2019s cheaper than flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung. And as a geriatric millennial who refuses to give up skinny jeans, I especially liked how the compact phone felt in my pocket.\nSo why, you might ask, haven\u2019t I converted to a foldable already? The simple reason is that I have apersonal preference for the iPhone\u2019s software system, and I\u2019m holding out for a foldable one.\nThere\u2019s hope yet that this will happen. Apple has been developing a foldable iPad, according to an Apple employee who claims to have seen a prototype of the tablet. That could pave the way for an iPhone with a bendable screen. Apple declined to comment.\nI, for one,love my iPadfor reading articles and watching video, but when I\u2019m on the go, the tablet is usually left at home. I dream of the day that our big, bright screens can fold up so we can carry them everywhere. That future feels inevitable."

        "title": "Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking Me to Check In With My Ex?",
        "fulltext": "Simon was waiting for a ride home one evening when he received a strange notification on his iPhone. It appeared with the iMessage logo, almost like a text message, but it was a suggestion from Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant. \u201cStart a Check In with Daniel,\u201d the phone prompted him. \u201cLet them know when you arrive at your destination.\u201d\nSimon, who works in artificial intelligence at a company in British Columbia and asked to be identified only by his first name because he was commenting on the work of another tech company, was amused by the notification and took a screenshot. Daniel was his old roommate who lived nearly 5,000 miles away, on a completely different continent: Why on earth would his phone think he\u2019d want to check in with him?\n\u201cI found it funny,\u201d Simon said in a phone interview. \u201cHe is in my Favorites on my phone, so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s how Apple does these recommendations. But it still just doesn\u2019t make any sense, because I also have his address saved in my contacts, so my phone should know that we live on different continents.\u201d\nOther iPhone users have not been so amused by the Siri feature, which wasreleasedwith iOS 17 last year. Since then, the internet has been inundated with posts from users wondering why their phones want them to check in with seemingly random contacts.\nMany have taken to Reddit, describing the prompts as distressing or surprising, with some saying the messages had caused tension in their relationships over what felt like an attempt to control their movements. Oneuserwas asked to Check In with an ex they were no longer in touch with and others were asked to send them to managers, casual acquaintances, old enemies and, onat least one occasion, a deceased mother.\nLeo Margul, a 37-year-old writer living in Los Angeles, said that on two occasions he was leaving concerts when Siri prompted him to start a Check In with his mother, who lives across the country in Boston. When he posted the screenshot to Reddit, other users chimed in to say that they had received similar notifications, but that their parents had passed away.\n\u201cMany of the top comments were from folks expressing a deep regret that they didn\u2019t speak to their now deceased mother, or parent, when they were still alive,\u201d Mr. Margul said in an interview. \u201cOthers talked about how they still check in with their mom or parents regardless of their age or sometimes their circumstances.\u201d\nHow exactly the Check In feature works is a secret Apple guards very closely. According to a company news release from June 2023, Check In was designed as a feature \u201cfor when a user wants to notify a family member or friend that they have made it to their destination safely.\u201d\n\u201cAfter a user initiates a Check In, their friend or family member will automatically be notified as soon as the user arrives,\u201d the release said. \u201cIf they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information will be temporarily shared with the selected contact, such as the device\u2019s location, battery level and cell service status. Any information shared is end-to-end encrypted.\u201d\nBut how exactly does your phone decide when the time is right to start a Check In? The feature hinges on Siri Suggestions, a function that, according to Apple, is based on a variety of factors, including what information is stored on your device and how you use your phone. Whether or not you actually start the Check In is up to you. Users can alsoturn offSiri Suggestions entirely, which will stop the notifications.\nStill, some iPhone users are skeptical about using Check In without knowing exactly how it works.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something creepy about the fact that it isn\u2019t readily explained how this feature works and how it chooses who to suggest,\u201d Mr. Margul said. \u201cThat said, ultimately it reminded me to check in with people I would like to contact more often, so I appreciate that. It would just be great to know the exact privacy cost of that suggestion.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Hollywood\u2019s top lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association, has a powerful new member: Amazon.\nThe tech giant\u2019s decision to join the M.P.A. after a long courtship reflects its ambition in the streaming and film businesses \u2014 as well as the association\u2019s need to add muscle. \u201cWelcoming Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios into our ranks will broaden our collective policymaking and content protection efforts,\u201dCharles H. Rivkin, the association\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview.\nThe association\u2019s other members are Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. The M.P.A. has not added a member since 2019, when Netflix joined. Mr. Rivkin, a former United States ambassador and assistant secretary of state, has since focused recruitment efforts on Amazon.\nAmazon gained a foothold in the entertainment industry in the 2010s with unconventional series like \u201cTransparent\u201d and indie films like \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d The company has since grown its Prime Video streaming service into a colossus. Last year,Amazon spent $19 billionto make or acquire content (films, TV shows, music), up 14 percent from a year earlier.\nIn 2021, Amazon acquiredMetro- Goldwyn-Mayerfor $8.5 billion. MGM was a founding member of the M.P.A. in 1923. But the studio dropped its membership in 2005 amid anill-fated mergerwith Sony. In Mr. Rivkin\u2019s membership discussions with Amazon, its purchase of MGM \u201cchanged the conversation,\u201d he said. In the years ahead, Amazon plans to roughly double MGM\u2019s theatrical slate to as many as 16 films annually.\nMike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement that the company was \u201cproud\u201d to join the M.P.A. and its effort \u201cto protect creators, content and consumers worldwide.\u201d Amazon has successfully worked with the association on piracy efforts over the last few years.\nFor decades, the M.P.A. reigned as one of the most powerful trade associations in Washington. Its influence waned in the 2000s with the arrival of lobbyists for Big Tech. The M.P.A. also suffered from budget cuts and glacial decision making, in part because of consolidation in the entertainment industry; member studios had become embedded inside media conglomerates with divergent interests.\nThe low point came in 2012, when the M.P.A. failed to push through the Stop Online Piracy Act, which was mostly aimed at piracy sites overseas. Google and other tech companies, including Amazon, mobilized to defeat the legislation, arguing that it would effectively allow the government to censor the internet.\nMr. Rivkin washired in 2017to reinvigorate the M.P.A. The association\u2019s priorities include strengthening copyright protections. It also lobbies to open markets and secure tax incentives to produce films. Mr. Rivkin has expanded the group\u2019s advocacy to include streaming.\nThe association also oversees the movie-ratings system in the United States and operates a separate unit to fight piracy. Last month, the M.P.A. helpedshut downFmovies, a Vietnam video site that trafficked in stolen Hollywood content, attracting 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.\nWith the addition of Amazon, the only significant Hollywood player that remains a nonmember is Apple.\n\u201cIt used to be seen as a Northern versus Southern California battle,\u201d Mr. Rivkin said, referring to Hollywood and Silicon Valley. \u201cThat is so outdated. The lines have blurred.\u201d"

Over the past seven years, it has generally looked the same, with incremental improvements to its cameras, processors and battery life.\nBut on Monday, Apple tried to turn the page on that predictability by introducing its first artificially intelligent iPhone.\nThe iPhone 16, which was unveiled in a prerecorded video at the company\u2019s futuristic Silicon Valley campus, comes in four different models that are designed to run the company\u2019s generative artificial intelligence system, called Apple Intelligence. The company said that the phones will be able to sort messages, offer writing suggestions and use a more capable Siri virtual assistant.\nIn addition to announcing those changes to the iPhone, the company unveiled the Apple Watch Series 10, which has rounder corners and a larger, brighter display that is nearly 10 percent thinner.It also introduced a new AirPods Pro, capable of automatically reducing noise at concerts or near construction sites, and acting as professional-grade hearing aids.\nThe new phones arrive at a pivotal time for Apple and the broader tech industry. Apple\u2019s business has sputtered in recent years as iPhone users have held on to their phones for longer. It has made a major bet by realigning its engineering teams to work on artificial intelligence in hopes that the technology, which can answer questions, create images and write software code, will persuade people to buy new devices.\nThe tech industry is hoping that Apple can help make A.I. mainstream. Microsoft, Google and Samsung have all added generative A.I. features to products but have yet to see those capabilities widely adopted. But Apple has shown in the past that it can wait to embrace an emerging technology and popularize it, as it did with digital music players, smartphones and smartwatches.\n\u201cThe question is: How good is Apple Intelligence?\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, a market research firm. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible demos from Microsoft, Google and OpenAI, but when you start to work with these services, a lot are parlor tricks. Helping normal people do something useful every day would make people go, \u2018I need a new iPhone.\u2019\u201d\nThe iPhone 16 is debuting with fewer capabilities than the company marketed in June, when it announced its Apple Intelligence system. Starting next month, the phones will summarize notifications, offer writing recommendations and allow people to more quickly find photos by describing an image to Siri. The A.I. also makes it possible to use the camera to identify specific types of flowers, plants or dog breeds.\nOther capabilities will arrive over time, the company said, including Siri\u2019s ability to field some requests related to personal information on the phone, like pulling details from a text message about a family member\u2019s flight and checking airline information for real-time arrival details.\nRequests unrelated to personal information will be routed to ChatGPT, which will be available on iPhones afterApple cut a deal with OpenAIin the spring.\nThe iPhone\u2019s limited feature set is emblematic of how Apple is taking a cautious approach to generative A.I. By contrast, last month Googlerevealed a Pixel phonethat includes a conversational virtual assistant, the ability to edit people into photographs and the opportunity to use the company\u2019s generative A.I. chatbot, Gemini, to answer complex questions. Google has also had A.I. misfires, including a chatbot\u2019stelling users to eat rocks.\nApple released four versions of the iPhone 16, all of which come with a new camera button. The entry-level models, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, start at $799 and feature a faster processor, a more powerful camera and an \u201cAction button\u201d that can be programmed to automatically retrieve capabilities like the phone\u2019s flashlight. The higher-end models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, start at $999 and feature a slightly larger display, a larger battery and the ability to capture studio-quality audio. They will be available in stores on Sept. 20.\nTo power Apple Intelligence, both phones come with similar processors. The base iPhone 16 model features the A18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip. The upgrade makes for a smaller difference in the capabilities of the lower- and higher-priced phones than in recent years.\nWall Street is enthusiastic about the artificially intelligent phones, with analysts predicting the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12 percent increase from this year.\nThe generative A.I. era also presents new challenges for Apple. During most of the iPhone\u2019s 17 years, the company developed a single software system that it updated throughout the world. But many countries want the computing systems and data supporting A.I. to be located within their border. The artificial intelligence systems are also expected to be sensitive to the cultural and language differences of the people using them.\nAs a result, Apple may have to create more customized software for the countries that sell iPhones, analyst say.\nThe company said Apple Intelligence would become available next month in the United States in a preliminary software update. Apple will expand the software\u2019s distribution to Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa later this year. It said the capabilities wouldn\u2019t be available in Chinese, Japanese or Spanish until next year.\n\u201cRegions are becoming more Balkanized,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, the founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech research firm. \u201cIt is slowing down the pace of output for Apple, as each region becomes more bespoke.\u201d"

        "title": "After Apple, Jony Ive Is Building an Empire of His Own",
        "fulltext": "Five years to the week after he walked away from the top job designing the iPhone, Jony Ive leaned over a hulking model of a San Francisco city block. The dozen buildings, with each brick carved to scale in Alder wood, had become a prototype for his future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing right now, here,\u201d Mr. Ive said, pointing with his black, Maison Bonnet reading glasses at a two-story, 115-year-old building in Jackson Square, a Gold Rush Era neighborhood wedged between San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown and Financial District. \u201cWe bought this building first, but then we noticed that it had access to this huge volume in the center.\u201d\nThe \u201chuge volume\u201d was a parking lot. Each time Mr. Ive, Apple\u2019s former head of design, looked at the empty stretch of asphalt, he saw something more: a garden, a pavilion, a place where people could socialize outside like they do at his favorite restaurant in London, the River Cafe. So he bought the building next door. And then he bought another and another. Eventually, he owned half of a city block, including the vacant blacktop.\n\u201cThis is a very odd thing,\u201d Mr. Ive said, looking up from the model on a morning in late June. \u201cFor five years, I haven\u2019t talked to anybody about what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nMr. Ive, 57, walked off the world stage in 2019 at the pinnacle of his profession. During his 27 years at Apple, he had conceived the minimalist aesthetic of Apple products. His sleek designs and packaging had influenced everything from the look of televisions to the shape of water bottles. He had become a rare industrial-designer-turned-celebrity who was a co-chair for theMet Galaand helped J.J. Abrams, the director of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201ddream up a new lightsaber.\nBut after leaving Apple to start his own design firm, which he named LoveFrom, Mr. Ive largely disappeared. The firm\u2019swebsitedisplayed only its name in a self-made serif font. Its sparseness led people across Silicon Valley to joke that Mr. Ive had spent five years designing a typeface. But behind the laughter was the same curiosity: What was Mr. Ive up to?\nMr. Ive\u2019s city block model offered part of the answer. Over the past four years, the British designer, whose wealth is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, has quietly accumulated nearly $90 million worth of real estate on a single city block. The purchases began early in the pandemic, at a time when many tech luminaries were fleeing San Francisco. Mr. Ive found the exodus noxious.\n\u201cI owe the city so much,\u201d said Mr. Ive, who moved to San Francisco in the 1990s. \u201cThe area had attracted so many people because of its talent, but as soon as things stopped working out, people were leaving.\u201d\nDressed in a white, long-sleeve, hooded T-shirt, stone chinos and Clarks Wallabee shoes, Mr. Ive said he wanted to draw creative types to the edge of downtown. He has been turning one of his buildings into a home base for his agency\u2019s work on automotive, fashion and travel products. Another is the headquarters of a new, artificial intelligence device company that he is developing with OpenAI.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was reckless,\u201d he said of his building buys. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t arrogant. It was well intended. But I really felt we could have a contribution.\u201d\nWealthy tech executives spending their fortunes on real estate or more imaginative adventures is a staple of Silicon Valley culture. Some buy islands, others build yachts longer than a football field or fund quixotic flying car projects. Mr. Ive\u2019s fixation on a single city block, by comparison, seems modest.\nBut for Mr. Ive, Jackson Square also represents personal reinvention. Few people walk away from their profession\u2019s premier job. Even fewer start over again. A self-professed control freak, Mr. Ive decided that he had fretted enough over the snugness of each iPhone box, the layout of every Apple Watch component and the curve of every iPad corner. He wanted something new.\nAt LoveFrom, he has tried to trust his instincts. Buying one building led to buying another. A discussion about a new yarn led to his first fashion apparel. Work with one client, Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, led to meeting Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\nIt is unclear what the real estate spending spree will amount to, and for all of Mr. Ive\u2019s success, there have been points when his design instincts and expensive tastes went too far. He has been criticized for putting form over function. Some MacBooks were so thin that the keyboards malfunctioned.Some of Apple\u2019s biggest fansmocked thecustom goldwatch that the company sold for $17,000.\nBut over two days with him earlier in the summer, it became apparent that he has become more relaxed, even as the range of projects he tackles explodes.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m learning is to trust, more than ever, my intuition,\u201d Mr. Ive said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\nMr. Ive was 21 years old when he first visited San Francisco. It was the summer of 1989, and Britain\u2019s Royal Society of Arts had awarded him a travel scholarship for creating a futuristic phone called \u201cthe Orator.\u201d He used it to visit Silicon Valley because of its reputation for designing that decade\u2019s most important product: the personal computer.\nOn that visit, he and his future wife, Heather, fell in love with Jackson Square. Many buildings in the neighborhood had survived the city\u2019s 1906 earthquake and fire because there was a whiskey storehouse in the area. City officials had worried the alcohol would catch on fire, so they protected the neighborhood, even as the rest of the city burned.\nMr. Ive spent hours in the neighborhood at the William Stout Architectural Books store, which had thousands of books about design. Before he left the city, he knew that he wanted to return.\nWhen Apple offered him a job with its design team in 1992, he made San Francisco home. His twin boys, Charlie and Harry, were born there in 2004 and grew up in a$17 million mansionin the Pacific Heights neighborhood with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nWhen it came time to find office space for LoveFrom, Mr. Ive returned to Jackson Square because of its creative legacy. It was just a block away fromCity Lights BookstoreandVesuvio Cafe, where Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and the Beat Generation hung out. It was also home to galleries and artists.\n\u201cOne of the things that I was fortunate of was to see and understand the context of San Francisco through the eyes of Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Ive said. \u201cHe knew City Lights and Vesuvio. I owe Steve so much for how I understand San Francisco\u2019s contribution to the culture.\u201d\nMr. Ive named the firm in honor of Mr. Jobs, who toldApple employees in 2007that one of the ways to express appreciation to humanity is through \u201cthe acting of making something with a great deal of care and love.\u201d\nIn early 2020, Mr. Ive was searching for a permanent office when he learned about a building for sale on Montgomery Street in Jackson Square. He bought it for $8.5 million and discovered its backdoor led to a parking lot encircled by the block\u2019s buildings. He wanted to turn the parking lot into a green space, but learned that he needed to own another building on the block to control the parking lot. So a year later, he bought a neighboring, 33,000-square-foot building for $17 million.\nAs he was pursuing the property, Mr. Ive had dinner with his friend Wendell Weeks, the chief executive of Corning, the glass company that makes iPhone screens. He talked excitedly about his investments, but Mr. Weeks cringed. San Francisco\u2019s commercial real estate market would crash during the pandemic, and more than a third of its offices remain vacant.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think you need to do that,\u201d Mr. Weeks told Mr. Ive. \u201cI can get you office space.\u201d\nBut Mr. Ive\u2019s mind was made up. At Apple, he had worked at Infinite Loop, a sterile office park near the interstate, and Apple Park, a futuristic circle of glass and blonde wood. Both campuses were so isolated that they could have existed anywhere. He wanted his new office to be part of the community.\nMr. Ive\u2019s land grab alarmed residents and business owners. Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor now running for mayor, worried that Mr. Ive might demolish iconic buildings and propose a skyscraper.\nThose worries faded after neighbors met Mr. Ive. He offered to reduce some tenants\u2019 rents, did free design work for others and won over Mr. Peskin, a frequent critic of development in his district, with his plans to preserve the existing buildings.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many iterations and reincarnations of this area, but it\u2019s always maintained a diverse business typology,\u201d he said. \u201cHe respects that.\u201d\nFrom a bench at a long wooden table inside the LoveFrom studio on that morning in late June, Mr. Ive flipped through images of his firm\u2019s work. There was a coronation emblem for King Charles III, a jacket for the Italian luxury brand Moncler and an interior touch-screen for the first electric Ferrari.\nThe three-story studio was a blend of Mr. Ive\u2019s past and present. Exposed brick walls framed a long table for design discussions \u2014 much as he had at Apple. Waist-high tables nearby, similar to those at an Apple Store, displayed finished work. And shelves along the walls displayed white coffee table books about design research.\n\u201cThis is my button book,\u201d Mr. Ive said, as he flipped open one of the oversized books titled \u201cGarment Fasteners Design Research.\u201d Its pages were filled with images of fasteners and pins from prehistory through the Bronze Age. It was the first of a custom-printed, five-volume series of books with pictures and analysis of mankind\u2019s entire history of making buttons for clothing. \u201cFive years we\u2019ve been working on this, and we absolutely love it.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Ive first considered leaving Apple, he turned to his friend Marc Newson for advice. TheAustralian-born industrial designer, who joined Apple in 2014 to work on the Apple Watch, had spent his career at an independent design firm with work that ranged from luxury yachts and surfboards to Louis Vuitton luggage and vibrators. Mr. Newson suggested that they start a creative collective to work on projects.\nRecalling those early conversations, Mr. Newson said the goal was to leave behind the grind and rigor of Apple. \u201cThe freedom was the idea,\u201d Mr. Newson said.\nOver five years, Mr. Ive and Mr. Newson hired architects, graphic designers, writers and a cinematic special effects developer who work across three areas: work for the love of it, which they do without pay; work for clients, which includes Airbnb and Ferrari; and work for themselves, which includes the building renovation.\nMr. Ive\u2019s \u201cbutton book\u201d is emblematic of the firm\u2019s approach. During a conversation in 2019 with Remo Ruffini, the chief executive of Moncler, Mr. Ive learned that the jacket maker was uncertain how to use a new yarn made of recycled nylon. Mr. Ive proposed creating a jacket cut from a single piece of cloth with no seams.\nThe resulting coat is a blanket of goose down that can be zipped together to create two sleeves. It slips inside the shell of a poncho, parka or a field jacket and is held in place by custom, magnetic buttons that snap together with a click like an AirPods case. The buttons are etched with LoveFrom\u2019s mascot: a brown bear inspired by California\u2019s state flag.\nThe jacket will be released this fall as a special edition item. It will cost more than $2,000.\nThe Moncler project was something Mr. Ive collaborated on because he wanted to design his first garment. It fit into his belief that the firm should do some work that he says is for \u201cthe love of others\u201d and some that is for the \u201clove of us.\u201d\nThe firm\u2019s largest \u201cfor us\u201d project is the Jackson Square redevelopment. On a 114-inch TV near the studio\u2019s entrance, Mr. Ive showed an artist\u2019s rendering of the parking lot as a garden. Pebbled pathways cut between green grass. Hedges created a perimeter of greenery along the walls of the surrounding buildings and trees provided shade for outdoor chairs. A pavilion stood in the center for meetings and events.\nThe firm\u2019s studio will fill two buildings between the courtyard and street. Because of a zoning requirement, one of the buildings will have a LoveFrom store where the firm will sell products like its custom notebooks and Moncler jackets.\nHe and Mr. Newson hope the renovation, which is scheduled for completion in late 2025, draws others to the area. Several firms have already followed, including Emerson Collective, which was founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, and Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm with ties to OpenAI.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a counterintuitive opportunity to prove people wrong\u201d about San Francisco,Mr. Newson said.\nAs Mr. Ive climbed a wooden staircase to the studio\u2019s second floor that morning, he spoke about LoveFrom\u2019s clients, which pay the firm as much as $200 million annually. The two dozen designers upstairs were working on an array of projects, including a Christie\u2019s auction stand, Airbnb graphics and a Ferrari interior.\nJohn Elkann, the chief executive of Exor and a member of the Agnelli family, which owns Ferrari, was one of LoveFrom\u2019s first clients. Mr. Elkann tapped the firm because he admired how Mr. Ive\u2019s Apple Watch had turned an analog device into a digital product. He wanted the same touch on Ferrari\u2019s first electric vehicle.\nThe project has given Mr. Elkann an appreciation for LoveFrom\u2019s process. In January, he visited the firm\u2019s studio for an hourslong meeting about the car\u2019s steering wheel. He listened as Mr. Ive and others talked about the appropriate steering wheel length and how a driver should hold it. Ferrari\u2019s chief test driver tested an early prototype of the wheel, which borrowed design elements from the company\u2019s sports car and racecar history, to assess how it would perform.\n\u201cPaying attention to the steering wheel in a car that you want to drive and what the physicality of what that means is something that Jony was very clear about,\u201d Mr. Elkann said. He added that the result is \u201csomething really, really different.\u201d\nMr. Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, was another early client. LoveFrom helped redesign the travel company\u2019s review system, introduce three-dimensional icons to its app and develop a concept, called \u201ctravel postcards,\u201d which led to the company\u2019s introduction of digital postcards that can be shared when booking travel.\nMr. Chesky is a close friend of Mr. Altman, whose company OpenAI has been at the forefront of building generative artificial intelligence. Last year, Mr. Chesky arranged for Mr. Ive and Mr. Altman to meet for dinner.\nAt a Michelin-starred restaurant, Spruce, a few miles from Jackson Square, Mr. Altman and Mr. Ive talked about how generative A.I. made it possible to create a new computing device because the technology could do more for users than traditional software since it could summarize and prioritize messages, identify and name objects like plants and eventually field complex requests like booking travel.\nMr. Ive and Mr. Altman met for dinner several more times before agreeing to build a product, with LoveFrom leading the design. They have raised money privately, with Mr. Ive and Emerson Collective, Ms. Powell Jobs\u2019s company, contributing, and could raise up to $1 billion in start-up funding by the end of the year from tech investors.\nIn February, Mr. Ive found office space for the company. They spent $60 million on a 32,000-square-foot building called the Little Fox Theater that backs up to the LoveFrom courtyard. He has hired about 10 employees, including Tang Tan, who oversaw iPhone product development, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Mr. Ive in leading design at Apple.\nOn a Friday morning in late June, Mr. Tan and Ms. Hankey could be seen wheeling chairs between the Little Fox Theater and the nearby LoveFrom studio. The chairs were topped by papers and cardboard boxes with the earliest ideas for a product that uses A.I. to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.\nThe project is being developed in secret. Mr. Newson said that what the product would be and when it would be released were still being determined.\nThough Mr. Ive is optimistic about their work and enthusiastic that it could make his investments in Jackson Square worthwhile, he is uneasy about the future. It is only natural for him to be afraid that he spent too much money on property or worry that his start-up could fail.\nBut seated on a plush, cream couch near LoveFrom\u2019s model of Jackson Square, he said that his philosophy was not to let success be determined by a number. Judging a real estate purchase or a new device by its return on investment would miss the point. Life\u2019s most important decisions require leaps into the unknown.\n\u201cYou somehow have to make friends with uncertainty,\u201d he said. It was a very un-Apple-like view of the world.\nRead byTripp Mickle\nAudio produced byTally Abecassis."

        "title": "Breaking Up With China Is Hard to Do",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s not an easy time to be an American multinational company that sells to or buys from China. As the governments of the United States and China butt heads, they\u2019re pressuring companies to take sides.\nLook at Ford. In January, the heads of two congressional committeesaskedthe Biden administration to investigate four Chinese companies that they said were involved in Ford\u2019s planned battery factory in Michigan. The committee chairs claimed that the companies had ties to the Chinese military, the Communist Party, the North Korean government and human rights abuses in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\nOr look at Apple. As this newspaperhas reported, \u201cFor years, Apple hasbowed to Beijing\u2019s demandsthat it block an array of apps, including newspapers, VPNs and encrypted messaging services.\u201d Apple \u201calso built a data center in the country to house Chinese citizens\u2019 iCloud information, which includes personal contacts, photos and email,\u201d The Times wrote.\nThe two companies \u2014 which once saw business with China as a major bright spot \u2014 are repeatedly forced to scramble to explain. Ford, for example, told Reuters it follows U.S. government regulations \u201cacross our business.\u201d Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook talks up the company\u2019s Americanness: \u201cI know that a company like Apple could only come from America \u2014 and we are as committed as ever to giving back to our great country,\u201d he said in Arizona in 2022.\nAn analysis released Monday by Strategy Risks, a 12-person business intelligence company focused on relations with China, lists Ford first and Apple third in a ranking of exposure to China among the 250 biggest publicly traded firms in the United States. (Second on the list is Carrier Global, the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning company.) Other analysts might rank the companies lower. You could make a case that Tesla, ranked fourth by Strategy Risks, is more exposed than Ford, Carrier or Apple. But the publication of the list nonetheless invites a look at the China strategies of two of America\u2019s most famous companies.\nThe question that bedevils American C.E.O.s is how close to get to Chinese frenemies: companies that can be both friends as partners and enemies as competitors. The Chinese market is lucrative, but American companies that have entered it have given the Chinese valuable intellectual property \u2014 sometimes willingly,sometimes not.\nAs Chinese companies have caught up and in some cases surpassed American companies in technology, the new question for the American ones is whether to attempt to fight their way back to the forefront, at great cost, or cede the market to the Chinese and become their customers.\nThat\u2019s the dilemma these days for Jim Farley, who has been the chief executive of Ford since 2020. The Wall Street Journalreportedthis month that Farley returned from a China trip in May amazed by Chinese companies\u2019 progress in electric vehicles, telling a fellow Ford board member that \u201cthis is an existential threat.\u201d\nFord haspredictedit will lose around $5 billion on its electric vehicle operations in 2024. That\u2019s in spite of high tariffs that block Chinese E.V.\u2019s from the American market. In August Fordannouncedit was pulling the plug on an all-electric, three-row sport utility vehicle and delaying the rollout of a large electric pickup truck by about 18 months, to 2027.\nFarley is steering a middle course with regard to China. Ford is taking subsidies from the U.S. government to make batteries in Michigan. But it\u2019s licensing technology for them from China\u2019s C.A.T.L., the world\u2019s largest maker of E.V. batteries. That amounts to an acknowledgment of Chinese technological leadership, coupled with a commitment to in-house manufacturing.\nFarley\u2019s latest tactic for keeping up with Chinese competition is setting up a new operation in the Los Angeles area to design electric vehicles that will be entirely new from the pavement up, built around those new batteries.\nIt might work, or it might not. Some Wall Street analysts are skeptical. \u201cFocus on your core,\u201d John Murphy, a Bank of America analyst,saidin a talk in June. He said Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, should focus on selling gasoline-powered trucks in North America, which remain highly profitable, while \u201cultimately investing in autonomous connected and electric vehicles over time.\u201d (Ford says its Chinese operations have turned profitable.)\nApple, though still widely admired in China, is losing market share in smartphones and encountering political headwinds. While Apple has tried to remain in the good graces of the government, Chinese agencies and government-backed firms havebannedtheir employees from bringing iPhones and other foreign devices to work. Jon Stewart\u2019s show on Apple\u2019s streaming service ended last year partly because potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence were causing concern among Apple executives, The Timesreported.\nApple has made moves to reduce its reliance on Chinese sources for parts but has made little progress. Nikkei Asiareportedin April that Apple increased its use of parts from China-headquartered suppliers and Chinese manufacturing sites in 2023, while using fewer suppliers from Taiwan, the United States, Japan and South Korea. Apple said in March that it was expanding a research center in Shanghai and opening a new lab in Shenzhen, the tech hub near Hong Kong.\n\u201cEveryone has the same dilemma\u201d of fearing over-dependence on China but also worrying about becoming uncompetitive if they pull out, James Andrew Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. \u201cPeople are hedging their bets.\u201d\n\u201cIt would take Apple a decade to get out of China\u201d even if it wanted to, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director for Counterpoint Research, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the building of devices. It\u2019s the huge ecosystem of components.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman declined to discuss the company\u2019s exposure to China. The company says it designs all its products in California and has more than 90,000 employees in the United States, versus about 16,000 in \u201cGreater China,\u201d which for Apple includes Taiwan.\nIf tensions between China and the United States continue to ratchet up, the pressure on companies that straddle the two markets will only intensify. There is no easy way out.\nCalifornia\u2019s $20 minimum wage for workers in big fast-food chains \u201cincreased average hourly pay by a remarkable 18 percent, and yet did not reduce employment,\u201d according to a newworking paperby the economists Michael Reich of the University of California, Berkeley, and Denis Sosinskiy of the University of California, Davis. The policy increased prices about 3.7 percent, \u201ccontrary to industry claims of larger increases,\u201d they estimated. Profit margins of restaurants were above competitive levels before the policy and absorbed \u201ca substantial share\u201d of the increased expense on wages, they calculated. Franchise owners pay a fixed percentage of their revenue in royalties to their parent companies, so when they raised prices, the parent companies got more money that went straight to the bottom line.\nI asked Michael Strain, an economist who has debated Reich on minimum wagesin print, what he thought of the research. He said some of the lowest-skilled workers might be fired and replaced by higher-skilled workers who would be attracted by the higher pay. Also, he said fast-food workers eat at the restaurants where prices rose, so \u201cyou\u2019re kind of giving a pay boost to workers with your right hand and you\u2019re taking a bunch of it back with your left hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe stock market, which is a sort of horse track without the horses, does not deserve its wide reputation as a barometer. It sometimes sows the hurricane, instead of reporting the breeze.\u201d\n\u2014 E.B. White, \u201cStock Market Zigzags,\u201d The New Yorker, March 26, 1955, collected in \u201cE.B.

        "fulltext": "Over successive administrations, the U.S. government has used stiff trade restrictions to try to stifle the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. In turn, the company never misses an opportunity to show that it is still standing.\nLast year, at the tail end of avisit to Chinaby Gina M. Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, Huawei unveiled a smartphone that was powered by an advanced semiconductor made in China. The chip was exactly the kind of technology that the United States, in an effort led by Ms. Raimondo, had tried to prevent China from developing.\nThe Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Pro, was heralded in China as the triumph of a national champion over American constraints. It sold out within minutes on Chinese e-commerce platforms. Many shoppers chose to pair their purchase with a phone case emblazoned with a photo of Ms. Raimondo\u2019s face.\nIn the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen on Tuesday, Huawei again made a bid for the spotlight with the announcement of a new device just hours after Apple introduced itsiPhone 16in California. Huawei\u2019s latest phone, the Mate XT, is heavy on novelty: It can be folded, twice.\nThe tablet-size device folds along two vertical seams to become the size of a typical phone. It is the first commercially available trifold smartphone. It comes in two colors, red and black, and will go on sale on Sept. 20.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of work that everyone has thought of but never managed to create,\u201d said Richard Yu, Huawei\u2019s consumer group chairman. \u201cI have always had a dream to put our tablet in my pocket, and we did it.\u201d\nThe Mate XT, with a screen that measures 10.2 inches diagonally, is equipped with artificial-intelligence-enabled translation, messaging and photo editing features. Mr. Yu also unveiled a thin keyboard that folds in half to the same size as the phone. He showed the audience how he carried both together in the pocket of his suit jacket.\nStarting at $2,800, the Mate XT is priced like a luxury product.\nSince the Mate 60 Pro was launched last year, Huawei has been eating into Apple\u2019s yearslong dominance of the market for high-end smartphones in China.\nWhile the trifold phone is making a splash, Huawei has not yet introduced its latest rival to the iPhone, the next-generation Mate 70.\nIn recent years, Huawei has launched products in September, which is also when Apple typically unveils new iPhones.\nHuawei has used the events to also commemorate the 2021release of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and the daughter of the company\u2019s founder who had been detained in Canada after the company had been accused of violating U.S. sanctions. Her case became a geopolitical point of contention, and her return received widespread attention in China.\nAnalysts said the introduction of the Mate 70 had been slowed by constraints on chip production at the country\u2019s leading chipmaker, the state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation of China, or SMIC.\nThe company was behind the chips that enabled Huawei to take the world by surprise last year. But the technology used to manufacture those chips is costly and prone to defects, making it difficult to produce them in large volumes.\nHuawei relies on SMIC\u2019s most advanced technology for three of its product lines, including the new trifold phone, said Joanne Chiao, an analyst at TrendForce, a market research firm.\nHuawei has not confirmed a release date for the Mate 70. SMIC did not respond to a request for comment.\nHuawei was once a top global smartphone brand and maker of 5G telecommunications equipment. Its worldwide market share for smartphones plunged after the Trump administration moved in 2019 to restrict its access to critical technologies, including semiconductors. Additional sanctions by the United States and its allies furthereroded the company\u2019s profits. But Huawei staged a comeback last year, reporting its fastest growth in four years, driven in part by the sales of Mate 60 Pro.\nThe new folding phone is Huawei\u2019s attempt to show off its leadership despite the uncertainty around the release date of the Mate 70, according to Linda Sui, a senior director at TechInsights, a market research firm.\n\u201cHuawei still tried to do something to save face, to make people believe they feel comfortable competing with Apple side by side,\u201d Ms. Sui said.\nFor a decade, China accounted for roughly 20 percent of Apple\u2019s total sales. It was the iPhone\u2019s most important market after the United States.\nButApple\u2019s market share in Chinafell drastically during the first half of this year. Even offering iPhones at a discount \u2014 a rare step for Apple \u2014 was not enough to reverse the decline.\nIn the quarter that ended in June, Apple dropped out of the five top-selling brands in China, according toCanalys, a research firm. It was the first quarter in years that the best-selling smartphones in China were all made by domestic companies.\nSince the Mate 60 was released, Apple has lost nearly a quarter of its market share for high-end smartphones, Ms. Sui said. That share has been taken up by Huawei.\nApple faces additional challenges:reluctance by Chinese consumersto spend while the economy sputters, andgrowing government pressurefor people to turn away from devices made by U.S. companies.\nMany consumers are holding on to their phones longer rather than spending on an incremental upgrade. Apple has bet that new software enabled byartificial intelligencewill motivate people to spring for the iPhone 16.\nInside China, the government closely regulates access to A.I. products like some of the new features Apple has outlined. Apple has said it plans to work with OpenAI, the American artificial intelligence leader, on part of this technology. But to make it available in China, Apple is likely to need to find a Chinese partner company.\nAn obvious choice would be Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Samsung, the South Korean electronics maker, teamed up with Baidu for the versions of its new A.I.-enabled smartphone that were released in China this year.\nApple, which did not reply to a request for comment, has not explained how it will roll out its A.I. software in China.\nLori Chang, a senior analyst at Isaiah Research, a market research company, said the trifold phone was unlikely to give Huawei\u2019s sales a big boost. The device is expensive, and because the foldable screen is hard to make, the company is expected to produce just a few hundred thousand units. Huawei launched its first foldable phone with one seam in 2019.\nIn Shenzhen on Tuesday, Mr. Yu, the Huawei executive, said the phone\u2019s high price reflected how challenging it was to produce. \u201cWe hope to reduce the cost by improving the process after it is launched on the market,\u201d he said.\nStill, as of Tuesday, more than four million people had signed up on Huawei\u2019s website to be notified when the Mate XT goes on sale.\nClaire Fucontributed reporting from Seoul."
