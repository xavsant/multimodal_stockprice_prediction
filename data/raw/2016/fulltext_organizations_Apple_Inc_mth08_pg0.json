        "fulltext": "Q.My wife and I have used Apple\u2019s Numbers program to open and edit Microsoft Excel files. But how can Excel subsequently be used to open and edit the same file after it\u2019s been opened in Numbers?\nA.When a spreadsheet created in Microsoft Excel is opened in Apple\u2019s Numbers app forOS X,iOSandiCloud, the file is imported and converted to the Numbers format. To open that same file again later in Excel, you need toexport the spreadsheet back onto Excel\u2019s own format. Keep in mind that theconversion between programs may not be seamless, as some Excel features likepivot tables,surface chartsand certain graphic elements are not supported by Numbers.\nOn the OS X version of Numbers, open the file you want to use later in Excel. Go to the File menu, choose Export To and select Excel from the submenu. In the Export Your Spreadsheet box, click the arrow next to Advanced Options and use the drop-down menu to select the newer Excel format (.xlsx) or the older file format (.xls) used by the program from 1997 to 2004. Click the Next button to give the file a name and then click the Export button.\nIn Numbers on an iOS device, open the file you want to convert and tap the Share icon on the upper-right side of the toolbar. Select the \u201cSend a Copy\u201d option from the menu and tap Excel in the next box. Once the file converts to the .xlsx format, choose how you want to share it \u2014 by email, saved to an online server and so forth.\nIf you have the file open in the Numbers app on the web at iCloud.com, click the wrench icon in the toolbar and choose either \u201cDownload a Copy\u201d or \u201cSend a Copy\u201d (to share by mail and other methods) from the menu. On the next box, choose Excel and follow the steps onscreen."

        "fulltext": "Q.Can you process RAW images in Apple\u2019s OS X Photos program?\nA.Photos, Apple\u2019s free image-editing program now included with the OS X operating system, can handle picture files inmany digital camera RAWformats,as did Apple\u2019s previous iPhoto software.For those unfamiliar with it, some digital cameras have a setting that allows them to capture images in anuncompressed format called RAW, along with the standard compressed JPEG format used by just about every smartphone and stand-alone camera around. (Apple\u2019scoming iOS 10 operating system will also let people collect RAW image datafrom the device\u2019s camera.)\nRAW images take up more room on the memory card than JPEG files because they contain all of the data from the camera\u2019s sensor. Many serious photographers prefer to work with RAW images because they havemore controlover how the photo ultimately looks. As the RAWfile contains more data to manipulatethan a JPEG, experienced users can download the image to a computer and process it themselves instead of having the camera do it. For example, a RAW file typically contains a greater dynamic range of highlights and shadows, which can produce bright, luminous photos with sharp contrast when adjusted in an image-editing program.\nAfter you set your camera on its version of theRAW and JPEG settingto capture both a RAW and a high-resolution JPEG version of each photo, connect your camera or memory card to the Mac and import the images into the Photos program. By default, Photos will present the JPEG version of the image when you double-click on a picture to open it. To get to the RAW copy, click the Edit button in the upper-right corner, go to the Image menu and choose Use RAW as Original. (If you used the camera\u2019s RAW-only setting for your pictures, or if your camera has slots for two memory cards and the option to store RAW files on one card and JPEG on the other, just upload the card full of RAW images to the computer.)\nWith the RAW version open, click the Adjust icon in the editing window andmake the changesyou wish to the photo\u2019s light, color and other properties. RAW files in your Photos librarycan be backed upto Apple\u2019s onlineiCloud Photo Libraryas well."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Emoji Gun Control",
        "fulltext": "Cambridge, Mass. \u2014 This month, Apple previewed some changes to its next generation of iPhones and iPads with the promise that \u201call the things you love to do are more expressive, more dynamic and more fun than ever.\u201d That especially includes emojis, those little icons that,accordingto one study, 92 percent of the online population now make part of their everyday communication.\nOne change in particular, though, is not delighting everyone. Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.\nApple hasn\u2019t said why it would be making this change, but this summer, along with Microsoft, the company lobbied Unicode, the nonprofit consortium that decides which emojis should exist,againstadding a separate rifle. For those emojis Unicode has already approved, like gun, it\u2019s up to each company to create a picture for it.\nIt\u2019spossiblethat the company\u2019s decision on the pistol resulted from a#DisarmTheiPhonecampaign by a public relations firm working with New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. \u201cThere is a gun we all carry that we can all give up,\u201d explains a video on the campaign\u2019swebsite\u2014 meaning the iPhone\u2019s picture of a gun. But the campaign was not asking individual people to abstain from using the emoji; it aimed at persuading Apple to prevent, in one swoop, anyone from sending or receiving that cartoon image of a handgun.\nApple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.\nSo what could justify a retroactive change by Apple that breaks compatibility among phones? One theory, perhaps derived fromnotionsthat toy guns are inappropriate for kids, could be that children\u2019s exposure to gun imagery might encourage violence. By changing the picture into something harmless, children will be protected. If that is the concern, Apple could address the issue by simply enabling parental controls for some emojis.\nThe thrust of our digital infrastructure should allow us to be, in Apple\u2019s words, more expressive. That\u2019s why last year\u2019s change to allow people toselect emoji skin-tone shadingwas good news. When it comes to restrictions, technology companies should limit only speech that breaks clearly stated and openly applied rules, not deprive us of entire tools and means of expression.\nTo take a related example, some have demanded that Facebook actively monitor live feeds \u2014 whether through a squad of customer service reps or through artificial intelligence methods \u2014 and cut off those that might bethreats to public safetyor merely considered inappropriate. This is a dangerous path to tread when there are only a handful of private gatekeepers.\nTo eliminate an elemental concept from a language\u2019s vocabulary is to reflect a sweeping view of how availability of language can control behavior, as well as a strange desire for companies \u2014 and inevitably, governments \u2014 to police our behavior through that language. In the United States, this confuses taking a particular position on the Second Amendment, concerning the right to bear arms, with the First, which guarantees freedom of speech, including speechaboutarms.\nThose behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.\nWith emojis so popular, the Unicode Consortium now requires those who want to propose new emojis for standardization to take a ticket and join a queue, laying out a two-yearprocessfor people to suggest things like dumplings, sleds and robots and await the consortium\u2019s judgment.\nIt need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.\nSome will be skeptical that emojis represent a profound expression of speech the way that more traditional languages do, but even the skeptics should worry about private companies\u2019 intervening in what their users can say before they even try to say it. Today, users of the Chinese version of Skype simply cannot type to one another certainwords, including \u201ctruthfulness,\u201d \u201ccampus upheaval\u201d and \u201cAmnesty International.\u201d\nApple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand. Apple should be no more responsible if someone uses a gun image in the abstract than if someone happens to type the word \u201cgun.\u201d\nAs free citizens, we acquiesce to infantilizing digital infrastructure at our peril."

        "title": "Daily Report: Venture Capital\u2019s Endangered Middle Class",
        "fulltext": "There\u2019s a lot of anxiety about the future of the middle class in America. There should be in Silicon Valley, too, but in a different sense: It\u2019s getting harder to see much of a future for midrange venture capital firms and midsize tech companies.\nAs Katie Bennerwrites, a venture firm called Technology Crossover Ventures just raised a $2.5 billion fund. That is more than 25 percent of the $8.8 billion raised across the industry in the second quarter of this year. It\u2019s not that TCV alone will dominate the industry, but rather that there is now an intense concentration of power in a few firms. And it is happening just as there is an intense concentration of power in \u2014 and acquisition of new companies by \u2014 a few tech companies.\nIn the first half of the year, the article notes, just five venture firms raised $7.4 billion, or about one-third of the $22.9 billion raised over all by V.C.s.According tothe National Venture Capital Association, at the end of 2015 there 798 venture firms in the United States.\n\u201cPeople are starting to wonder if it\u2019s turning into a world of haves and have-nots,\u201d Katie said when I asked her about this. \u201cThere are rich tech guys doing angel and seed investing at the low end, then there are these huge funds. It looks like the end of the middle.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the only place. Like never before in Silicon Valley, big companies like Facebook, Google and Apple are buying start-ups very early in their life. They want the talent, and unlike the giants that preceded them, they believe that they have figured out how to turn near prototypes, likevirtual reality goggles, into big commercial products.\nMoreover, the computing infrastructure that powers tech companies is changing to cloud computing. The cloud business is concentrated in just a few companies, primarily Google, Amazon and Microsoft. People at these companies are working on their own gear andbuying components in bulkfrom giant suppliers.\nThat is going to affect the midsize companies, each making a few hundred million dollars a year and collectively employing tens of thousands of people.\nThey will have less of a place. They will have less demand, if much of the back end of computing is in a few big cloud giants. And they will have fewer likely backers, if a small number of venture capital firms are trying to invest very large amounts of money.\nWhich raises another question from the current venture funding: Where are the haves among the venture capitalists going to invest all that money?\nThere\u2019s still plenty to invent, of course, and some of it is still going to cost a lot, particularly in the more esoteric worlds of genomics, biotechnology and advanced computing. There are big-capital projects, like rocketry and theHyperloop, a proposed super-high-speed train.\nSome of that is the kind of infrastructure investment you would normally associate with a bank or a sovereign wealth fund. But clearly, the world is changing.\nAnother rich area to pursue, somewhere between traditional venture and infrastructure, is adapting tech throughout other industries \u2014 taking big data intoagriculture, for example, or bringing artificial intelligenceto oil refining. Changing the world can still take a lot of money."

        "fulltext": "The shoo-in for No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s next album chart is Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cBlonde,\u201d which hascharmed criticsand enthralled fans who had waited four years since his last record.\nBut the release of the album last weekend, through an exclusive deal with Apple, has also roiled the industry, bringing to the surface long-simmering tensions that record companies have with streaming music services, and sometimes even with their own artists.\nWithin days of the album\u2019s release, a series of revelations about Mr. Ocean and \u201cBlonde\u201d \u2014 whose cover artspells it \u201cBlond\u201d\u2014 emerged that portray a business deeply in flux. Mr. Ocean, it seemed, was no longer signed to Def Jam, his record company, when \u201cBlonde\u201d was released. He had apparently fulfilled his contractual agreement with the label with the release of a separate \u201cvisual album\u201d the day before \u201cBlonde\u201d came out \u2014 a move that cut Def Jam and its corporate parent, the giant Universal Music Group, out of the profits for one of the year\u2019s most-anticipated albums.\nAt the same time, Universal\u2019s management decided to clamp down on the growing practice of releasing new music through exclusive deals with digital outlets like Apple Music and Tidal, a move that reasserted the label\u2019s control over the music its artists produce but also risked alienating top performers who benefit from such promotions.\nAs the industry has struggled to interpret the fallout from \u201cBlonde,\u201d one thing is clear: In the streaming age, the complex series of relationships that the music business relies on to function have become anything but harmonious.\n\u201cThe unprecedented run of exclusives by digital music services has put a tremendous strain on the relationship between artists and their record companies,\u201d said Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School. \u201cWe are seeing that play out in public now.\u201d\nThe details of Mr. Ocean\u2019s exit from Def Jam are still unclear. But the story began to take shape when fans noticed that the label\u2019s name was nowhere to be found in the credits for \u201cBlonde.\u201d That album had come out just a day after the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s \u201cEndless,\u201d a 46-minute \u201cvisual album,\u201d also an Apple Music exclusive.\nDespite its idiosyncratic format, \u201cEndless\u201d \u2014 one long streaming film, whose songs (different from those on \u201cBlonde\u201d) were not available separately \u2014 fulfilled Mr. Ocean\u2019s contractual obligations to Def Jam, enabling him to release \u201cBlonde\u201d through Apple without any involvement from the label, according to three people with knowledge of Mr. Ocean\u2019s deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The financial arrangement between Mr. Ocean and Apple is not known. Apple, Def Jam and a representative for Mr. Ocean\u2019s managers all declined to comment.\nIt was still not known whether a CD version of \u201cBlonde\u201d would be made widely available, and if so, what company would handle its distribution now that Mr. Ocean is no longer on the Def Jam roster. (In another twist to the unusual release of \u201cBlonde,\u201d a relatively small number of CDs were included with copies of a printed publication called Boys Don\u2019t Cry that were given away for a limited time in pop-up stores in New York and three other cities.)\nIndependence may be particularly attractive to an artist like Mr. Ocean, who is revered as an innovator but has been a reclusive and enigmatic figure; he has alsocomplained in the pastabout Def Jam. But the way \u201cBlonde\u201d was released is also viewed as representative of a wider shift in the power dynamics between artists, record labels and technology companies.\nIt follows a year of deal-making by streaming music companies like Apple and Tidal focused on exclusive album releases. Used by the streaming outlets to attract attention and subscribers, these arrangements \u2014 in which an album is available on only one service for a limited period, usually a week or two \u2014 have also been viewed by artists as ways to finance new projects, since they often involve a significant financial commitment from the streaming service to pay for videos or other forms of promotion, according to music and talent executives who have negotiated the deals.\nOver the last year, major albums by Beyonc\u00e9, Drake, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Rihanna, Future and DJ Khaled were released first through exclusive streaming deals of various kinds. Apple has carved out a particular role in paying for videos by stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Taylor Swift.\nBut deals like these have also often irritated fans, since they sequester music on a particular subscription-based service \u2014 even if only for a limited time. Record labels also often dislike them because they limit sales and frequently lead to piracy.\nThey are also seen as examples of digital services interfering in the labels\u2019 relationships with artists, a connection that in decades past was absolute but has already been chipped away by declining record sales and the rise of the concert business as a major source of revenue for artists.\nThe tide may be turning against exclusives, at least from the perspective of the labels. After the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s album, Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, sent a private memo to top executives at the company\u2019s labels calling for an end to long-term exclusive deals with a single service, according to a person who has seen the memo but spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was an internal document. Yet that edict may still leave the company plenty of room to negotiate more limited deals with digital services. A spokesman for Universal declined to comment.\nExecutives at two major record labels said that in recent weeks Spotify, which has resisted exclusives, had told them that it had instituted a policy that music that had benefited from such deals on other services would not receive the same level of promotion once it arrived on Spotify; such music may not be as prominently featured or included in as many playlists, said these executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private negotiations. Spotify declined to comment.\nOthers in the music world have called for a truce between labels and digital services when it comes to online distribution, particularly when it concerns young artists like Mr. Ocean, who at 28 has no experience with the record industry before its digital disruption.\n\u201cArtists want to be fully empowered to control their careers, and they don\u2019t want the old school to tell them what to do,\u201d said Doug Davis, a music industry lawyer. \u201cUltimately there has to be a resolution between the major labels and the artists that allows them to control their destinies and cash in on the financial opportunities that are out there.\u201d"

        "title": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier",
        "fulltext": "Google and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.\nOn Tuesday, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple\u2019sFaceTime.\nThe app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.\nDuo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201d\nAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.\nNick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\n\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\nApple does not profess to be worried by Google\u2019s moves. When the iPhone maker reportedfalling saleslast month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen.\n\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.\nI decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.\nA Short History\nFirst, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. The Silicon Valley company announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duowould be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to access.\nThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.\nCrystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.\nFaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.\nDuo Versus FaceTime\nThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.\nDuo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.\nWith FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.\nI placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.\nThere is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.\nAgainst the Rest\nI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.\nIn Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.\nOn Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.\nThe Bottom Line\nFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.\nBut if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the primordial days of computing, IBM machines were so common inside corporations that there was arunning jokein the industry: Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.\nThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.\nApple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\nFor Apple, which isstruggling to reverse declining sales of its iPhones and Macsand has seen overall revenues drop for two quarters in a row, the corporate market is a surprising bright spot. Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong. Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments, according to the research firm Forrester.\n\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.\nIt is a long way from the days when Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder and longtime chief executive,derided corporate technology buyers as \u201corifices\u201dand preferred to focus on building great products that would sell themselves.\nPinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.\nCompanies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.\nFor British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\n\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.\nApple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201d\nApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\n\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201d\nApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.\nHence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201d\nIBM, Apple\u2019s archrival in the early personal computer business, is now one of the company\u2019s biggest boosters. Under a two-year-old partnership, IBM, which has transformed itself into a technology services powerhouse,has developed more than 100 business-oriented appsfor Apple\u2019s iOS operating system that it has sold to over 2,000 enterprises. The effort brought in more than half a billion dollars in revenue to Big Blue last year.\nMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.\nClaims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.\nApple has alsostruck a deal with Cisco Systems, a maker of gear that manages corporate computer networks, to develop software that gives priority to mobile devices or apps. That software is in testing and will be unveiled next month when Apple releases a big upgrade to its mobile operating system.\nThree months ago,Apple teamed up with SAP, a big German maker of business software, to make it easier to build apps that connect to the SAP back-end software that many large enterprises use for inventory, sales, human resources and other corporate tasks. SAP is developing some of those apps itself and also writing a set of software tools that will let companies easily write their own mobile apps to retrieve their SAP systems.\nMany companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.\nOther apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\n\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201d\nVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.\nThat opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\n\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Owes $14.5 Billion in Back Taxes to Ireland, E.U. Says",
        "fulltext": "The European Union on Tuesday ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, a record penalty that worsened tensions with the United States over the bloc\u2019s crackdown on sweetheart deals with global multinationals.\nEurope\u2019s competition enforcer said that Apple\u2019s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a \u201chead office\u201d with \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities,\u201d the commission said.\nBy doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years\u2019 worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest.\nThe amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law. The United States Treasury Department said it jeopardized \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the E.U.\u201d\nSince taking over as competition commissioner,Margrethe Vestager, has made tax avoidance a central focus, a campaign that has also ensnaredStarbucks in the Netherlands,Amazon in LuxembourgandAnheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. The United States Treasury, one of the most vocal critics of these moves, has said that Europe is overstepping its power, unfairly targeting American companies and hurting global efforts to curtail tax avoidance.\nThe United States government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to places like Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates.\nBut the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty and the rights to regulate them.\ntranscript\nBrussels - 30 August 2016\n//\n SOUNDBITE (English) Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner:\n\u201cAs a result of the allocation method in the tax rulings, only a fraction of the profits from the Apple sales internationally were attributed to the Irish branch. The remaining - the vast majority of profits - was attributed to the so-called \u2018Head Office\u2019. This means that Apple Sales International, as a whole, paid very little tax on its profits. Let me illustrate for one tax year: in 2011 Apple Sales International made a profit of 16 billion euros (18 billion US dollars). Less than 50 million euros (56 million US dollars) were allocated to the Irish branch; the rest - the huge majority - was allocated to the so-called \u2018Head Office,\u2019 where they remained untaxed. This means that Apple\u2019s effective tax rate in 2011 was 0.05 percent. To put that in perspective it means that for every million euros (1.1 million US dollars) in profits it paid just 500 euros (558 US dollars) in taxes. This effective tax rate dropped further to as little as 0.005 percent in 2014, which means that even less was paid in taxes - it was 50 euros (56 US dollars) per million in profits.\u201d\n//\n SOUNDBITE (English) Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner:\n\u201cThe commission still have two in-depth state aid investigations underway in to the tax treatment of Amazon and McDonald\u2019s in Luxembourg, and we are continuing our work on reviewing more than a thousand tax rulings from all EU countries that make use of them. So, we still have some work ahead of us to ensure that companies compete on equal terms, and not at the expense of EU tax payers, that be other companies or citizens.\u201d\n//\nSOUNDBITE (English) Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner:\n\u201cThe European Commission has today adopted a decision that Apple\u2019s tax benefits in Ireland are illegal. Two tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple\u2019s tax burden for over two decades in breach of EU-stated rules. Apple now have to repay the benefits, worth up to 13 billion euros plus interest. This decision sends a clear message: member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not.\u201d\n\u201cU.S. companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\u201cNevertheless, because of the nature of U.S. politics,\u201d he said, the Apple case \u201cwill be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching and discriminating against \u2018our team.\u2019\u201d\nSince early this year, Ms. Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe\u2019s state-aid tax investigations. Mr. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the American perspective.\nLast week, the Treasury Departmentreleased a reportcriticizing any moves to recoup back taxes from American companies. Politicians also chimed in after the Apple decision.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a \u201ccheap money grab\u201d by the European Commission, \u201ctargeting U.S. businesses and the U.S. tax base.\u201d The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said that the decision \u201cencroaches on U.S. tax jurisdiction.\u201d\nApple and Ireland had similar defenses.\nTimothy D. Cook, the chief executive of the technology company, said that Europe\u2019s ruling had \u201cno basis in fact or in law,\u201d and called it an effort to \u201crewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.\u201d The company called the effective tax rate \u201ca completely made-up number.\u201d\nThe Finance Ministry of Ireland said that the commission\u2019s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said that taxes were a \u201cfundamental matter of sovereignty.\u201d\nIreland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe\u2019s decision, even though any appeals process could take years.\nThe commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if the American authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,\u201d the competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cWe need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency.\u201d\nAlthough the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is a bit more complicated.\nA United States Senate committee said in 2013 that Apple had negotiateda special corporate tax rateof 2 percent or less in Ireland. While the committee did not accuse Apple of breaking any laws, lawmakers criticized the \u201cgimmicks,\u201d \u201cschemes\u201d and complex corporate structures that allowed the company to sidestep taxes. The public scrutiny and the emergence of previously confidential information about Apple\u2019s tax arrangements, in part, helped spark Europe\u2019s own investigation into the issue.\nApple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States.\nNonfinancial American companies hold a combined $1.7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s. Just the international piece of Apple\u2019s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion.\nIreland has faced broad scrutiny for its tax appeal.\nIn a matter separate from the Apple case, the United States Treasury has taken aggressive steps to curtail so-called inversions, a tax move that has significantly benefited Ireland. Under those merger deals, an American company would buy an overseas counterpart and shift its headquarters overseas to lower its taxes.\nIreland, with its low corporate tax rate, has been an especially big winner with inversions. Such financial maneuvers helpedplump up the country\u2019s economy, which grew at a breakneck 26.3 percent last year.\nIreland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bills even further. While it is phasing out some of the more contested loopholes, Ireland has just introduced a new break for profit on intellectual property, a potentially huge benefit to large technology companies with troves of patents.\n\u201cMany member states are not unhappy about the European Commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d said Philipp Werner, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in Brussels. \u201cThey may help to close down tax havens.\u201d"

        "title": "Daily Report: The Tax Man Comes for Apple in Ireland",
        "fulltext": "The technology industry has enjoyed a cozy relationship with Washington in recent years. Gone, it seems, are the days of brass-knuckled antitrust investigations and \u2014 other than a fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over encryption \u2014 threats of tougher regulations.\nNow in Europe, that\u2019s another story. On Tuesday, the European Union\u2019s competition authoritiesruledthat Apple will have to pay 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest, in back taxes to the Irish government. Antitrust officials argue that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local taxes from 1991 to 2007.\nThe Irish government said it would move to appeal the decision and Apple can support that appeal in a process that could take years. But the decision is likely to stir charges that the E.U. is overreaching.\nApple is not the only American companybeing targetedby European regulators. Google, which has largely escaped antitrust concerns in the United States, could still face competition concerns across the Atlantic. Facebook\u2019s run-ins with local privacy regulators are near routine. And law enforcement in various European countries, like their American counterparts, are indicating they would like to limit the use of encryption in technology products.\nThe source of some of these European concerns? American companies like the review site Yelp that believe their complaints have been ignored in their own country."

        "title": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes",
        "fulltext": "Apple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.\nBut Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.\nApple has engaged inincreasingly aggressive tax avoidancefor at least a decade, including stashing some $100 billion in Ireland without paying taxes on much of it anywhere in the world, according to aSenate investigation in 2013. In a display of arrogance, the company seemed to believe that its arrangements in a knowntax haven like Irelandwould never be deemed illegal \u2014 even as European regulators cracked down in similar cases against such multinational corporations as Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat and the German chemical giant BASF.\nCongress, for its part, has sat idly by as American corporations have indulged in increasingly intricate forms of tax avoidance made possible by the interplay of an outmodedcorporate tax codeand modern globalized finance. The biggest tax dodge in need of reform involves deferral, in which American companies can defer paying taxes on foreign-held profits until those sums are repatriated.\nInitially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.\nBefore the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.\nThe European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.\nBut the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.\nThe way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.\nRepublicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes."
