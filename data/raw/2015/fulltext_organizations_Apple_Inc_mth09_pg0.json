        "title": "Apple and Google Create a Buzz at Frankfurt Motor Show",
        "fulltext": "FRANKFURT \u2014 WHETHER or notApple\u2019s secretive car project ever leads to an actual automobile, the technology company has already had a profound effect on the vehicle business.\nThe mere knowledge that Apple has a team of several hundred peopleworking on car designschanged the conversation this week at the FrankfurtInternational Motor Show. Along withGoogle, Apple has focused the minds of auto executives on the challenge posed by new technologies that have the potential to disrupt traditional auto industry hierarchies.\nThis year, \u201cconnectivity\u201d has supplanted \u201chorsepower\u201d or \u201ctorque\u201d as the prevailing buzzword in Frankfurt. The talk is of self-driving cars, battery-powered cars and information technology designed to link cars with data networks to make driving safer and more efficient.\nEven though neither Apple nor Google is close to mass-producing a vehicle, nervousness about their intentions \u2014 which remain cloaked in mystery \u2014 is understandable.\nAs cars increasingly become rolling software platforms, Apple and Google have depths of tech expertise that the carmakers would have trouble duplicating. And those Silicon Valley companies have financial resources that dwarf those of even behemoth companies like Daimler andVolkswagen. Google, which began working on self-driving cars in 2009, is valued by the stock market at more than five times the worth of either of those carmakers. Apple is worth eight times as much. That gives them an advantage in a business that requires huge investment in research and development.\nThe main risk for carmakers is probably not so much that an Apple car would destroy Mercedes-Benz or BMW the way the iPhone gutted Nokia, the Finnish company that was once the world\u2019s largest maker of mobile phones. Rather, the risk is that Apple and Google would turn the carmakers into mere hardware makers \u2014 and hog the profit.\nCarmakers say they are determined to resist that danger by maintaining control of the software that is proliferating inside vehicles.\n\u201cWhat is important for us is that the brain of the car, the operating system, is not iOS or Android or someone else but it\u2019s our brain,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, the maker of Mercedes vehicles, told reporters at the car show. IOS is Apple\u2019s operating system for mobile devices.\n\u201cWe do not plan to become the Foxconn of Apple,\u201d Mr. Zetsche said, referring to the Taiwanese-owned company that manufactures iPhones in China.\nEven without competition from Apple and Google, the carmakers are under extreme pressure to change the way they build cars. Regulators in Europe and the United States are demanding that cars emit less carbon dioxide, a culprit in global warming. The only way the automakers can meet increasingly stringent emissions standards is by selling more hybrid vehicles, and eventually all-electric cars. Both technologies require more software than gasoline or diesel engines.\nTechnology that links cars to data networks, so-called connectivity, also plays a role in reducing emissions and satisfying regulators. Systems that help drivers quickly find a parking space or avoid traffic jams, besides being convenient, help limit unnecessary driving and save fuel. But the new technologies are expensive, and car buyers are not necessarily willing to pay. Electric cars account for a sliver of the market so far.\nThose pressures have been building for several years, but they have intensified since word leaked out early this year that Apple was studying whether to build a car.\n\u201cWhat has been an evolution is going to be a revolution,\u201d said Stephan Winkelmann, the chief executive of Lamborghini, the Italian maker of super sports cars that is part of the Volkswagen group.\n\u201cStarting from sustainability, going over to digitalization, and ending up at autonomous driving \u2014 these three big things are really something that is a game changer for the automotive industry,\u201d Mr. Winkelmann said in an interview. \u201cEverybody has to tackle these challenges.\u201d\nVolkswagen, previously regarded as a laggard in vehicle electrification, said in Frankfurt this week that it would introduce 20 new plug-in hybrid or all-electric models by 2020, and it introduceda battery-powered Porscheconcept car. At the company\u2019s preshow extravaganza for the media Monday night at a repurposed basketball arena, there was nary a mention of internal combustion. Instead, Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive, spoke of cars that would park themselves and eventually run completely on autopilot.\n\u201cBy the end of this decade we will have transformed all of our new cars into smartphones on wheels,\u201d he said.\nIt is not only the European carmakers closely watching Apple and Google. Anthony Foxx, the United States transportation secretary, in Frankfurt for a meeting on Thursday with his counterparts from other G7 nations, said conventional automakers were trying to roll out technology as fast as they can, while some in Silicon Valley were aiming to leap straight to self-driving cars.\n\u201cThere is an interesting dialogue between Detroit and Silicon Valley on this,\u201d Mr. Foxx said during a meeting with several reporters. \u201cThere is probably some tension there, but maybe that is good creative tension.\u201d\nOne of the main guessing games at the auto show was whether Apple or Google would ever build a car. Both companies have met with German car companies as well as suppliers. Google executives have said the company will not become a carmaker.\n\u201cGoogle is not a car manufacturer and does not intend to become one,\u201d Philipp Justus, a Google vice president in Europe, said.\nBut it was not clear yet whether he meant that Google would license self-driving technology to traditional carmakers, or use contract manufacturers to build a vehicle. A Google spokesman declined to elaborate.\nApple\u2019s intentions are murkier. As is customary for Apple, the company has provided no information. But Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, reportedly visited a factory in Leipzig, Germany, last year where BMW manufactures the i3, an all-electric sedan with a carbon fiber body.\n\u201cWe are not quite sure what Apple is prepared to do,\u201d Friedrich Eichiner, the chief financial officer of BMW, said during a meeting with a group of reporters in Frankfurt. He said he thought Apple was still trying to understand the implications of getting into the car business.\n\u201cFinancially they are very strong,\u201d Mr. Eichiner said. \u201cThey could do it.\u201d\nLuca de Meo, head of sales and marketing at Audi, another Volkswagen unit, said it would be out of character for Apple not to build its own vehicle, if it decides to get into the car business. \u201cThe Apple style is the ability to do software and hardware at the same time,\u201d Mr. de Meo said in an interview.\nThe traditional carmakers\u2019 big advantage is that they have already mastered the formidable complexity of manufacturing vehicles that are reliable, comfortable and safe. But it is becoming more feasible for a newcomer to outsource vehicle manufacturing the same way that Apple outsources production of iPhones. And the outsourcer wouldn\u2019t necessarily be in China.\nOne company already working with Google is ZF, a large German auto components supplier that in May completed an acquisition of TRW, a company based in Michigan that provides auto electronics such as airbag systems. TRW has been working on sensors and other hardware for self-driving cars.\nStefan Sommer, the chief executive of ZF, said the company would be able to produce a Google-branded car along with two or three other partners supplying components that ZF can\u2019t, such as sheet metal body parts. \u201cWe would be a partner in that, for sure,\u201d Mr. Sommer said in an interview.\nBut he said ZF could not work with Apple under the conditions it now imposes on suppliers. ZF sees itself as an innovator, not just a supplier. In Frankfurt, it displayed a car with electrically powered wheels that allow the car to turn 360 degrees almost on its own axis. ZF could not agree to demands by Apple for exclusive rights to such inventions, Mr. Sommer said.\nWhile Apple and Google pose a threat to traditional automakers, the mood in Frankfurt is not gloomy. Not long ago, analysts were predicting that the auto industry faced long-term decline. Surveys showed that younger people were less interested than their parents in cars and driving. But if Apple and Google are interested in the car industry, auto executives reason, cars and driving must be cool again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s confirmation that we are working in a future industry,\u201d said Ola K\u00e4llenius, head of marketing and sales for Mercedes-Benz cars.\nApple and Google have given the car industry a jolt. Now the question is whether carmakers can respond quickly enough.\nAnd they are trying to raise their games. Daimler, for example, reorganized its factories around the world last year, eliminating plant managers and giving control over production to the executives in charge of different model lines. The change allowed Mercedes to introduce a new variant of its popular C-Class at four factories, on four continents, in six months \u2014 about half of what it would have taken earlier, said Markus Sch\u00e4fer, head of production at Mercedes.\n\u201cThis enables us to be more competitive in a world where new competitors come to the table,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4fer said.\n\u201cWe created the automobile,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will not be a hardware provider to somebody else.\u201d"

        "title": "Siri, Apple Music and Other iPhone Questions",
        "fulltext": "We asked readers to send us questions aboutApple\u2019s newest smartphones, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which go on sale on Friday. Brian X. Chen and Farhad Manjoo answer the queries.\nQ. I understand that buying the phone at a discounted price and being locked into a two-year plan is not worth it if I plan to keep the phone longer than two years. What\u2019s the best AT&T plan for purchasing an iPhone 6s? Should I pay full price upfront? Or should I choose a plan to pay for the phone over time? \u2014Peter Liao, Manhattan\nBrian:Take a look at my recent article onchoosing the best phone plan, which includes a roundup of plans and prices using an iPhone as the base example. After doing the math, you will find that over two years, the total cost of smartphone ownership and service on a two-year contract is slightly lower than on a two-year installment plan.\nHowever, if you hold onto a phone longer than two years, after you finish paying off the phone on an installment plan, the cost of the smartphone is subtracted from the monthly bill and you pay a lower rate, saving money over time. For you, an installment plan is the way to go.\nYou should look at your phone bills and calculate the average amount of data you use each month and choose a data bucket. (If it helps, the average American consumer uses three gigabytes of cellular data a month). Then choose an installment plan \u2014 for AT&T there is Next 12, Next 18 and Next 24. For your sake, Next 18 would work because it spreads phone payments over 24 months; after that, the monthly rate drops. You don\u2019t have to pay the full price of the phone upfront; it makes no difference because there is no interest charge when you spread payments over monthly installments. Hope this isn\u2019t too confusing.\nQ.Can you turn off \u201cHey Siri\u201d? Is it on by default only on the iPhone 6 and 6s, or all devices using iOS 9, or some subset of iOS 9 devices?\u2014 Hugh McNally, Bridgeport, Conn.\nFarhad:\u201cHey Siri,\u201dthe feature that lets you activate the iPhone\u2019s voice assistant without pressing a button, is available on the iPhone 4s or later models, but on most models it works only when the device is plugged into a charger. On the latest iPhones, it works even when the phone is unplugged.\nThe feature is turned off by default, but the iPhone gives you the option to turn it on when you set up a new phone. If you are runningiOS 9, Apple\u2019s latest operating system, you will be asked to say \u201cHey Siri\u201d several times to teach the phone your voice.\nQ. Does 3D Touch make the Apple Music interface any less frustrating?\u2014 Andrew Bell, Richmond, Va.\nBrian:It depends on what\u2019s frustrating you. Thenew 3D Touch featuremakes Apple Music a bit quicker to control. If you press down firmly on the Apple Music icon, you can load a menu of quick actions, including the ability to search for a song, or play the Beats 1 radio station. You can also press lightly on an album to peek at the list of songs and then press hard to open the album.\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that 3D Touch is just an additional way to interact with Apple Music. Personally, I find Siri much quicker for playing music with Apple Music. If you say something like \u201cSiri, play \u2018Doolittle\u2019 by the Pixies,\u201d it will begin playing that specific album. This is especially useful when driving in the car.\nQ.You mentioned that \u201cApple says Siri is watching for a pattern, not recording or storing any data.\u201d Are you sure the Siri server doesn\u2019t store data?\u2014 Wynn Miller, Colorado Springs\nFarhad:To make \u201cHey Siri\u201d work, the iPhone has to constantly analyze audio patterns to figure out if someone is calling Siri\u2019s name. That audio, Apple says, is not stored on the iPhone.\nHowever, after you invoke Siri, your voice is recorded and sent to Apple\u2019s servers to decipher. The device may also send other data, too, like your location and the names in your contacts.Apple saysthis data is not associated with your name or Apple account, but rather with a random identifier linked to your device.Apple has saidthe random identifier and other data that Siri has collected from you in the previous six months will be deleted if you turn Siri off on your phone. The company says voice snippets that are older than six months are \u201cdissociated\u201d from specific user accounts; these anonymized snippets are deleted after 18 months on Apple\u2019s servers.\nQ.Would there be an overlap (and potential confusion) between 3D Touch-driven interactions and long tap-driven ones?\u2014 Amitava Bhattacharyya, New York, N.Y.\nFarhad:Yes, there is some confusion, but only when you first start using 3D Touch. After a few uses, you will easily be able to remember when to press longer and when to press harder. It helps that there aren\u2019t many interface actions in the iPhone that call for a long press on the screen. The most common use of the long press is to rearrange the icons on your Home Screen, which people don\u2019t do very often.\ntranscript\nna\nQ.Is there a tutorial or iPhone expert who could teach me how to use my new iPhone 6s Plus? I use \u201cHey Siri\u201d to set calendar appointments, make phone calls and send texts, but that is the extent of it.\u2014 Ellen G. Siegel, Durango, Colo.\nBrian:Apple provides auser guideon its website for the iPhone running iOS 9. If you visit an Apple retail store, the employees would also walk you through the various features. For Siri specifically, Apple also has awebpageexplaining how to use the voice assistant. Lastly, the iPhone includes a \u201cTips\u201d app that offers a brief tutorial for some of the main features on the phone.\nQ.I\u2019ll probably upgrade soon from my iPhone 5 to the 6s. If I tell Siri to guide me to a particular destination, will it do so without my having to tap on Maps?\u2014 Bernd, Sierra Madre, Calif.\nFarhad:Yes, that should work on all iPhones that support Siri.\nQ.Are the phones purchased via the iPhone upgrade program unlocked? If so, why does Apple ask what carrier you are going to use when I try to reserve a phone?\u2014 Charlie, Austin, Tex.\nBrian:Yes, they are unlocked. Apple asks you to choose a carrier because it requires that the iPhone be activated on AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint or T-Mobile USA (presumably because of business arrangements it made with those carriers).\nThat still means, however, that the device is unlocked. So if you decide you want to switch to another carrier, you can sign up for its plan and pop in that carrier\u2019s SIM card. Or if you travel abroad, you can switch to a foreign carrier\u2019s SIM card. (In the past, you would typically have to ask the carrier to unlock the phone before your phone would work on a different network.)\nQ.I will be upgrading from my Samsung Galaxy 3. Currently, I download and store YouTube videos (MP4 and MP3) on my phone. If I get an iPhone 6s, will I be able to do that?\u2014 Ken Leebow, Atlanta\nFarhad:YouTube\u2019s own iPhone app does not let you download videos. But if you use one of the many websites that do let you save YouTube videos and then put those files on your iPhone, they will most likely play just fine."

        "title": "Hands-On Experience With Apple\u2019s New Devices",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Just in time for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, Apple on Wednesday announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.\nWith the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple\u2019sfamily of iPadsalso gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen \u2014 much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.\nAt the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions.\nThe 3D Touch capability is the iPhone\u2019s signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.\nA light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions \u2014 for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.\nI found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.\nThe new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple\u2019s website and not when holding the devices.\nThe iPad Pro\u2019s jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.\nThe iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. Previous iPads could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.\nThe large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 1.5 pounds, which is the same weight as the very first iPad.\nThe Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colors, similar to Apple\u2019s Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.\nI decided to have some fun playing a game with the new Apple TV remote control. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.\nI also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control\u2019s microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said \u201ccomedy,\u201d thinking I had said \u201ccomity.\u201d But it did a better job with action movies \u2014 when I said \u201cshow me action movies,\u201d Siri brought up a list of titles including \u201cMad Max\u201d and \u201cFurious 7.\u201d\nThe new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that\u2019s a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions."

        "title": "Charter and Time Warner Vote, and Chinese Tech Meeting in Seattle",
        "fulltext": "Shareholders of both Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable will vote on Monday on their proposed $56.7 billion merger. Announced in May, Charter\u2019s takeover of Time Warner Cable, along with a deal for Bright House Networks, would create the country\u2019s second-largest broadband Internet provider and third-largest video provider.\nCharter shareholders will also vote on Monday on the company\u2019s $10.4 billion deal for Bright House and the sale of $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband. The vote comes a little more than a week after the Federal Communications Commission started its 180-day timetable to review the deal.EMILY STEEL\nOn Tuesday, Bank of America shareholders will decide whether Brian T. Moynihan, above, keeps his dual titles of chief executive and board chairman. The bank\u2019s board argues that it needs the flexibility to grant him one or both titles.\nOpponents, including two large California pension funds, say the two roles should be separated to allow for greater oversight. Bank officials and the pensions have been lobbying major shareholders ahead of the vote in Charlotte, N.C.MICHAEL CORKERY\nOn Wednesday, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is scheduled to mark the second day of his visit to America in Seattle attending a photo opportunity with select leaders of Chinese and American technology companies, possibly including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, after members of his delegation attend a broader tech gathering.\nChina\u2019s Internet czar, Lu Wei, and executives like Jack Ma of Alibaba are expected at the gathering, which has frustrated American officials by veering off the plan for the visit.\nWhile some companies in the United States may take the chance to announce new deals in China, American officials worry that the gathering could portray China\u2019s leadership as constructively engaging American companies even as the administration has argued that China\u2019s cyberattacks and anticompetitive practices have hurt American firms.PAUL MOZUR\nOn Wednesday, a French court will rule on whether Uber\u2019s low-cost ride-hailing service can operate legally in the country. The decision follows widespread violent protests this summer by members of French taxi associations who were angry about Uber\u2019s aggressive expansion from Paris to Marseille.\nThe legality ruling comes a week before two Uber executives in France accused of operating an illegal taxi service are scheduled to stand trial.MARK SCOTT\nThe advocate general of the European Court of Justice, the region\u2019s highest court, will issue an opinion on Wednesday on whether people\u2019s online data can be shared between Europe and the United States. The case involves claims that Facebook cooperated in the National Security Agency\u2019s data collection program, called Prism, and could have wider implications for other American tech companies.\nWhile not binding, the advocate general\u2019s opinion will be a sign of how the European court will rule on the case later this year.MARK SCOTT\nJanet L. Yellen, above, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, is scheduled to deliver a speech about inflation on Thursday at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\nThe speech comes one week after the Fed concluded its September policy-making meeting by announcing that it was keeping interest rates near zero, in part because of the persistent sluggishness of inflation. Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech may shed light on why she thinks inflation has been so slow.BINYAMIN APPELBAUM\nNavinder Singh Sarao, above, a British futures trader, will face a court hearing in London on Friday to determine whether he will be sent to the United States to face charges of engaging in improper trading that contributed to a sudden plunge in American stock markets five years ago, known as the \u201cflash crash.\u201d\nMr. Sarao, 36, was arrested in Britain in April and has been fighting extradition. He was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago this month.CHAD BRAY\nOn Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its third and final estimate of economic growth in the second quarter.\nThe estimate was revised sharply upward to 3.7 percent in late August, and most economists are not looking for another big revision. But some analysts think a slight uptick could be in the offing, with growth boosted by stronger consumer spending and higher levels of construction.NELSON D. SCHWARTZ\nAlso Friday morning, the University of Michigan will release its final reading on consumer sentiment in September. The initial September survey showed an unexpectedly steep drop in the index to 85.7, as worries about volatility on Wall Street and global markets filtered down to consumers.\nExperts will be watching to see if the recent partial rebound in stocks has improved the outlook among consumers.NELSON D. SCHWARTZ\nApple\u2019s latest smartphones, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, go on sale on Friday in several countries and territories, including the United States and China. Shoppers who buy the new devices in an Apple store can opt in to the new iPhone Upgrade Program, which includes Apple\u2019s warranty program and the option to upgrade to a new phone every year.\nApple recently said that global preorders for the phones exceeded forecasts and that the company was racing to catch up with demand.KATIE BENNER"

        "title": "A Grab Bag of Software for the Apple Watch Upgrade",
        "fulltext": "The Apple Watch that I wear generates a constant stream of questions from friends and strangers alike. One thing they always ask is whether the device is actually useful. I always answer yes \u2014 and that\u2019s even more so now that Apple has releasedthe first major upgrade of the watch\u2019s operating system.\nThe upgrade, which Apple calls watchOS 2, had its debut last week. The refreshed operating system adds many more features to the watch and lets the device run its own apps without having to be tethered to an iPhone. There are some good apps to try.\nThe one I have been using most isCarrot Weather, a forecasting app with a sense of humor. The watch version has a text-heavy display that includes humorous quotes alongside the weather forecast. There\u2019s also a quick-glance graph of temperature predictions for the near future or an alert if it rain is expected. Swiping up the screen reveals a forecast for the next week, and tapping on a particular day gives you more detailed information: humidity, sunset times, UV index and more.\nThe app is simple but powerful, particularly if you enable the watch face \u201ccomplication\u201d feature, which shows you Carrot\u2019s weather predictions alongside the time on the watch face.The app costs $4but some information, like rain predictions, requires an upgrade to premium level for an additional $2 a year.\nAnother app I have been using often isCitymapper, which tries to help whether you are driving, taking a train, subway or even ferry. The travel app can help plan journeys because it has access to timetables for transport systems and can calculate how long it will take to walk or drive to a destination.\nTo navigate via the watch app, you tap on locations that you have preset in the phone version of the program. Tapping \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d on the watch then determines a route and guides you through a journey. For example, if I tap the \u201chome\u201d destination, I see a seven-minute walk to the station, then a wait for the 12:24 train, which I need to stay on for five stops. You can also use Citymapper to see journeys available by way of a train or bus stop near your location, and it will also show traffic or transit alerts for your nearest city.\nHaving Citymapper\u2019s information on your wrist is useful, particularly if you are in a hurry and don\u2019t want to fish for your phone in a pocket or bag. But thefree appsometimes reacts sluggishly when you touch the screen, and it may not work everywhere because of a limited coverage list.\nThis next app helps me, as a journalist, with recording interviews. The program,Just Press Record, has a dedicated Watch edition that records the sounds it hears through the watch\u2019s own microphone. It\u2019s quick to open, and you can start recording with a single tap. It even works if your watch is far from your phone \u2014 the files sync to the phone wirelessly when you are back in range.\nThe audio quality isn\u2019t stellar, but it is functional.The app costs $3, and you need to be using Apple\u2019s iCloud Drive for the files to sync properly.\nMany reviewers are also praisingCycles, an app for tracking the menstrual cycle. It\u2019s supposed to be very easy to use, giving warning of when your period is due and when you\u2019re ovulating.Cycles is free, but to get some alerts and the power to share data with a partner costs $2.\nIt\u2019s not all serious business on the watch. The appTimecrest, for example, brings a classic-designed text adventure to your wrist. That includes an interesting story (with a beginning like \u201cI\u2019m Ash, and my world is ending\u201d) and the interactions work well on the watch \u2014 you tap on one of several options to interact with the app after it has finished describing the current scene. There are several paths through the story line, and you may find yourself failing, at which point you can \u201crewind time\u201d to try again. This is where thefree gamemay get you buying fresh \u201ctime crystals,\u201d via in-app purchase, in order to win. Simple fun.\nAnother game to check out on your watch:Rules!This mentally taxing game pits you against the clock, asking you to tap on colorful playing tiles as you follow an increasingly complex sequence of rules like \u201ctap on odds,\u201d \u201ctap only animals\u201d and so on. It\u2019s addictive fun, perfect for whiling away time on a boring commute. The phone app, which includes a bigger, and thus more complex and difficult, playing area with more tiles to tap,costs $3and includes the watch edition.\nThe popular onlinelearning companyKhan Academyhas long had an app available forthe iPhone. The app has now had a big makeover on iOS, with improvements including a more-polished interface. There\u2019sa proper Android appfor the first time too. Both are free."

        "fulltext": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014Narendra ModiandMark Zuckerberghave much in common.\nMr. Modi, the prime minister of India, oversees a nation of 1.25 billion people. Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive ofFacebook, runs a social network with 1.5 billion active users. Both see themselves as global leaders pushing for broad social change, and both routinely use social media to communicate with their many millions of fans.\nOn Sunday, the two men engaged in a mutual admiration session at Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, with Mr. Modi fielding preselected questions from a crowd of Facebook employees and guests invited by the Indian Embassy.\nMr. Modi praised social networks like Facebook,Twitterand even China\u2019s Weibo as useful tools for governing and diplomacy.\n\u201cThe strength of social media is it can tell government where they are going wrong,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cWe used to have elections every five years. Now we have them every five minutes.\u201d\nMr. Modi\u2019s visit to Facebook came halfway through his weekend tour of Silicon Valley, where he has been meeting with technology executives and seeking their ideas and assistance in bringing India fully into the digital world.\nSilicon Valley has been eager to assist. India is the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, and use of the Internet and smartphones isgrowing rapidly, providing new markets for American companies.\nIn addition, tens of thousands of Silicon Valley technology workers are of Indian descent and eager to give something back to their country of origin.\nThe prime minister, an avid user of Twitter and Facebook, sees technology as a way to lift India out of poverty.\n\u201cIn this digital age, we have an opportunity totransform the livesof people in ways that were hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago,\u201d Mr. Modi said in San Jose on Saturday in a dinnertime speech to about 500 technology leaders, including the chief executives ofMicrosoft,Google, Adobe and Uber.\nNaren Gupta, a founder of the Silicon Valley investment firm Nexus Venture Partners, who helped organize Mr. Modi\u2019s visit, said the prime minister wants tech companies to help him bring about that transformation.\n\u201cInnovation is a state of mind, and he is saying, help him bring that state of mind to India,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cBig changes are pretty much impossible to make. What you need to do in a democracy is take a thousand little steps.\u201d\nMr. Modi\u2019s message of partnership with American technology companies has been carefully choreographed to appeal to his constituents back in India, a country that is rapidly discovering the Internet and the start-up culture. The prime minister\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party has encountered setbacks in its legislative agenda and will soon face state elections.\nA group of academicsraised concernsabout the free speech andprivacy policiesof Mr. Modi\u2019s government in an open letter before his visit. Outside Facebook headquarters, Sikh separatists also protested his visit.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Modi stopped by Tesla Motors, theelectric-carmaker, and held private meetings with three of the technology world\u2019s most powerful executives:Timothy D. CookofApple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Satya Nadella of Microsoft.\nAt the subsequent dinner, the tight connections between American companies and the Indian government were apparent.\nMr. Modi announced that Google had agreed to provide free public Wi-Fi in hundreds of Indian railroad stations, which are major transit and social hubs for their communities.\nRecalling his childhood in India, Mr. Nadella pledged that Microsoft would help India bring wireless Internet to its 500,000 villages, but offered no details. \u201cWhat opportunities can we unlock, what changes can we spark?\u201d he said.\nQualcomm, a chip maker with thousands of employees in India, promised $150 million to finance Indian start-ups.\nAfter the Facebook visit on Sunday, Mr. Modi planned tovisit Googleand Stanford University, and to drop by a meeting of Indian tech entrepreneurs. In the evening, he was scheduled to address a sold-out crowd of about 18,000 people, mostly Indo-Americans, at an arena in San Jose."

        "title": "\u2018Steve Jobs\u2019 Receives Warm Reception at Telluride Film Festival",
        "fulltext": "TELLURIDE, Colo. \u2014 Before the world premiere of his new film on Saturday night, Danny Boyle told a crowd of 650 here at theTelluride Film Festivalnot to\n                                        expect a representational biopic. Rather, he said, his \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is a meant to be a direct signal from inside the Apple co-founder\u2019s\n                                        mind, \u201cwith all of its wonders and all of its horrors.\u201d\nIn other words, reputation varnishing this is not.\nAs portrayed by Michael Fassbender, acting from a script written by Aaron Sorkin, Mr. Jobs is part genius and part monster, a man who seems to go out of his way to be cruel but who has a genius understanding of technology\n                                        and marketing. Mr. Jobs\u2019s initial refusal to acknowledge that he fathered a daughter is a primary story line.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to be polite,\u201d he snaps to a colleague at one point.\n\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d co-stars Kate Winslet as an Apple executive who functions as his taskmaster and gatekeeper; Seth Rogen plays the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The film ends in 1998, five years before Mr.\n                                        Jobs was diagnosed with cancer and takes place almost entirely backstage at theaters where products are about to be unveiled.\n\nThe assembled festival pass holders responded warmly to the two-hour film. At one point about half way through the screening, after an argument scene with loads of tongue-twisting dialogue, an attendee shouted \u201cSorkin!\u201d\nMr. Boyle, who was interviewed on stage before the screening, called \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d the most challenging film he has ever directed. \u201cI tend to be a very visceral director and entertain through that\n                                        with fast cutting, and what you\u2019re going to see tonight is very, very different,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge is try to create the space for the actors to act out these extraordinary scenes.\u201d\nMr. Sorkin\u2019s script ran roughly 200 pages, roughly double the standard length for a film, Mr. Boyle said.\n\u201cWe were determined to shoot it in San Francisco because we thought by some osmosis you\u2019ll pick up something from the place in the world where this new digital age was born,\u201d he added. He said \u201cfinance\n                                        people\u201d suggested filming in Hungary to shave $5 million from the budget. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is set for release by Universal Pictures on Oct. 9 after another premiere at theNew York Film Festival.\nA version of this article appears in print on 09/07/2015, on pageC3of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: \u2018Steve Jobs\u2019 in Telluride."

        "title": "IPhone 6s\u2019s Hands-Free Siri Is an Omen of the Future",
        "fulltext": "The headline feature inApple\u2019s latest smartphones, theiPhone6s and 6s Plus, is something called 3D Touch, which lets youactivate shortcutson the phone by pressing a bit harder on the screen. For now, though, I found a less novel, but far handier feature in the new iPhone \u2014 one that has long been the butt of jokes but is now becoming a necessary part of modern computing.\nYou may have heard of it: It\u2019s called Siri, and together with voice-control initiatives from Google, Amazon, Microsoft and several start-ups, it is poised to change the way we think of computers.\nAs David Piercewrote recently in Wired, voice recognition and artificial intelligence are getting so good so quickly that it isn\u2019t really a stretch to imagine that talking to computers will soon become one of the signature ways we interact with them. The new Siri is paving the way to what you might call \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores.\nPicture the \u201cStar Trek\u201d computer, but instead of powering a starship, it\u2019s turning off the basement lights, finding you a good movie on Netflix and, after listening in on a fight between you and your spouse, reminding you to buy flowers the next day. It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful \u2014 and it\u2019s coming faster than you think.\nThere is one key improvement to Siri in the iPhone 6s that suggests these grand possibilities. Rather than having to reach for your phone, you can now activate Siri by yelling at it from a few feet away. \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d you bellow, and the robotic assistant springs to life. This is not groundbreaking; hands-free voice control has been around in competing smartphones at least since Motorola introduced it in 2013, and several phone makers have adopted it since. Hands-free Siri is also available on older iPhoneswhen the phone is plugged into its charger, because constantly listening for \u201cHey, Siri\u201d consumes battery power. (The iPhone 6s, however, reduces the drain on the battery through hardware changes.)\nBut \u201cHey, Siri\u201d is not the only improvement. IniOS 9, Apple\u2019s new mobile operating system, Siri also has more powers to connect to deeper parts of your phone. It can control devices compatible with Apple\u2019s home-automation system, called HomeKit \u2014 you can tell it to turn down the lights, for example. Siri also controls Apple Music, the company\u2019s new streaming service. In the car, say, \u201cHey, Siri, play Dylan,\u201d and up comes \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the ubiquity of voice-control devices. Besides the phone, Apple has put Siri in its watch and its coming Apple TV set-top box. Amazon has it on the Echo, a voice-controlled computer that is constantly listening and ready to help you out, and also in its TV streaming devices. Google and Microsoft also have embedded voice in phones, computers and TV devices.\ntranscript\nna\nA host of start-ups are entering the game, too. One, calledSoundHound, offers a taste of the possibilities of talking to machines: Rather than going through several sites to make a hotel reservation, you can ask, \u201cFind me a three- or four-star hotel in New York next Friday for less than $300,\u201d and off it goes.\nThe ubiquity of voice-controlled assistants changes the way we interact with them. When Siri and other voice systems were new, they seemed gimmicky. Nobody quite knew what to do with them, and interactions veered toward the awkward. But the more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel \u2014 and that means the more you\u2019ll use them, feeding the cycle.\nI\u2019ve felt this happen most impressively with Amazon\u2019s Echo, a machine that one addresses with the keyword \u201cAlexa,\u201d and which I keep in my kitchen, the place I most often need a hands-free device. In my early days with the Echo, I didn\u2019t quite know what to use it for, and when it got something wrong,I tended to penalize the device for its shortcomings.\nBut the more I stuck with the Echo, the better I understood its capabilities. Now I consult the Echo several times a day for the weather, to set timers, to do quick kitchen math and to play music or audiobooks. It\u2019s become one of the most useful gadgets I own. (And the voice-recognition hardware in the Echo is more powerful than that of the iPhone \u2014 Alexa can hear me from far across the room, while with the iPhone 6s, \u201cHey, Siri\u201d stopped working beyond about five feet.)\nThe coming pervasiveness of voice-controlled machines will not occur without some social anxiety. There will be conventions to work out \u2014 is it O.K. to call out \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d on a bus? Probably not soon, but in time, that may happen; you\u2019ll cringe, and then it could become normal. (The new iPhone tries to learn your voice to prevent other people from activating your device.)\nThere will be questions of privacy, too. To start up when they hear certain keywords, systems like \u201cHey, Siri\u201d have to constantly listen to their surroundings. Apple says Siri is watching for a pattern, not recording or storing any data.\nBut you can imagine that actually analyzing all of your speech can\u2019t be far off, because it would make voice assistants more useful. In fact, for years now, Google\u2019s top search engineers have been describing the \u201cStar Trek\u201d computer as their vision of the future of search.\n\u201cThe \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer is not just a metaphor that we use to explain to others what we\u2019re building,\u201d Amit Singhal, the head of Google\u2019s search team,once told me. \u201cIt is the ideal that we\u2019re aiming to build \u2014 the ideal version done realistically.\u201d\nThat fictional computer not only responds to commands, but is also passively listening, analyzing and predicting what you want based on what it\u2019s hearing. It\u2019s easy to see how such machines would become useful. After all, why should I have to ask my computer to do something \u2014 if it\u2019s listening, shouldn\u2019t it just notice that I told my wife we\u2019re out of bread and add it to the grocery list? If I tell my 5-year-old that he has three minutes to brush his teeth or else, shouldn\u2019t the computer set a timer and remind the distracted child that he might end up going to bed without a story?\nIndeed, a version of this voice-enabled disciplinarian made an appearance last season on \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d I found it dystopian, sure, but also kind of wonderful. Parenting is a slog; why wouldn\u2019t I want a computer to occasionally step in and have my back?\nThat\u2019s how it begins, of course. Then, over time, as we allow these assistants to listen in to more of our lives, they\u2019ll start to use the data in unforeseen ways \u2014 to be more helpful, but also to get to know you better to better make a profit from your relationship.\nThese are big worries. You don\u2019t have to really think about them with the new iPhone, which isn\u2019t doing anything nefarious with its audio assistant. But still, as you sing out \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d \u201cHey, Cortana\u201d or \u201cAlexa,\u201d keep in mind that you\u2019re ushering in a brand-new era in our interactions with machines.\nFor years, we\u2019ve had to go to our computers to get things done. Now the computers are all around us, in the air. They\u2019re listening. They\u2019re helping. They\u2019re inescapable."

        "fulltext": "Apple is continuing itsefforts to create a car, though some of the big questions around the project remain undecided.\nThe company is still working out whether it will make a self-driving car, anelectric vehicleor a combination of the two, according to a person with knowledge of the product, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Apple is known for its intense secretiveness. It is not unusual for Apple to work on several prototypes of a product at the same time, as it did with the iPhone and the iPad.\nOther details of the car project are falling into place. Apple is committing hundreds of people to the effort, and meeting with officials of the California Department of Motor Vehicles and of a testing ground for self-driving cars, said the person with knowledge of the work.The Wall Street JournalandThe Guardianpreviously reported on those developments. Apple is aiming to introduce some sort of car product around 2020, several people with knowledge of the project said.\nApple declined to comment for this article.\nSince reports that Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, was working on a car surfaced in February, the auto and tech industries have closely watched any progress, because Apple could transform the car industry the same way it did the mobile phone industry. Vehicles, which are essentially turning into moving computers, could be a huge new platform for technology companies.GoogleandUberare both working on self-driving vehicles.\nAt the FrankfurtInternational Motor Showthis month,carmakers were obsessedwith what the nonauto companies like Apple and Google might be developing. Detroit has come a long way since the financial crisis, and advanced sensor-based safety features are available on many models of cars from Ford and General Motors. But none of them have the software expertise of a company like Apple, and they do not want to be stuck manufacturing the bodies of the vehicles while another company controls the more lucrative software.\n\u201cWe do not plan to become the Foxconn of Apple,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, told reporters at the auto show in Frankfurt.\nSergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, hassought a relationship with Apple. This year, he met with Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, during a three-day trip to California. In an interview this spring, he called companies like Apple and Google \u201cdisrupters.\u201d After a speech this spring, he said of the technologies they were inventing: \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. They\u2019re coming.\u201d\nMr. Cook has sidestepped questions about a car.\nApple has about 600 employees working on the undertaking, called Project Titan, according to a person with knowledge of the project. Apple is deploying more internal resources to Titan, pulling people from other projects, like the Apple Watch, to work on it, said two people with knowledge of the plans.\nApple executives recently met with the California D.M.V., which in 2012 was tasked with promulgating self-driving car regulations. In a statement, the department said the \u201cD.M.V. often meets with various companies regarding D.M.V. operations. The Apple meeting was to review D.M.V.\u2019s autonomous vehicle regulations.\u201d\nApple engineers have also met with officials from GoMentum Station in Concord, Calif., which is known as a testing ground for self-driving cars, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.The Guardianearlier obtained documents about the meeting."
