        "title": "Forced to Change: Tech Giants Bow to Global Onslaught of Rules",
        "fulltext": "By Thursday, Google will have changed how it displays certain search results. Microsoft will no longer have Windows customers use its Bing internet search tool by default. And Apple will give iPhone and iPad users access to rival app stores and payment systems for the first time.\nThe tech giants have been preparing ahead of a Wednesday deadline to comply with a new European Union law intended to increase competition in the digital economy. The law, calledthe Digital Markets Act, requires the biggest tech companies to overhaul how some of their products work so smaller rivals can gain more access to their users.\nThose changes are some of the most visible shifts that Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta and others are making in response to a wave of new regulations and laws around the world. In the United States, some of the tech behemoths have said they will abandon practices that are the subject of federal antitrust investigations. Apple, for one, ismaking it easier for Android usersto interact with its iMessage product, a topic that the Justice Department has been investigating.\n\u201cThis is a turning point,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in Brussels, who spent much of the past decade battling with tech giants. \u201cSelf-regulation is over.\u201d\nFor decades, Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta barreled forward with few rules and limits. As their power, riches and reach grew, a groundswell of regulatory activity, lawmaking and legal cases sprang up against them in Europe, the United States, China, India, Canada, South Korea and Australia. Now thatglobal tipping point for reining in the largest tech companieshas finally tipped.\nThe companies have been forced to alter the everyday technology they offer, including devices and features of their social media services, which have been especially noticeable to users in Europe. The firms are also making consequential shifts that are less visible, to their business models, deal making and data-sharing practices, for example.\nThe degree of change is evident at Apple. The Silicon Valley company once offered its App Store as a unified marketplace around the world, but it now has different rules for App Store developers inSouth Korea, the European Union and the United States because of new laws and court rulings. The company dropped the proprietary design of an iPhone charger because ofanother E.U. law, meaning future iPhones will have a charger that works with non-Apple devices.\nOn Monday, Apple wasfined 1.8 billion euros, or $1.95 billion, by E.U. regulators for thwarting competition among music streaming rivals.\nThe modifications mean that people\u2019s technology experiences will increasingly differ based on where they live. In Europe, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat users under the age of 18 no longer see ads based on their personal data, the result of a 2022 law calledthe Digital Services Act. Elsewhere in the world, young people still see such ads on those platforms.\nThe tech industry is essentially maturing and becoming more like banking, automobiles and health care, with companies tailoring their products and services to local laws and regulations, said Greg Taylor, an Oxford University professor focused on competition in technology markets.\n\u201cThis represents a sea change in how we regulate the tech sector,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the E.U. is the first out of the gate, other jurisdictions around the world are trying to do similar things.\u201d\nYet even as the big tech firms make changes, smaller rivals like Spotify say much more government action is needed worldwide to seriously address their vast power. Many of the firms continue to report record profits and sales. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, havehelped push the stock marketto new highs. Their combined market value has more than doubled since the end of 2019 to nearly $10.6 trillion.\nEven policymakers behind some of the new rules said it was unrealistic to assume the new laws and regulations would immediately dislodge dominant companies like Google or Apple. Andreas Schwab, a member of the European Parliament who helped write the Digital Markets Act, said the hope was that over time, the rules, if strongly enforced, would provide space for new entrants to emerge and grow.\n\u201cThe tipping point will be reached when we have more competition and not just a change of some products,\u201d said Mr. Schwab, who traveled to Brazil, Japan, South Korea and Singapore over the past year to discuss the European Union\u2019s new tech rules. \u201cMaybe in one year we say they were important, or maybe in one year we say it\u2019s a joke because the changes didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft declined interview requests.\nFew laws have forced the tech firms to make as many adjustments as the Digital Markets Act. The E.U. law was passed in 2022 to bar the biggest tech companies from using their interlocking services and deep pockets to box in users and squash rivals. The law affects everything from online advertising to messaging apps to app payment methods. Violators could face penalties of up to 20 percent of their global revenue.\nFor more than a year, tech companies have negotiated with E.U. regulators in Brussels about changes to their products, services and businesses to come into compliance.\nIn January, Google said it would reduce the visibility of its own services in search results and link more to rivals on queries for things like flights and restaurants. The company also pledged to let European users limit personal data from being shared across services like search, YouTube and Chrome \u2014 a shift long sought by privacy groups.\nThat month, Apple said it that in addition to the change allowing rival app stores and payment services, customers in Europe with a new iPhone would see a screen to select a default browser instead of the iPhone\u2019s automatically defaulting to Apple\u2019s browser, Safari.\nAround the same time, the Digital Services Act, intended to combat illicit content online, has also begun having an effect. European users have gained new tools to report toxic content. Online platforms like Google and Meta can no longer allow advertisers to target users based on their ethnicity, political views and sexual orientation. TikTok and Instagram users can also choose to see posts without any recommended content chosen by an algorithm based on their personal data.\nEurope\u2019s aggressive approach is increasingly being emulated abroad. In Australia, a 2021 law required companies like Alphabet and Metato pay the country\u2019s media outletsfor distributing news articles on its sites, leading to an estimated $100 million in deals. On Thursday, Meta said it would not renew the deals with Australian media companies, potentially leading to further government action.\nIn Indonesia,TikTok closed its online shopping servicelast year after the country banned e-commerce transactions on social media platforms. Nepal banned TikTok altogether last year. Indiabanned the appin 2020.\nIn the United States, momentum is also building. The Federal Trade Commissionsued Meta in 2020, arguing the company snuffed out nascent competition by buying young rivals. It sued Amazon last year over claims the company had squeezed small merchants on its site.\nThe Justice Department has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Google and could file oneagainst Appleas soon as the first half of this year. The cases could result in orders for the companies to change their practices, or even a partial breakup of their businesses.\nSome of the companies are making adjustments that get ahead of U.S. regulators. In June, Amazon pledged to allow merchants to sell via its Prime subscription program without using its own logistics network, announcing the change before the government complained that such practices were anticompetitive. Google is allowing more mobile payment options to app developers, instead of just its own, as part of a proposed deal with state attorneys general.\nLegal fights loom. TheSupreme Court heard argumentslast month over whether Texas and Florida could legally bar sites like Facebook and TikTok from taking down certain political content. If the states prevail, it will upend how online platforms can set the terms of engaging on their sites without U.S. government interference.\nNu Wexler, a former employee in the Washington offices of Google, Meta and Twitter, which has been renamed X, said the tech firms were \u201cmaking more concessions\u201d and \u201care being more pragmatic.\u201d\nThey just \u201caren\u2019t as invincible as they were five years ago,\u201d he said.\nDaisuke Wakabayashicontributed reporting from Seoul."

        "title": "How the Fight Against Apple Could Redefine Antitrust Law",
        "fulltext": "With itsantitrust lawsuit against Apple, the Biden administration has joined agrowing list of regulatorstaking on the iPhone giant. But the Justice Department is taking a more ambitious approach than the others by aiming at the company\u2019s tight control of the iPhone ecosystem, which officials say hurts consumers and developers while producing giant profits.\nIf successful, the case could upend a business model that has made Apple one of the most profitable companies in history \u2014 but victory would require courts to accept a redefinition of decades-old antitrust law.\nProsecutors zeroed in on Apple\u2019s efforts to lock-in consumers.The Justice Department argues that the company unlawfully restricted competition by blocking key iPhone features to prevent consumers from switching devices.\nApple is profiting \u201cnot by making its own products better, but by making other products worse,\u201dAttorney General Merrick Garland said on Thursday.\nThe lawsuit identified five areas:smart watches, digital wallets, cloud-based gaming, messaging apps \u2014 yes, thegreen-bubble debateis key here \u2014 and so-called \u201csuper apps\u201d that bundle different programs. (It also suggests that Apple\u2019s behavior affects an even wider array of products,including cars.)\nApple said the approach amounted to excessive interference in business.\u201cIf successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding that it would let the government have a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\nRegulators globally are already changing how Apple operates.The European Union\u2019s sweepingDigital Markets Actaims to open up iOS and theApp Store, and the bloc has alsofined the company $2 billionfor hampering music-streaming competitors.\nSouth Korea and the Netherlands have adopted legislation to require app store owners toallow alternative payment systems. (Skeptics say Apple is seeking toundermine those efforts.)\nThe new case pushes the boundaries of traditional antitrust policy.That\u2019s in keeping with the stated aim of regulators like Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, andLina Khan, the head of the F.T.C.\n\u201cWe want to help real people by making sure that our antitrust laws work for workers, work for consumers, work for entrepreneurs and work to protect our democratic values,\u201dKanter told The Timesin January, declining to comment on specific cases.\nBut some experts think this lawsuit is a stretch.Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told DealBook that antitrust policy traditionally hasn\u2019t focused on issues like porting consumer data to different platforms.\nHe added that while prosecutors were seeking to help some consumers \u2014 those who favor switching devices \u2014 the lawsuit could end up hurting others. Users of iOS \u201cderive a lot of value from their closed ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cApple users like the closed ecosystem and the benefits that confers on them.\u201d\nReddit soars in its first day of trading.Shares in the social media companyjumped 48 percenton Thursday, putting its valuation at $9.5 billion \u2014 just shy of the $10 billion it attained in a fund-raising round three years ago. That warm reception could persuade other companies to go public, reopening an I.P.O. market that has been largely frozen for several months.\nShareholders are set to vote on taking Donald Trump\u2019s social media company public.Investors in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the shell company that has agreed to give Truth Social its stock market listing, are expected to approve the transaction, meaning that Trump\u2019s platform could begin trading next week. That would be good news for Trump, who could thenborrow against his $3 billion stakein the company to raise money for legal bills.\nBlackRock pushes back against Texas.The Wall Street giant said it hadmade more than $250 millionfor the state\u2019s Permanent School Fund, after the fund withdrew $8.5 billion, citing a 2021 law barring it from working with investment managers seeking to divest energy stocks. It\u2019s the latest clash between conservative states and financial firms over the investing approach known as E.S.G.\nAs the showdown between Disney and the activist investor Nelson Peltz nears \u2014 shareholders are set to vote on board nominees at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 3 \u2014 prominent supporters are emerging on both sides.\nDealBook is the first report on a new one:Michael Eisner, who was the company\u2019s C.E.O. for more than two decades.\nEisner gave DealBook an exclusive statement:\nIn 1983, Disneywas under attackby corporate raiders trying to take over the company. That would have ended the Disney Company as we know it, for the studio, theme parks, and hotels were suggested to be sold off. The board turned to me and Frank Wells, and a different story was written, one that was continued by Bob Iger and his executive team.\nToday, a similar situation exists, so let\u2019s remember the lessons from 40 years ago. Bringing in someone who doesn\u2019t have experience in the company or the industry to disrupt Bob and his eventual successor is playing not only with fire but earthquakes and hurricanes as well. The company is now in excellent hands and Disney shareholders should vote for the Disney slate.\nOthers have weighed in, following the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis and Disney\u2019s top individual shareholder, the filmmaker George Lucas (both backed Disney and its current chief, Bob Iger):\nLaurene Powell Jobs,a prominent Disney shareholder, who backed Iger: \u201cHe is a once-in-a-generation leader with an ambitious vision for the future, and we as shareholders are fortunate to have him guiding this cherished company at such a crucial moment in its history.\u201d\nInstitutional Shareholder Services,the other influential proxy adviser, which recommended that shareholders vote Peltz onto the board. Peltz, as a major shareholder, \u201ccould be additive to the succession process, providing assurance to other investors that the board is properly engaged this time around. He could also help evaluate future capital allocation decisions.\u201d\nI.S.S. advised withholding votes for an incumbent board member, Maria Elena Lagomasino, citing \u201cmulti-year concerns\u201d about her role on the compensation committee. (Interestingly, the firm didn\u2019t recommend that shareholders vote to add Jay Rasulo, the former Disney C.F.O. whom Peltz has also nominated as a director candidate.)\nThe regional banking crisis spurred a wave of consolidation just over a year ago. Now, regulators want to increase the scrutiny of big bank acquisitions \u2014 which could worsen the odds for deals like Capital One\u2019s $35 billion bid for Discover Financial.\nThe F.D.I.C. is proposing the first overhaul of takeover rules since the 2008 financial crisis.Under thenew framework, which would apply to deals that create a bank with more than $100 billion in assets, regulators would need to consider the transaction\u2019s effects on public interest grounds, including financial stability, communities and competition.\nThat would represent a big shift.Bank merger reviews traditionally focused on deposits and branches. ButJonathan Kanter, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, said on Thursday that lenders now offer so many different services that a more expansive approach was needed to take into account how a deal would actually affect competition. (TheOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency is also pushing for rules to prevent big banks from buying rivals.)\nThe Discover deal was already poised for tight scrutiny.Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,told DealBookthat the credit card market had been consolidating for years, and that \u201cany proposed transaction is going to get a very close look.\u201d\nProgressive advocacy groups have alsopushed for close examinationof the transaction.\nA broader mandate could better capture the deal\u2019s competitive dynamics,Aaron Klein at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official, told DealBook. \u201cIt\u2019s the merger of a credit card bank with a payment rail owner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a merger driven by the economics of payments, not the economics of banking.\u201d\n\u2014 Ellis Webster, the premier of Anguilla, on the money the British territory hasmade from the boom in artificial intelligence. The tiny Caribbean island collects a fee from every registration for internet addresses that end in \u201c.ai,\u201d earning about $32 million last year.\nThe U.S. and China are in a cutthroat technological competition that some have likened to a new cold war, and a crucial front is the race to dominate in artificial intelligence.\nAmerican companies lead in breakthroughs that power products like ChatGPT andinvestment, while China produces far more research and is ahead in another crucial aspect:talent.\nChina accounts for almost half of the world\u2019s top A.I. researchers, according to astudyfrom the Marco Polo think tank, part of the Paulson Institute. By contrast, U.S. undergraduate institutions produce about 18 percent.\nThat\u2019s a big jump: Three years ago, China producedless than a thirdof the top A.I. researchers. But it has added more than 2,000 undergraduate A.I. programs since 2018, with a focus on applying the tech to industry and manufacturing.\nThe countries\u2019 tech sectors remain linked despite a push to \u201cdecouple\u201d the economies.Chinese companies aretapping into American open-source A.I. systemsto build their own models.

        "title": "Apple Keeps Losing Patent Cases. Its Solution: Rewrite the Rules.",
        "fulltext": "Over the past decade, some of Apple\u2019s biggest regulatory headaches have come from a little-known federal agency called the U.S. International Trade Commission. The agency\u2019s patent judges have found Apple guilty of appropriating innovations in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches. And recently, they forcedApple to remove a health feature from Apple Watches.\nNow the tech giant is pushing back. While it defends itself from patent complaints before the I.T.C., Apple has begun lobbying lawmakers to help rewrite the agency\u2019s rules.\nThe company has been campaigning across Washington for legislation that would make some patent owners ineligible to bring complaints before the I.T.C. It has sought to influence the language of committee reports that could affect how the agency levels punishments. And it has added to its lobbying might by enlisting one of the agency\u2019s former commissioners.\nThe lobbying effort comes as Apple is enmeshed in a multiyear legal battle with two U.S. medical device makers over technology in the Apple Watch. The companies,AliveCorandMasimo, filed complaints in the I.T.C. against Apple in 2021 for appropriating innovations they had developed to measure the heart\u2019s electrical activity and people\u2019s blood oxygen levels.\nAfter losing both cases, Applethis year removed the technology to measure blood oxygenin its watches, which infringed on Masimo\u2019s patent. It is appealing the I.T.C.\u2019s decision. A similar punishment is on hold as court proceedings continue related to theI.T.C.\u2019s finding that Apple infringed on AliveCor\u2019s innovationswith the Apple Watch\u2019s electrocardiogram feature.\nApple is trying to blunt the agency\u2019s signature power. Unlike traditional patent courts, where juries or judges typically issue fines, the I.T.C.\u2019s judges can discipline a company that violates a patent by banning imports of the infringing product.\nBecause Apple makes all its signature devices overseas, a block on the import of its devices would be perilous to the company. To avoid that penalty in the future, the company says, it wants the agency to put the public interest of a product ahead of a ban. The company is betting that the court would then give more credence to Apple\u2019s argument that Americans would be harmed by an import ban because they would lose access to the communication and health features in iPhones and Apple Watches.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the existing law requires that the I.T.C. consider how the public interest could be affected before ordering an import ban. But it saidpublic data showedthat the agency had made public-interest evaluations in only one-fifth of cases it had heard since 2010. As a result,its lobbyists have been talkingwith White House and congressional leaders about the I.T.C., as well as other issues such as privacy and domestic manufacturing.\nAdam Mossoff, a patent law expert and a professor at George Mason University, said Apple was misinterpreting the law, which requires the I.T.C. to block a product if it finds that it infringes on a patent. An import ban is supposed to be overruled only if there\u2019s a proven threat to health or safety, he said. Blocking sales of an Apple device wouldn\u2019t qualify as harmful.\n\u201cThe problem with their lobbying is that they\u2019re trying to neuter a well-functioning court by closing its doors to Americans who have had their rights infringed,\u201d he said.\nWhen Congress set up what became the I.T.C. in 1916, it wanted to protect American innovation by allowing the U.S. government to ban the import of products with stolen technology. But as manufacturing moved overseas, the federal agency\u2019s court system became a forum for disputes between U.S. companies.\nThe I.T.C.\u2019s judges, who are appointed by the commission, hold hearings with different standards for patent disputes than those that govern District Court cases. The cases are fast and compressed and can culminate with the judge\u2019s punishing a patent abuser by blocking its products.\nBefore a ban is put into effect, a company that\u2019s found guilty can appeal to the White House for a reprieve. But it\u2019s rare for an administration, which oversees the agency, to go against a judge\u2019s recommendation.\nApple has become the pre-eminent example of how the I.T.C. can be used. Because the company manufactures almost all its products overseas, the judges who have found it guilty of infringing on patents in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches say it should be punished by blocking the import of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.\nApple has largely escaped the import bans. In 2013, theObama administration vetoedthe I.T.C.\u2019s plan to block iPhone imports after the agency determined that Apple hadinfringed on one of Samsung\u2019s smartphone patents. In 2019,Apple agreed to pay Qualcomm a royaltyfor some wireless technology patents, heading off an I.T.C. ruling that could have blocked iPhone sales. And after losing the Masimo case, Apple agreed to remove the infringing health feature to dodge an Apple Watch ban.\nFor years, Apple avoided the kind of lobbying that was customary for a large corporation. It kept a small office in Washington staffed by just a few people and employed only one lobbying firm, two people familiar with the company\u2019s practices said. But as regulatory challenges to its business have risen, its policy team has swelled to include dozens of people and 11 lobbying firms.\nIn the face of the patent complaints from AliveCor and Masimo, Apple\u2019s team in Washington gave priority to lobbying to change the I.T.C. In 2022, it began working with the ITC Modernization Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of companies that includes Samsung, Intel, Dell, Google, Verizon and Comcast. The group worked with members of Congress as it wrote the Advancing America\u2019s Interest Act in 2019 andsupported its reintroduction in 2023.\nThe bill\u2019s backers \u2014 Representatives David Schweikert, a Republican from Arizona, and Donald S. Beyer Jr., a Democrat from Virginia \u2014 have promoted it as a way to curb abuse of the I.T.C. by patent trolls. It would prohibit patent holders from suing unless they manufactured a product that used the patented technology or had licensed the technology to someone else already.\nAliveCor and Masimo are medical companies that have focused on selling products to health care providers and consumers more than licensing innovations to consumer technology companies like Apple.\nLast year, Apple\u2019s lobbyists filed three reports disclosing that it had campaigned on behalf of the bill, according to Open Secrets, a campaign finance research nonprofit. It also added to its lobbying ranks byhiring Deanna Tanner Okun, a formerI.T.C. chairwho works for thelaw firm Polsinelli.(The hiring was previously reported byPolitico.)\nThe lobbying campaign coincided with an effort to argue in Washington that an I.T.C. ban on Apple Watch imports would deprive people of a device that was crucial to their health, two people familiar with the lobbying said.\nIn addition to lobbying directly on legislation, Apple worked with a member of Congress to put language on Page 97 of a committee report for the 2024 Appropriations Bill, said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado. The language would require the I.T.C. to review how it determined the value to the public of a product before suggesting a ban and to report to Congress on that process.\n\u201cTo me, this went around the legitimate process,\u201d said Mr. Buck, who isleaving Congress this month. He told Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky who is on the Rules Committee, that he had 10 votes and would block the bill unless the language was removed. Mr. Massie\u2019s office confirmed that the language had been removed at Mr. Buck\u2019s request but declined to comment further.\nAn Apple spokeswoman disagreed with Mr. Buck\u2019s claims that its lobbying circumvented the legitimate legislative process. She said its public federal lobbying reports detailed how it worked on issues important for its products and customers.\nThe spokeswoman also pointed to the Senate\u2019s passage of a committee report with a sentence expressing its support of the I.T.C.\u2019s doing thorough analysis of the public health implications of a product ban before issuing one, which is what Apple wants in the future."

Keep out!\u201d as well as leading prompts like, \u201cThis month I was really happy when \u2026\u201d and \u201cThe nicest person in my class is \u2026.\u201d Around then, a friend of my parents gave me another journal, with the title \u201cMy Private World.\u201d That cover has a pensive, apron-wearing, barefoot girl seated under a sinewy tree, nestled alongside a dog, two cats and a book, with rolling mountains in the distance. I\u2019ve never felt a connection to the girl, blissfully lost in thought in her bucolic setting. But the journal\u2019s title? That spoke to me. It still does.\nI\u2019ve kept a journal ever since. I have an oversize Tupperware bin in my basement containing dozens of musty diaries. Each is filled with anecdotes from my life, scrawled in sloppy handwriting, riddled with misspellings. They\u2019re filled with rants about friends, family and feelings. They contain my shames and terrors, my crushes, my dreams (both literal and figurative), my worries and mundane accounts of more than 30 years of my life. Like a boy with a porn stash under his mattress, I\u2019ve always carefully tucked them away, embarrassed they exist.\nI hold on to these journals because when I feel discombobulated and lost, reading through who I was at 14 or 19 or 25 years old helps connect me to myself. Paging through the diaries now, I\u2019m startled to realize how far I\u2019ve come and also how little I\u2019ve changed. In Journal No. 1, I\u2019m a 9-year-old living in Ohio. I\u2019m 4 feet 5 inches tall, weigh 75 pounds and feel a kinship with Curious George. In Journal No. 11, I\u2019m 20, working for my college professor on an archaeological dig in Syria and flirting with a German man twice my age. Journal No. 19 leaves off in June 2009, when, unbeknown to me, life is about to pivot: In a month I\u2019ll become engaged, in six months I\u2019ll be married, and in a year I\u2019ll be pregnant with my first child.\nIt\u2019s not just their contents that are interesting time capsules. I am also drawn back to their covers. Teenage me decorated them with political stickers, funny headlines, inspiring fortune cookie fortunes. Young adult me used postcards from my travels and darkroom contact sheets. I collaged the covers in order to express myself to myself, lovingly crafting keepsakes for an audience of one. At some point I numbered each book with a black Sharpie, but even these \u201cpermanent\u201d markings are now wearing off.\nReturning to these covers makes me think about girlhood, secrets, memories and the passage of time. It\u2019s not lost on me that I work as a photographer, meaning I document people and events for posterity. I\u2019m paid to be a memory maker and keeper. I\u2019ve made a career trafficking in nostalgia.\nI recently photographed my diaries set against sentimental garments: delicate, pint-size floral dresses my mom saved from the 1980s and stretched-out extra-large T-shirts from the 1990s. By making these photographs, I entered a portal to my youth, simultaneously connecting with my angsty, decorative, teenage self and appreciating her from afar. They remind me of who I was, who I\u2019ve always been and, to some extent, who I still am. Whether or not it\u2019s healthy, on some level, holding on to the stuffof my youthmakes it more bearable to swallow the fact that time is always, incessantly, marching on.\nWhich brings me back to that iPhone update. I still don\u2019t fully understand Apple\u2019s new Journal app. If it weren\u2019t for the eerie fact that it mines phone usage to prompt reflection, I would be open to trying it. Regardless, I\u2019m curious what changes when journaling moves into the cloud. Paging through an old diary is an emotional, time-travel experience. If a teenager today uses the Journal app, what will her experience be decades from now? Assuming the technology exists to retrieve her writing, will revisiting an online journal have the same power to transport her back in time? What\u2019s her online equivalent of me holding the crispy, lined pages of my spiral-bound books from decades ago, touching the stickers, seeing my childhood handwriting and doodles in the margins?\nJosephine Sittenfeldis a photographer and filmmaker based in Providence, R.I.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "The Second Coming of the Microsoft Antitrust Battle?",
        "fulltext": "Impeding innovation. Reducing consumer choice. Extending dominance to other markets.\nThese are accusations that the Justice Department leveled against a technology giant it accused of running an illegal monopoly. But they aren\u2019t from this week\u2019santitrust lawsuit against Apple\u2014 they\u2019re from the case the departmentbrought against Microsoftin 1998.\nThe move against Apple is, along with the Justice Department\u2019s 2020 lawsuit against Google over search, perhaps the most ambitious tech antitrust battle since the Clinton administration\u2019seffort to open up Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system.\nAnd federal prosecutors areexplicitly connectingthe Apple lawsuit to that earlier fight. \u201cThey\u2019re really presenting this case as a successor to that: Microsoft 2.0,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\nBut the comparison isn\u2019t perfect. And it isn\u2019t clear whether the Justice Department will be able to achieve here what it claims to have done by suing Microsoft.\nThe Justice Department sees a direct connection between the two cases.\u201cMicrosoft\u201d appears 26 times in the Apple complaint. And prosecutors say Apple wouldn\u2019t have achieved its current towering success had it not been for the government\u2019s fight against Microsoft:\nThe iPod did not achieve widespread adoption until Apple developed a cross-platform version of the iPod and iTunes for Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, at the time the dominant operating system for personal computers. In the absence of the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft, it would have been more difficult for Apple to achieve this success and ultimately launch the iPhone.\nIn the 1998 case, the Justice Department argued that Microsoft illicitly sought to protect its Windows software from competition like the Netscape Navigator browser and Apple\u2019s QuickTime multimedia software.\nThis week, the agency said Apple was doing something similar, unlawfully restricting competition by denying rivals access to key iPhone features like its contactless payment chip. \u201cEach step in Apple\u2019s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,\u201d prosecutors wrote in Thursday\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe Justice Department sees another opportunity.Any hold Microsoft had on the emerging internet economy, the agency says, was broken, allowing companies like Google, Facebook and, yes, Apple, to prosper.\n\u201cToday, we stand here, once again, to protect competition and innovation for the next generation of technology,\u201dJonathan Kanter, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, said at Thursday\u2019s news conference.\nOthers say the Microsoft case\u2019s legacy is less clear.Hurwitz told DealBook that the reality was more complicated. Netscape failed in part because a botched upgrade turned off users, while Microsoft missed out on the dawn of internet 2.0 services because of bad strategic decisions.\n\u201cIn terms of actual industrial changes, I think the case yielded very little,\u201d Hurwitz said.\nThe comparison of the lawsuits falls short in several ways.For one, the Apple case is more ambitious, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. While both cases accused companies of using exclusivity to hamper rival technologies, the more recent case also demands that Apple ease operability across platforms, like ensuring that text messages from iPhone and Android devices work the same.\nThen there is the matter of defining market share. In 1998, over 80 percent of Intel-based personal computers used Windows software. By contrast, the iPhone had about64 percent of the U.S. smartphone marketat the end of last year, according to one estimate. (Globally, it\u2019s closer to 20 percent.) That said, federal prosecutors say Apple controls 70 percent of what they call the \u201cperformance\u201d smartphone market, which also includes high-end devices by Samsung and Google.\nAnd technology advances more quickly than it did in 1998. Smartphones could evolve in unexpected directions by the time the Apple case wraps up, potentially limiting the case\u2019s effect on innovation. \u201cTechnology is racing ahead like a Formula 1 automobile,\u201d Kovacic said, \u201cand antitrust is riding a bicycle trying to catch up.\u201d\nThe Microsoft fight does underscore the risks Apple faces.Regardless of what the earlier antitrust lawsuit accomplished, Microsoft was tied up in litigation for years, a costly distraction. Apple \u2014 which is already battling tighter regulations around the world \u2014 will have to devote some of its considerable resources to defending itself here.\n\u201cThat might open up opportunities for competitors,\u201d Hurwitz said. But he added, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the best way of facilitating competition in the market.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Mercedand Sarah Kessler\nMicrosoft poached an artificial intelligence pioneer.The Windows maker hired Mustafa Suleyman, a former Google executive, and most of the staff at Inflection AI, the start-up he co-founded. Suleyman will lead Microsoft\u2019s consumer A.I. business.\nThe Federal Reserve reiterated expectations to cut rates three times this year.The central bankheld interest rates steady at about 5.3 percent, with inflation not yet at the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said the economy was performing strongly, a sign that a recession may not be needed to bring down inflation.\nThe Biden administration issued one of its toughest climate rules yet.NewEnvironmental Protection Agency regulationswill require most cars sold in the United States to be electric or hybrid by 2032. The rules will gradually limit allowed tailpipe emissions, but will give carmakers more time to adapt than previously planned.\nDonald Trump\u2019s social media company merged with a shell company.Shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corporation voted to give the parent company of Truth Social its stock market listing. The transaction willadd $3 billion to Trump\u2019s wealth, potentially providing a new cash source to pay his mounting legal bills.\nReddit isthe first social media company to go publicsince Snap in 2017. It is also the first to do so in the meme stock era, making its own usersone of the biggest risksto its share price. Leading up to the initial public offering on Thursday, some wondered if Reddit users on forums like WallStreetBets, which helped power the rise of meme stocks, would try to manipulate the company\u2019s share price as they did for GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. But Ivan Cosovic, the managing director of the data company Breakout Point, told DealBook that chatter in the community had been \u201ca mix of short-term excitement driven by FOMO and long-term skepticism based on fundamentals.\u201d\nMentions of RDDT, Reddit\u2019s stock ticker symbol, on WallStreetBets peaked after its shares started trading Thursday afternoon, rising to be on a par with mentions of the chipmaker Nvidia, a favorite stock of retail investors. But they amounted to just 5 percent of the daily mentions of GameStop in January 2021, when the forum helped drive the retailer\u2019s stock upmore than 1,700 percent. And they petered out shortly after Reddit\u2019s shares listed.\nOpinions on the forum largely varied between two extremes. \u201cThis is a death sandwich, which exists purely as VC exit liquidity,\u201d read one popular post. Another said users bashing Reddit\u2019s stock in the forum \u201call use it for 12 hours a day and would be helpless without it.\u201d\nDan Wang is a leading observer of contemporary China. As a tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, and through his well-readnewsletter, Wang has charted the country\u2019s rise as a fast-growing high-tech economy and, more recently, its slowdown and rising tensions with the United States.\nWang is now a visiting scholar at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center and writing a book about the relationship between China and the U.S. The interview has been edited and condensed.\nHow does China see the latest TikTok fight?\nChinese state media and the government have made it clear that this is very unwelcome. China feels that ByteDance is a very, very successful company that is being bullied in America because it is Chinese. The Chinese people are affronted by the U.S. government declaring it a national security threat. And Beijing has passed laws that recommendation algorithms are subject to Chinese export controls, so the sense is that the government will not allow a sale to go through.\nIs the Chinese government using the case as a propaganda tool?\nState media is keeping its powder dry because there are still several steps before ByteDance might have to sell TikTok in the U.S. These include Senate passage, the White House\u2019s signature, as well as the legal challenges that ByteDance is sure to bring. Before this looks imminent, state media is not rallying citizens to object too much.\nWhat does it look like when state media mobilizes the public?\nIn 2022, Congress passed theUyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and a lot of Western companies made anodyne statements. Chinese state media seized on one company, H&M, which made a fairly typical statement that it did not source from Xinjiang or tolerate forced labor in its supply chains. China\u2019s Communist Youth Leaguereposted a statement on social mediasaying that you cannot both make money in China as well as criticize China. That incited a consumer boycott. H&M products disappeared from pretty much all e-commerce sites, and H&M stores disappeared from online maps. The company was essentially erased from the Chinese internet, and it was really difficult to buy its products or find its physical stores.\nHow could China retaliate toward U.S. companies?\nThe more important question is: Does Beijing decide that this act is worthy of retaliation? I spent all four years of President Trump\u2019s trade war living in China, and Beijing was highly forbearing toward U.S. companies.\nFirst, Beijing realizes that big U.S. companies are major employers in China, like Apple, through Foxconn, as well as Tesla. Second, Beijing realizes that American businesses are its last best friends left in Washington, and it would prefer that American companies continue to lobby Congress to maintain ties. It would also prefer that Elon Musk doesn\u2019t spend all day tweeting about how terrible China is.\nIs China playing a long game?\nBeijing might well treat this as a pretty substantial propaganda victory if the U.S. government forces a sale or actually bans TikTok. It would play into Beijing\u2019s hands to say that the U.S. has been talking about free speech for a long time but this illustrates that the U.S. is a hypocrite.\nHow is the fact that Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, is working on a bid to buy TikTok perceived?\nIf it is successful, it would be viewed as in bad taste \u2014 not just in China but pretty much everywhere \u2014 that an official whoordered a salethen ends up actually owning it. For Beijing, it would be the cherry on the cake in terms of its propaganda.\nRead a longer version of this interviewhere.\nThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you Monday.\nWe\u2019d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions todealbook@nytimes.com."

        "title": "U.S. Sues Apple, Accusing It of Maintaining an iPhone Monopoly",
        "fulltext": "The federal government\u2019s aggressive crackdown on Big Tech expanded on Thursday to include an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department against Apple, one of the world\u2019s best-known and most valuable companies.\nThe department joined 16 states and the District of Columbia to file a significant challenge to the reach and influence of Apple, arguing in an 88-page lawsuit that the company had violated antitrust laws with practices that were intended to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and less likely to switch to a competing device. The tech giant prevented other companies from offering applications that compete with Apple products like its digital wallet, which could diminish the value of the iPhone, and hurts consumers and smaller companies that compete with it, the government said.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit is seeking to put an end to those practices. The government even has the right to ask for a breakup of the Silicon Valley icon.\nThe antitrust suit is the federal government\u2019s most significant challenge to the reach and influence of the company.\nThe lawsuit caps years of regulatory scrutiny of Apple\u2019s wildly popular suite of devices and services, which have fueled its growth into a nearly $2.75 trillion public company that was for years the most valuable on the planet. It takes direct aim at the iPhone, Apple\u2019s most popular device and most powerful business, and attacks the way the company has turned the billions of smartphones it has sold since 2007 into the centerpiece of its empire.\nBy tightly controlling the user experience on iPhones and other devices, Apple has created what critics call an uneven playing field, where it grants its own products and services access to core features that it denies rivals.Over the years, it has limited finance companies\u2019 access to the phone\u2019s payment chip and Bluetooth trackers from tapping into its location-service feature. It\u2019s also easier for users to connect Apple products, like smartwatches and laptops, to the iPhone than to those made by other manufacturers.\n\u201cEach step in Apple\u2019s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,\u201d the government said in the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. It added that the company\u2019s practices resulted in \u201chigher prices and less innovation.\u201d\nApple says these practices make its iPhones more secure than other smartphones. But app developers and rival device makers say Apple uses its power to crush competition.\n\u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said. \u201cIf successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\nApple is the latest company the federal government has tried to rein in under a wave of antitrust pressure in recent years from both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, to which the Biden administration has appointed heads sharply focused on changing the laws to fit the modern era. Google, Meta and Amazon are all facing similar suits, and companies from Kroger to JetBlue Airways have faced greater scrutiny of potential acquisitions and expansion.\nThe lawsuit asks the court to stop Apple from engaging in current practices, including blocking cloud-streaming apps, undermining messaging across smartphone operating systems and preventing the creation of digital wallet alternatives.\nThe Justice Department has the right under the law to ask for structural changes to Apple\u2019s business \u2014 including a breakup, said an agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official declined to identify what additional action the agency could request in this case but any demands would be tied to how a court rules on the question of whether \u2014 and how \u2014 Apple broke the law.\nIt\u2019s unclear what implications the suit \u2014 which is likely to drag out years before any type of resolution \u2014 would have for consumers. Apple plans to file a motion to dismiss the case in the next 60 days. In its filing, the company plans to emphasize that competition laws permit it to adopt policies or designs that its competitors oppose, particularly when those designs would make using an iPhone a better experience.\nApple has effectively fought off other antitrust challenges. In a lawsuit over its App Store policies that Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, brought in 2020, Apple persuaded the judge that customers could easily switch between its iPhone operating system and Google\u2019s Android system. It has presented data showing that the reason few customers change phones is their loyalty to the iPhone.\nIt also hasdefended its business practices in the pastby highlighting how the App Store, which it opened in 2008, created millions of new businesses. Over the past decade, the number of paid app makers has increased by 374 percent to 5.2 million, which Apple has said is a testament to a flourishing marketplace.\nEvery modern-day tech giant has faced a major federal antitrust challenge. The Justice Department is also pursuing a case against Google\u2019s search business and another focused on Google\u2019s hold over advertising technology. The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit accusing Meta, which owns Facebook, of thwarting competition when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp and another accusing Amazon of abusing its power over online retail. The F.T.C. also tried unsuccessfully to block Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard, the video game publisher.\nThe lawsuits reflect a push by the regulators to apply greater scrutiny to the companies\u2019 roles as gatekeepers to commerce and communications. In 2019, under President Donald J. Trump, the agencies opened antitrust inquiries into Google, Meta, Amazon and Apple. The Biden administration has put even more energy behind the effort, appointing critics of the tech giants to lead both the F.T.C. and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.\nIn Europe, regulators recently punished Apple for preventing music streaming competitors from communicating with users about promotions and options to upgrade their subscriptions, levying a 1.8 billion-euro fine.App makers have also appealed to the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, to investigate claims that Apple is violating a new law requiring it to open iPhones to third-party app stores.\nInSouth Koreaand theNetherlands, the company is facing potential fines over the fees it charges app developers to use alternative payment processors. Other countries, including Britain, Australia and Japan, are considering rules that would undercut Apple\u2019s grip on the app economy.\nThe Justice Department, which began its investigation into Apple in 2019, chose to build a broader and more ambitious case than any other regulator has brought against the company. Rather than narrowly focus on the App Store, as European regulators have, it focused on Apple\u2019s entire ecosystem of products and services.\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday focuses on a group of practices that the government said Apple had used to shore up its dominance.\nThe company \u201cundermines\u201d the ability of iPhone users to message with owners of other types of smartphones, like those running the Android operating system, the government said. That divide \u2014 epitomized by the green bubbles that show an Android owner\u2019s messages \u2014 sent a signal that other smartphones were lower quality than the iPhone, according to the lawsuit.\nApple has similarly made it difficult for the iPhone to work with smartwatches other than its own Apple Watch, the government argued. Once an iPhone user owns an Apple Watch, it becomes far more costly for them to ditch the phone.\nThe government also said Apple had tried to maintain its monopoly by not allowing other companies to build their own digital wallets. Apple Wallet is the only app on the iPhone that can use the chip, known as the NFC, that allows a phone to tap-to-pay at checkout. Though Apple encourages banks and credit card companies to allow their products to work inside Apple Wallet, it blocks them from getting access to the chip and creating their own wallets as alternatives for customers.\nThe government said that Apple refuses to allow game streaming apps that could make the iPhone a less valuable piece of hardware or offer \u201csuper apps\u201d that let users perform a variety of activities from one application.\nThe government\u2019s complaint uses similar arguments to the claims it made against Microsoft decades ago, in a seminal lawsuit that argued the company was tying its web browser to the Windows operating system, said Colin Kass, an antitrust lawyer at Proskauer Rose. He added that the most compelling allegation \u2014 and the one that brings it closest to the Microsoft case \u2014 is that Apple could be contractually preventing rivals from developing apps that work with other app providers, as \u201csuper apps\u201d could.\nOther legal experts noted that companies are legally allowed to favor their own products and services, so the government will have to explain why that is a problem with Apple.\n\u201cThis case is about technology,\u201d Mr. Kass said. \u201cCan the antitrust laws force a company to redesign its product to make it more compatible with competitors\u2019 products?\u201d\nApple has defended itself against other antitrust challenges by arguing that its policies are critical to make its devices private and secure. In its defense against Epic Games, it argued that restraining the distribution of apps allowed it to protect the iPhone from malware and fraud. The practice benefited customers and made the iPhone more attractive than competing devices with Android\u2019s operating system.\nThe government will try to show that the effect of Apple\u2019s policies was to hurt consumers, not help them.\n\u201cCompetition makes devices more private and more secure,\u201d said Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. \u201cIn many instances, Apple\u2019s conduct has made its ecosystem less private and less secure.\u201d"

        "title": "E.U. Takes Aim at Alphabet, Apple and Meta in Wide-Ranging Investigations",
        "fulltext": "Alphabet, Apple and Meta were told by European Union regulators on Monday that they were under investigation for a range of potential violations of the region\u2019s new competition law.\nThe inquiries are the first that regulators have announced since the Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, and they signal the bloc\u2019s intention to tightly enforce the sweeping competition rules. The law requires Alphabet, Apple, Meta and other tech giants to open up their platforms so smaller rivals can have more access to their users, potentially affecting app stores, messaging services, internet search, social media and online shopping.\nThe investigations in Brussels add to the regulatory scrutiny facing the largest tech companies and show growing alignment between the United States and Europe on the need to crack down on the firms for anticompetitive behavior.\nLast week in Washington, the Justice Departmentsued Apple for breaking antitrust lawswith practices that were intended to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and less likely to switch to a competing device. Amazon, Google and Meta are also facing federal antitrust lawsuits.\nE.U. investigators said they wanted to study whether Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, were unfairly favoring their own app stores to box out rivals, particularly restrictions that limit how app developers can communicate with customers about sales and other offers. Google is also being investigated over the display of search results in Europe, while Meta will be questioned about a new ad-free subscription service and the use of data for selling advertising.\nThe European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, can fine the companies up to 10 percent of their global revenue, which for each runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. The commission has 12 months to complete its investigations.\nThe companies had already announced a number of changes to their products, services and business practices to try to comply with the Digital Markets Act. But in announcing the investigations on Monday, regulators said their changes did not go far enough.\n\u201cCertain compliance measures fail to achieve their objectives and fall short of expectations,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s executive vice president, who announced the investigations at a news conference in Brussels. Compliance with the law, she said, \u201cis something that we take very seriously.\u201d\nThe investigations announced on Monday intensify a yearslong campaign by European regulators to loosen the grip of the biggest tech companies on the digital economy. This month, Ms. Vestagerannounceda 1.85 billion-euro ($2 billion) fine against Apple for unfair business practices related to the App Store. Amazon, Google and Meta have also been subject to E.U. investigations.\nIn an interview last month, Ms. Vestager said the United States and the European Union were more closely aligned now on the need to regulate the tech sector than a few years ago when she was accused of unfairly targeting American firms. She said European regulators communicated with counterparts in Washington to \u201cshare notes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the cooperation has been better for a very long time,\u201d she said.\nThe Digital Markets Act,first passedin 2022, was intended to give European regulators more authority to force the tech giants to change their business practices without the drawn-out process of filing traditional antitrust lawsuits, which can take years to resolve. A key aspect of the law is that the companies cannot favor their own services over similar products offered by rivals.\nAs part of the investigations, Alphabet, Apple and Meta will now be required to disclose more information to regulators about their business practices. The companies said they had made changes to comply with the new rules.\nAmong the changes, Apple announced in January that developers would have new ways to reach customers in the European Union, including allowing outside app stores to be available on iPhones and iPads for the first time. Google also made changes to its products, including how it displays search results for flights, hotels and shopping services.\nMeta created a new subscription service that allows E.U. users to pay \u20ac13 per month if they want to use Facebook and Instagram without advertisements. Regulators said the policy essentially forces users to either pay a fee or agree to have their personal data used to target advertising.\n\u201cThe commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or consent\u2019 model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\nA spokesman for Meta said it would \u201ccontinue to engage constructively with the commission.\u201d Apple said it had \u201cdemonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the European Commission and developers, listening and incorporating their feedback.\u201d Oliver Bethell, the director of competition at Google, said the company would \u201ccontinue to defend our approach in the coming months.\u201d\nMany in the tech industry have wondered how aggressively E.U. regulators would enforce the new competition law. In Brussels, the tech companies have been participating in workshops about how the rules would be carried out. At the same time, many app developers, competitors and consumer groups have complained to regulators that the changes made by the companies so far were insufficient.\n\u201cToday\u2019s opening of investigations into Meta, Google and Apple is a sure sign that the commission means business in enforcing the Digital Markets Act,\u201d said Monique Goyens, director general of the European Consumer Organization, a group in Brussels that has been critical of the tech industry.\nOn Monday, regulators also said they were gathering information about Amazon\u2019s compliance with the Digital Markets Act. Regulators said the company might be favoring its own branded products in its online store, in violation of the law."

        "title": "Apple Fined $2 Billion by E.U. for Using App Store to Thwart Competition",
        "fulltext": "Apple on Monday was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) by European Union regulators for thwarting competition among music streaming rivals, a severe punishment levied against the tech giant in a long-simmering battle over the powerful role it plays as gatekeeper of the App Store.\nThe penalty,announced by the E.U. antitrust regulator, is the culmination of a five-year investigation set in motion by one of its biggest rivals, Spotify. Regulators said Apple illegally used its App Store dominance to box out rivals.\n\u201cFor a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees competition policy.\n\u201cFrom now on,\u201d she said in a news conference, \u201cApple will have to allow music streaming developers to communicate freely with their own users.\u201d The size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects both Apple\u2019s financial power and the harm that Apple\u2019s conduct inflicted on millions of European users.\u201d\nThe action by the European Commission, the E.U. executive branch, is the latest in a series of regulations and penaltiesto target the App Store. Most of the disputes are because Apple requires that apps use its in-app payment service for sales. It takes as much as a 30 percent commission on each transaction, a fee that many developers say is excessive.\nRegulators in theNetherlands andSouth Koreahave passed laws or orders to force Apple to allow alternative payment services, but Apple has largely disregarded the regulators\u2019 challenges. In those countriesit is allowing alternatives but charging a 27 percent commission, a solution that regulators in the countries are contesting.\nApple said it would appeal the ruling. \u201cWhile we respect the European Commission, the facts simply don\u2019t support this decision,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Monday.\nIn a briefing last month, Apple said that European regulators had been searching for a legal theory for the case for nearly a decade, in fits and starts. Apple challenged the idea that Spotify users haven\u2019t been able to subscribe to music services through other means, saying that Spotify has added more than 100 million subscribers outside its app over the past eight years.\nApple also accused Spotify of being a monopolist because it has more than a 50 percent share of Europe\u2019s music streaming business. It said that Spotify has benefited from the software tools that Apple provides, as well as more than 119 billion downloads and updates of its app. It\u2019s done so while not paying Apple any money in commissions.\n\u201cFundamentally, their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple\u2019s tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.\nSpotify, in a statement, said Monday\u2019s penalty \u201csends a powerful message \u2014 no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers.\u201d\nThe penalty reinforces the European Union\u2019s position as the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of the tech sector. In recent years, the bloc has passed laws on data privacy, industry competition, content moderation of online content and artificial intelligence. Antitrust regulators have meanwhile investigated or fined Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta.\nThe fine is the most severe penalty against Apple since 2016, when the European Commission ordered the company to turn over \u20ac13 billion for unpaid taxes to Ireland. In a sign of how long the appeal process can drag out, that case is still winding its way through E.U. courts.\nIn 2022, the 27-nation bloc largely sided with developers in writing the Digital Markets Act that requires Apple to open the iPhone to competing app stores and allow app makers to directly accept payments. The rules go into effect Thursday.\nIn itslatest quarter, Apple reported revenue of about $120 billion and a net profit of $34 billion.\nLast month, Apple said that it would comply with the new law by giving developers three options. They could stick with the status quo App Store system and continue paying up to a 30 percent commission of sales. Or they could accept alternative payments and reduce their commission to 17 percent, while taking on a new charge of 50 euro cents on every download above one million. Finally, they could avoid Apple\u2019s commission and distribute through competing stores, while still paying Apple\u2019s download fee.\nUnder Apple\u2019s plan, Spotify and other apps would be able to tell customers in their app about cheaper subscription prices online.\nApple\u2019s proposal for the App Store in Europe has sparked an outcry from developers large and small, who say that it fails to abide by both the letter and spirit of the law.\nApple has said that its plan complies with the law, while minimizing the risk iPhone users encounter malware, spam or fraud.\nSpotify has been one of Apple\u2019s most vocal critics. For years, the music streaming service has complained that the App Store\u2019s in-app payment system and 30 percent commission has put it at a disadvantage to Apple Music, which can sell subscriptions directly without a similar fee.\nThe rules have alsohampered Spotify\u2019s efforts to expand its businessinto audiobooks and other services. Instead of charging for a book in the app, it has tried to avoid Apple\u2019s fees by directing customers outside the app to pay, a process that it has called cumbersome and difficult.\nApple says that Spotify\u2019s decision to link to its website means that it doesn\u2019t pay for many of the services that benefit the music streaming service, including software tools and hardware improvements like advanced media playback. It also complained that Spotify met with European regulators more than 60 times during the course of the investigation.\nDaniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, has complained for years about the slow pace of Europe\u2019s investigation. Throughout the process, he pointed out ways that Apple\u2019s control over the App Store disadvantaged competitors.\n\u201cWithout policymakers taking action, nothing will change,\u201dMr. Ek wrote in 2022 on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. \u201cI can\u2019t be the only one who sees the absurdity.\u201d\nMonika Pronczukcontributed reporting from Brussels."

        "title": "Apple and Google Are Discussing a Deal to Bring Generative A.I. to iPhones",
        "fulltext": "Apple is in discussions with Google about using the search giant\u2019s generative artificial intelligence model called Gemini for its next iPhone, as the company races to embrace a technology that has upended the tech industry.\nThe talks are preliminary and the exact scope of a potential deal hasn\u2019t been defined, three people with knowledge of the discussions said. Apple has also held discussions with other A.I. companies, one of these people said, as it looks to tap into the power of a large language model capable of analyzing vast amounts of data and generating text on its own.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has promised investors that the company will introduce new generative A.I. capabilities this year. The company\u2019s smartphone rivals, Samsung and Google, have already added Gemini to their newest devices to edit videos and summarize audio recordings.\nApple and Google declined to comment.Bloombergreported earlier on their talks.\nAn Apple-Google deal on generative A.I. would extend one of technology\u2019s most longstanding partnerships. Since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Google has been a critical contributor to the device\u2019s success. It initially provided Google Maps for navigation and the default search engine on the iPhone\u2019s Safari browser, now a lucrative agreement for whichGoogle pays Apple more than $18 billion a year.\nGoogle\u2019s discussions to provide generative A.I. capabilities for the iPhone would be the latest example of its filling a gap in Apple\u2019s products. Apple\u2019s effort to develop its own large language model, the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, has been running behind, two people familiar with its development said.\nApple\u2019s delay in releasing an A.I. product has been costly. After a decade-long run as the world\u2019s most valuable public company,it was dethroned this year by Microsoft, which has aggressively pursued A.I. The technology has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value.\nDespite its delays, Apple has the potential to be a big player in A.I. The company has more than two billion devices actively in use, making it an attractive partner for Google and others. Its reputation for protecting customers\u2019 private information could also be helpful in a future where A.I. services help manage people\u2019s calendars or health data.\nA deal could bring the Gemini model to iPhones around the world, giving Google access to a massive user base and making generative A.I. even more mainstream. Virtually overnight, Google could have more consumers using its A.I. than its chief rival, OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT \u2014 making a pact with Apple a tantalizing prospect.\n(The New York TimessuedOpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\nApple\u2019s selecting Google as an A.I. supplier would be a crucial vote of confidence in the search giant after a number of setbacks to its A.I. ambitions. The company\u2019s first A.I. chatbot, Bard, debuted to middling reviews last March and struggled to attract as many users as ChatGPT.\nIn February, Google debuted a new chatbot, Gemini. The chatbot ran into problems last month when users found that its image generator produced illustrations of historical figures that were not racially accurate and refused in most instances to generate images of white people, leading to accusations of bias. Google disabled the ability to create images of people and vowed to fix the problem.\nIn a note on Tuesday, a Bernstein Research analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, called an Apple-Google deal a \u201cwin-win,\u201d giving Apple generative A.I. for iPhones and validating Google\u2019s work on Gemini. He also said Apple didn\u2019t have to own an A.I. model on iPhones to profit from it and could instead take a commission from Google, which currently charges $19.99 per month for its Gemini Advanced app.\nCompanies haven\u2019t yet cashed in on generative A.I. The costs associated with running large language models in the cloud are staggering, and consumers and business customers are only starting to pay for the emerging technology. But they are optimistic that profits will increase as the capabilities of A.I. systems improve and the costs decline for building the data centers to power the systems.\nA new deal between Apple and Google could draw scrutiny from U.S. regulators. TheJustice Department is in the final stages of a lawsuit against Googlefor harming competition by paying Apple to be the default search engine on the iPhone and other services. JudgeAmit P. Mehtaof U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the nonjury trial, is expected to deliver a verdict this year."
