        "fulltext": "It was all too fitting that an anti-commercialism Christmas classic, broadcast over the public airwaves every year since 1965, would be sidelined in 2020 to a paid streaming service operated by a tech giant.\nSuch was the widespread reaction in October when Apple TV Plus obtained the exclusive rights to the \u201cPeanuts\u201d catalog, including the widely beloved \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas,\u201d not to mention \u201cA Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.\u201d It meant families could no longer watch the holiday specials on ABC \u2014 they would have to be streamed on the service Apple has been pushing sinceits debut last November.\nTo many, including the more than 260,000 people whosigned a petition, it was a theft of holiday traditions befitting of grinches and blockheads, even though Apple would make the specials available for free for a few days underits agreementwith the companies that own \u201cPeanuts.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Apple eased its grip on the shows,announcing a dealthat would allow PBS to show ad-free versions of the Thanksgiving special on Sunday and the Christmas special on Dec. 13. The announcement did not say whether the specials would return to public television after 2020.\nBut for this year, at least, it was the kind of tale that may have fit in the 1965 Christmas special, long praised as being ahead of its time in its anti-consumerism message. In the 25-minute production \u2014 spoilers ahead, if you haven\u2019t gotten around to watching it in the past 55 years \u2014 Charlie Brown, dealing with a bit of seasonal depression, confesses he just can\u2019t catch the Christmas fever like everyone else.\n\u201cCharlie Brown, you\u2019re the only person I know who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem,\u201d his friend Linus tells him.\nCharlie dismays at his sister, Sally, saying all she wants \u201cis my fair share,\u201d and at Linus\u2019s sister, Lucy, complaining about her gifts while what she really wants is real estate.\n\u201cLook, Charlie, let\u2019s face it,\u201d Lucy tells him. \u201cWe all know that Christmas is a big commercial racket.\u201d\nWithout going into a full plot synopsis, they break out some fierce dance moves, a Bible verse is recited, a slight tree is decorated nicely, and Christmas is saved.\nThe Apple-PBS deal was struck too late to save this year\u2019s showing of the \u201cGreat Pumpkin\u201d for Halloween, promptingmurmurs of discontentamong those saddened at the loss of what had long been a nationwide communal experience. It was the first time since 1966 the special didn\u2019t air on network TV.\nThe Thanksgiving special, sandwiched between its slightly more popular neighbors, first aired in 1973.\nGaining the \u201cPeanuts\u201d collection, the legacy ofthe popular cartoonist Charles Schulz, was seen as a coup for Apple TV Plus, the $5-a-month streaming service on whichApple has bet bigand positioned as a competitor to streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Disney Plus. It still has less content than its competitors, but has banked on creating can\u2019t-miss exclusive shows.\nAs part of its deal with \u201cPeanuts,\u201d Apple will be producing a new season of \u201cSnoopy in Space\u201d and new holiday specials celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, Earth Day and New Year\u2019s Eve."

        "title": "Apple Introduces New Macs With the First Apple Chips",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019sbreakup with Intelhas begun.\nApple unveiled a new series of Mac computers on Tuesday that use processors it created for the first time. Since 2005,Applehas relied on Intel to make the processors that underpin Apple\u2019s laptops and desktop computers, meaning those computers used virtually the same chips as many other PCs.\nThe move away from Intel was the latest sign ofthe growing powerand independence of the technology industry\u2019s largest companies. Apple is large enough and rich enough to design and make those chips itself. Apple has already made the chips inside iPhones, iPads and the Apple Watch, and now it creates essentially all major parts of the Mac, from the software to the hardware to the components that power the computer.\nApple hadannounced the transition in June, and said then that it would show off the first Macs with Apple processors later this year. Apple said on Thursday that it was making \u201ca family of chips\u201d and that it would take two years to transition all of its Mac computers to the new components.\nApple announced new Macbook Air and Macbook Pro laptops, as well as a new Mac mini desktop computer. All of the computers went on sale on Tuesday.\nIn a prerecorded 45-minute infomercial, a format that has replaced Apple\u2019s live product launches during the pandemic, a series of Apple executives described how the new Apple processor, called the M1, would make the new Macs faster and more power efficient.\n\u201cEvery Mac with M1 will be transformed into a completely different class of product,\u201d Johny Srouji, a former Intel engineer who leads Apple\u2019s chip-design team, said in the video. He said the new chip could achieve three times more \u201cperformance per watt.\u201d That enabled the new Macbook Pro to have up to 20 hours of battery life, the most ever for a Macbook, Apple said.\nFor Intel, Apple\u2019s shift continues a drumbeat of bad news that largely follows its delays in delivering performance gains in its chips. It also illustrates the gains possible for computer makers with the engineering prowess to design blocks of chip circuitry that handle specific tasks, like graphics and machine learning.\nThough Apple represents a small chunk of Intel\u2019s business, analysts have warned that any major performance leaps by Apple might spur other major computer makers to start designing chips of their own or turn to other suppliers, such as Qualcomm. Microsoft is already selling laptops powered by that company\u2019s chips.\nBut the Apple presentation didn\u2019t provide details of the benchmark tests used to justify the claimed speed improvements. \u201cPerformance of the new M1 chip is nearly impossible to gauge as the company didn\u2019t provide any detailed substantiation around any of the performance claims made,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cI think these should be scrutinized extensively.\u201d\nAn Intel spokesman said the company remained focused on delivering the most advanced PC experiences and a wide range of technology choices that redefine computing."

        "title": "Apple Halves Its App Store Fee for the Smaller Companies",
        "fulltext": "Apple, facing growing antitrust scrutiny over what it charges other companies for access to its App Store, said on Wednesday that it would cut in half the fee it took from the smallest app developers.\nDevelopers that brought in $1 million or less from their apps in the previous year will pay a 15 percent commission on those app sales starting next year, down from30 percent, the company said.\nThe move, which will have little impact on Apple\u2019s bottom line, is an abrupt change from the company\u2019s public intransigence over its fees. For 12 years, the App Store has helped fuel Apple\u2019sremarkable growth, and the company has appeared reluctant to do anything to tamper with it. Even when its fee policy emerged as the focus of antitrust complaints, Apple aggressively defended it.\nNow Apple appears to have found a way to earn good will from thousands of developers and give its executives ammunition for defending its commission to regulators and journalists, all without costing the company much.\nThe change will affect roughly 98 percent of the companies that pay Apple a commission, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. But those developers accounted for less than 5 percent of App Store revenues last year, Sensor Tower said. Apple said the new rate would affect the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its developers, but declined to offer specific numbers.\nApple said in a statement that it had made the change because 2020 was a difficult year for many small companies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re launching this program to help small-business owners write the next chapter of creativity and prosperity on the App Store, and to build the kind of quality apps our customers love,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release. The smaller commission will help \u201cdevelopers fund their small businesses, take risks on new ideas, expand their teams, and continue to make apps that enrich people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\nThe fee cut probably won\u2019t calm the waters between Apple and the larger app developers that have long protested the fee most loudly, and could just be a sop to state and federal regulators.\nEpic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite,sued Applein August over its fee. A month later, 13 companies and groups, including Spotify and Match Group, formed the nonprofitCoalition for App Fairnessto fight the \u201capp tax.\u201d And American and European regulators areinvestigating Appleforanticompetitive behavior, partly because of its commission.\n\u201cThe only good thing about this cynical, Machiavellian ploy by Apple to split developers with selective handouts is that it shows they\u2019re sweating,\u201dsaid David Heinemeier Hansson, a prominent software developer whose company, Basecamp, will still have to pay the 30 percent commission.\nTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive and another of Apple\u2019s toughest critics, also accused Apple of trying to divide developers. By charging smaller companies less, \u201cApple is hoping to remove enough critics that they can get away with their blockade on competition and 30 percent tax on most in-app purchases,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut consumers will still pay inflated prices marked up by the Apple tax.\u201d\nIn its news release, Apple included comment from several smaller companies that welcomed its change and that said it would help them reinvest in their businesses or offer more free features to users.\nApple introduced its 30 percent commission in 2008 with its App Store, which had just 500 offerings. Now the App Store is one of the world\u2019s largest centers of commerce, facilitating half a trillion dollars in sales in 2019.\nThat has made the commission the biggest driver of Apple\u2019s internet-services business, which brought in more than $53 billion over the past year.\nApple charges 30 percent of all sales of \u201cdigital goods and services\u201d in an app, such as a virtual item in a game or a subscription to a music, TV, news or dating app. (In the second year of a subscription, Apple\u2019s cut drops to 15 percent.) Apple doesn\u2019t take a cut of physical goods or services, such as an Uber ride or shoes bought in the Amazon app.\nWith the world\u2019s migration online, particularly during the pandemic, the App Store has become an increasingly crucial gateway to customers for companies of all sizes. Apple\u2019s growing power has prompted bothlawmakersanddevelopersto call its 30 percent cut \u201chighway robbery.\u201d\nNo company has fought Apple\u2019s commission harder than Epic. In August, the company baited Apple into kicking its wildly popular Fortnite game off the App Store, and then quickly sued Apple and rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign against it. This week, Epicexpanded its legal fighttoAustralia, where the laws could favor its complaints.\nEpic has argued that Apple could charge a more reasonable rate. Epic runs its own online marketplace for games, taking 12 percent of other companies\u2019 sales \u2014 and turning a profit of 5 percent to 7 percent, the company said.\nApple has argued that 30 percent matches other companies\u2019 rates, including app stores run by Google, Microsoft and Samsung, and game stores from Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.\nStill, Apple has not applied its cut evenly. Bigger companies with services that Apple wanted on iPhones, to make the devices more attractive to buyers, have negotiated better rates. Documents released by House lawmakers in July showed that Apple executivesoffered Amazona 15 percent commission to release its Amazon Prime Video app on the App Store in 2016.\nApple said it would use the combined sales of all of a developer\u2019s apps in the previous calendar year to determine which rate to charge a company. Any developer, including new ones, with $1 million or less in the prior year will pay the 15 percent rate for the year, even if its sales surpass $1 million that year."

        "title": "Nike and Coca-Cola Lobby Against Xinjiang Forced Labor Bill",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Nike and Coca-Cola are among the major companies and business groups lobbying Congress to weaken a bill that would ban imported goods made with forced labor inChina\u2019s Xinjiang region, according to congressional staff members and other people familiar with the matter, as well as lobbying records that show vast spending on the legislation.\nThe bill, which would prohibit broad categories of certain goods made by persecutedMuslim minoritiesin an effort to crack down on human rights abuses, has gained bipartisan support, passing the House in September by a margin of 406 to 3. Congressional aides say it has the backing to pass the Senate, and could be signed into law by either the Trump administration or the incoming Biden administration.\nBut the legislation, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, has become the target of multinational companies including Apple whose supply chains touch the far western Xinjiang region, as well as of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lobbyists have fought to water down some of its provisions, arguing that while they strongly condemn forced labor and current atrocities in Xinjiang, the act\u2019s ambitious requirements could wreak havoc on supply chains that are deeply embedded in China.\nXinjiang produces vast amounts of raw materials like cotton, coal, sugar, tomatoes and polysilicon, and supplies workers for China\u2019s apparel and footwear factories. Human rights groups and news reports have linked many multinational companies to suppliers there, including tying Coca-Cola to sugar sourced from Xinjiang, and documentingUighur workers in a factoryin Qingdao thatmakes Nike shoes.\nIna report issued in March, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, listed Nike and Coca-Cola as companies suspected of ties to forced labor in Xinjiang, alongside Adidas, Calvin Klein, Campbell Soup Company, Costco, H&M, Patagonia, Tommy Hilfiger and others.\nIn a statement, Coca-Cola said that it \u201cstrictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain\u201d and uses third-party auditors to closely monitor its suppliers. It also said that the COFCO Tunhe facility in Xinjiang, which supplies sugar to a local bottling facility and had been linked to allegations of forced labor byThe Wall Street Journal and Chinese-language news media, \u201csuccessfully completed an audit in 2019.\u201d\nGreg Rossiter, the director of global communications at Nike, said the company \u201cdid not lobby against\u201d the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act but instead had \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with congressional staff aides aimed at eliminating forced labor and protecting human rights.\nAsked about the allegations of forced labor, Nike referred toa statement in Marchin which it said that it did not source products from Xinjiang and that it had confirmed that its suppliers were not using textiles or yarn from the region.\nNike said that the Qingdao factory had stopped hiring new workers from Xinjiang in 2019, and that an independent audit confirmed there were no longer employees from there at the facility. (According to areport published in Marchby the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that cited state media, the factory employed around 800 Uighur workers at the end of 2019 and produced more than seven million pairs of shoes for Nike each year.)\nChina\u2019s vast campaignof suppressing and forcibly assimilating Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has attracted the scorn of politicians and consumers around the world.\nBut for many companies, fully investigating and eliminating any potential ties to forced labor there has been difficult, given the opacity of Chinese supply chains and the limited access of auditors to a region where the Chinese government tightly restricts people\u2019s movements.\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would require companies sending goods to the United States to scrutinize those supply chains, or perhaps abandon Chinese suppliers altogether. It would impose high standards, barring imports of goods made \u201cin whole or in part\u201d in Xinjiang unless companies prove to customs officials that their products were not made with forced labor.\nThe bill also targets so-called poverty alleviation and pairing programs that ship Muslims from impoverished areas to work in factories elsewhere, which human rights groups say are often coercive. Companies would be required to disclose information on their ties to Xinjiang to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRichard A. Mojica, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier, said that for many companies, convincing the authorities that they have no involvement with forced labor could take months. Firms were already responding by trying to find sources for products outside Xinjiang, he said.\n\u201cRebutting a presumption of forced labor is going to be a very challenging endeavor,\u201d he said.\nCompanies and groups lobbying on the bill have been pushing for various revisions, including easing disclosure requirements, people familiar with the conversations said.\nApple, which has extensive business ties to China, has also lobbied to limit some provisions of the bill, said two congressional staff members and another person familiar with the matter.\nDisclosure forms show that Apple paid Fierce Government Relations, a firm led by former staff aides to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and President George W. Bush, $90,000 to lobby on issues including Xinjiang-related legislation in the third quarter. Apple\u2019s lobbying waspreviously reported by The Washington Post.\nApple also paid outside firms this year to lobby on another bill, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020.\nApple disputed the claim that it had tried to weaken the legislation, saying it supported efforts to strengthen American regulations and believes the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act should become law.\nAccording to a document viewed by The New York Times, Apple\u2019s suggested edits to the bill included extending some deadlines for compliance, releasing certain information about supply chains to congressional committees rather than to the public, and requiring Chinese entities to be \u201cdesignated by the United States government\u201d as helping to surveil or detain Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.\nInits March report, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute identified Apple and Nike among 82 companies that potentially benefited, directly or indirectly, from abusive labor transfer programs tied to Xinjiang.\nThat report said that O-Film Technology, a contractor for Apple,Microsoft, Google and other companies, received at least 700 Uighur workers in a program that was expected to \u201cgradually alter their ideology.\u201d It tied other Apple suppliers, including Foxconn Technology, to similar employment programs.\nApple said in a statement that it had the strongest supplier code of conduct in its industry and that it regularly assessed suppliers, including with surprise audits.\n\u201cLooking for the presence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment we conduct and any violations of our policies carry immediate consequences, including business termination,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEarlier this year, we conducted a detailed investigation with our suppliers in China and found no evidence of forced labor on Apple production lines and we are continuing to monitor this closely.\u201d\nLobbying disclosures show that companies have spent heavily to sway Congress on Xinjiang-related legislation, though they reveal nothing about their specific requests.\nIn the first three quarters of 2020, Nike spent $920,000 on in-house lobbying of Congress and other federal agencies. Disclosures do not break down expenditures by topic, but show Nike lobbied on matters including physical education grants, taxes and climate change, as well as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.\nNike also paid outside firms like Cornerstone Government Affairs, Ogilvy, Capitol Counsel, GrayRobinson, American Continental Group, DiNino Associates and Empire Consulting Group more than $400,000 this year to lobby on issues including the act.\nMr. Rossiter said that Nike had these firms on retainer long before the Xinjiang legislation was introduced, and that the company actively worked with lobbying firms to engage Congress on a variety of subjects it cares about.\nCoca-Cola has also invested heavily, spending $4.68 million in the first three quarters of 2020 on in-house lobbying and hiring Empire Consulting Group and Sidley Austin to lobby on issues including the act.\nCoca-Cola said in a statement that it complies with all laws associated with its political activities and has \u201cadopted best-in-class disclosures practices.\u201d\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce declined to comment on lobbying, instead providing a letter it sent to Congress in November with seven other industry groups. The letter said the groups had long been working to combat forced labor, and urged the government to take a comprehensive approach that would mobilize the administration, Congress and foreign governments to address the problem, in addition to industry."

        "title": "Apple Puts Key Contractor on Probation Over Labor Abuses in China",
        "fulltext": "Applesaid on Monday that it had placed a key assembler of its iPhones on probation after the Taiwanese company was found to have concealed violations of labor rules for students employed at its factories inChina.\nFor years,Applehas worked, and at times struggled, to uphold labor standards across its vast electronics supply chain in China. The company said it had made the decision because the Taiwanese company, Pegatron, had violated its code of conduct by allowing student laborers to work night shifts and overtime and do work unrelated to their fields of study, and had then falsified documents to cover it up.\n\u201cThe individuals at Pegatron responsible for the violations went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nTo meet grueling deadlines, factories in China sometimes recruit labor from local technical schools. Strict guidelines are supposed to limit how long and when such employees can work, but in practice, rules are often ignored and other abuses are common. In some cases, students have saidthey were forced to do monotonous assembly workrather than the more technical tasks they were studying.\nPegatron, a major assembler of the iPhone that has factories across China, has been accused of a number of labor and environmental abuses over the years. Apple said it would not give the contractor any new business until it took corrective measures, and noted that a Pegatron executive in charge of the student employment program had already been fired.\nThe rebuke, rare for such a high-profile supplier, underscored a challenge facing Apple as it seeks to address abuses in its supply chain, which sprawls across hundreds of factories across China and increasingly the world. While Apple can make or break the smaller companies that make the innards of its iPhones and put them together, few have the scale to assemble large numbers of phones quickly, leaving Apple reliant on assemblers like Pegatron and its larger Taiwanese rival,Foxconn.\nApple occasionally drops suppliers or puts them on probation. In its 2019 supplier responsibility report, the company saidit had removed 20 manufacturing facilitiesfrom its supply chain because of violations over the years. In general, however, it said it works with suppliers for 90 days to ensure corrective actions are taken.\nIn a statement, a Pegatron spokeswoman said that upon discovering the violations, the company immediately removed the student workers from production lines and worked to \u201cmake appropriate arrangements for them to return to their homes or schools with proper compensation alongside all necessary support and care.\u201d\nShe added that the company was undertaking an audit to ensure its labor standards were upheld.\nThe probation, which will not affect current production of the iPhone, comes at a busy time for Apple suppliers, who regularly add staff and increase worker hours to meet huge orders of iPhones ahead of theproduct\u2019s annual holiday release schedule. While workers once sought out the relatively well-paid shift jobs at the citysize factories that produce the iPhone, new employment opportunities closer to home, like jobs in food and package delivery, have made it harder to attract short-term workers during times of high labor demand.\nIn the past, worker shortages have led companies like Pegatron and Foxconn to break rules to ensure they have enough staff.Foxconn has used child labor, whilePegatron relied on ruthless agentswho hold workers\u2019 salaries and sometimes their identification cards, preventing them from leaving the factories. Wider concern about the harsh conditions in Apple\u2019s supply chain spread in 2010, when arash of suicides at Foxconn\u2019s plantsprompted Apple to institute further checks and oversight.\nThe suspension for Pegatron, while probably temporary, could further open the door forLuxshare, a smaller Chinese manufacturer that has been working to expand its role in the Apple supply chain. This year, Luxshare bought an iPhone production factory in China from the Taiwanese company Wistron, which was widely read as an attempt to elbow into the business dominated by Foxconn and Pegatron."

        "title": "Biden Is Expected to Keep Scrutiny of Tech Front and Center",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The tech industry had it easy under President Barack Obama. Regulators brought no major charges, executives rotated in and out of the administration, and efforts to strengthen privacy laws fizzled out.\nThe industry will have it much harder underpresident-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\nBipartisan support to restrain its power has grown sharply during the Trump administration, and shows no signs of going away as Democrats regain control of the White House. Mr.Bidenis expected to take on the Silicon Valley giants on misinformation, privacy andantitrust, in a sharp departure from the polices pursued while he was vice president under Mr. Obama.\n\u201cThe foundations of the concerns about digital platforms were developing during the Obama years, and yet the major tech issues from the Obama era are still with us and unresolved,\u201d said Chris Lewis, the president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \u201cThe genie is out of the bottle and the issues the public needs resolved are piling up without resolution.\u201d\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Biden rarely spoke about technology policy at length. But he has criticized social media companies, like Facebook, that have allowed disinformation to flourish on their sites, and he has expressed concern over power held by a handful of companies in tech and other industries.\nA Biden administration is expected to pursue theantitrust lawsuit filed against Google last month, people with knowledge of his campaign said. It may also introduce more antitrustcases against Facebookand possibly Amazon and Apple, which the Trump administration has investigated for more than a year.\nThe Biden campaign wouldn\u2019t comment about specific cases or investigations. But a spokesman for it, Matt Hill, said Mr. Biden would take an aggressive stance toward the industry.\n\u201cMany technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy and evaded any form of responsibility,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cThat ends with a President Biden.\u201d\nMr. Biden\u2019s clearest position on internet policy has been his call to revoke alegal shield known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That safe harbor has protected Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter from lawsuits for hosting or removing harmful or misleading content. He hasn\u2019t elaborated on how he would revoke the shield, a 1996 law that the tech industry will fight vigorously to defend.\nAlso near the top of Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda, his advisers have said, will be the extension of broadband internet service to low-income and rural households, which has become an urgent need during the pandemic as schools have shifted online. Billions in federal funding could come from legislation or the Federal Communications Commission, which hollowed out several regulations during the Trump administration.\nThe F.C.C. would also be poised to reinstall so-called net neutrality, a rule that prevented telecommunications companies from blocking or slowing internet traffic.\nHundreds of informal tech advisers, some of them current or former telecom and tech employees, have offered opinions, white papers and strategies for Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign and possible presidency. Many of the top advisers have been proponents of strong legislation to limit the power of the tech companies.\nLeading Mr. Biden\u2019s team of tech advisers is Bruce Reed, his chief of staff when he was vice president. Mr. Reed served in recent years as general counsel for Common Sense Media, a child advocacy nonprofit in San Francisco that has lobbied for tech privacy and safety laws. Mr. Reed was instrumental in the creation ofCalifornia\u2019s privacy lawin 2018.\nAnother top aide working on tech issues is Stef Feldman, a longtime member of Mr. Biden\u2019s staff who led the campaign\u2019s policy efforts. This year,she told Politicothat among the issues she was tracking closely was \u201cdisparities in children\u2019s ability to engage in remote learning due to a lack of access to technology\u201d during the pandemic.\nMr. Biden will need to navigate a split in the Democratic Party over how aggressively to approach the tech companies. Progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island have argued that the giants should be broken up, and those lawmakers will probably fight for regulators who feel similarly. Moderates in the party have shown a reluctance to break up the companies.\nMany conservatives support the antitrust investigations being led by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. But they are likely to resist many of Mr. Biden\u2019s tech policies, like online speech and privacy legislation that interferes in free markets. And with neither party controlling a large majority in the Senate, their opposition means that legislation could easily hit gridlock.\nMr. Biden will also face fierce pushback from the industry. In recent years, technology companies have expanded their lobbying, with Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google spending $53.6 million on it last year \u2014 more than Wall Street, pharmaceutical and energy firms.\n\u201cTremendous political influence will be brought to bear on a Biden White House by the tech lobby and its allies,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, head of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s night and day in terms of how tech is viewed now and during the Obama years.\u201d\nCurrent and former tech executives and lobbyists, as well as former regulators, said that while the industry expected a Biden administration to be tough on the companies, particularly in antitrust areas, it would welcome a change from the unpredictable Trump administration.\n\u201cThe Trump administration was a showbiz, and as a result no one knew what to expect,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, a Democrat who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under Mr. Obama. \u201cSilicon Valley will at least be pleased with stability knowing there is a plan, rather than a whim-of-the-moment policy creation.\u201d\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel and its chief of government affairs from 2009-17, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re in Silicon Valley and you\u2019re the head of one of these companies, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Biden\u2019s not going to be easier on us \u2014 but at least it\u2019s back to the devil that we know.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Biden is expected to largely extend the hard line Mr. Trump has taken against Chinese tech firms that officials say pose a national security threat. The Trump administration has moved to strip Chinese telecom equipment from American networks, stop Silicon Valley companies from building undersea cables to mainland China and remove Chinese-owned products like TikTok from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores.\nMr. Trump has pressured American allies to take the same steps. But Mr. Biden may try to take a more conciliatory approach with European policymakers who have grown to see China\u2019s influence over technology as a major threat \u2014 which could encourage him to overcome the gap between Europe\u2019s tough internet regulations and the United States\u2019 hands-off approach.\n\u201cA Biden administration would definitely seek to put pressure on Beijing in a multilateral way, but one of the first things they\u2019ll have to think about is: How do we work with Europeans when there is a massive digital chasm?\u201d said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at the think tank New America."

        "title": "When Music Is on Your Holiday List",
        "fulltext": "In a holiday season when it may not be possible to hand someone a CD or a boxed set of vinyl, you can always order these gifts online.\nBut other, potentially more creative options for music lovers abound. Many are particularly well suited to concert fans who have missed going to live events for most of this year: You can give them an online subscription to watch a live or filmed performance in the socially distanced comfort of home, or honor them with a donation to a music hall that is struggling to survive.\nThe appeal of watching music performances online, whileespecially resonant this year, isn\u2019t limited to the pandemic. \u201cEven before all the drama, there was a real sense that there are a lot of people who can\u2019t make it to New York or London,\u201d said Susannah Simons, editorial director ofMarquee TV, a British-based online streaming platform, available worldwide, for classical music, opera, theater and ballet. \u201cWhy should they be denied the opportunity to see these great performances?\u201d\nSubscriptions provide access to recorded performances from venues including the Royal Opera House in London and the Teatro Real in Milan and by institutions like the London Philharmonic Orchestra. And while Ms. Simons would not disclose how many the company had sold \u2014 a year\u2019s access is currently $90 \u2014 she said the number in 2020 more than tripled between March and October over the same period in 2019.\nA gift subscription to what the Berlin Philharmoniker calls itsDigital Concert Hall, available worldwide, offers both livestreamed performances and archived videos; the $169 price for a one-year service includes a DVD with concert footage.\nIdagio, the Berlin-based classical music audio-streaming service, added live concert footage, to be purchased per performance, to its offerings in May. And in mid-November, the site began selling $200 gift subscriptions for a 12-month package that includes unlimited access to its audio streams and concert footage. (The service is available in many countries but some, like Japan and China, are not included.)\nFor fans of more contemporary music, there are sites likeQello Concerts by Stingray. Its offerings include music documentaries and archival performances by artists like Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, Bob Marley and Childish Gambino; the Montreal-based service, available in more than 160 countries, is $99 for a year\u2019s subscription. AndLe Poisson Rouge, a club in Greenwich Village, recently added a subscription option to its website, where concerts by emerging artists like Sunflower Bean and Samia can be viewed worldwide, live and on demand, for $20 a month.\nSome websites, likeDiceandNugs.net, offer gift tickets to one-time viewings of live shows online; these concerts are sometimes filmed in an empty theater. Pop artists like Billie Eilish and Niall Horan have also offered virtual tickets to livestreams on their websites. Buying this type of online access as a present, however, can be tricky.\n\u201cOne challenge is that these livestreams are announced not very far in advance,\u201d said Hannah Karp, Billboard\u2019s editorial director, \u201cso if you want to do early Christmas shopping you might not know what concerts are going to be out there after you give your gifts.\u201d\nAudio-only sites likeSpotifyandDeezer, in spite of their popularity, aren\u2019t well structured for gift giving. \u201cOne of the fastest-growing forms of music service are family plans, so you\u2019re automatically covering your immediate family members with unlimited, all-you-can-consume music if they\u2019re in your own household,\u201d said Chris Bierly, a partner at Bain & Company, a management consulting firm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give a subscription to your kid, because they\u2019re already covered on your family plan.\u201d\nPerhaps with this in mind, Spotify doesn\u2019t offer gift subscriptions to its ad-free premium service, although individual subscriptions can be purchased through third-party gift cards. Apple gift cards can also be used to buy its music-streaming service. (These prices vary by country.)Qobuz, a French website, offers gift subscriptions ($30 in the U.S. and Britain; \u20ac40 elsewhere) for two months\u2019 access to its high-resolution music streaming in a dozen countries.\nFor concertgoers who miss being surrounded by other music fans, there are gift options that help support venues while they\u2019re closed. The 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., for example,sells itemslike branded tank tops ($15) and bandannas ($10). Melkweg, the Amsterdam concert hall,sellsT-shirts (25 euros, or about $30) and tote bags (\u20ac10).\n\u201cMerch has been an absolute lifesaver for the whole music industry,\u201d said Beverley Whitrick, strategic director of the British charityMusic Venue Trust.\n\u201cParticularly with a view to Christmas,\u201d Ms. Whitrick continued, \u201cit\u2019s a great time to think, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t go mosey around the shops and look for X, Y and Z, but I can buy something fantastic to wear from an artist or a venue.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Karp at Billboard said: \u201cIt\u2019s a way that fans can transact with their idols since they can\u2019t actually go see them live. At least you can buy stuff and have that connection. That has become a big thing this year for some artists.\u201d\nOr, if you would like to help challenged music halls by making donations in someone\u2019s honor, theNational Independent Venue Associationhas a relief fund for U.S. concert spaces; the Music Venue Trust takes donations for British ones. Anddonations to Wigmore Hallin London support the chamber musicians who appear in performances that are streamed free on its website. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a model where we can pay the artists, because so many of them had no work for at least six months,\u201d said John Gilhooly, the hall\u2019s director.\nAnother option is a gift subscription to a monthly service like theRough Trade Club, which sends members a CD or LP each month. Run by a respected chain of record shops in Britain and the U.S., it offers delivery worldwide; price depends on the subscription length and release format. Its curated selection of releases tends toward critically acclaimed alternative-rock artists, like Idles, Weyes Blood and Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever.\nAmong the other record clubs isVinyl Me, Please, a Denver-based business, which offers a selection of genres, andthe Retro, based in Glasgow, Scotland. These ship to many countries, although there may be import duty charges when the package arrives each month.\nAlthough many in-person concerts have already been announced for next year, the appeal of music online \u2014 and the need for musicians\u2019 support \u2014 looks unlikely to wane.\n\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic on early resumption of live events in music in 2021,\u201d Mr. Bierly of Bain & Company said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be quite some time before the live part of the industry is back to what it once was.\u201d"

        "title": "How Fake Reviews Hurt Us and Amazon",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nHere\u2019s a conundrum of the digital age: It\u2019s now possible and valuable to evaluate the feedback of others before buying a product, trying a restaurant or booking a hotel. But the growing ability to manipulate that feedback makes it hard to have faith.\nWe have more information than ever but may be more poorly informed.\nA recentacademic research paperexamined the prevalence of paid customer reviews on Amazon, and how the company and shoppers responded to them. The researchers found that Amazon is deleting a large share of ratings for which merchants paid, as these violate the company\u2019s rules. But in most instances Amazon didn\u2019t act fast enough, so people were still influenced by the bogus reviews.\nCustomerratings heavily influence what people buy online. This research suggests that Amazon could be doing more to ensure the credibility of reviews, and that we need to be even more skeptical shoppers.\nTwo of the paper\u2019s authors,Brett HollenbeckandSherry He, talked me through how they combed groups on Facebook where merchants solicit glowing reviews on their Amazon merchandise, typically in exchange for a free product, cash or other incentives. Over nine months, their team tracked about 1,500 products with solicited reviews.\nThe research found these paid-for reviews worked, to a point. The average rating and sales of the products increased, but only for a week or two before ratings fell as soon as merchants stopped buying reviews. It was often still financially worthwhile for the merchants, they said.\nAn Amazon representative told me that the companydevotes significant resources to rootingout and preventing inauthentic reviews, and that it catches many before they ever appear on its site.\nThe researchers found that Amazon eventually deleted roughly one-third of the bogus reviews, but typically only after an average lag of more than 100 days. Long before then, unhappy customers left a significant number of one-star reviews, a sign that they didn\u2019t like what they bought and possibly even felt deceived by it.\nPrevious investigationsandanalyseshave examined the cottage industry of bogus Amazon product reviews. This research is different in spotlighting Amazon\u2019s response.\nIt\u2019s impossible to catch all bad actors. But the fact that Amazon eventually deletes a significant portion of bought-off reviews shows that the company is able to spot inauthentic ones but doesn\u2019t have the resources or doesn\u2019t care enough to catch them before the damage is done.\n\u201cThey have almost unlimited resources and this seems to pose a threat to people\u2019s confidence in the company,\u201d said Dr. Hollenbeck, an assistant professor of marketing at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe researchers said their findings had made them more cautious online shoppers and suggested tips for the rest of us. People should be particularly wary of reviews for products that are expensive and for items bought during the holiday shopping period and in categories where many merchants are offering nearly identical products. Those cases have higher instances of bought-off reviews.\nThey also said it\u2019s safer but not foolproof to buy from merchants whose names you recognize. In their analysis, the majority of solicited reviews came from relatively unknown merchants, mostly in China. Here are moreonline shopping tips from Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product recommendation site.\nIt\u2019s bad when companies aren\u2019t upfront with their customers. It\u2019s much worse when companies aren\u2019t upfront in ways that fuel conspiracy theories.\nApple agreed on Wednesday to pay $113 million to settle an investigation by more than 30 states into its past practice of secretly slowing down older iPhones to preserve their battery life, my colleague Jack Nicasreported. In 2017, Apple acknowledged that it had reprogrammed its software to slow down phones with older batteries in some circumstancesto prevent them from shutting off unexpectedly.\nWhat Apple had been doing was not necessarily wrong, but the way the company communicated with customers was clueless.\nApple knew that people had suspected for years that the company intentionally made people\u2019s existing iPhones slower when new models were coming out so that people would buy new phones. There has never been evidence of this, and Apple has gotten angry about these rumors over the years.\nThe problem was that when Apple trained its software to slow down iPhones \u2014 for perhaps a sensible reason \u2014 it didn\u2019t sufficiently explain what it was doing. And that fueled the conspiracy theories that people already had about their iPhones. Apple created unnecessary controversy for itself.\nLikewise, Facebook made a similar error when it acknowledged having humanreviewers listen to audio clips from people using its servicesbut didn\u2019t properly explain why. There may have been legitimate reasons for Facebook to review people\u2019s audio recordings from its Messenger app and other products, but the company wasn\u2019t transparent about what it was doing \u2014 either to customers or its workers.\nAgain, this activity played intolong-held suspicions that Facebook was listening to people\u2019s private conversations. Facebook executives have rebutted these suspicions. It\u2019s harder to trust Facebook saying it\u2019s not secretly listening to people, when its workers doactually listen to peoplewithout their true knowledge or consent.\nMy free advice for rich companies: Don\u2019t do anything that undermines your own attempts to bat down conspiracy theories.\nMore attention on YouTube as a source for bogus information:Videos with misinformation supporting the idea that there was widespread U.S. voter fraud were viewedover 138 million times on YouTube during the week of the election, according to research reviewed by my colleague Sheera Frenkel. While YouTube has intervened to recommend fewer deceptive or dangerous videos through its automated recommendations, this research showed that it wasn\u2019t enough to stop people from finding bogus information anyway.\nHow are your 4-year-old\u2019s Zoom skills?Bloomberg News wrote aboutelite private schools in New York that are conducting web video interviews of potential kindergarten students. Predictably, test-prep companies and consultants charging up to $195 an hour are coaching preschoolers on how to make a good impression over video.\nI must know everything about the pig couch:My colleague Kate Conger unravels an internet scam, but a harmless one, involving amuch ridiculed pig sofa for sale on Craigslistthat wasn\u2019t what it seemed.

        "title": "Imagine a World Without Apps",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nAllow me to ask a wild question: What if we played games, shopped, watched Netflix and read news on our smartphones \u2014 without using apps?\nOur smartphones, like our computers, would instead mostly be gateways to go online through a web browser.\nWhy bother changing, you ask? Because the downsides of our app system \u2014 principallythe control that Apple and Google, the dominant app store owners in much of the world,exert over our digital lives \u2014 are onerous enough to contemplate another path.\nThere remain technical obstacles to using smartphone websites for everything. We\u2019re also used to apps. But in recent months,Microsoft\u2019s Xboxvideo gaming console, the popular gameFortniteandothergame companies have moved ahead with technology that makes it possible to play video games on smartphone web browsers.\nThis is a big deal. Games are the among the most popular smartphone apps, and they are often technically sophisticated. If video games can inch away from apps, maybe every other industry can, too.\nEven small erosions in our app system raise two big questions: Have apps outlived their usefulness? And if apps weren\u2019t dominant, would we have a richer variety of digital services from a broader array of companies?\nThe first thing to understand about apps is this: They were not inevitable. In the early smartphone era, there was a tug of war between technologies that were more like websites and the apps we know today. Apps won, mostly because they were technically superior.\nBut web browsers have become more capable, and cloud computing now enables a lot of sophisticated stuff to happen off the physical phone.\nI first became interested in this topic because Aram Zucker-Scharff, who helps oversee digital advertising technology at The Washington Post, has beentweetingfor yearsarguing thatapps were a mistakeand it\u2019stimeto move most of our smartphone activity to increasingly sophisticated mobile websites.\nOne of Zucker-Scharff\u2019s points is about control. Apple and Google dictate much of what is allowed on the world\u2019s phones. There are good outcomes from this, including those companiesweeding out bad or dangerous appsand giving us one place to find them.\nBut this comes with unhappy side effects. Apple and Google charge asignificant fee on many in-app purchases, and they\u2019ve forced app makers into awkward workarounds. (Ever try to buy a Kindle e-book on an iPhone app? You can\u2019t.) The growingcomplaints from app makersshow that thedownsidesof app control may be starting to outweigh the benefits.\nYou know what\u2019s free from Apple and Google\u2019s iron grip? The web. Smartphones could lean on the web instead.\nIt\u2019s easy to believe that fights over apps are merely one set of powerful companies \u2014 the Fortnite owner, Epic Games, andSpotify, for example \u2014 beefing over money with even more powerful companies, Apple and Google. It\u2019s more than that, though.\nThis is about imagining an alternate reality where companies don\u2019t need to devote money to creating apps that are tailored to iPhones and Android phones, can\u2019t work on any other devices and obligate app makers to hand over a cut of each sale.\nMaybe more smaller digital companies could thrive. Maybe our digital services would be cheaper and better. Maybe we\u2019d have more than two dominant smartphone systems. Or maybe it would be terrible. We don\u2019t know because we\u2019ve mostly lived with unquestioned smartphone app dominance.\nOverthrowing the app system is hard, and it may not be worth the trouble. But I\u2019m coming around to the idea that the flaws of the app system can\u2019t be fixed, and it\u2019s worth exploring alternatives that minimize the role of apps in our digital lives.\nFacebook is a company. It is also the world\u2019s biggest experiment in mass mind control. (Yes, I\u2019m being intentionally provocative. It\u2019s not literally mind control.)\nPlease readthis articlefrom my colleagues about software changes that Facebook made to de-emphasize divisive posts in its news feed and give more prominence to information from authoritative news sources about the U.S. election.\nThose changes prompted internal debates at Facebook about balancing the benefits of calmer online interactions with potential dings to the company\u2019s finances and possible political backlash, Kevin Roose, Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel reported.\nIt\u2019s a fascinating peek behind the curtain at how Facebook governs an online gathering place of billions. And their article shows that Facebook is not a static product. It evolves constantly in response to the company\u2019s goals and outside pressure.\nThose who believe Facebook is exerting too much control overwhat information people seein its news feed will chafe at the kind of tinkering my colleagues wrote about.\nBut let me say for the zillionth time that everything we see or don\u2019t see on Facebook is a result of deliberate choices by the company. Facebook makes tweaks all the time to change what information we see and reshape our interactions.And it has always been this way. Many popular internet servicesare the same.\nNow matter how you feel about Facebook, it is wild that a corporation controlled principally by one person has this much influence on the preferences and behaviors of billions of people \u2014 and is essentiallymaking big decisions mostly on its own and in secret.\nAs even Facebook executiveshave asked at times, should we really be leaving this much power in one company\u2019s hands?\nA computer could write this better than I:My colleague Cade Metz has the bestexplanationI\u2019ve read about a technology known as GPT-3 that analyzes reams of published words to spit out computer-generated language that sounds like humans. Andhe tried it on some Modern Love columns. (I\u2019ll have more from Cade in Wednesday\u2019s newsletter.)\nWhy your son might be struggling with virtual classes:Remote school has been tough for many kids and families. But The Wall Street Journal writes about some research that finds the distractions of virtual instruction and a lack of motivationmight be causing boys to fall further behindgirls in academic achievement.\nWhen virtual violence is an escape from the real thing:Filled with death and destruction, the group mobile game PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds is becoming widely played across Afghanistan, almost as an escape from the reality of a country mired in war, my colleagues Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fatima Faizi write.\nLook, anewborn donkey taking his first, ungainly steps.
