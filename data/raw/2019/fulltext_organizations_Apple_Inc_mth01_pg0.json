        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Despite a trade war between the United States andChinaand past admonishments from President Trump \u201cto start building their damn computers and things in this country,\u201d Apple is unlikely to bring its manufacturing closer to home.\nA tiny screw illustrates why.\nIn 2012, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook,went on prime-time televisionto announce that Apple would make a Mac computer in the United States. It would be the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers, and the top-of-the-line Mac Pro would come with an unusual inscription: \u201cAssembled in USA.\u201d\nBut when Apple began making the $3,000 computer in Austin, Tex., it struggled to find enough screws, according to three people who worked on the project and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.\nInChina, Applerelied on factories that can produce vast quantities of custom screws on short notice. In Texas, where they say everything is bigger, it turned out the screw suppliers were not.\n[Apple disabled theiPhone\u2019s Group FaceTime feature to fix a bug that made eavesdropping possible.]\nTests of new versions of the computer were hamstrung because a 20-employee machine shop that Apple\u2019s manufacturing contractor was relying on could produce at most 1,000 screws a day.\nThe screw shortage was one of several problems that postponed sales of the computer for months, the people who worked on the project said. By the time the computer was ready for mass production, Apple had ordered screws from China.\nThe challenges in Texas illustrate problems that Apple would face if it tried to move a significant amount of manufacturing out of China. Apple has found that no country \u2014 and certainlynot the United States\u2014 can match China\u2019s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost.\n[Apple computers were once made in Silicon Valley.It did not go well.]\nIn China, you will also find one of Apple\u2019s most important markets, and over the last month the risks that come with that dependence have become apparent. On Jan. 2, Apple said it would miss earnings expectations for the first time in 16 years, mostly because of slowing iPhone sales in China. On Tuesday, the company is expected to reveal more details about its financial results for the most recent quarter and its forecast for the coming year.\nThe company could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China \u2014 something the president has threatened to do.\nApple has intensified a search for ways to diversify its supply chain, but that hunt has homed in on India and Vietnam, according to an Apple executive who asked not to be named because the executive was not authorized to speak publicly. The company\u2019s executives are increasingly worried that its heavy dependence on China for manufacturingis risky amid the country\u2019s rising political tensionswith the United States and unpredictability, this person said.\n\u201cThe skill here is just incredible,\u201d Mr. Cook said ata conference in China in late 2017. Making Apple products requires state-of-the-art machines and lots of people who know how to run them, he said.\n\u201cIn the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d he said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d\nKristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the company was \u201can engine of economic growth in the United States\u201d that spent $60 billion last year with 9,000 American suppliers, helping to support 450,000 jobs. Apple\u2019s Texas manufacturer, Flextronics, did not respond to requests for comment.\nMr. Cook helped lead Apple\u2019s shift to foreign manufacturing in 2004, a move that cut costs and provided the enormous scale necessary to produce some of history\u2019s best-selling tech products.\nApple contracted much of the work to enormous factories in China, somestretching miles and employing hundreds of thousands of peoplewho assemble, test and package Apple products. That assembly includes parts made around the world \u2014 from Norway to the Philippines to Pocatello, Idaho \u2014 that are shipped to China.\nThe final assembly is the most labor-intensive part of building the iPhone, and its location often determines a product\u2019s country of origin for tariffs.\nMr. Cook often bristles at the notion that iPhones are Chinese-made. Apple points out that Corning, at a factory in Kentucky, makes many iPhone screens and that a company in Allen, Tex., makes laser technology for the iPhones\u2019 facial-recognition system.\nMr. Cook has also disputed that cheap labor is the reason Apple is still in China. But it doesn\u2019t hurt. The minimum wage in Zhengzhou, China,home of the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, is roughly $2.10 an hour, including benefits. Apple said the starting pay for workers assembling its products there was about $3.15 an hour. Compensation for similar jobs in the United States is significantly higher.\nWhile it was one of Apple\u2019s most powerful computers, the American-made Mac Pro also turned out to be one of its most expensive.\nChinese suppliers shipped their components to Texas. But in some cases, the Texas team needed new parts as designs changed, and engineers who were tasked with designing the computer found themselves calling machine shops in central Texas.\nThat is how they found Stephen Melo, the owner and president of Caldwell Manufacturing in Lockhart. Employees of Flextronics, the company hired by Apple to build the computers, in turn hired Caldwell to make 28,000 screws \u2014 though they would have liked more.\nWhen Mr. Melo bought Caldwell in 2002, it was capable of the high-volume production Apple needed. But demand for that had dried up as manufacturing moved to China. He said he had replaced the old stamping presses that could mass-produce screws with machines designed for more precise, specialized jobs.\nMr. Melo thought it was ironic that Apple, a leader in offshore manufacturing, had come calling with a big order. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to invest for that in the U.S. because that stuff is purchased very cheaply overseas,\u201d he said.\nHe made do with his new machines, although he could not make the exact screws Apple wanted. His company delivered 28,000 screws over 22 trips. Mr. Melo often made the one-hour drive himself in his Lexus sedan.\nA former Apple manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Flextronics team had also been far smaller than what he typically found on similar Apple projects in China. It was unclear exactly why the project was understaffed, the manager said, speculating that it was because American workers were more expensive.\nThe manager said similar Apple jobs in China would include a roomful of people working to ensure that all materials were in place for production. In Texas, it was one worker, who often seemed overwhelmed, the manager said. As a result, materials were regularly out of place or late, contributing to delays.\nAnother frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers won\u2019t work around the clock. Chinese factories have shifts working at all hours, if necessary, and workers are sometimes even roused from their sleep to meet production goals. That was not an option in Texas.\n\u201cChina is not just cheap. It\u2019s a place where, because it\u2019s an authoritarian government, you can marshal 100,000 people to work all night for you,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. \u201cThat has become an essential part of the product-rollout strategy.\u201d\nMs. Helper said Apple could make more products in the United States if it invested significant time and money and relied more on robotics and specialized engineers instead of large numbers of low-wage line workers. She said government and industry would also need to improve job training and promote the development of a supply-chain infrastructure.\nBut, she added, there is a low chance of all that happening.\nApple still assembles Mac Pros at the factory on the outskirts of Austin, in part because it has already invested in complicated and custom machines. But the Mac Pro has been a slow seller, and Apple has not updated it since its introduction in 2013.\nIn December, Apple announced that it wouldadd up to 15,000 workers in Austin, just miles from the Mac Pro plant. None of the new jobs are expected to be in manufacturing."

        "title": "Why My Chinese Dad Switched From an iPhone to a Huawei",
        "fulltext": "I got my first iPhone during Chinese New Year in early 2012. It wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d aspired to own. I wasn\u2019t particularly techy, nor could I afford the brand as a graduate with a starting salary.\nBut at a dinner with an old friend of my father\u2019s, the friend gave me, along with other knickknacks, an iPhone 4. My gift came with a caveat, however: It wasn\u2019t the sought-after 4S that had caused a frenzy around the country after its release in January. Mine was a simple iPhone 4 \u2014 released in 2010, and by then considered already past its prime as a formal gift. That meant I was almost certainly a secondary or even tertiary receiver of the phone \u2014 China\u2019s gift-giving culture is all about regifting \u2014 but back then, the Apple brand carried enough cachet that my father\u2019s friend still saw it as good enough to give a close friend\u2019s daughter, if not quite prized enough to present to a business partner.\nThat was back when Apple was stillthephone to own for a Chinese person on the make, and when people like my father and his friends \u2014 mostly older, and in senior positions in large organizations \u2014 were still caught up in the legend of the Apple product, even though most of them, including him, had no idea how to use most of the features. That didn\u2019t matter; it was enough to know that iPhones were \u201cthe best.\u201d Their global reputations came with an assurance of both status and quality.\nWhat\u2019s happened in the interim? A lot. When Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, warned investors on Wednesday that the company was facing slowing sales in China, the wider world seemingly greeted the news that Apple had lost its China mojo with shock. But for those who are smartphone users in China, the news just confirmed what we already knew: China\u2019s domestic brands have made huge strides in the years since 2012, creating new features and products that take into account what Chinese users want, for a small fraction of the price. Apple, meanwhile, has mostly failed to localize or reinvent itself, on the assumption that global cachet would be enough.\nThe homegrown groundswell began with a little-known brand called Xiaomi, which burst onto the scene in the early 2010s as one of the first brands in China to have its own operating system, and offered high-speed processing on the cheap. At first it appeared to cater to a completely different market than Apple. Selling entirely online, Xiaomi offered both a low-end model \u2014 the Redmi for as low as 699 yuan (then under $150) \u2014 and a higher-end model that was still far cheaper than the cheapest iPhone (less than 2,000 yuan, then under $350).\nBut with time, the useful features on Xiaomi products, as well as those of its competitors like Huawei and OPPO, combined with the price, began to outweigh the increasingly limited glamour of the iPhone. I myself transitioned to a high-end Xiaomi from an iPhone in late 2015 after a young professional friend of mine, who worked in marketing in Shanghai, raved about the Xiaomi Mi Note, which is one of the big-screen models, or \u201cphablets,\u201d that have long been popular in China and East Asia, where many prefer the bigger screens \u2014 Huawei\u2019s latest measures a whopping 7.2 inches \u2014 ideal for taking selfies and watching TV dramas. (Apple released its Plus series in late 2014 with larger handsets, whichdidsend itssales shooting up in China\u2014 but also added $100 to an already expensive price tag.)\nApple also long resisted the rise of another important local feature: the dual SIM card system, a component that may sound boring but forChinese people has become essential. In China, where many young people have never owned laptops, phones have become all-in-one devices \u2014 part television, part computer, part phone. Transitioning between two SIM cards on all other cell brands is a seamless process: one card for streaming and downloading at cheaper rates, the other one for making calls. Growing international tourism has also raised demand for phones that can accommodate a second, foreign SIM \u2014 and yet for years, Apple didn\u2019t budge. The company finally gave in to the dual SIM card in the form of specialmodelsfor China and Hong Kong last fall.\nIt\u2019s telling that the main example of Apple localizing its products to China in the last few years was a special model gold-colored iPhone. First introduced in 2013, it was a clear play for the Chinese market, and was, admittedly, a huge hit on the mainland. Many joked that the gold iPhone was targeted at the tuhao, a recent term that roughly translates as \u201ctasteless nouveau riche\u201d and that mockingly refers to the wealthy who feel the need to show off. The color was even given the name tuhao jin, or tuhao gold.\nBut the allure of gold-colored plating \u2014 a feature focused not on user experience but aesthetics \u2014 goes only so far, it seems. And it may not be enough at this point to keep even the tuhao loyal. Huawei, China\u2019s largest smartphone maker by market share, recently overtook Apple to move tosecond place globally. Its popularity among the wealthy and business class at home has shot up in recent years; its prices have been steadily rising as it shifts focus towardhigher-end products. Many upper-middle-class Chinese who once owned iPhones have since switched to Huawei \u2014 including my dad.\nAs China has moved online en masse, it has, perhaps, surprised some analysts who believed that the appeal of high-end brands as status symbols would drive decision-making for years into the future. It turns out that Chinese consumers care about user experience, too (and price, of course).\nBut the iPhone hasn\u2019t lost all of its luster. A civil servant friend of mine was still offered a brand-new iPhone as a \u201cgift\u201d in 2016; I\u2019ve yet to hear of anyone who was bribedwith a Huawei.\nYuan Ren is a writer and producer from Beijing.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."

        "title": "CES 2019: It\u2019s the Year of Virtual Assistants and 5G",
        "fulltext": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The show must go on.\nThat sentiment couldn\u2019t have been stronger this week at CES, the largest consumer electronics convention in the country. The conference, which brought more than 180,000 people to Las Vegas, was a reminder of what the tech industry is best at: being optimistic about itself.\nWho cares about theabysmal stock marketand growing fears that we are slidinginto a recession? Check out these virtual-reality headsets, self-driving cars and big-screen TVs.\nFilippo Yacob, a tech entrepreneur who attended, was blas\u00e9 about the state of the market. \u201cThe speed of progress and innovation happens at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s not like it pulses with the stock market,\u201d said Mr. Yacob, whose company Primo Toys makes tech products for children. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a bullet train.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s event was also slightly larger than the last, with more than 4,500 exhibitors sprawled across 2.7 million square feet. The conference offered a peek at theyear\u2019s hottest tech trends, including artificially intelligent virtual assistants, next-generation wireless networks and connected cars.\nAnd companies unveiled thousands of products. Google and Amazon showed car accessories, alarm clocks and speakers that can be controlled with their virtual assistants by speaking commands like \u201cHey, Google, what\u2019s the weather today?\u201d or \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s my sports update?\u201d\nLG lured attendees into its giant booth with televisions that can be rolled up as if they wereyoga mats.\nWireless carriers and chip makers highlighted 5G, the next-generation cellular networkarriving this yearin a small number of cities with data speeds so zippy that devices can download an entire movie in seconds.\nThe most surprising news came when a host of tech companies announced they were working with Apple to bring some of the company\u2019s content and virtual assistant capabilities to their devices.\nVizio, the TV maker, said its newer TVs would work with AirPlay, an Apple software feature for streaming video and audio content from an iPhone or Mac to a television screen. People will be able to speak to Siri on their iPhones to play content they had purchased from iTunes on the Vizio TVs. Samsung, Sony and LG announced similar partnerships with Apple.\nIn the past, AirPlay and iTunes videos were mostly tied to Apple-made hardware like the Apple TV set-top box. Their expansion to third parties underlines Apple\u2019s ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services. That\u2019s especially important now that sales of Apple\u2019s cash cow, the iPhone, are slowing. This month, the companyreduced its revenue expectationsfor the first time in 16 years.\nThe move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by Apple to open its technology to other companies, including competitors like Samsung.\nIn a statement provided by Samsung, Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, said that with the expansion of iTunes and AirPlay, \u201ciPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home.\u201d\nFront and center at CES was the battle between virtual assistants \u2014 namely Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with Assistant, including smart watches, speakers and displays. The company said a billion devices now work with its assistant, up from 400 million last year. Google wants to make the Assistant the focal point of a consumer\u2019s life: in the home, in the car and on mobile devices.\n\u201cWhen I walk down the aisle at Home Depot,will all the devices I might buywork with the Assistant?\u201d Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant, said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d\nAmazon also had a large presence at the show. It filled a large conference room at the Venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with Alexa, including an Audi car, a motorcycle helmet and a stereo system.\nThe battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices. Many of the smart gadgets at CES worked with multiple virtual assistants.\nAaron Emigh, chief executive of Brilliant, which makes smart home products that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together, not against one another, because the smart home was already too complex, with products like light switches, thermostats and cameras coming from different brands.\n\u201cThe more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home, the more important that it all works together,\u201d he said.\nCar manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and 5G wireless connections. But consumers won\u2019t be able to buy self-driving vehicles from a dealership anytime soon, in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars. Smarter cars with features like built-in voice assistants to help people use maps, play music or get a sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now, however.\nIf the economy does cool off, sales of cutting-edge gadgets will drop. Fast. But that didn\u2019t faze people here. None of the CES attendees I spoke to expressed concern.\nMatt Strauss, who oversees Comcast\u2019s Xfinity internet and cable service, was especially bullish about the year ahead. He said just about everything announced at CES required an internet connection, so that\u2019s the last thing that people would cut off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become like oxygen,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHello, It\u2019sErin Griffith, reporting, happily, from my home base in San Francisco and not the carnival of virtual assistants, shiny screens, crowded smart homes and greasy VR demos in Las Vegas. Our correspondents made the CES maze of gadgets lookalmost fun, which anyone who has been there before knows is an impressive feat.\nBack in the land of magical, billion-dollar start-up unicorns, things have been quieter, thanks to the federal government shutdown. No Securities and Exchange Commission means no progress on initial public offering plans of the larger start-ups, including Uber and Lyft.\nAny other time in the last five years, this would not have mattered. The unicorns have been putting off their public market debuts for as long as possible \u2014 what\u2019s another month or two? But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panic.\nAsThe Times reported in December, Uber and Lyft already accelerated their I.P.O. plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift. This week, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, tempered expectations,telling The Wall Street Journalthat market turbulence was not likely to affect the company\u2019s plans, but \u201cif it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nUber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year, he added.\nThe shutdown, volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment. The start-up world\u2019s success hinges, in part, on its ability to use hype and \u201ctrust me\u201d confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation, disruption and rising valuations (and ignore the lack of profits).\nBut not everyone has, and skeptics are getting louder. Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capital investor,recently calledthe entire start-up and venture capital system a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201can enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi scheme.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right in one sense: A Ponzi scheme relies on its creator\u2019s ability to persuade ever-larger crowds to buy into his or her vision. Same goes for start-ups that haven\u2019t proved they\u2019re able to turn a profit. A flash of doubt, especially among public-market investors, could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire start-up ecosystem.\nFor the largest, most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public, there could not be a worse moment for that to happen. If Uber can\u2019t go public, what does it mean for all the \u201cUber for X\u201d companies that followed its lead?\nCracks are beginning to show. This week, two high-flying start-ups experienced a reality check in their fund-raising. WeWork sought to raise $16 billion in new funding from SoftBank, its main backer. The companywound up raising just $2 billion\u2014 still an enormous pile of cash, but a steep step down from its original plan.\nAnd Bird, a two-year-old scooter company that was so sought-after by investors last summer that they doubled the company\u2019s valuation in just a few weeks, is now raising funding at a flat valuation, according toAxios.\nSome venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn, as Iwrote this week. They\u2019re hoarding cash and making \u201cdownturn lists\u201d of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable. And some companies have seen the venture-fueled madness and decided it\u2019s not for them.\nElsewhere this week:\n\u25a0 Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy. No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy, with concerns spreading to non-tech companies including Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany,Matt Phillips writes.\n\u25a0 Apple\u2019s biggest issue is not the Chinese economy, it\u2019s that people like the columnistKevin Roose\u2019s motherdon\u2019t feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore.\n\u25a0 That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies, including Vizio, Samsung, Sony and LG, to use its software. The deals \u2014 something the company has resisted in the past \u2014 show Apple\u2019s ambition to make more money from content and services, as sales of its cash cow, the iPhone, slow down,Brian X. Chen writes.\n\u25a0 When the government asked Palantir and Oracle to share the number of women and minorities it employs, the companies tried to hide the numbers, citing them as \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d According to areport from Reveal News, the numbers are abysmal. (Palantir has no female executives and just one female manager.) The publication sued to obtain the letters the companies sent justifying their privacy around the issue. The Palantir letter cited fears that competitors would steal their lone female manager."

Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m Sheera Frenkel, your friendly cybersecurity reporter.\nI\u2019m writing from a sunny and glorious San Francisco while the world\u2019s elite share deep thoughts in snowy Davos, Switzerland, at an annual gathering of the rich and powerful.\nExecutives from Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple wined and dined with the elected officials and regulators who are responsible for holding their companies to account. A lot is at stake. The European Union is looking to enforce its new privacy regulations, and in the United States the Federal Trade Commission is expected to round out its investigation of Facebook within the next month or so.\nOther countries are also exploring regulation. Our colleagues at Davos reported that on Wednesdayleaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germanyissued a call for global oversight of the tech sector.\nIn the next year, important elections will be held in countries including India, Indonesia, Ukraine and Israel. Everyone will be watching to see whether social media is rife with false news and disinformation, and the tech companies will have a chance to show that they\u2019ve changed for the better.\nIf the last week was any indication, things aren\u2019t looking great.\nEveryone was reminded of the power of social media to divide when a video showing a confrontation in Washington between a group of high school students and a Native American protester went viral.\nThe minute-long video, which was first posted by a Twitter account called @2020fight, initially inspired outrage among liberal groups that believed the students were intimidating and mocking the protester.\nBut within two days, another version of the video, which showed the protester intentionally walking into the group of students, had appeared. Conservative groups took to Twitter to claim that the students, not the protester, were the victims. They called on celebrities and prominent journalists to apologize to the students, and a group of lawyersannouncedthat it would sue popular figures who had tweeted defamatory statements about the incident.\nDays later, people were still fighting about the video on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the cable networks. The account that started it all \u2014 along with many that helped amplify it \u2014 remains anonymous.\nMy colleague Kate Conger and Ireported Wednesdaythat lawmakers were asking Twitter for more information about the accounts. There is concern that the accounts that amplified the tweet were foreign (read: Russian) and looking to stir discord among Americans. Twitter said it was investigating. So far, it appears that at least the original poster, @2020fight, is American.\nThe account was suspended by Twitter. But what, at least under Twitter rules, did it do wrong? Many people on Twitter use fake names; many more use fake photos. Neither practice is explicitly against Twitter\u2019s rules, and in many ways the account used Twitter for exactly what the platform was designed to do \u2014 to make something go viral.\nThere\u2019s a question of whether that is good for any of us, or whether, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo succinctly put it in his column this past week,the answer is to \u201cNever Tweet.\u201d\n\u25a0 Twitter wasn\u2019t the only company to have a bad week. French regulators announced thatthey had fined Google 50 million euros, or about $57 million, for not properly disclosing how it collected data about its users across its services. Adam Satariano wrote that it was the largest penalty of its kind levied by the European Union, which last year adopted a sweeping new data privacy law known as theGeneral Data Protection Regulation.\n\u25a0 In Australia,a sweeping new lawgives local law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech companies like Apple to create tools, known as back doors, that would circumvent the encryption they built into their products.\nMy colleague Nellie Bowles reported that the law\u2019s impact could be felt globally. If Apple were to build a back door for iPhones, law enforcement in other countries, including the United States, could ask to use the same tool.\nThe debate about back doors to encryption has been raging for years. Tech companies argue that they encrypt devices to protect users. The police say they need access to devices, especially phones, to do their jobs.\n\u25a0 In other news about our dystopian future, Cade Metz wrote about start-ups that are turning high-altitude surveillance into alucrative business. Using cameras, sensors and inexpensive satellites, the companies are selling insights gleaned from those devices to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge.\n\u25a0 Karen Weise wrote about howAmazon is building a huge businessout of knowing everything you buy. Amazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy. It knows how often you buy it, where you ship it to and what you are most likely to buy next.

        "fulltext": "Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email?Sign up here.\nHigh-level delegates from Beijing and Washington are meeting near the White House today for the first of two days of trade talks, but appear to have a great distance left to bridge.\nEach government has reason to play nice. Evidence is mounting that reciprocal tariffs are hurting both sides, and global markets have been skittish while awaiting a deal.\nBut there are signs that China isunwilling to bendon key U.S. demands involving intellectual property and technology transfer, even as its lawmakersaccelerated a voteon legislation addressing foreign investors\u2019 concerns.\nA pair of indictments revealed earlier this week against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei couldcomplicate the discussions, as could disagreements over strategy within the Trump administration\u2019s team.\nOther factors include:\nWeakness in the Chinese economy.At least 20 companies reported yesterday that their 2018 earnings wouldfall short of expectations. The Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, Ford Motor\u2019s primary partner in China, warned of a profit slumpof as much as 93 percentlast year. China Life Insurance said its net income may have fallen as much as 70 percent. And Chinese exporters suffereda sluggish startto 2019.\nSlowing Chinese investment abroad.Net purchases of U.S. commercial real estate by Chinese companies \u2014 big buyers earlier in the decade \u2014 have slipped to theirlowest level since 2012.\nWorries to the west.The motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said that tariffs \u2014 along with other shifts in its business \u2014 left it barely breaking even in the final quarter of 2018. In the European Union, there are concerns whatever happens: If China and the U.S. reach a deal, Mr. Trump might turn his attention to German cars and French wines. If not, China might dump discounted goods into the European market. \u201cWe arenext in the queue,\u201d said William De Vijlder, the chief economist at BNP Paribas.\n____________________________\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.\n____________________________\nThe Trump administration\u2019s growth forecastis much rosier than those of economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, who warn that growth is slowing and put some of the blame on the government, writes the NYT\u2019s Jim Tankersley.\nPresident Trump\u2019s team has predicted that inflation-adjusted growthwill average 3 percent through 2024. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and trade policies were working as expected:\n\u201cLast year looked just like we thought, so we don\u2019t think, going into our next forecast, that there\u2019s a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things.\u201d\nAn exceptional year:Growth appears to have exceeded 3 percent in 2018, the first time it has done so in a decade. But many economists attribute that to a burst of fiscal stimulus that isn\u2019t expected to be repeated.\nGrowing consensus:The Congressional Budget Officepredicted that growth would slowto 2.3 percent this year and then to 1.7 percent in 2020. Economists at the Fedalso forecast 2.3 percent growththis year. Some corporate financial executivesare bracing for a recession.\nMore Fed news:Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has taken a conversational tone in public comments, butthe markets didn\u2019t understand. Investors face three outcomes if the Fed is done raising interest rates, andnone of them are good.\nApple reported yesterday that it had flat profit and lower revenue in the fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season. After years of expansion, the tech giantappears to be entering a period of vulnerability, writes the NYT\u2019s Jack Nicas.\nDiminishing demand:The company has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, but they haven\u2019t had the global impact of the iPhone. That wasa drag on the company\u2019s earnings.\nSlowdown in China:Apple is uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as topotential tariffs on Chinese-made products.\nSecurity concerns:Customers saida flaw in the iPhonelet people eavesdrop on phone calls. The problem was in the FaceTime app, which Apple promised to fix by the end of the week, but it has beencriticized for moving too slowly. A lawyer in Houstonsued Apple over the glitch.\nMore Apple news:Shares ralliedafter the company outlined plans for life beyond the iPhone. And it plans tolower prices on some phonesoutside U.S. to offset a strong dollar.\nPacific Gas and Electric filed for a corporate reorganization on Tuesday that \u201cis shaping up to beone of the most complicated and difficult in recent years,\u201d writes Ivan Penn.\nFacing tens of billions of dollars in claims related to 17 major wildfires in California in 2017, with its equipment under investigation in several other blazes last year, PG&E decided to declare bankruptcy despite havinga stable income stream and several offers of financing.\nNow creditors and suppliers of the state\u2019s largest utilitywill face offagainst California officials and fire victims to be paid, while renewable energy companies and climate change activists jockey for position. Lawyers, bankers and consultants are likely to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\nThis is PG&E\u2019ssecond bankruptcyin less than 20 years; the first came after California tried to deregulate utilities. Dan Reicher, who was an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration, called it \u201ca real mess,\u201d adding:\n\u201cIt comes down to lots of needs: Take care of the fire victims, keep the lights on, ensure progress on climate change and protect ratepayers.

        "title": "American Companies Need Chinese Consumers",
        "fulltext": "In a rare bit of bad news for its investors, Apple last week laid the blame forlower than expected revenue on its performance in China. The news sent Apple\u2019s stock price plunging, and investors also ditched other companies with significant exposure in China. The scale of the damage, both to Apple\u2019s bottom line and to the broader market, underscores how critically important China \u2014 and Chinese consumers \u2014 have become for American companies.\nChina accounts for about $52 billion in sales for Apple, and is its third-largest market. Apple is not the only technology company that relies on sales in China. For Qualcomm, a chip maker whose technology is used in many Apple smartphones, the figure is $15 billion, or about 65 percent of its total sales, according to an estimate by FactSet. Others with big bets on China include Intel (24 percentof sales), Micron Technology (51 percent), and Texas Instruments (44 percent).\nThese numbers make it very clear that the perception of China as the \u201cfactory of the world,\u201d flooding global markets with cheap goods, is badly out of date. Exports and capital investments such as buildings and roads are no longer the main engines of China\u2019s growth. Exports have dropped from 36 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product in 2006 to 20 percent in 2018. Going after China\u2019s exportswith tariffs, as the Trump administration is attempting,is, to a certain extent, fighting yesterday\u2019s war.\nIn recent years, China\u2019s economy has shifted to one that is much more dependent on domestic household consumption \u2014 ordinary Chinese people buying things for themselves and their families. In China over the last decade, the growth in private consumption has outpaced overall economic growth rate. In 2018, G.D.P. in China grew by 6.5 percent, and household consumption accounted for about four-fifths of that growth.\nChina is now the fastest-growing consumer market in the world, with private consumption amounting to about $5 trillion, more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s total. Competition for Chinese consumers\u2019 hard-earned renminbi has become intense.\nConsider the smartphone market. As recently as 2016, Apple was China\u2019s leading maker of handsets. But by the third quarter of 2018, China\u2019s dominant telecommunications company, Huawei, was on top, with 23 percent of the market.The Chinese smartphone makers Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomioccupy the next three spots, while Apple ranked fifth, with 9 percent. South Korea\u2019s Samsung, the global leader in smartphone sales, has all but disappeared from China, having failed to recover from the fiasco over its dangerously overheating Galaxy Note 7 batteries.\nEven industries where American consumers once reigned supreme are now increasingly shifting toward China. General Motors, for example, sells more cars in China than in North America. For global filmmakers, box office sales in 2018 totaled about $9 billion in China, compared with almost $12 billion for North America in 2018.\nMy company made a decision more than a decade ago not to invest in China\u2019s export sector. Costs for Chinese manufacturers are rising, and prices for their exports are flat or falling. Instead, I feel strongly that there is much greater potential for companies \u2014 inside and outside China \u2014 that cater to the Chinese consumer market.\nYes,China\u2019s economic growth has begun to slow, and there has been a decrease in investments as Beijing has moved to tighten credit. And the threat of a trade war with the United States is real. But my long-term outlook has not changed. The Chinese consumer market will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, and it will continue to be a market that any global company must pay serious attention to if it wants to remain competitive.\nSo where does this leave companies like Apple that find themselves caught in the middle of the trade war? They must hope, first of all, for a swift conclusion to the latest round of trade negotiations between China and the United States,which began in Beijing on Monday. The best possible outcome is a deal that will encourage China to open its economy further, commit to shrinking its bloated state-owned sector and ease barriers to further foreign investment and trade.\nTariffs were supposed to hurt China by hitting its exports to the United States. That hasn\u2019t happened. Should it persist, the trade war will, of course, hurt Chinese companies, just as it has already hurt so many American companies. But if the conflicteventually drags down Chinese consumer demand, businesses all over the world will be the losers.\nWeijian Shan is chairman and chief executive of PAG, a private equity firm based in Hong Kong, and the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cOut of the Gobi: My Story of China and America.\u201d\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."

        "title": "He Reported on Facebook. Now He Approaches It With Caution.",
        "fulltext": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nYou\u2019ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people\u2019s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?\nI\u2019m not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting onhow tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can \u2014 which is not very well.\nMost of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as theadvertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.\nI use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google\u2019s operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I\u2019ve turned offlocation trackingfor almost all of the apps I use, and I\u2019ve tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.\nFor search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I\u2019m doing.\nDespite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable. (I\u2019m thinking of going back toFirefox.)\nSo what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I\u2019ve turned off \u2014 or \u201cpaused\u201d \u2014 all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users\u2019 browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I\u2019ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.\nFor all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I\u2019m missing. And that\u2019s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.\nHave you changed your use of social media after writing about some of thedata practices of Facebook?\nWhen I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google \u2014 and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.\nThat\u2019s partly because I don\u2019t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it\u2019s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don\u2019t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don\u2019t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.\nThe social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it\u2019s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in \u2014 once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife\u2019s phone \u2014 I\u2019m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.\nIs deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?\nNot in the slightest.\nIt may interfere with Facebook\u2019s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do.\nDeleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about\u201cshadow profiles\u201d\u2014 dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.\nWhat are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter?\nI don\u2019t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It\u2019s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection.\nWhen I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I\u2019ve also used tools at theNational Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site calledCitizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It\u2019s basically Google for \u201cdark money.\u201d\nMore recently, I\u2019ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you\u2019re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted \u2014 often information that is otherwise not public.\nThe most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.\nIf you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?\nI\u2019m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it\u2019s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way.\nThe privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I\u2019ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it\u2019s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.\nI\u2019ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer \u2014 and probably more stringent \u2014 laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.\nOutside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?\nWe\u2019re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don\u2019t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don\u2019t actually like.\nSonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can\u2019t I just play my songs directly from my phone\u2019s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)\nI\u2019ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter\u2019s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.\nI have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it\u2019s New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me. We cook a lot but don\u2019t havean Instant Pot. Don\u2019t @ me."

The company attributed its $5 billion shortfall to the sharp decline in iPhone sales in China. That spurred larger fears about the lagging Chinese economy \u2014 and whether it\u2019s pulling American companies down with it. Apple\u2019s stock fell 10 percent after its announcement, its worst one-day slide in six years, and suppliers that manufacture iPhone partstook a beatingas well.

More hints and insights may come this Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee publishes economic projections and the minutes fromits December meeting.

        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 To most Americans, the names are unfamiliar, maybe a little hard to pronounce: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.\nThey are China\u2019s biggest smartphone brands. Around the world \u2014 although not in the United States \u2014 they are making the handset business brutally competitive. This week, after Apple warned ofdisappointing iPhone sales in China, industry observers said that devices from the Chinese brands were a major culprit.\nAs the phone market in China reaches saturation and sales shrink over all, the country\u2019s hardware makers are pushing hard, and increasingly winning fans, in places like France, Germany, India and Southeast Asia, where consumers find that the phones can do just about everything an iPhone can do at a fraction of the cost.\nApple sits comfortably atop the market in many countries, including China, for thehighest-end handsets. But companies like Huawei have started to do elsewhere what they have done in China, competing with the iPhone on experience and value and luring customers with price comparisons that make them rethink buying Apple\u2019s signature product.\nThe cost difference is notable: In China, an iPhone XR starts at around $950, while Huawei\u2019s top-end handsets start at about $600, and Xiaomi\u2019s comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around $1,250.\nCompanies like Huawei and Oppo have made improvements in features and overall quality that are enticing many wealthy Chinese people, said Mo Jia, an analyst in Shanghai for the technology research firm Canalys. Chinese brands\u2019 aggressive marketing and sales campaigns in Europe indicate that the companies believe consumers there who have traditionally used iPhones will do the same thing.\n\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t happen this year or next year,\u201d Mr. Jia said. \u201cBut Huawei is going in that direction.\u201d\nIn its pursuit of the European market, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d), which has its headquarters in Shenzhen and is now the world\u2019s No. 2 seller of smartphones, has gone far beyond the phone store. Huawei has sponsored summer concerts in Greece, teamed up withLithuania\u2019s basketball federationand backed a\u201cChina Festival\u201din Cologne, Germany. Vivo sponsored last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia.\nXiaomi (pronounced \u201cSHAO-mee\u201d), which is based in Beijing and was founded in 2010, seemingly came out of nowhere to become the No. 4 mobile brand in Europe early last year,according toCanalys. The gadget maker has also become the top seller of phones in India, in part by opening hundreds of stores in rural areas.\nCl\u00e9ment Blaise, a 25-year-old banker in northern France, has an iPhone for work and a Xiaomi as a personal phone. He said he needed to recharge the Apple device \u201call the time\u201d but could go two days without charging his Xiaomi.\n\u201cWe have this false, preconceived idea that Chinese brands are not as good, that their products are of cheap quality,\u201d Mr. Blaise said. \u201cBut the price gap leavens the fears. For 150 euros\u201d \u2014 around $170 \u2014 \u201cwhat do you risk anyway?\u201d\nChinese phone makers have not made similar inroads in the United States. The American government has worked for years to stymie the sale of Huawei\u2019s smartphones and telecom-network equipment, after a congressional inquiry in 2012 deemed Huawei a potential vehicle for cyberspying by the Chinese government. The Trump administration has urged Western allies to do the same.\nSecurity concerns have not dissuaded some buyers across the Atlantic. Giannis Vassilopoulos, a college student in Athens, said he had been bombarded by Huawei ads during his recent travels around Europe. He said he had bought a Huawei phone because the brand felt more familiar, more European even.\n\u201cSeeing Huawei in the middle of London makes it look immediately more Western,\u201d he said.\nApple still has a hold on consumers in many places.Announcing the sales slumpin China this week, the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said Apple expected to set revenue records in wealthier countries like Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and Spain and in some emerging markets like Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Vietnam.\nIn China, though, Apple\u2019s market share has been declining, and the company is clinging to theNo. 5 spotin smartphone shipments, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nChina became the world\u2019s largest smartphone market over the past decade as rising incomes coincided with an explosion in mobile technology.\nPeople in China rely on handsets in an all-encompassing way, using them to rent bikes, sign into gyms and pay restaurant bills. The market is increasingly saturated, and there are fewer people in China who do not have an advanced device. But there are also new economic reasons to buy locally made goods: Consumers who are replacing or looking to upgrade are dialing back in light of China\u2019s slowdown.\nToday, mainland China\u2019s top smartphone seller is Huawei, whose handset line includes midrange devices and higher-end models withall the latest features. Vivo and Oppo, brands owned by the same Chinese parent company, are next. And then comes Xiaomi, whose phones, smart home devices and even sneakers command apassionate fan base.\nSamsung of South Korea, which sells more smartphones globally than any other brand, has only around 1 percent of the market in China.\nFeng Yin, a 32-year-old engineer, has an iPhone now, but he is considering switching to a Huawei device.\n\u201cIn the past few years, the technology in Apple\u2019s phones has not had any big breakthroughs, while the technology in domestic phones has gotten better and better,\u201d he said while browsing in a Huawei store in Shanghai on Friday. \u201cThe difference is getting smaller.\u201d\nApple products have long been seen in China as conferring on their owners the ultimate in cachet and cool. But Chinese companies have used slick marketing and celebrity endorsements in hopes of giving their products more personality, while promoting advances in camera technology, battery life and microchips.\nOn Friday, Xian Longfei, a restaurant chef, and a friend were at an Oppo store in Shanghai. When it comes to cellphone brands, Mr. Xian, 35, has tried many: Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and three different iPhone models. He switched to an Oppo a few months ago.\nHe acknowledges that Apple\u2019s devices still seem better on the whole. But so many of his friends in Shanghai and people in his hometown are Oppo users. And the price \u2014 around $400 on sale \u2014 was hard to beat.\nAlso, he said, holding up his pink handset, \u201cthe form factor is pretty.\u201d\nAnother factor working against Apple in China is the dominance of WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than a billion people. It works on Google\u2019s Android operating system as well as Apple\u2019s, making a phone\u2019s software less of a differentiating factor.\n\u201cWhy would people pay such a high price for an iPhone,\u201d asked Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst for the industry research firm IDC, \u201cif, from a hardware perspective, there isn\u2019t much of an upgrade from Huawei and, from a platform perspective, there\u2019s nothing to lock people in?\u201d\nIn Europe, buyers of Chinese brands describe undergoing a sort of conversion. Irritating flaws in their iPhone or Samsung devices lead them to seek alternatives. Presented with unfamiliar Chinese products, they initially have doubts. But after a while, they get hooked.\nWhen Alessandro Del Mastro, 33, bought a Huawei handset in southern Italy three years ago, he was skeptical.\n\u201cMy friends teased me that it was not going to last, like most Chinese products, but we were all wrong,\u201d he said.\nFaruk Kaya uses an Apple iPhone and tablet but, as a salesman at a Berlin electronics store, he encounters German customers who prefer Chinese brands.\n\u201cNow you can get a smartphone with the best photo and audio quality for about half the price of an iPhone or a Samsung,\u201d he said.\nGregory Lauseiro, a telecom executive in Paris, bought his eighth Huawei phone last summer. He has turned his 56-year-old aunt, Christine Jankowski, into a believer, too.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really worried about the fact that it was a Chinese brand,\u201d Ms. Jankowski said of her Huawei phone. She added: \u201cWe know that they make amazing technological products.\n\u201cIf I had to buy a Chinese frying pan, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a phone?\u201d"
