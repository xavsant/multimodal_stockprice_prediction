        "title": "The End of CNN+",
        "fulltext": "Yesterday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it wasshutting down CNN+, the extensively hyped but extremely short-lived streaming service. It will close on April 30, for a total run of less than five weeks. \u201cWell, that was fast,\u201dsaidScott Galloway, a professor who was planning to host a CNN+ show on business. Quibi, the ill-fated video platform that was streaming\u2019s previous cautionary tale, lasted seven months.\nMore than 300 employees work at CNN+, and the network said it would try to transfer them to open positions in the company. Layoffs are likely for the rest. The news came days afterNetflix saidit expected to lose two million subscribers this quarter, raising doubts about the increasingly crowded field of streaming services,The Times\u2019s Michael Grynbaum, John Koblin and Benjamin Mullin write.\nWhere did it all go wrong?CNN sunk $300 million into the streaming service,according to The Wall Street Journal, hiring big-name anchors, including the former \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace and the former NPR host Audie Cornish. CNN+ carried only unique programming to avoid running afoul of CNN\u2019s agreements with cable carriers. In the end, it drew far fewer viewers than expected. It also had a powerful skeptic: Discovery C.E.O. David Zaslav, who earlier this month became the head of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery, becoming the new owner of CNN after its parent, WarnerMedia, was sold by AT&T.\nSome of the reasons for a shutdown have to do with the reality of mergers.The fact that CNN\u2019s management pushed forward with the launch of CNN+ instead of waiting for the OK from its new corporate leaders appears to have ruffled feathers. Last week, on the first business day of Discovery\u2019s ownership of WarnerMedia, marketing of CNN+ was suspended. (Zaslav has promised $3 billion in cost savings from the merger.) In a meeting with CNN+ staff yesterday, Chris Licht, CNN\u2019s incoming president, compared the service to a residential property that had been constructed without the input of its intended owner. \u201cThen the new owner came in and said: \u2018What a beautiful house! But I need an apartment,\u2019\u201d he said, according to a recording reviewed by The New York Times.\nWhat comes next?The shutdown raises questions for other media companies looking to start streaming services. The Warner Bros. Discovery chiefs appear to believe the future of streaming is in all-in services. The company seems likely to merge a CNN offering with its other subscription platforms \u2014 Discovery+ and HBO Max \u2014 creating one giant streaming service. \u201cThis back and forth is the talk of the media biz right now,\u201dwrote Brian Stelter,CNN\u2019s own media critic, in his newsletter yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s likely going to become a business school case study.\u201d\nJay Powell signals that the Fed could raise rates rapidly starting next month.A half-point increase\u201cwill be on the table for the May meeting,\u201d the Fed chair said yesterday, as the central bank tries to reduce inflation by \u201cmoving a little more quickly.\u201dStocks droppedon his comments.\nFrench prosecutors issue an international arrest warrant for Carlos Ghosn.The former head of Nissan and Renault, who has been living as a fugitive in Lebanon since his high-profile escape from Japanese authorities in 2019,is suspected ofchanneling millions of euros in Renault funds for his personal use, including the purchase of a 120-foot yacht.\nPhiladelphia ends its indoor mask mandate after four days.It had become the first major American city to reinstate an indoor mask mandate in response to rising cases, but said yesterday thatthe mandate would be liftedbecause the numbers seemed to be plateauing. The rapid U-turn comes amidlegal wrangling at the federal levelover mask mandates and debate aboutthe effectiveness of masking rulesin general.\nJanet Yellen calls for a reshaping of global supply chains that are \u201cnot secure.\u201dThe Treasury secretary said that trade relationships should beoriented around \u201ctrusted partners,\u201deven if it meant higher costs for businesses and consumers.\nFacebook is reportedly reviewing whether Sheryl Sandberg violated company policy.According to The Wall Street Journal, she contacted the digital edition of The Daily Mail in 2016 and in 2019 to head off the publication of an article about her boyfriend at the time, the Activision Blizzard C.E.O. Bobby Kotick.\nElon Musk said yesterday that he hadcommitments worth $46.5 billionto finance his proposed bid for Twitter. In a filing that detailed the funding, he also said that he was exploring whether to launch a hostile takeover for the social media company. The details put more pressure on Twitter\u2019s board to take his offer seriously, after his initial bare-bones bidwas received skeptically by Wall Street.\n\u201cIt\u2019s serious,\u201d saidSteven Davidoff Solomonof the U.C. Berkeley School of Law. \u201cHe\u2019s getting more professional and this is starting to look more like a normal hostile bid.\u201d\nWhat we know:Morgan Stanley and a group of other lenders are offering $13 billion in debt financing and another $12.5 billion in loans against Mr. Musk\u2019s stock in Tesla. A dozen banks are offering those loans at a 20 percent loan-to-value ratio, which implies that Musk is pledging more than $60 billion in Tesla stock as collateral, a significant chunk of his holding in the electric car company.\nWhat we don\u2019t know:Musk\u2019s funding plan also includes $21 billion in equity financing, and analysts question whether he is willing to put up this cash on his own. Private equity firms are wary of getting involved in a bitter takeover battle, The Timespreviously reported, potentially ruling out a number of partners. \u201cWho will be willing to cut 10- and 11-figure checks to participate in Elon\u2019s Big Adventure if that adventure is going to be a bare-knuckles brawl?\u201d wrote Don Bilson, an analyst at the research firm Gordon Haskett. Twitter\u2019s shares remain well below Musk\u2019s offer price, suggesting that markets remain unconvinced of the takeover\u2019s prospects.\nMusk is really into the letter \u201cX.\u201dThe shell companies created as part of his proposed takeover of Twitter are called X Holdings I, X Holdings II and X Holdings III. Then there\u2019s X.com, an online banking start-up that Musk founded in 1999 and that later became part of PayPal; Tesla\u2019s Model X S.U.V.; and X, the nickname of one of his children. Musk responded to an emailed request from The Times for comment on his funding plans and naming conventions by writing, simply, \u201cX.\u201d\n\u2014 Former President Barack Obama,delivering a speech in Silicon Valleycalling for tougher regulation of social media companies that have \u201cturbocharged\u201d political polarization in the U.S. Fierce lobbying by Big Tech has helpedthwart attempts by Congress to pass legislationreining in the industry. Meanwhile, Europe is taking action: The E.U. could announcea deal today on a landmark lawaddressing social media\u2019s societal harms.\nCompanies have a history of monitoring employees\u2019 time spent at work by default (key-card swipes) or with intent (keyboard-monitoring software). This knowledge has new power as many workers are being asked to return to the office for at least a few days a week after a long period working remotely.\nBosses are grappling with whether to track attendanceto ensure that workers are coming to the office when directed, or to keep trusting that they will do their work, wherever they are,The Times\u2019s Emma Goldberg and DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch report.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to be monitoring if people are showing up to work,\u201d said Jenae Kaska, the head of employee experience at SmartRecruiters, whose London employees are expected to come into the office on Thursdays. Managers at the software company can use data from their desk reservation system to follow up with employees who don\u2019t show up.\nAt Goldman Sachs, data on workers\u2019 badge swipes has been discussed during the company\u2019s weekly meeting of investment bank managers, people familiar with the situation told DealBook.

        "title": "Lockdowns in China Block Truck Shipments and Close Factories",
        "fulltext": "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s mounting Covid-19 restrictions are creating further disruptions to global supply chains for consumer electronics, car parts and other goods.\nA growing number of Chinese cities are requiring truck drivers to take daily Covid P.C.R. tests before allowing them to cross municipal borders or are quarantining drivers deemed to be at risk of infection. The measures have limited how quickly drivers can move components among factories and goods from plants to ports.\nShanghai and other major Chinese cities have imposed lengthy, stringent lockdowns to try to control Covid outbreaks. Previous interruptions in the supply of goods from Chinese factories to buyers around the world mainly involved the temporary closure of shipping ports, includingin Shenzhenin southeastern China in May and June last year and thennear Shanghailast summer.\n\u201cThe problem is not ships \u2014 it\u2019s that there\u2019s no cargo coming because there are no trucks,\u201d said Jarrod Ward, the chief East Asia business development officer in the Shanghai office of Yusen Logistics, a large Japanese supply chain management company.\nThe testing of truck drivers has been held up because some cities are doing mass testing of residents. Shanghai tested essentially all 25 million people within its borders in a single day on Monday and detected another 21,000 cases on Thursday.\nNow, there is an acute shortage of truck drivers in Shanghai and in nearby cities like Kunshan, a center of electronics production. Many electronics components manufacturers are shutting down in Kunshan.\n\u201cThe key electronics suppliers to Apple, to Tesla, they\u2019re all based there,\u201d said Julie Gerdeman, the chief executive of Everstream, a supply chain risk management affiliate of DHL that is based in San Marcos, Calif.\nApple declined to comment, and Tesla had no immediate reply to questions.\nMany factories have tried to stay open by having workers stay on site instead of going home. Employees have been sleeping on mats on the floor for as long as four weeks in some cities in northeastern China. Companies have been storing goods in nearby warehouses while waiting for normal truck traffic to resume.\nBut as lockdowns stretch on in cities like Shanghai, Changchun and Shenyang, factories are starting to run out of materials to assemble. Some are sending their workers home until further notice.\nMaking car seats, for example, requires different springs, bolts and other materials. Mr. Ward said car seat producers had run out of components. Volkswagen said it had closed a factory outside Shanghai.\nWhile Shanghai\u2019s cases increase, its main rival in electronics manufacturing, Shenzhen, has emerged from lockdown. That is freeing workers and factories there to resume full-speed production.\nRetailers and manufacturers in the West tried to adapt to previous supply chain difficulties in China by switching from ships to airfreight, but airfreight rates have more than doubled from last year.\nThe near-total suspension of passenger flights in and out of Shanghai has roughly halved the airfreight capacity there, said Zvi Schreiber, the chief executive of Freightos, a freight booking platform. The war in Ukraine has forced many airlines to schedule longer flights around Russia and Ukraine, which means each plane can make fewer trips in a week and often can carry less weight on each flight.\nThe war in Ukraine is also starting to hurt the availability of Soviet-era Antonov freighters, Mr. Schreiber said. These workhorses of the airfreight industry have been kept going in recent years almost entirely by Ukrainian maintenance bases that are now closed.\nFor companies, any additional disruptions to the global supply chain would come at a particularly fraught moment, on top of rising prices for raw materials and shipping, along with extended delivery times and worker shortages."

        "title": "You\u2019re Still Being Tracked on the Internet, Just in a Different Way",
        "fulltext": "Theinternet industry shudderedlast year whenApple introduced privacy measuresfor the iPhone that threatened to upend online tracking and cripple digital advertising. Google pledged similar privacy actions.\nBut in less than a year, another type of internet tracking has started taking over. And it is having the unintended effect of reinforcing the power of some of tech\u2019s biggest titans.\nThe shift suggests that gathering people\u2019s online data fortargeted advertisingis not going away. That has implications for how companies make money online and how the internet operates. It also underlines the advantages built up by some of the largest digital platforms.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve entrenched their own power,\u201d Eric Seufert, a media strategist and the author of Mobile Dev Memo, a blog about mobile advertising, said of Apple and Google.\nFor years, digital businesses relied on what is known as \u201cthird party\u201d tracking. Companies such as Facebook and Google deployed technology to trail people everywhere they went online. If someone scrolled through Instagram and then browsed an online shoe store, marketers could use that information to target footwear ads to that person and reap a sale.\nBut that kind of invasive tracking is being scaled back or blocked by Apple and Google to protect people\u2019s privacy. Last April, Apple introduced a feature so iPhones users could choose not to be followed by different apps. Google also announced a plan todisable the tracking techin its Chrome web browser by 2023 and said it was working to limit data sharing on Android phones.\nNow tracking has shifted to what is known as \u201cfirst party\u201d tracking. With this method, people are not being trailed from app to app or site to site. But companies are still gathering information on what people are doing on their specific site or app, with users\u2019 consent. This kind of tracking, which companies have practiced for years, is growing.\nIn other words, Google is accumulating data on its own users\u2019 search queries, location data and contact information. Pinterest is doing the same with its users on its site and app, while TikTok is gathering information on the people who are on its app. TheNew York Timesalso does first-party tracking.\nThe rise of this tracking has implications for digital advertising, which has depended on user data to know where to aim promotions. It tilts the playing field toward large digital ecosystems such as Google, Snap, TikTok, Amazon and Pinterest, which have millions of their own users and have amassed information on them. Smaller brands have to turn to those platforms if they want to advertise to find new customers.\nMany small businesses already appear to be spending less on digital ads that rely on third-party data, such as Facebook and Instagram ads, and are reallocating marketing budgets to platforms with lots of first-party information, like Google and Amazon.\n\u201cAnybody who is in their right mind and wants to reach a large audience still has to go to them,\u201d Douglas C. Schmidt, a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University who researches digital privacy, said of the big tech sites.\nConsiderStoggles, a company in Pasadena, Calif., that sells fashionable protective eyewear online. The firm, which spends about $250,000 a month on online advertising, has long earmarked roughly 80 percent of its marketing budget to buying Facebook and Instagram ads to identify new customers, said Max Greenberg, one of the founders of Stoggles.\nBut after Apple made its privacy changes, Stoggles trimmed its spending on Facebook and Instagram ads to 60 percent of its budget, Mr. Greenberg said. The company instead bought more Google search ads, Amazon ads to reach shoppers and ads on TikTok to appeal to young people.\n\u201cThe days of supercheap and very targeted online marketing are over,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cWe need to experiment with other platforms.\u201d\nSome tech companies said they did not consider the monitoring, collecting and storing of data on their own users to be tracking. Gathering such first-party information, they said, is the digital equivalent of a supermarket\u2019s keeping tabs on customers in its store and using that data to persuade businesses to advertise or offer coupons.\nGoogle and Apple said the shift was not a way to strengthen their own standings. Apple said it had to follow the same rules as everyone else. Google said it had pledged to regulators that it would not adopt privacy measures that gave itself an edge. It also said it was working on software to help advertisers and website publishers that did not have access to first-party data.\nTheoretically, Facebook and Instagram would also benefit because they have plenty of first-party data. But their parent company, Meta, has had trouble navigating the transition. In February, the company said it expected tolose $10 billion in sales this yearbecause of Apple\u2019s privacy measures.\nTo adapt, Meta has hired hundreds of engineers towork on new ad-targeting systemsthat do not rely on following people across the internet. It has also asked small businesses to share information about their customers with it to improve the performance of its ads.\nLandon Ray, the chief executive ofOntraport, a software company that works with small businesses, said Meta had circulated a presentation to Ontraport\u2019s clients in recent months encouraging them to share their customer information with it.\n\u201cThe idea is that if everybody does this, then Facebook would once again have all that data that they needed,\u201d Mr. Ray said.\nIn a statement, Meta said that the effort was not a way to evade Apple\u2019s privacy rules and that advertisers must get permission from their users to share data with it. It added that it had created the program before Apple\u2019s changes and that Google and Snap did similar things. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, has said his company expects to benefit from the tracking changes in the long run.\nWhile Meta adjusts, some small businesses have begun seeking other avenues for ads. Shawn Baker, the owner of Baker SoftWash, an exterior cleaning company in Mooresville, N.C., said it previously took about $6 of Facebook ads to identify a new customer. Now it costs $27 because the ads do not find the right people, he said.\nMr. Baker has started spending $200 a month to advertise through Google\u2019s marketing program for local businesses, which surfaces his website when people who live in the area search for cleaners. To compensate for those higher marketing costs, he has raised his prices 7 percent.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending more money now than what you had to spend before to do the same things,\u201d he said.\nOther tech giants with first-party information are capitalizing on the change. Amazon, for example, has reams of data on its customers, including what they buy, where they reside, and what movies or TV shows they stream.\nIn February, Amazon disclosed the size of itsadvertising business\u2014 $31.2 billion in revenue in 2021 \u2014 for the first time. That makes advertising its third-largest source of sales after e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon declined to comment.\nAmber Murray, the owner of See Your Strength in St. George, Utah, which sells stickers online for people with anxiety, started experimenting with ads on Amazon after the performance of Facebook ads deteriorated. The results were remarkable, she said.\nIn February, she paid about $200 for Amazon to feature her products near the top of search results when customers looked up textured stickers. Sales totaled $250 a day and continued to grow, she said. When she spent $85 on a Facebook ad campaign in January, it yielded just $37.50 in sales, she said.\n\u201cI think the golden days of Facebook advertising are over,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cOn Amazon, people are looking for you, instead of you telling people what they should want.\u201d"

        "title": "Etsy and the Sameness of Internet Fights",
        "fulltext": "This week, thousands of people who sell goods on Etsy aregoing on strike to protest the company\u2019s climbing fees. And what seems to be a fight over a small corner of the internet is really one of the most enduring battles over our digital world.\nEtsy is one of the zillion internet businesses that bring together people with something to sell and those who might be interested in taking them up on the offer. For their role connecting the two sides, these middlemen collect a fee that might be 15 to 30 percent of each sale. (Etsy charges much less.)\nTechies call these marketplaces, and they are everywhere. Most of Amazon\u2019s e-commerce sales come from fees that the company charges the independent merchants whose cat toys and phone chargers we find and purchase on Amazon. Apple\u2019s app store, Airbnb, restaurant delivery apps and Uber are also marketplaces that match customers with people offering apps, homes for rent, restaurant meals or a ride to the airport.\nIt is a constant of the digital world that thesemiddlemen are hated by the people and businesses that rely on them. Almost always, at least someapp developers,restaurants, Etsy dog portrait creators,Substack newsletter writersand other marketplace sellers believe that the fees are too high, the rules aren\u2019t fair, they\u2019re being mistreated \u2014 or all of the above.\nIt\u2019s possible that these conflicts are inevitable. In 2022, running your own business almost always means leaning ontech middlemen that make your business possible, but can also make it harder.\nLook, I want to acknowledge that in this Etsy dispute \u2014 as with Apple developers\u2019fury at the companyand Amazon merchants\u2019unhappiness with sellingon the vast digital mall \u2014 both sides have a point.\nIt\u2019s undeniable that Etsy, Amazon and Apple do a lot of work for the people who sell stuff through them. Without Etsy, people who make dog portraits would have to try to set up their own websites or stores and hunt for customers on their own, and deal with tasks like processing credit cards and providing customer service.\nEtsy does all that for them, in return for a fee that is increasing to 6.5 cents on each dollar of sales from what has been 5 cents. The merchants who are fighting Etsy have other disagreements with the company, too, including that it effectively punishes solo business owners if they can\u2019t reply right away to potential customers, and that the company requires sellers to pay to advertise their products on sites like Google, Pinterest and Facebook that nibble more into their income.\nEtsy hassaidthat some of the company\u2019s approaches might be unpopular right now, but that they will benefit sellers in the long run.\nSometimes those gripes can feel whiny or abstract to us, but put yourself in the shoes of those Etsy sellers, the restaurants selling food through the Grubhub app, or businesses making apps for iPhones.\nThey love being able to find a bunch of customers in one place, but might resent that Etsy, Grubhub and Apple dictate so much of how they conduct their business, take a big chunk of their money, and grow more powerful off their work.\nThese disagreements reverberate into the prices that we pay, and they are high stakes for the millions of people trying to make a living from doing what they love.\nOne question that always gets asked about disputes over marketplaces iswhat is a fair feefor them to charge people offering an Uber ride or selling a dog portrait. But I also wonder if the imaginative technology industry hasn\u2019t been imaginative enough about hunting for alternative ways of making money.\nAlmost all marketplaces charge a commission and often other fees when we buy something.Even in the metaverse, apparently, companies will still make money by collecting a commission from the people selling virtual reality doodads. Is there another way, and would it be better?\nA couple of years ago, an investment analyst with Goldman Sachs suggested that rather than fighting developers who might resent paying up to 30 percent on the sales of a digital weapon in an iPhone game, Apple could recoup its costs for supporting the app economy in a different way. The analyst, Rod Hall, proposed that developers instead pay for some or all of the Apple technologies that developers use to create iPhone apps and distribute them.\nThat approach definitely would create a whole new set of problems. And it doesn\u2019t address the complaint of iPhone developers or those protesting Etsy sellers that love having one central place to sell their stuff, but hate the ways those marketplaces have so much power over how they run their businesses.\nThere are no magical balms for the internet\u2019s enduring fights over middlemen like Apple and Etsy. But I appreciated Hall\u2019s attempt to reimagine how marketplaces earn income. It feels as if we could use more experiments to try to bring peace to one of the internet\u2019s most enduring disputes.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nUkraine said that it stopped an attempted Russian cyberattack on the country\u2019s power grid.My colleague Kate Conger writes that the disclosure of the sophisticated cyberattack raises fresh concerns that Russia\u2019s governmentmight step up its use of digital weapons in Ukraineand potentially in the United States.\nRelated:Russia\u2019s tech industryfaces a brain drain as thousands of workers flee the country.

        "title": "As Europe Approves New Tech Laws, the U.S. Falls Further Behind",
        "fulltext": "In just the last few years, Europe has seen a sweeping law foronline privacytake effect, approved far-reaching regulations tocurb the dominanceof the tech giants and on Saturday reached a deal on new legislation to protect its citizens from harmful online content.\nFor those keeping score, that\u2019s Europe: three. United States: zero.\nThe United States may be the birthplace of the iPhone and the most widely used search engine and social network, and it could also bring the world into the so-calledmetaverse. But global leadership on tech regulations is taking place more than 3,000 miles from Washington, by European leaders representing 27 nations with 24 languages, who have nonetheless been able to agree on basic online protections for their 450 million or so citizens.\nIn the United States, Congress has not passed a single piece of comprehensive regulation to protect internet consumers and to rein in the power of its technology giants.\nIt\u2019s not for lack of trying. Over 25 years, dozens of federal privacy bills have been proposed and then ultimately dropped without bipartisan support. With every major hack of a bank or retailer, lawmakers have introduced data breach and security bills, all of which have withered on the vine. A flurry of speech bills have sunk into the quicksand of partisan disagreements over freedoms of expression. And antitrust bills to curtail the power of Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, have sat in limbo amid fierce lobbying opposition.\nOnly two narrow federal tech laws have been enacted \u2014 one for children\u2019s privacy and the other for ridding sites of sex-trafficking content \u2014 in the past 25 years.\n\u201cInertia is too kind of a word to describe what\u2019s happened in the United States; there\u2019s been a lack of will, courage and understanding of the problem and technologies,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a public interest group. \u201cAnd consumers are left with no protections here and lots of confusion.\u201d\nThe prospects that any legislation will pass imminently are dim, though regulations at some point are almost inevitable because of the way tech touches so many aspects of life. Of all the proposals currently in front of Congress, an antitrust bill that would bar Apple, Alphabet and Amazon from boosting their own products on their marketplaces and app stores over those of their rivals has the best shot.\nA co-author of the bill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said Democratic leaders had promised it would go to a vote by this summer. But even that bill, with bipartisan support, faces an uphill climb amid so many other priorities in Congress and a fierce tech lobbying effort to defeat it.\nIf history is a guide, the path toward U.S. tech regulation will be long. It took decades of public anger to regulate the railroads through the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. It took nearly 50 years from the first medical reports on the dangers of cigarettes to the regulation of tobacco.\nThere\u2019s no single reason for the sludge of progress in Congress. Proposals have been caught in the age-old partisan divide over how to protect consumers while also encouraging the growth of business. Then there are the hundreds of tech lobbyists who block legislation that could dampen their profits. Lawmakers have also at times failed to grasp the technologies they are trying to regulate, turning theirpublicfoiblesover tech into internetmemes.\nTech companies have taken advantage of that knowledge blind spot, said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I call the \u2018big con,\u2019 where the tech companies spin a story that they are doing magic and that if Washington touches their companies with regulations they\u2019ll be responsible for breaking that magic,\u201d he said.\nIn the vacuum of federal regulations, states have created a patchwork of tech rules instead. California, Virginia, Utah and Colorado have adopted their own privacy laws. Florida and Texas have passed social media laws aimed at punishing internet platforms for censoring conservative views.\nAmazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft said they supported federal regulations. But when pressed, some of them have fought for the most permissive versions of the laws that have been under consideration. Meta, for instance, has pushed forweaker federal privacy legislationthat would override stronger laws in the states.\nTech\u2019s lobbying power is now on full display in Washington with the threat of the antitrust bill from Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa. The proposal passed its first hurdle of votes in January, much to the tech industry\u2019s surprise.\nIn response, many of the tech companies mobilized an extensive lobbying and marketing campaign to defeat the bill. Through a trade group, Amazon claimed in television and newspaper ads that the bill would effectively end its Prime membership program. Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, wrote in ablogpost that the legislation would \u201cbreak\u201d popular products and prevent the company from displaying Google maps in search results.\nMs. Klobuchar said the companies\u2019 claims were hyperbole. She warned that by fighting the proposal, tech companies might be choosing the worse of two difficult options.\n\u201cThey are letting Europe set the agenda on internet regulation,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cAt least we listened to everyone\u2019s concerns and modified our bill.\u201d\nThe inaction may appear surprising given that Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly in lock step over how tech companies have morphed into global powerhouses.\n\u201cConsumers need confidence that their data is being protected, and businesses need to know they can keep innovating while complying with a strong, workable national privacy standard,\u201d said Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. \u201cThe U.S. cannot afford to cede leadership on this issue.\u201d\nLawmakers have also forced many tech chief executives \u2014 including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta \u2014 to testify multiple times before Congress in recent years. In some of those televised hearings, lawmakers of both parties have told the executives that their companies \u2014 with a combined $6.4 trillion in market value \u2014 aren\u2019t above government or public accountability.\n\u201cSome of these companies are countries, not companies,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said in a January antitrust hearing, adding that they are \u201ckilling fields for the truth.\u201d\nBut so far, the talk has not translated into new laws. The path to privacy regulations provides the clearest case study on that record of inaction.\nSince 1995, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a dozen privacy bills for internet service providers, drones and third-party data brokers. In 2018, the year Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation took effect, he proposed a bill to require a consumer\u2019s permission to share or sell data.\nMr. Markey also tried twice to update and strengthen privacy legislation for youths following his 1998 law, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act.\nWith every effort, industry lobbying groups have denounced the bills as harmful to innovation. Many Republican lawmakers have opposed the proposals, saying they don\u2019t balance the needs of businesses.\n\u201cBig Tech sees data as dollar signs, so for decades they\u2019ve bankrolled industry lobbyists to help them evade accountability,\u201d Mr. Markey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a breaking point.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Oct. 30\nOct. 31\n4,140\n4,150\n4,160\n4,170\n4,180\n4,190\nData delayed at least 15 minutes\nSource: FactSet\nBy: Ella Koeze\nStocks slid on Tuesday, adding to a losing streak that has April shaping up to be Wall Street\u2019s worst month in two years.\nThe S&P 500 fell 2.8 percent, bringing its losses for the month to 7.8 percent. The index is on track for its worst monthly decline since March 2020, when stocks plunged 12.5 percent as the coronavirus spread around the world, prompting lockdowns and halting economic activity.\nThe steady drop \u2014\u00a0with only six days of gains in April \u2014\u00a0has come as investors have confronted a long list of fears: that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates far more quickly than economists had anticipated; that rising prices and wages could erode corporate profits; and that renewedlockdowns in Chinacould become another drag on the global economy.\nEarlier this month, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth would slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That was before a new Covid outbreak in Beijing raised concerns about more restrictions in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, where cities like Shanghai have already been under lockdown for weeks.\n\u201cChina slows down the rest of the world if it shuts down,\u201d said Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. \u201cIf China shuts down, that could shut down commerce, and that slows down overall global demand.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, technology stocks led the retreat on Wall Street, ahead of earnings reports from Alphabet, Microsoft and \u2014 later in the week \u2014 Meta, Amazon and Apple. Shares of all five companies were lower. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted toward tech, fell about 4 percent.\nAlso lower were shares of Tesla, which fell more than 12 percent. The company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, may have to sell a big chunk of his stock in the carmaker to fund his takeover of Twitter. He has pledged$21 billionin cash as part of the deal, in addition to loans. Tesla\u2019s shares are often more volatile than those of other large companies, and they can weigh on the broader S&P 500 when they fall because of the company\u2019s huge valuation.\n\u201cTesla investors are worried that Musk might spend too much time trying to fix the social media giant\u2019s problems, and that will take away his laserlike focus in winning the electric vehicle race,\u201d said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA.\nAmong the worst performers in the S&P 500 was General Electric, which fell 10.3 percent after it said its outlook for the year was \u201ctrending toward the low end\u201d of its previous forecast for profits and listed nearly every one of Wall Street\u2019s concerns as a factor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing increased pressure from inflation, renewable energy and the Russia-Ukraine war,\u201d H. Lawrence Culp Jr., the company\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, when explaining the outlook. \u201cWe\u2019re also watching to evolving areas, namely additional supply chain pressure and recent Covid impacts in China.\u201d\nConcerns over an economic slowdown in the United States and abroad have weighed on investors\u2019 minds all month. Already, companies and consumers have borne higher costs for goods and transportation, with inflation reaching8.5 percentin the year through March.\nBut the conflict inUkraineand the shutdowns in China have also triggered volatility in energy markets, with crude oil surging in early March before retreating slightly in April. That has spilled over into the stock market, too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a pendulum going back and forth,\u201d said Ms. Greene. \u201cWe go from saying oil prices are too high to saying we\u2019re going to see oil prices come down because we don\u2019t have the demand we thought we would see.\u201d\nFutures for Brent crude, the international standard, were up about 2.5 percent on Tuesday to about $105 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, for June delivery was up 3.2 percent to $101.70 a barrel.\nInvestors are also contending with the Fed\u2019s approach toward raising interest rates in the coming months in efforts to cool down inflation. Although Wall Street was already pricing in several rate increases this year, Fed officials have adopted amore aggressivetone this month about their willingness to raise rates quickly to try and stem inflation, and analysts are worried that the central bank could tip the economy into a recession.\n\u201cThe only way to cool off inflation will be to destroy demand and raise unemployment,\u201d said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as simple as raising rates as the markets are expecting.\u201d\nMohammed Hadicontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s growth slows, but still beats Wall Street\u2019s expectations.",
        "fulltext": "After a year of blistering sales growth, Apple showed that it has a more resilient business than many of its tech peers, even though it cooled off in the first three months of the year.\nThe company reported on Thursday that profit rose 6 percent to $25 billionin its second fiscal quarter, a slowdown from the double-digit growth in each of the previous five quarters.Sales increased 9 percent to $97.29 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations, as pandemic-fueled purchases of iPads and Macs slowed from a year earlier.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, cautioned investors about the months ahead, telling Wall Street analysts that an accelerating Covid outbreak in China will curtail demand and impair production of iPhones, iPads and Macs. He said the supply-chain troubles are expected to reduce sales in the current quarter by $4 billion to $8 billion.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing a reasonable job currently navigating what is a challenging environment,\u201d Mr. Cook said, noting that \u201calmost all\u201d of the factories Apple relies on in the Shanghai region have restarted production.\nThe company\u2019s shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading, giving up much of Apple\u2019s gains earlier in the day.\nTheresults added to a week of uneven financial reports from leading technology companies that have struggled to sustain last year\u2019s explosive growth. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook\u2019s parent, Meta, hadreported profit declinesfrom a year earlier, whileMicrosoft posted an increasein profit.\nThe pandemic has been a double-edged sword for Apple. Remote school and work spurred demand for computing equipment, and government stimulus checks and cutbacks in travel and leisure spending provided a jolt to the company\u2019s all-important iPhone business, analysts said. But those same forces sowed supply-chain problems, triggering a global chip shortage that has cost Apple billions of dollars in missed sales.\nIn addition to highlighting the challenges it faces in China, Apple said total revenue in the current quarter will be crimped by its decision to stop selling products in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Apple counts on Russia for 1 percent of its sales and a slightly larger percentage of its profit, analysts estimate.\nDuring the January-to-March quarter, sales of iPhones, iPads and other devices rose 6.6 percent to $77.5 billion, Apple said.\nThe bigger problem for Apple may come in the months ahead as economic strains from the war in Ukraine spill into Europe, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. \u201cPeople are on edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re paying more for fuel. If you live in Germany, does that affect your decision to buy the next iPhone?\u201d\nTo diversify beyond device sales, Mr. Cook has pushed an increasing array of software and services across Apple products worldwide. Last year, people sequestered at home splurged on apps, video games and subscriptions such as HBO Max. But amid the return to work and school, Apple said, sales growth in its so-called services business slowed, recording $19.82 billion inrevenue during the quarter.\nThe company said it would increase its cash dividend to shareholders by 5 percent and increase its share repurchases by $90 billion."

        "title": "Apple Store workers in Atlanta are the first to formally seek a union.",
        "fulltext": "Employees at an Apple store in Atlanta filed a petition on Wednesday to hold a union election. If successful, the workers could form the first union at an Apple retail store in the United States.\nThe move continues a recent trend of service-sector unionization in which unions have won elections atStarbucks,AmazonandREIlocations.\nThe workers are hoping to join the Communications Workers of America, which represents workers at companies like AT&T Mobility and Verizon, and has made a concerted push into the tech sector in recent years.\nThe union says that about 100 workers at the store \u2014 at Cumberland Mall, in northwest Atlanta \u2014 are eligible to vote, including salespeople and repair technicians, and that over 70 percent of them have signed authorization cards indicating their support.\nIn a statement, the union said Apple, like other tech employers, had effectively created a tiered work force that denied retail workers the pay, benefits and respect that workers earned at its corporate offices.\nWorkers said they loved working at Apple but sometimes felt they were treated like second-class employees. \u201cWe want equal to what corporate actually gets,\u201d said Sydney Rhodes, an employee at the store who is involved in the union campaign.\nMs. Rhodes, who has worked at Apple for four years, said that she and many of her co-workers hoped to continue working for Apple for years to come but that it was often unclear how they could progress within the company. \u201cAnother reason why we're working toward this union is for a more clear and concise way to grow, especially internally,\u201d she added.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company offered strong benefits, including health care coverage, tuition reimbursement and paid family leave, and a minimum pay rate of $20 per hour for retail workers.\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have incredible retail team members, and we deeply value everything they bring to Apple,\u201d the spokesman said, but declined to comment on the union effort. The company would not say whether it would recognize the union voluntarily.\nOfficials at the National Labor Relations Board will next determine whether there is sufficient interest among workers to hold an election \u2014 the bar is officially 30 percent \u2014 and set the terms for a potential vote. Both the union and the employer will have an opportunity to weigh in on the details, including the universe of employees eligible to take part and whether the vote should occur by mail or in person.\nOther unions, most notably Workers United, an affiliate of the giant Service Employees International Union that has led the organizing campaign at Starbucks, are also seeking to unionize Apple retail workers, of which there are tens of thousands in the United States.\nWorkers at an Apple Store at Grand Central Terminal in New York City have begun to sign authorization cards that could lead to a filing for a union vote that would allow them to join Workers United. The move wasreported over the weekendby The Washington Post.\nActivism and labor organizing at Apple have been building since last summer, when discontent over the company\u2019s plan to require employees to return to the officesnowballed into a broader movement, called #AppleToo. That movement aimed to highlight workplace problems like harassment, unequal pay and what workers described as a culture of secrecy that pervaded the company.\n\u201cApple workers across every line of business and around the world are using their voices to demand better treatment,\u201d Janneke Parrish, one of the #AppleToo leaders, said of the union effort. Ms. Parrish has saidApple fired her in retaliationfor her organizing. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see workers taking this big step to stand up for their rights,\u201d she said. Apple has disputed Ms. Parrish\u2019s accusations.\nThe #AppleToo movement included retail workers, who have said throughout the pandemic that Apple did not do enough to keep them safe from the coronavirus.\nRetail workers\u2019 complaintsescalated late last year when the Omicron variant spread rapidly throughout the country andat least 20 Apple stores had to closetemporarily as a precaution or because so many of their workers had become infected that the stores could no longer operate. On Christmas Eve, several dozen Apple workers walked off their jobs to demand better pay and working conditions.\nMs. Rhodes said that the effort at her store began in earnest last fall, and that her co-workers had taken encouragement from the union campaigns at companies like Starbucks and Amazon.\nBeyond its overtures at Apple, the communications workers union has had a presence at Google in recent years, helping workers form a so-called solidarity orminority unionthat enables them to coordinate actions without holding a union election and seeking certification from the labor board. Companies are not required to bargain with minority unions, as they are with more formal unions.\nThe union also recently won a vote to represent about one dozen retail employees at Google Fiber stores in Kansas City, Mo., who are formally employed by a Google contractor. It isseeking to representa few dozen Wisconsin-based quality assurance workers at the video-game maker Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft isacquiring, pending approval from regulators."

        "title": "Welcome Back to the Office. Isn\u2019t This Fun?",
        "fulltext": "When Google employees returned to their mostly empty offices this month, they were told to relax. Office time should be \u201cnot only productive but also fun.\u201d Explore the place a little. Don\u2019t book back-to-back meetings.\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to attend the private show by Lizzo, one of the hottest pop stars in the country. If that\u2019s not enough, the company is also planning \u201cpop-up events\u201d that will feature \u201cevery Googler\u2019s favorite duo: food and swag.\u201d\nBut Google employees in Boulder, Colo., were still reminded of what they were giving up when the company gave them mouse pads with the image of a sad-eyed cat. Underneath the pet was a plea: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to RTO, right?\u201d\nR.T.O., for return to office, is an abbreviation born of the pandemic. It is a recognition of how Covid-19 forced many companies to abandon office buildings and empty cubicles. The pandemic proved that being in the office does not necessarily equal greater productivity, and some firmscontinued to thrivewithout meeting in person.\nNow, after two years of video meetings and Slack chats, many companies are eager to get employees back to their desks. The employees, however, may be not be so eager for a return to morning commutes, communal bathrooms and daytime outfits that are not athletic wear.\nSo tech companies with money to burn and offices to fill are rolling out the fun wagon, even as they make clear that in many cases returning to the office \u2014 at least a few days a week \u2014 is mandatory.\nLizzo will perform for Google employees this month at an amphitheater near the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When Microsoft reopened its offices in Redmond, Wash., in late February, employees were treated to music from local bands, beer and wine tasting, and even classes for making terrariums.\nTo mark its first official week back at the office, the chip maker Qualcomm helda happy hourwith its chief executive, Cristiano Amon, at its San Diego offices for several thousand employees with free food, drink and T-shirts. The company also started offering weekly events such as pop-up snack stands on \u201cTake a Break Tuesday\u201d and group fitness classes for \u201cWellness Wednesday.\u201d\n\u201cThese celebrations and perks are a recognition by companies that they know employees don\u2019t want to come back to the office, certainly not as frequently as before,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school. At least for now, he added, companies are opting for the carrot over the stick: rewarding workers for coming into the office rather than punishing them for staying home.\nBefore Covid struck, the biggest technology firms committed billions of dollars to erect offices that are marvels of architecture and trophies of financial success. Those gleaming offices, packed with amenities and perks, are a testament to the long-held belief that in-person collaboration is still better for fostering creativity, inspiring innovation and instilling a common sense of purpose.\nBut for many employees who enjoyed the freedom of working remotely, the return to office \u2014 no matter how fancy \u2014 carries a touch of end-of-summer, back-to-school dread. Few, it seems, are keen on going back five days a week.\nOn Memegen, an internal company site where Google employees share memes, one of the most popular posts was a picture of a company cafeteria with a caption: \u201cRTO is just bumping into each other and saying \u2018we must grab lunch soon\u2019 until one of you quits Google.\u201d\nNick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who surveys 5,000 workers every month, said most wanted to return to the office two or three times per week. One-third never want to return to the office and prefer to remain remote.\nJust by eliminating the office commute, Mr. Bloom said, the average worker will save one hour a day, so \u201cyou can see why employees are not going to start coming to work for free bagels or to play Ping-Pong.\u201d The main draw for heading to the office, according tothe surveys, is that employees want to see colleagues in person.\nAfter a number of postponements, Google kicked off its hybrid work schedule on April 4, requiring most employees to show up at U.S. offices a few days a week. Apple started easing staff back to the office on Monday, with workers expected to check in at the office once a week at first.\nOn March 31, David Radcliffe, Google\u2019s vice president of real estate and workplace services, sent an email to San Francisco Bay Area employees saying the company wanted to make the return to office \u201ctruly special.\u201d\nFor years, Google has provided employees with Wi-Fi-equipped luxury buses to make commutes more productive and comfortable, but it\u2019s going a step further. It is starting a program toreimburse $49 monthly leases for an electric scooteras part of its transportation options for staff. Google also plans to also start experimenting withdifferent office designsto adapt to changing work styles.\nWhen Microsoft employees returned to their offices in February as part of a hybrid work schedule, they were greeted with \u201cappreciation events\u201d and lawn games such as cornhole and life-size chess. There were classes for spring basket making and canvas painting. The campus pub transformed into a beer, wine and \u201cmocktail\u201d garden.\nAnd, of course, there was free food and drink: pizzas, sandwiches and specialty coffees. Microsoft paid for food trucks with offerings including fried chicken, tacos, gyros, Korean food and barbecue.\nUnlike other technology companies, Microsoft expects employees to pay for their own food at the office. One employee marveled at how big a draw the free food was.\nThe challenge for companies, Mr. Bloom said, is how to balance flexibility in letting workers set their own schedule with a more heavy-handed approach of forcing them to come in on specific days to maximize the usefulness of office time.\nHe said companies should focus on developing the right approach to hybrid work instead of wasting time and effort on showering employees with inducements like private concerts.\n\u201cEmployees aren\u2019t going to come in regularly just for the frills,\u201d Mr. Bloom said. \u201cWhat are you going to do next? Get Justin Bieber and then Katy Perry?\u201d\nFitting of Apple\u2019s more restrained workplace, its employees said they did not expect \u2014 nor had they heard of \u2014 any celebrations for returning to the office. At first, Apple is asking employees to come once a week. By late May, Apple is requiring them to come in on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.\nWhen Apple announced its return-to-office plan last year before another Covid surge forced a delay, more than 1,000 employeessigned a letterurging management to be more open to flexible work arrangements. It was a rare show of dissent from the company\u2019s rank-and-file, who historically have been less willing to openly challenge executives on workplace matters.\nBut as tech companies grapple with offering employees greater work flexibility, the firms are also scaling back some office perks.\nMeta, formerly known as Facebook, told employees last month that it wascutting back or eliminating free serviceslike laundry and dry cleaning. Google, like some other companies, has said it approved requests from thousands of employees to work remotely or transfer to a different office. But if employees move to a less expensive location, Google is cutting pay, arguing that it has always factored in where a person was hired in setting compensation.\nClio, a legal software company in Burnaby, British Columbia, won\u2019t force its employees back to the office. But last week, it gave a party at its offices.\nThere was upbeat music. There was an asymmetrical balloon sculpture in Clio\u2019s signature bright blue, dark blue, coral and white \u2014 perfect for selfies. One of Clio\u2019s best-known workers donned a safari costume to give tours of the facility. At 2 p.m., the company held a cupcake social.\nTo make its work spaces feel more like home, the company moved desks to the perimeter, allowing Clions \u2014 what the company calls its employees \u2014 to gaze out at the office complex\u2019s cherry blossoms while banging out emails. A foosball table was upgraded to a workstation with chairs on either end, \u201cso you could have a meeting while playing foosball with your laptop on it,\u201d said Natalie Archibald, Clio\u2019s vice president of people.\nClio\u2019s Burnaby office, which employs 350, is open at only half capacity. Spaced-out desks must be reserved, and employees got red, yellow and green lanyards to convey their comfort levels with handshakes.\nOnly around 60 people came in that Monday. \u201cTo be able to have an IRL laugh rather than an emoji response,\u201d Ms. Archibald said. \u201cPeople are just excited for that.\u201d\nKaren Weisecontributed reporting."

        "title": "Musk may be about to sell some Tesla stock. How would that affect markets?",
        "fulltext": "When Elon Musk laid out the financing for his bid to buy Twitter, hepromised to put up $21 billion in cash.\nEven for Mr. Musk, who is worth well north of $200 billion, that\u2019s a lot of cash to come up with. Most of his wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and one of the most obvious ways to raise the money would be to sell some of those shares.\nGiven Tesla\u2019s enormous market capitalization and its inclusion in major stock indexes, almost everybody with a 401(k) probably owns some Tesla stock. The potential for Mr. Musk to sell some of his holdings, and spend less time on Tesla as he shifts his focus to Twitter, has raised questions about the outlook for Tesla\u2019s share price. The stock dived 12.2 percent on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 index fell 2.8 percent.\nTesla\u2019s shares have lost about 20 percent of their value since Mr. Musk first revealed that he had bought a big stake in Twitter, kicking off takeover speculation. Jim Cramer, the frenetic host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201daccused Teslaof \u201churting this market pretty badly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s too early to know. Such sales would have to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but those reports are not instantaneous. Sales can take a few days to be made public.\nEven a sale of a huge portion of Mr. Musk\u2019s Tesla stock would be unlikely to affect Tesla\u2019s share price for too long.\nMr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, holding about 17 percent of the company\u2019s shares \u2014 about 175 million shares in total.\nHe would need to sell nearly 24 million shares at Tuesday\u2019s price to generate $21 billion in cash. That\u2019s about an average day\u2019s trading volume for Tesla stock \u2014 a lot, but not enough to overwhelm the market. On Tuesday, about 45 million shares were bought and sold.\nMr. Musk\u2019s financing package for Twitter also includes$12.5 billion in loansusing his Tesla shares as collateral. If Tesla\u2019s stock falls far enough, lenders would require Mr. Musk to add collateral to support the loans, potentially forcing him to sell more stock to come up with the cash.\nMr. Musk has sold off large tranches of Tesla\u2019s stock before. Last year, he sold some 15 million shares, worth more than $16 billion, over two months. Those sales did not appear to measurably drive Tesla\u2019s price down, though it\u2019s unknowable whether the price would have gone up had he not been selling.\nTesla is a component in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite index. In addition to being barometers of how stocks in the United States are performing, both indexes are mirrored by numerous mutual funds that are invested in widely.\nThe S&P 500, considered the benchmark U.S. index, weights companies according to their market value. Tesla, which is worth about $900 billion, is one of the most influential stocks in the index.\nFor every dollar that Tesla\u2019s stock dropped on Tuesday, the S&P 500 lost 0.099 points, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That means the drop in Tesla\u2019s stock accounted for nearly a tenth of the S&P 500\u2019s fall on Tuesday.\n\u201cSo it did have a very large impact,\u201d Mr. Silverblatt said, but \u201cnot the highest.\u201d Apple, with nearly three times the valuation of Tesla, has far more impact. Its stock\u2019s drop of 3.7 percent on Tuesday contributed more to the overall index\u2019s decline.\nTeslais a famously volatile stock. Tuesday\u2019s 12.2 percent fall was its worst daily decline since Sept. 8, 2020, when it shed about 21 percent of its value. But in the past six months, Tesla shares have twice fallen nearly 12 percent, onNov. 9and Jan. 27.\nSome \u2014including Mr. Musk, at times\u2014 have suggested that Tesla is overvalued. Among those who believe in Tesla\u2019s valuation, which is much higher than rival automakers\u2019 relative to the size of its operations, a lot of the argument depends on Mr. Musk\u2019s stewardship. Even Tesla acknowledges this, stating as a riskin its most recent quarterly report: \u201cWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, techno-king of Tesla and our chief executive officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.\u201d\nA lot about Mr. Musk\u2019s plan to buy Twitter is unknown, including how involved he would be. \u201cTesla investors are worried that Musk might spend too much time trying to fix the social media giant\u2019s problems and that will take away his laserlike focus\u201d on Tesla, said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA.\nOr as Mr. Silverblatt put it: \u201cIt\u2019s anticipation of something that hasn\u2019t occurred yet. It will be a while before we know anything.\u201d"
