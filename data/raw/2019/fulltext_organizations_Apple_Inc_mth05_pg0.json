        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\n\u201cThe facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith,wrote in December, when he called for regulation of the technology.\nSan Francisco just put it back in.\nOn Tuesday, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisorsbanned the use of facial recognition softwareby the police and other city agencies in an 8-to-1 vote. Supporters said its use by government was an invasion of privacy incompatible with healthy democracy. Departments will now need to first submit proposals and post public notices to use the technology. Private-sector and federal use isn\u2019t affected.\nThat the ban was introduced by San Francisco, a city pivotal to the development of the technology, was viewed by some as a siren call. \u201cThis is like Detroit banning a certain model of vehicle because it\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d said Alvaro Bedoya, a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cYou may not live in Detroit, but, boy, you\u2019d think twice before getting in that car.\u201d\nExpect more cities to follow: Somerville, Mass., outside Boston, is considering something similar, and Brian Hofer, a paralegal who drafted the San Francisco ordinance, ispushing for other anti-surveillance measuresacross California.\nLike it or not, it\u2019s a rare sign that technologies viewed as threats to citizens\u2019 well-being can be blocked. \u201cThe decision refutes a defeatist and widespread opinion that once a technology is established, you can\u2019t stop it in its tracks,\u201d said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action lawsuit against Apple, giving consumers an opportunity to try to prove that the iPhone maker used monopoly power to raise prices of iPhone apps.\nAs my colleaguesAdam Liptak and Jack Nicas reported, the lawsuit focuses on the fact that Apple charges developers a commission of up to 30 percent for selling products through its App Store, bars them from selling the apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices.\nApple claims that it is a middleman: that customers buy software from the app developers. But the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, said iPhone owners had a \u201cdirect purchaser\u201d relationship with Apple, so they had the right to sue.\nIt\u2019s interesting that the decision went against Apple at all. Liberal jurists often favor antitrust action, and conservatives avoid it. So you\u2019d have expected the verdict to be 5-to-4 in the other direction, along the conservative-liberal line of the Supreme Court.\nBut the new justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, tipped the other way.\nYou could read Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s decision as an indicator that, as people of all political stripes begin to find Big Tech troublesome, conservatives may accept that antitrust could be a useful tool in curbing its power. If that\u2019s accurate, Big Tech should be very concerned.\nIn 2019 there\u2019s little more fashionable than calling for Facebook\u2019s dismantlement.\nThis past week,Senator Kamala HarrisandJoseph R. Biden Jr., two of the Democrats running for president, said it should be considered, joining another, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who hascalled for wider Big Tech breakups. And don\u2019t forget that Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, wrote this month that hewanted its split up, too.\nWe could argue (at length) about the validity of the idea. But howplausibleis it?\nThe weapon of choice behind most of these calls is antitrust law. Fine. There\u2019s plenty of potentially anticompetitive behavior to go after. But in terms of end results, a breakup is possible, but by no means certain, from such legal action, according to antitrust experts I spoke with.\nEiner Elhauge, a Harvard law professor who was chairman of the antitrust advisory committee to the Obama campaign in 2008, told me that splitting WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook \u2014 the most popular proposal \u2014 was plausible but might depend on how deeply integrated they had become.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to unscramble eggs,\u201d he said. And Facebook\u2019s push to intertwine the platforms more closely may make such unscrambling only harder.\nHarry First, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust, said breaking up what then remained of Facebook would be \u201cproblematic and expensive,\u201d making it unlikely.\nMore skeptical was Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, who said that for any antitrust action, \u201cthe remedy has to be applied specifically to the harm; it cannot be a broad remedy.\u201d That means that \u201cit may not even include breaking up the company,\u201d but would instead involve something less severe, like conduct requirements.\nMr. First agreed that injunctions and the formal monitoring of conduct were \u201cmuch more likely\u201d outcomes than a breakup.\nSo if an antitrust argument is used to break up the social network, it\u2019s not guaranteed to have the desired outcome. But, as Mr. First told me, for those who want it, \u201cit\u2019s good to have a goal.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany,signed a nine-point plan with big tech companieslike Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to address extremist and violent content. A notable absence: the United States.\nThe Trump administration cited free-speech protections for not signing, saying that \u201cthe best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.\u201d\nThe same day, the White Houseunveiled a bias reporting toolthat enables people to report, to the government, censorship that they believe is a result of political bias on social networks. That thrusts into the public domain a widely held view among Republicans that platforms like Facebook and Twitter censor conservative viewpoints.\nAs my colleague Kevin Roose pointed out, that looks like asavvy collection tool for voter data. But it\u2019s also an interesting, if not particularly surprising, demonstration of the priorities of the Trump administration.\n\u25a0 Uber bombed its I.P.O.Its fall from a potential $120 billion blockbuster to a much-smaller debut that fell even further was a tale ofmismanaged expectations and slumping confidence in the company\u2019s prospects.\n\u25a0 Nothing is truly secure.Intel\u2019scomputer chips, Microsoft\u2019soperating systemsand WhatsApp\u2019sencrypted messagingwere all shown to contain big security flaws this past week.\n\u25a0The United States is hitting out at Huawei.The Commerce Department put it on a list of firms thatneed special permission to buy American components and technology, which could hamstring its operations.\n\u25a0 Amazon wants to sell ads. Google wants to woo shoppers.Those shared ambitions are putting the tech giantson a collision course.\n\u25a0 Appalachia was supposed to get coding jobs.But the nonprofit organization that promised them, Mined Minds, has since beenaccused of being a fraud.\n\u25a0 Fake news is still very much a thing.Russia and the far right arespreading disinformation ahead of European electionsthis month, and a pro-Iran group has published fake websitesto attack the nation\u2019s adversaries.\n\u25a0 Russia wants you to think that 5G is dangerous,and causes cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.It isn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t.\n\u25a0 Amazon wants its workers to quit.And thenstart their own delivery businessesto distribute its packages with the help of $10,000 start-up grants.\n\u25a0 Brace for more Google ads. In the face of slowing growth, expect to find them onsearch pages, image searches and maps.\n\u25a0 Forget folding-screen phones.Lenovo has a folding-screen laptop.\n\u25a0 Do you still love tech?Despite all its scandal, the tech veteran Paul Fordsays he\u2019s as in love with it as ever."

        "title": "Supreme Court Allows Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple to Proceed",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed an enormous antitrust class action against Appleto move forward, saying consumers should be allowed to try to prove that the technology giant had used monopoly power to raise the prices of iPhone apps.\nThe lawsuit is in its early stages, and it must overcome other legal hurdles. But the case brings the most direct legal challenge in the United States to the clout that Apple has built up through its App Store. And it raises questions about how the company has wielded that power, amid a wave of anti-tech sentiment that has also prompted concerns about the dominance of other tech behemoths such as Facebook and Amazon.\nThe court\u2019s 5-to-4 vote featured an unusual alignment of justices, with President Trump\u2019s two appointees on opposite sides. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in October, wrote the majority opinion, which was also signed by the court\u2019s four more liberal justices. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who joined the court in 2017, wrote the dissent.\nThe class-action lawsuit focuses on the fees that Apple takes on sales in its App Store, which millions of people use every day to download games, messaging apps and other programs. The company charges up to a 30 percent commission to developers who sell their products through its store, bars them from selling their apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices. App makers have long complained that the fee and other practices are unfair.\nOver the years, people and app makers have come to rely on the App Store almost as if it were a utility. The store features more than two million apps,Apple has told the court, and generated more than $26 billion in payments to developers in 2017. More important, the availability of apps transformed the iPhone from merely a phone to the center of our digital lives. Without the App Store, there would be no Uber or Lyft for calling cars, Instagram for sharing pictures and videos, or Postmates for ordering food.\nCompetitors have accused Apple of using the App Store to harm rivals. Spotify, Netflix, Amazon and others have sought to avoid the Apple fee by directing their customers to subscribe to their services directly. But smaller app makers would struggle to make such a move.\nApple has appeared to use its power over the App Store to its advantage in other instances, including amove to restrict or block appsthat provide parental controls or monitor time spent on a phone. Apple\u2019s competitors complained that the company had targeted them after it created its own tool for those tasks. Apple said it removed some of the apps for privacy reasons.\nApple said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident we will prevail when the facts are presented and that the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\u201d\nHow the case unfolds is likely to be closely watched as lawmakers and regulators around the world debate how to rein in the power of tech companies. In the United States,legal scholars have questionedwhether antitrust arguments focused on price are enough to deal with the tech giants and whether antitrust law should take competitive process into account.\nThis year, the music streaming service Spotify fileda complaint with European regulatorsthat accused Apple of using its power over the App Store to harm rivals.\nOther tech powers like Google, Facebook and Amazon have faced antitrust scrutiny for their outsize market shares in areas like internet search, social media and online commerce, but Apple escaped it for years because iPhones make up less than half of the American smartphone market, according to some estimates, and far less in other countries. Instead, Google\u2019s Android software backs most of the world\u2019s smartphones.\nStill, iPhone users spend far more than owners of smartphones running Android, meaning the App Store, which was opened in 2008, has become the dominant marketplace for app makers to reach customers.\nSuccessful antitrust plaintiffs are entitled to triple damages, so the damages could be large if Apple loses the lawsuit. Still, Apple has deep pockets \u2014 it generated $266 billion in sales and $59.5 billion in profit in itslast fiscal year.\nA ruling that forces Apple to reduce its share of app sales is likely to have an even longer-term effect on the company. Apple, which makes most of its sales from iPhones, has tried to shift its business to rely more on revenue from sales of apps and other services. In January, it said it had paid out $120 billion to app makers since 2008, putting its own take from App Store revenue at around $50 billion.\nApple has tried to address some developer concerns about its App Store. In 2016, it announced that it would reduce its take from subscription accounts to 15 percent after the first year.\nThe App Store has also become a major talking point for Apple\u2019s lobbying efforts. The company has called itself \u201cone of the biggest job creators in the U.S.,\u201d citing the number of jobs generated by companies writing software for the App Store. As of 2017, it said, the app industry had generated more than 1.5 million American jobs in software design and development.\nSandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for stronger antitrust enforcement, said the App Store gave Apple too much power over pricing and allowed it to censor content.\n\u201cWhat Apple has done since the launch of the iPhone is tell all iPhone owners and iPhone app developers that if they want to buy and sell apps, they have to go through the App Store,\u201d Mr. Vaheesan said. \u201cSo Apple has set up this app store as a bottleneck where everyone in the iPhone ecosystem must transact.\u201d\nApple shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday, with some investors selling on news of the Supreme Court ruling, as well as therenewed trade war between China and the United States, which poses a risk to the company\u2019s business. Apple relies on China for much of its manufacturing and roughly a fifth of its iPhone sales.\nThe legal question in the case, Apple v. Pepper, was whether the lawsuit was barred by a 1977 decision inIllinois Brick Company v. Illinois, a case that allowed only direct purchasers of products to bring federal antitrust lawsuits. Apple argued that it was an intermediary and so not subject to a lawsuit.\nThe majority rejected that argument. \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 allegations boil down to one straightforward claim: that Apple exercises monopoly power in the retail market for the sale of apps and has unlawfully used its monopoly power to force iPhone owners to pay Apple higher-than-competitive prices for apps,\u201d Justice Kavanaugh wrote.\nApple argued that app developers set their own prices, meaning that consumers should not be able to sue the company. Justice Kavanaugh responded that the argument missed the economic reality of the relationship between Apple and app developers.\n\u201cA \u2018who sets the price\u2019 rule,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwould draw an arbitrary and unprincipled line among retailers based on retailers\u2019 financial arrangements with their manufacturers or suppliers.\u201d\n\u201cUnder Apple\u2019s rule a consumer could sue a monopolistic retailer when the retailer set the retail price by marking up the price it had paid the manufacturer or supplier for the good or service,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut a consumer could not sue a monopolistic retailer when the manufacturer or supplier set the retail price and the retailer took a commission on each sale.\u201d\n\u201cIn sum,\u201d Justice Kavanaugh wrote, \u201cApple\u2019s theory would disregard statutory text and precedent, create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers and furnish monopolistic retailers with a how-to guide for evasion of the antitrust laws.\u201d\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s majority opinion.\nIn dissent, Justice Gorsuch said the 1977 decision meant Apple should prevail, and he suggested that the majority had undermined the precedent by questioning all of its basic rationales.\n\u201cWithout any invitation or reason to revisit our precedent, and with so many grounds for caution, I would have thought the proper course today would have been to afford Illinois Brick full effect,\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote, \u201cnot to begin whittling it away to a bare formalism.\u201d\nChief Justice John G Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Justice Gorsuch\u2019s dissent."

        "title": "A Very Modern Waste of Tax Dollars",
        "fulltext": "When Californians place an online order with Best Buy, they pay the company and they pay a state sales tax. What the receipt doesn\u2019t say is that Best Buy gets some of the sales tax, too.\nCalifornia distributes a portion of sales tax revenue to local governments, based on the location of sales. In 2015, Best Buy agreed to keep a distribution warehouse in the small city of Dinuba, and to credit its online sales to that location. In exchange, Dinuba agreed to give Best Buy45 percent of its shareof the resulting sales tax revenue.\nCompanies including Apple, Macy\u2019s and QVC have struck similar deals with other California municipalities, according toa recent investigationbyBloomberg Tax. A consultant to the League of California Cities estimates that corporations are now receivingmore than $1 billion a year in such payouts\u2014 more than 20 percent of the total local share of sales tax revenue.\nThe tax deals are a facet of a much larger problem: the incredibly wasteful competition among state and local governmentsto lure and keep corporations. Everyone (well, everyone except corporations) would be better off if states prevented local governments from offering such incentives, and if the federal government deterred states from doing so, for exampleby taxing state and local incentives. So long as such incentives are legal, the result is an endless game of beggar-thy-neighbors-and-thyself.\nIn the case of California sales taxes, the internet supersized an old problem. Governments across the country have long offered sales tax kickbacks, for example to lure an auto dealership from a neighboring town. Before the internet, however, the benefit was limited to sales at that location. In the age of e-commerce, one warehouse may serve the whole state.\nMost states allocate sales tax revenue based on the location of the buyer. California is among a handful of states that uses the location of the seller. That effectively lets online retailers pick a city to get the tax revenue \u2014 and to sell the rights to the highest bidder.\nApple, for example, assigns the taxes from itsCalifornia salesto its headquarters city, Cupertino, in exchange for a 35 percent kickback. Macy\u2019s getsa 50 percent kickbackfrom Sacramento County. Ulta, which sells beauty products,gets up to75 percentback from Fresno.\nA billproposed byState Senator Steven Glazer, andbacked by the League of California Cities, would prohibit new deals of this kind, though it would allow existing deals to be renewed \u2014 and would still allow kickbacks to brick-and-mortar retailers.\nThe league\u2019s logic is that assigning online sales to a single location allows cities to steal from one another. Beyond that, it says, local governments still should have the same right as state governments and the federal government to determine the use of tax dollars. A 2013California lawrequires local governments to publish the details of any tax incentive over $100,000, along with an analysis of costs and benefits, and to hold a hearing. If voters don\u2019t like what they see, the argument goes, they are free to vote the bums out.\n(California also could adopt the more common system for allocating sales tax revenue, but cities with warehouses argue that they bear the costs, and deserve the money.)\nThe bill is surely a step in the right direction, but its proponents should heed the logic of their own proposal. The purpose of all sales tax kickbacks is to compete with other cities.\nAnd the competition does not just shift tax dollars from place to place \u2014 it decreases the total pool of sales tax dollars by giving some of the money to corporations.\nCompanies, and cities, cannot be expected to exercise restraint under the current rules. The real answer is for California, andevery other state, to prohibit local sales tax kickbacks.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Taming the Apex Predators of Tech",
        "fulltext": "In a tech galaxy that now seems far, far away, everyone was terrified of Bill Gates. He was the Apex Predator of Tech.\nYou wanted to make software? Microsoft would crush you. You wanted to start an online service? Microsoft would decimate you. You wanted to make a browser to navigate the World Wide Web?Chomp!\nIt was that last one that finally stopped Mr. Gates and Microsoft. The government accused the company of being a monopoly and of engaging in anticompetitive practices against Netscape and its Navigator browser. In 2001 the government won a landmark case against the company thatrequired it tosubmit to more oversight and make it easier for other companies to offer competing software.\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act had prevailed over the leading power in tech, and what happened after was a resurgence of innovation that ushered in a spate of new companies and ideas. You can draw a pretty straight line from that decision to the growth of Google and Amazon and Apple, the explosion of Facebook and the introduction of start-ups like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Slack.\n[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this columnon Twitter.]\nYay, capitalism and unfettered markets! Boo, a concentration of control!\nIn recent years tech has backtracked, except this time we have several Apex Predators instead of just one. Google and Facebook are the most obvious. More and more people in the media and in politics, as well as consumers, have become fearful of these companies for the damage they can do and the unregulated power they wield.\nSomething has to be done, but what? Even as distrust of big tech companies increases and governments move to control them, their businesses have never been more successful.\nOne option is privacy legislation. Europe passed such a law in 2016. While there is no national privacy law in the United States, California will soon have a state-level law, andother states are considering similar reforms. The idea of restricting tech companies\u2019 use of personal data becomes more popular with every hack and every instance of abuse. Still, the likelihood of the United States passing a national privacy law with teeth is small.\nThen there are the fines, such as a multibillion-dollar one that the Federal Trade Commission is considering to punish Facebook for privacy violations. While the fine would be the largest the agency has ever levied, it would also be far too small to make a difference. When Facebook announced it might have to hand over $5 billion as its get-out-of-jail-free card, Wall Street cheered and Facebook stock rose.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a lot of talk about the ways that countries can work together to improve the online ecosystem. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand met with President Emmanuel Macron of France last week, for example, about creating an intergovernmental effort to end online extremism. While laudable in theory, very little of this hand-wringing is likely to result in any rules with heft. In addition, the prospect of governments making rules around the restriction of speech is rife with ethical dilemmas.\nFinally there\u2019s the biggest gun: Using antitrust law to break up big tech companies. Calls for antitrust action have become increasingly loud, most notably in a recent essay in this paperby the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. His statement that the company should be broken up attracted a lot of attention, especially after he called the power held by Mark Zuckerberg, his former college roommate, \u201cun-American.\u201d That had to hurt, even if the blow is likely to be glancing, since antitrust cases are slow-moving and hard to pull off.\nAnd yet the idea of using antitrust to rein in these companies got a significant boost recently with theSupreme Court\u2019s decisionto allow a lawsuit from consumers aimed at how Apple runs its App Store to proceed in a lower court.\nBreaking with the more conservative wing of the court in a 5-4 decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion that Apple\u2019s arguments that it wasn\u2019t subject to a lawsuit over its app prices \u201cdisregard statutory text and precedent, create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers and furnish monopolistic retailers with a how-to guide for evasion of the antitrust laws.\u201d\nApple has and will continue to argue that it is not a monopoly in either hardware and software \u2014 which is true. But the case, though narrow, is still a flashing neon sign of change. It centers on rethinking the idea of what a monopoly is with an eye to the power of the network effect. Even if a company doesn\u2019t completely dominate its sector, if its platform can exercise what amounts to an iron-fisted control over consumers, perhaps it should be considered a monopoly after all.\n[Technology has made our lives easier. But it also means that your data is no longer your own. We\u2019ll examine who is hoarding your information \u2014 and give you a guide for what you can do about it.Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.]\nGoogle and Facebook are good examples, because they hold sway in all kinds of ways that make it hard for other companies to compete and for consumers to escape. Google\u2019s share of the search market allows it to dominate mapping, recommendations, email, video, documents and more, while Facebook rules the social media world through its main app along with Instagram and WhatsApp.\nNone of this is good for consumers, except perhaps by the measure of convenience, because the choices they have are limited and never likely to challenge the status quo. In other words, these companies are Apex Predators, too. You don\u2019t have to be as powerful as Bill Gates once was to be just as harmful.\nThe question now is: How do we get consumers on top of the food chain for once?\nKara Swisher, editor at large for the technology news website Recode and producer of the \"Recode Decode\u201d podcast and Code Conference, is a contributing Opinion writer.@karaswisherFacebook\nLike other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

        "title": "Why Does Apple Control Its Competitors?",
        "fulltext": "Of the 17 most popular screen-time and parental-control apps in the App Store,11 have been removed or restricted by Apple. The app makers believe they are being punished for competing with Apple\u2019s own screen-time control tools, or worse, forweaning people off Apple devices. Many of the apps had more stringent controls than Apple\u2019s in-house alternatives.Apple saysthat the applications \u2014 specifically, the parental-control apps \u2014 were removed because of their use of Mobile Device Management, a technology that gave third parties access to information such as \u201cuser location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions and browsing history.\u201d In other words, Apple says it removed the apps to protect the privacy of the children and parents who installed them.\nThe actions by Applehighlight the inherent tension in the company\u2019s fierce control over its mobile operating system: On the one hand, the closed environment is a boon to consumerprivacy because the company has the leverage to insist upon it; on the other hand, that environment fosters a kind of monopoly.\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private?Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletterto explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.]\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the company has cracked down on products sold in its App Store. In January, the company revoked Facebook\u2019s control over an app thatcollected data on minors, which temporarily resulted in havoc at Facebook headquarters, since the revocation applied to severalcustom-made apps(like calendars) used internally within the company. Apple\u2019s caution around Mobile Device Management is reasonable \u2014 in a post-Cambridge Analytica world, third parties need not have overbroad access to user information.\nBut Apple\u2019s management of the App Store is also dangerously reminiscent of the anti-competitive behavior that triggeredUnited States v. Microsoft, a landmark antitrust case that changed the landscape of the tech industry.\nIn the mid-1990s, Microsoft began to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with Windows, moving to elbow competing browsers \u2014 primarily,Netscape\u2014 out of the picture. This triggered a lawsuit from the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general in 1998. Microsoft ultimatelylost.\nThe lawsuit is credited with opening up the marketplace for upstarts likeGoogle and Facebook. Now, the companies that shot up to the top while Microsoft was busy fending off the Justice Department are engaging in similar anti-competitive tactics. In some ways, Microsoft\u2019s conduct was more egregious thanApple\u2019s appears to be today\u2014internal documentsoutlined a clear strategy to \u201cleverage\u201d Windows to increase Internet Explorer\u2019s market share and ultimately dominate the browser market. The company also entered into agreements with various service providers to optimize sites for Internet Explorer but not other browsers. Yet Microsoft never banned the installation of other browsers outright \u2014 how could it? If a user wanted to, they could still use Netscape.\nBut Apple\u2019s operating system for mobile devices makes it almost impossible to get an app outside of the AppStore that will work on an Apple phone. Ultimately, the company controls what a user can or cannot do on their own iPhone. Apple also takesup to a 30 percentcut of in-app revenue, including revenue from \u201cservices\u201d fulfilled in-app \u2014\u00a0like buying a premium subscription or an ebook. Because all apps go through the App Store, this 30 percent cut is nearly unavoidable.\nApple doesn\u2019t ban apps like Amazon Kindle or Spotify, which compete with Apple Books and Apple Music, respectively. But the 30 percent fee stillstings.That\u2019s the reason you currently can\u2019t buy a Kindle ebook through the Kindle mobileapp. Spotify, a much smaller company, now pays Apple between15 and 30 percentof its in-apprevenuein order to serve streaming music to its premium subscribers. Spotifyrecently filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of anticompetitive practices. In the United States, anantitrust lawsuitpending before theSupreme Courtalleges that the 30 percent cutdrives up prices for consumers.\nApple isn\u2019t the only company leveraging a mobile operating system for an unfair advantage. Last year, theEuropean Union fined Google $5.1 billionfor bundling the Chrome browser and Google Search with other Android apps.\nEven if we take Apple at its word that it was only protecting the privacy and security of its users by removing screen-time and parental-control apps, the state of the app marketplace is troubling. Why isa company\u2014\u00a0with no mechanism for democratic oversight \u2014\u00a0the primary and most zealous guardian of user privacy and security? Why is one company in charge of vetting what users can or cannot do on their phones, especially when that company also makes apps that compete in a marketplace that it controls? Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal tobar Apple from competing in its own app marketplaceis too drastic, and doesn\u2019t take into consideration how intertwined the physical phone is with Apple\u2019s in-house apps. For example, iMessage competes with Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, but what\u2019s a cellphone without text messages?\nStill, the status quo is untenable. It\u2019s time for American regulators to take a good hard look at app stores and mobile operating systems. It might be time for another United States v.

        "title": "Apps Purged by Apple Say It Holds the Key They Need to Get Back In",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, Apple announced that it had created tools to help people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones. Around the same time,Apple began purging from its App Store a number of appsthat offered similar services.\nNow 17 companies affected by that purge say they have a technical answer to the privacy concerns that Apple cited for dropping them.\nThe companies on Thursday proposed the creation of anapplication programming interface, or A.P.I., a common bit of software that enables computer programs or apps to work with one another. The companies said the A.P.I. could tap Apple technology that would allow them to track screen time without invading privacy.\n\u201cRight now, technologically, only Apple has the right to do it on their devices, and we believe Apple should let everybody get a go,\u201d said Viktor Yevpak, the head of Kidslox, a parental-control app that has been targeted by Apple.\nThe companies\u2019 move puts added pressure on Apple ahead ofits annual developers conferencenext week, when the iPhone maker interacts with thousands of app makers and lays out its vision for the year.\nApple is increasingly on the defensive over its tight control of the App Store. The high fees for selling services in the App Store and competition from Apple\u2019s own apps are drawing accusations that the tech giant is abusing its power.\nSpotifyrecently complained to European regulatorsthat Apple used the App Store to give its Apple Music service an unfair advantage. Dutch regulators are investigating whether Apple abused its control of the App Store. This month,the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class actionto move forward, saying consumers have the right to try to prove that Apple used the App Store to raise apps\u2019 prices.\nAnd Kidslox and another parental-control app, Qustodio, filed a complaint with European competition officials over Apple\u2019s forcing changes to their apps. Another parental-control app complained to Russia\u2019s antitrust authorities.\nApple declined to comment on Thursday.\nApple has frequently created A.P.I.s to encourage app developers to use its technology. While the 17 app makersreleased a technical proposalon how it could work, a new A.P.I. would have to come from Apple itself.\nThis week,Apple published a web pageexplaining its approach to the App Store, saying it strives to create \u201ca safe and trusted place for customers\u201d and \u201ca great business opportunity for all developers.\u201d\nApple said it reviewed about 100,000 apps a week and rejected roughly 40 percent, typically for minor bugs or privacy concerns. (Security experts say the approach has made iPhones safer than Android devices.) Apple stressed that it welcomed competition in the App Store.\nAndrew Armour, a developer whose screen-time app was rejected by Apple, said he and the other developers had begun to collaborate afterThe New York Times reported last monthon Apple\u2019s purge. He and Mr. Yevpak said they were upset thatApple had said in its response to the articlethat it removed their apps because \u201cthey put users\u2019 privacy and security at risk.\u201d\nMr. Armour said Apple had never said that when it removed or rejected their apps. \u201cAll they said was it went against one of their rules,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us were doing anything malicious.\u201d\nThe developers said they were encouraged to act by Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive and one of the creators of the iPhone. Mr. Fadell spoke out about Apple\u2019s actions against the screen-time apps and suggested the technology that the companies are now proposing.\nMr. Fadell corresponded with several of the developers. \u201cI will push it out to the world \u2014 just make sure it\u2019s done BEFORE WWDC,\u2019\u201d he said in one message seen by The Times, using the abbreviation for Apple\u2019s developers conference next week.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Fadell said he had encouraged the effort but wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.\nBecause Apple has demonstrated that it can enable people to track the time they spend on their phones \u2014 as well as what their children are doing \u2014 without invading privacy, the developers said Apple should give them an A.P.I. that would allow them to do the same.\nThe companies said they had wanted such an A.P.I. for years but were forced to use workarounds.\nMany of them used a technology called mobile device management, or M.D.M., which enables one iPhone to control another. Apple allowed the practice for years but changed its policy last year. Apple said M.D.M. gave the apps too much access to children\u2019s devices.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of competition,\u201dApple said in a response to The Times\u2019s article. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of security.\u201d\nApple has removed or restricted more than two dozen screen-time and parental-control apps, according to a review by The Times. Still, Apple has left up at least three apps that use M.D.M., according to Sensor Tower, a firm that tracks information about apps.\nSeveral apps that Apple purged didn\u2019t use M.D.M. but were told they had been removed for using a separate technology, virtual private networks.\nApple declined to comment on why it had removed those apps."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Worried About Screen Time? A Dose of Big Tech Data May Help",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nI do it. You do it. We all do it: Look at screens. The. Whole. Time.\nTristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who co-founded the Center for Humane Technology, recentlyissued a battle cryagainst the potent cocktail of data and algorithms that he said tech companies had designed to hijack human attention. He claimed that they were \u201cdowngrading\u201d our attention spans, relationships, civility and more.\nThere\u2019s growing moral panic about our reliance on screens and the content, in particular social media, they display. My colleague Kevin Roose felt it, andforced himself to detox. (Spoiler: He liked it.)\nBut while researchers I\u2019ve spoken with said the way we used devices could be troubling, they also said we didn\u2019t fully understand the problems or how to solve them.\nDr. Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 spokeswoman on behavioral addictions, pointed out that not all screen time was equal.\n\u201cYou can do all kinds of things on a phone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe addiction is to the activity \u2014 gambling, gaming, watching porn.\u201d Much of our time with screens can be a healthy, she added, analogous to, say, reading a book.\nA problem is that we lack granular insight about how people use their devices, making it hard to understand how damaging our relationships with them are.\nAs we\u2019ve conducted more of our lives online, \u201cthe amount of human behavior we can directly observe has been shrinking,\u201d said Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist and director of research at the Oxford internet Institute. \u201cAs time has gone on, the ability to formulate meaningful questions and then ask them of good data has diminished.\u201d\nExcept, some people do have access to such data: They work at companies like Facebook, Google and Apple. These companies all collect troves of information \u2014 all locked away \u2014 about how we use technology.\nInspired by our panic, Google and Apple have introduced tools to help users manage their digital activity. But should we trust tech companies to help curb tech use?\nMy colleague Jack Nicas reportedthat, since launching such tools for iPhones, Apple had purged other smartphone addiction apps from its App Store. Apple said it was over privacy violations; app makers said it was because their software could hurt Apple\u2019s business.\nIf the app makers are right, Apple is cornering the market on access to iPhone use data.\nThat would be troubling. If other companies and researchers had access to such data \u2014 along with Facebook\u2019s likes, Netflix\u2019s streaming figures, Google\u2019s browsing histories and more \u2014 they could study it to more accurately understand what is genuinely problematic about relationships with our devices, and develop meaningful interventions to overcome problems.\nThere are problems with this idea. Getting tech companies to give up data is hard, probably requiring regulatory intervention. Use of the data would obviously need to be closely policed. And it\u2019s slower than an intervene-first-think-later approach.\nBut if we\u2019re going to stop using screens, let\u2019s do it based on sound evidence.\n\u201cI know that we don\u2019t exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg told the crowd at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference on Tuesday, a smile on his face. He paused, perhaps expecting laughter.\nThere was virtual silence.\nHe pushed on, describing a new, more private Facebook \u2014 a bid to overcome the privacy and data scandals that have dogged his company. My colleague Mike Isaacexplained what this would look like: more sharing in private groups, ephemeral content and encryption by default on messaging services.\nSounds promising! So why the silence? One reason, excepting Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s delivery, was panic.\nFacebook is entering uncharted territory, and Mr. Zuckerberg isn\u2019t sure what the future looks like, according to aninterview he gave to The Washington Post. Here are some takeaways:\n\u25a0 His business plan is hazy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how good of a business it will be, but I am confident it will be good,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\u25a0 He can\u2019t say how long the pivot will take. \u201cThe next five years at least, maybe even the next 10 years, is building out the private platforms with the richness that the public platforms have had to date,\u201d he said.\n\u25a0 And impending regulation from all corners, perhaps the biggest threat to Facebook\u2019s future, is largely beyond its control.\nThe developers listening to Mr. Zuckerberg were aware of this, and the upheaval that the shift could cause them. Excuse them for not laughing.\nUber spent the week on a roadshow, trying to persuade investors to buy its shares ahead of its initial public offering. As Mike Isaac reported, Uber\u2019s pitchdraws parallels to Amazon: a do-anything juggernaut that will aggressively invest and diversify.\nInvestors have reportedly beenasking hard questionsabout the rid-hailing company\u2019s growth, competition and market share. Which is reasonable, given that Uber dedicated 35,000 words in its I.P.O. prospectus to what could go wrong.\nHere are some of its biggest nightmares:\nEmployees.Uber labels its drivers contractors, not employees, to avoid paying a minimum wage. More than 60,000 drivers have filed or plan to file for arbitration to change that, a shift that could cost it billions of dollars. (It will be heartened by the Labor Department\u2019s recent decision toexempt an unspecified gig-economycompany from that fate.)\nCompetitors\u2019 autonomous cars.Robo-cars are essential to Uber\u2019s profitability: They\u2019ll allow vehicles to offer rides 24-7 without human drivers, who currently share the takings. But if competitors like Waymo crack the technology first, Uber could be ruined.\nRegulation.It\u2019s 2019, and the authorities are after tech companies \u2014 whether through outright blocks to Uber\u2019s taxi service or privacy regulations that crimp its ability to innovate.\nItself.For years, Uber was perhaps tech\u2019s biggest villain. It worries that its cultural and leadership fixes might not be enough to solve its lingering P.R. problems.\nAnd, um, restaurants and delivery companies?Uber\u2019s aggressive diversification means competitors are everywhere: Restaurants steal customers from its food delivery service, and companies like DHL compete with its freight service.\n\u25a0 Huawei has a culture problem.It seeks acceptance in the West, but its structure and value system \u2014 shaped after the Communist Party\u2019s \u2014could stand in the way.\n\u25a0 Tech giants reported sliding financial results.Slumping iPhone salesshrank Apple\u2019s profit, andgrowth is faltering at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.\n\u25a0 Border officials have designs on your devices.The American Civil Liberties Union found that two agencies \u2014 Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 have \u201cnear-unfettered authorityto search and seize travelers\u2019 devices at the border.\u201d\n\u25a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s presidentlifted the nation\u2019s banon social media.It was supposed to prevent the spread of misinformation after bombings on Easter.\n\u25a0 Drones: now delivering organs.One of the unmanned vehiclesdelivered a kidney last month to a Maryland womanwho had waited eight years for a lifesaving transplant.\n\u25a0 I.P.O.s keep coming.SlackandWeWorkare the latest tech unicorns to file paperwork for impending initial public offerings.\n\u25a0 Robots rule the roost at Amazon.The companydismissed the ideathat robots would soon replace its warehouse workers, butmachines are hiring and firingthose employees.\n\u25a0 Qualcomm isgetting at least $4.5 billion from Apple.That\u2019s the settlement from their lengthy patent battle.\nJamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter.

        "title": "As China Takes Aim, Silicon Valley Braces for Pain",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Silicon Valley looks west to China, it sees many things. More than a billion hungry consumers. A cheap source of labor. A competitor, partner, supplier and security risk.\nNow add this: A foe bent on retaliation.\nThe Chinese government said Friday that it wasputting together an \u201cunreliable entities list,\u201da counterattack against the United States for denying important technology to Chinese companies. No companies were named or details given, but tech firms seemed all but assured of being a prime target.\nAs the economic relationship between the two countries frays at warp speed, the much-anticipated tech cold war is escalating.\n\u201cIf China continues to push back, and we continue to push back, there will soon be dual technology standards,\u201d said Rebecca Fannin, author of the coming book \u201cTech Titans of China.\u201d \u201cPrices will probably rise for components, which companies will pass along to consumers. But both sides will strengthen their innovation edge, and that helps the global economy.\u201d\nSome Silicon Valley companies are more vulnerable than others. Because Facebook and Google are blocked by the Chinese government, social media and search might be kept out of the conflict. Apple, on the other hand, isheavily invested in China, which is both a major manufacturer of the iPhone and a major market for it.\nTesla is building a plant in Shanghai that will produce 250,000 cars a year. Venture capitalists have poured in funding. Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Beijing is its largest outside the United States, while many of the products in the Amazon shopping mall are made in the country. Amazon also just opened an A.I. lab in China.\nThe consequences of the deteriorating relationship are already playing out with smaller tech companies.\nTwo weeks ago, the Trump administration put Huawei,the giant Chinese maker of telecommunications gear,on an \u201centity list\u201d that would force it to get permission to buy technology from American companies. Huawei relies on American-made parts for everything from its smartphones to its networking equipment. Although it received a 90-day waiver to allow time for negotiations, many companies based in the United States have already severed ties.\nThat has had a knock-on effect. Lumentum, a Silicon Valley company that makes optical networking gear, said Huawei was generating about 15 percent of its revenue. Last week, itreduced its expectationsfor the current quarter by about $35 million to a maximum of $390 million.\nQorvo, a semiconductor company in North Carolina, also said last week that it depended on Huawei for about 15 percent of its sales and projected that its revenue in the current quarter would drop by about $50 million to a maximum of $750 million.\nChina is a big and fast-growing consumer of computer chips, used in an array of products that include smartphones, personal computers, communications equipment and server systems. Customers in the country accounted for about 34 percent of global sales in 2018, which totaled $468.8 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.\nChina\u2019s importance to American chip makers is magnified by the fact that many chips are sent to China to be assembled to make gadgets for customers elsewhere, such as the iPhones that Taiwan-based Foxconn makes for Apple in China. Roughly 60 percent of semiconductors sold are connected to the Chinese-based supply chain, the consulting firm KPMG said.\nChip makers hope that the latest barbs between China and the United States are mainly aimed at gaining leverage in trade talks, not permanent changes in how the countries will have to do business.\n\u201cEach volley in the U.S.-China trade dispute causes semiconductor companies to wince and financial markets to wobble, while pushing us farther from a deal that would benefit both economies, the two largest in the world,\u201d John Neuffer, the Semiconductor Industry Association\u2019s president and chief executive, said Friday after news of China\u2019s unreliable entities list.\n\u201cWe urge both sides to avoid further escalations, get back to the negotiating table and reach a high-standard, enforceable and sustainable agreement,\u201d Mr. Neuffer added.\nApple\u2019s exposure to China is broad. The company assembles most of its products there, and the region is its No. 3 market, after the United States and Europe. In its latest quarter, Apple earned $10.2 billion in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, or about 18 percent of its total revenue. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s dependence on China was vividly demonstrated late last year whenChinese consumers began balking at buyingthe latest model of the smartphone. Total revenue for the region that includes China dropped 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. One of Apple\u2019s responses was to cut Chinese prices of its cheapest phone. The situation seems to have stabilized recently.\nOther tech behemoths have found little traction in China. Microsoft has generally tried to play along in China, censoring sensitive topics the government bans on its Bing search engine and teaming up with a state-run firm to produce a government-approved version of its Windows 10 software.\nYet in January, government censorsappeared to briefly blockBing, which, though little used, provides a rare portal in China to the global internet. And widespread problems with bootleg copies of Microsoft\u2019s software have prevented China from becoming a major market for the company. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\u201cPiracy has been an epidemic for Microsoft in China,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. Investors had hoped that trade negotiations with China could resolve these longstanding intellectual property issues.\n\u201cYou are talking about a company that tried to penetrate China from every angle, both from a demand and R & D perspective,\u201d Mr. Ives said. \u201cNow, with all the trouble they have had there, it actually becomes a benefit to Microsoft versus other tech players.\u201d\nFacebook, which needs all the friends and arguments it can get as it battles widespread calls for its breakup, has already seized on the China threat. It maintains it needs to be big to compete with the big Chinese companies.\n\u201cPeople are concerned with the size and power of tech companies,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, recentlysaid in a CNBC interview. \u201cThere\u2019s also a concern in the United States about the size and power of Chinese tech companies and the realization that those companies are not going to be broken up.\u201d"

        "title": "Siri and Alexa Reinforce Gender Bias, U.N. Finds",
        "fulltext": "Why do most virtual assistants that are powered by artificial intelligence \u2014 like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa system \u2014 by default have female names, female voices and often a submissive or even flirtatious style?\nThe problem, according to a new report released this week by Unesco, stems from a lack of diversity within the industry that is reinforcing problematic gender stereotypes.\n\u201cObedient and obliging machines that pretend to be women are entering our homes, cars and offices,\u201d Saniye Gulser Corat, Unesco\u2019s director for gender equality,said in a statement. \u201cThe world needs to pay much closer attention to how, when and whether A.I. technologies are gendered and, crucially, who is gendering them.\u201d\nOne particularly worrying reflection of this is the \u201cdeflecting, lackluster or apologetic responses\u201d that these assistants give to insults.\nThe report borrows its title \u2014 \u201cI\u2019d Blush if I Could\u201d \u2014 from a standard response from Siri, the Apple voice assistant, when a user hurled a gendered expletive at it. When a user tells Alexa, \u201cYou\u2019re hot,\u201d her typical response has been a cheery, \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say!\u201d\nSiri\u2019s response was recently altered to a more flattened \u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to that,\u201d but the report suggests that the technology remains gender biased, arguing that the problem starts with engineering teams that are staffed overwhelmingly by men.\n\u201cSiri\u2019s \u2018female\u2019 obsequiousness \u2014 and the servility expressed by so many other digital assistants projected as young women \u2014 provides a powerful illustration of gender biases coded into technology products,\u201d the report found.\nAmazon\u2019s Alexa, named for the ancient library of Alexandria, is unmistakably female. Microsoft\u2019s Cortana was named after an A.I. character in the Halo video game franchise that projects itself as a sensuous, unclothed woman. Apple\u2019s Siri is a Norse name that means \u201cbeautiful woman who leads you to victory.\u201d The Google Assistant system, also known as Google Home, has a gender-neutral name, but the default voice is female.\nBaked into their humanized personalities, though, are generations of problematic perceptions of women. These assistants are putting a stamp on society as they become common in homes across the world, and can influence interactions with real women, the report warns. As the report puts it, \u201cThe more that culture teaches people to equate women with assistants, the more real women will be seen as assistants \u2014 and penalized for not being assistant-like.\u201d\nApple and Google declined to comment on the report. Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe publication \u2014 the first to offer United Nations recommendations regarding the gendering of A.I. technologies \u2014 urged tech companies and governments to stop making digital assistants female by default and to explore developing a gender-neutral voice assistant, among other guidance.\nThe systems are a reflection of broader gender disparities within the technology and A.I. sectors, Unesco noted in the report, which was released in conjunction with the government of Germany and the Equals Skills Coalition, which promotes gender balance in the technology sector.\nWomen are grossly underrepresented in artificial intelligence, making up 12 percent of A.I. researchers and 6 percent of software developers in the field.\nThe report noted that technology companies justify the use of female voices by pointing to studies that showed consumers preferred female voices to male ones. But lost in that conversation is research showing that people like the sound of a male voice when it is making authoritative statements, but a female voice when it is being \u201chelpful,\u201d further perpetuating stereotypes.\nExperts say bias baked into A.I. and broader disparities within the programming field are not new \u2014 pointing to aninadvertently sexist hiring tool developed by Amazonandfacial recognition technology that misidentified black facesas examples.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always malicious bias, it\u2019s unconscious bias, and lack of awareness that this unconscious bias exists, so it\u2019s perpetuated,\u201d said Allison Gardner, a co-founder of Women Leading in A.I. \u201cBut these mistakes happen because you do not have the diverse teams and the diversity of thought and innovation to spot the obvious problems in place.\u201d\nBut the report offers guidance for education and steps to address the issues, which equality advocates have long pushed for.\nDr. Gardner\u2019s organization works to bring women working in A.I. together with business leaders and politicians to discuss the ethics, bias and potential for legislative frameworks to develop the industry in a way that is more representative.\nThe grouphas published its own listof recommendations for building inclusive artificial intelligence, among them establishing a regulatory body to audit algorithms, investigate complaints and ensure bias is taken into account in the development of new technology.\n\u201cWe need to change things now, because these things are being implemented now,\u201d Dr. Gardner said, pointing to the rapid spread of A.I.-powered virtual assistants. \u201cWe are writing the standards now that will be used in the future.\u201d\nDr. Gardner said that changes are also needed in education, because the bias was a symptom of systemic underrepresentation within a male-dominated field.\n\u201cThe whole structure of the subject area of computer science has been designed to be male-centric, right down to the very semantics we use,\u201d she said.\nAlthough women now have more opportunities in computer science, more are disappearing from the field as they advance in their careers, a trend known as the \u201cleaky pipeline\u201d phenomenon.\n\u201cI would say they are actually being forced out by a rather female-unfriendly environment and culture,\u201d Dr. Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture that needs to change.\u201d"
