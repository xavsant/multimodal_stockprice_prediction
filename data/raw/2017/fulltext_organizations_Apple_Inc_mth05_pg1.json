        "title": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine",
        "fulltext": "Great things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.\nApple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.\nApple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.\n\u201cApple has ushered itself squarely into a new normal of pedestrian growth,\u201d Edison Investment Research said, summing up the market reaction to Apple\u2019s latestquarterlyearnings report on Tuesday.\nIn a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201d\nYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.\nA major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?\nIt may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\nThat hasn\u2019t prevented its share price from powering upward. For the moment, the stock market remains entranced with what Apple is doing financially, and for understandable reasons. Apple may no longer be a great growth company but it is still extraordinary, said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who hasanalyzedApple\u2019s earnings closely since 2010. Come what may, he said, Apple churns out staggering quantities of money with metronomic regularity.\n\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.\nIn the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.\nApple has enough cash for an outright purchase of General Electric or Wells Fargo or AT&T, the data shows. There is speculation that Apple will make a major acquisition: Companies likeNetflix, Disney, Hulu and Tesla are on analysts\u2019 lists.\nBut there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.\nIn a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).\nFurthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201d\nAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.\nThe fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.\nApple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201d\nIt stashes nearly $240 billion of its cash offshore, out of reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Much of it will presumably return to the United States if the Trump administration lowerscorporate taxrates, as it has proposed. Mr. Maestri said the company\u2019s current plans for its cash reflect \u201cthe current tax legislation in this country, and there\u2019s a lot that still needs to happen there, and we\u2019ll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.\u201d\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.\nLike Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.\nMr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain."

What \u2014 and why \u2014 is this?\nA.Simply put, Apple updates its operating system and hardware processors regularly, but older apps that have not kept up with the changes will be too outdated to run on the new iOS software expected later this year. The move is not unprecedented. Both Apple and Microsoft have abandoned support for programs that did not evolve along with the Mac and Windows operating systems and hardware.\nIn 2013, withthe introduction of the iPhone 5s and iOS 7, Apple began to switch its mobile hardware and software from the older 32-bit processors and operating systems to more advanced 64-bit versions. (As with desktop systems, the terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the amount of data the processor can handle.) In 2015, the company began to require that new apps and new app updates include support for 64-bit systems.\nAsApple fully transitionsits hardware and software to the 64-bit world, older apps still stuck in a 32-bit world will be left behind. Apple has begun to warn users about these older apps with the alerts you have already seen.\nYou can find a list of all the apps that are destined for involuntary retirement in iOS 11 by opening the Settings icon on the Home screen, selecting General, then About and then tapping Applications.\nSome apps on the list may have been abandoned by their creators, but others may have alternate, updated versions in the App Store \u2014 or on the way. (For new editions, you may have to purchase the app again.) If you do not see any app upgrades available, search for the old app by name to see what alternative programs the App Store offers."

        "title": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us",
        "fulltext": "A few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.\nThis may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.\nThe five are among the most valuable companies on the planet, collectively worth trillions. (Apple reached $800 billion in market capitalization this week, the first of any public company to do so, andthe others may not be far behind.) And despite the picture of Silicon Valley as a roiling sea of disruption, these five have gotten only stronger and richer over time.\nTheir growth has prompted callsfor greater regulation and antitrust intervention. There\u2019s rising worry, too, over their softer, noneconomic influence over culture and information \u2014 for instance, fears overhow Facebook might affect democracies\u2014 as well as theimplicit threat they pose to the jurisdictions of world governments.\nThese are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.\nSo, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.\nThe Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?\nWhen I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.\nNext, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.\nIn third place, full of regrets: Apple. There\u2019s nothing I use more than my iPhone, and close behind are my MacBook and iMac 5K, which may bethe best computer I\u2019ve ever owned. Abandoning Apple would prompt deep and truly annoying rearrangements in my life, including braving Samsung\u2019s bad software. But I could do it, grudgingly.\nIt\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.\nIn fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).\nAnd then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.\nWhen the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?\nA few years ago I would have thought that was the limit. Then came Echo, the company\u2019s talking computer, which speaks through a persona known as Alexa, and which hasinfected my family like a happy virus.\nEcho has a way of ingratiating itself into one\u2019s most mundane moments. I rewired my household\u2019s lights to be able to control them through Alexa. I changed the kind of coffee I buy so that I could tell Alexa to reorder it. When Amazon announced, this week, a new screen-enabled Echo, anda feature to let Echos act as phones, I experienced another frisson of possibility. Amazon, I see now, is well on its way to becoming my household\u2019s brain, a kind of butler in the sky that runs the place for me.\nWhich brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.\nOne evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.\nIf such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.\nBut if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape."

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Will Donald Trump\u2019s presidency get rotted out?\nSteve Jobs might have said so.\nBack in 1995, when the tech god was between gigs at Apple, when he had learned a thing or three about leadership by being snaked out of his own company by John Sculley, he gave an interview positing that empires could crash and burn if the emphasis was on sales rather than product.\n\u201cThe companies forget what it means to make great products,\u201d Jobs said. \u201cThe product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that\u2019s required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts usually about wanting to really help the customers.\u201d\nIn \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump said that playing to people\u2019s fantasies and promising the greatest product was \u201can innocent form of exaggeration.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s one thing when you do that for condos and cologne and mattresses and steaks. It\u2019s another for life-or-death health care policy.\nTrump has twice pushed to pass disgraceful health care bills without even trying to grasp what\u2019s in them \u2014 or more important, what\u2019s not in them. He couldn\u2019t care less that the dog\u2019s breakfast served up by the House on Thursday wounds the struggling Americans he had promised to lift up.\nIt is \u201csomething terrific,\u201d as he vowed, but only for the superrich who are getting a Marie Antoinette wealth transfer at the expense of health care for the poor.\nThe president feted his fake-news \u201cwin\u201d in the Rose Garden, sprinkling flimflam dust to deflect from his ludicrous legislation. Paul Ryan slobbered over Trump\u2019s leadership even as the Senate made plans to shred the House bill and start over.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m president,\u201d Trump told his sycophants, or in this case, sickophants. \u201cCan you believe it, right?\u201d\nNo, I can\u2019t.\nIn a moment of clueless cynicism, hours after the ego festival in the Rose Garden, Trump sat in a tuxedo with the Australian prime minister on the Intrepid and said Australians have better health care than Americans \u2014 harking back to his old statements in support of universal health care.\nPresidents have to be good salesmen. Barack Obama faltered because he hated selling and simply lectured. He even outsourced the job of selling his re-election bid at the 2012 convention to a former antagonist, Bill Clinton.\nHillary was not good at salesmanship either. The new book \u201cShattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign,\u201d reports that at one point, her 2016 team got so flummoxed at her inability to explain why she wanted to be president that they actually considered the slogan \u201cBecause It\u2019s Her Turn.\u201d\nTrump did care about his product when he built Trump Tower. He obsessed over every detail of a building that was the flashy emblem of New York bursting out of the dark \u201970s and into the booming \u201980s.\n\u201cBut the success of that went to his head and he never cared again,\u201d his biographer Tim O\u2019Brien told me. \u201cHe\u2019s fundamentally lazy. He free-rides so many processes he doesn\u2019t know anything about. He used to do it in the business world, and now he does it in the political world.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a student of anything other than protecting his image. What he cares about is how he\u2019s perceived, not the nuts and bolts of things. He is essentially a performance artist.\u201d\nWhen Trump talked to John Dickerson for \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last Sunday, he said the big difference between business and politics was that in Washington, \u201cyou really need heart, because you\u2019re talking about a lot of people. Whereas in business, you don\u2019t need so much heart. You want to make a good deal.\u201d\nBut with health care, Trump wanted to make a deal so badly he was heartless. One Republican senator, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said that he would not vote for a health care bill that does not pass \u201cthe Jimmy Kimmel test\u201d: \u201cWould the child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything he or she would need in that first year of life?\u201d\nThe House Republicans just wanted Trump off their backs. They had never pulled a real bill together because they thought Hillary would win and they could just snipe at her. The Irish undertaker and his crew were so desperate to prove they had not totally forgotten how to pass anything that they were willing to go with garbage. And Ryan wanted to save the bacon \u2014 or bratwurst \u2014 of his fellow Wisconsin buddy Reince Priebus, blamed by Trump for the first health care defeat. After that debacle, The Times reported, Trump started merging the two names into one mocking \u201cRyan-ce.\u201d\nBut in delivering this win for Trump, they may well have delivered a way for Democrats to take the president down. The Democrats could win the House back and get their investigative machinery cranking. The Cook Political Report has now downgraded the 2018 re-election chances of 20 House Republicans.\nTrump cares only about optics, and yet he and Ivanka, his glossy shield on women\u2019s issues, do not seem to realize the bad optics of a viral photo of a crowd of guys applauding themselves for gutting health care protections for women.\nThe Republicans now have a pre-existing condition: They voted for something that will cause them a lot of pain in the future."

Nokia said that Apple should pay for technology used in smartphones, tablets and other devices.\nThat tug of war, however, is now over.\nOn Tuesday, the companies said that they had settled all of the lawsuits, and that they had signed a new patent agreement under which Apple will start paying royalties to Nokia from the second quarter of 2017. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.\nIn a sign that they had buried the hatchet, Apple and Nokia also announced that they had signed new business agreements: Apple will begin stocking some of Nokia\u2019s digital health products in its stores, and the Finnish company will provide some of its mobile network infrastructure products and services to the American company.\n\u201cWe are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement.\nInvestors welcomed the news, pushing Nokia\u2019s stock price upmore than 6 percentin morning trading in Helsinki, Finland, on Tuesday.\nThe legal battle between Apple and Nokia had highlighted the continuing role that the Finnish company \u2014 once the world\u2019s largest seller of mobile phones \u2014 has in the industry, despite its devices having been outmuscled by those of Apple and Samsung.\nLike Ericsson, another European technology company that owns multiple patents that are widely used in Android and Apple phones, Nokia avidly guards its intellectual property, which has become a mainstay of the company\u2019s annual revenue.\nSeparately, Apple continues to face a battle with Qualcomm, an American microprocessing giant, whichhas accusedit of failing to pay billions of dollars in licensing fees. Apple denies any wrongdoing."

        "fulltext": "Slowly, gradually, before we even had time to realize it,the Frightful Five tech companies\u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google \u2014 became essential and inescapable.\nThat was the view of the New York Times technology columnist Farhad Manjoo when he asked last week on Twitter how people would manage if they were forced to give up some of these companies\u2019 products and services. The question prompted all sorts of uncomfortable squirming as people considered \u2014 really considered \u2014 what they would do. Which ones would they ditch if they had to? The answers did not come easily.\nIn hiscolumnthis week, Farhad explains the order in which he would dump the companies. Spoiler alert: For Farhad, the last one to go would be Amazon, the e-commerce company that he now uses to order items of all kinds \u2014 and whose hardware, like the Amazon Echo speaker, he also uses for many household questions and tasks. Farhad also takes advantage of the handyman service that the company offers users who need assistance.\nTo help you figure out how deeply embedded the Frightful Five are in your life, Farhad came up witha quizto identify which of the companies you might shed first. Spend a minute with it, and see if the result surprises you."

        "title": "Giving the Behemoths a Leg Up on the Little Guy",
        "fulltext": "Every year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.\nAnd if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.\nThis column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.\nAt the moment, the internet isn\u2019t in a good place.The Frightful Five\u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 control nearly everything of value in the digital world, including operating systems, app stores, browsers, cloud storage infrastructure, and oceans of data from which to spin new products. A handful of others \u2014 Comcast, AT&T, Verizon \u2014 control the wired and wireless connections through which all your data flows. People used to talk about the internet as a wonderland for innovative upstarts, but lately the upstarts keep getting clobbered. Today the internet is gigantic corporations, all the way down.\nWhich brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.\nAmid many legal battles, neutrality rules in some form have governed the internet for years. In 2015, after President Obama advocated a stricter policy, Tom Wheeler, then chairman of the F.C.C., pushed through sweeping network neutrality rules. But under President Trump, net neutrality is on the chopping block. Last week, Mr. Paioutlined an effort to loosen the rules; his vision is likely to come to pass.\nThe fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.\nYet the portrayal of a fight along internet-versus-telecom battle lines seems increasingly simplistic. Telecom companies are becoming internet companies (Verizon now owns AOL and Yahoo), internet companies are dabbling in telecom (Alphabet has a fiber-optic internet service arm), and they\u2019re all becoming film and TV studios (Amazonhas an Emmys strategy!).\nSo the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?\nProbably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.\nTim Wu, the Columbia Law professor and New York Times contributing opinion columnist whodeveloped the concept of \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201dsaid that the emergence of a handful of internet giants has altered how he thinks about the issue. In 2003, when he began arguing for neutrality rules, Mr. Wu was mainly interested in protecting digital innovators from the telecom oligopolies that had long stifled new technology on their networks. If phone companies brought the same rules from phone networks over to the internet, attaching unapproved hardware to your line (like a Wi-Fi router) or running software that might compete with the phone company\u2019s primary business (say, Skype) could be deemed verboten.\nBut today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.\nExcerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\n\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201d\nTo see what he means, consider that today\u2019s internet giants have lots of ways to insulate themselves from competition. First, anytime competitors succeed, the giants usually also do well \u2014 they get rents from app store revenue, from cloud storage bills and from app-install ads, among other things. And when upstarts come along with services that threaten the Five\u2019s businesses, the giants can simply copy them, and bundle their own versions with their popular products. See how Apple launched its own streaming serviceto compete with Spotify, or howFacebook copiedall of Snapchat\u2019s most popular features.\nBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\n\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201d\nThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\n\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201d\nMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\n\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201d\nIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.\nWell, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\n\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.\nI\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.\nThe giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power."
