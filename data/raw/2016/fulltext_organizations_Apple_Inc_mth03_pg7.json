        "fulltext": "GENEVA \u2014 The top human rights official at the United Nations warned the United States authorities on Friday that their efforts to force Apple to unlock an iPhone belonging to a gunman risked helping authoritarian governments and jeopardizing the security of millions around the world.\nThe remarks by Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, came as American investigators continued to press Apple to write software to help them gain access to an iPhone used by one of the gunmen ina shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. Though the F.B.I. says it is a one-time request,Apple and others have raised concernsthat the case could set a precedent and could force technology firms to install so-called back doors in devices, potentially invading customer privacy.\nMr. al-Hussein said that American law enforcement agencies, in trying to break the encryption protecting one phone, \u201crisk unlocking a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d and that there were \u201cextremely damaging implications\u201d for the rights of many millions of people, with possible effects on their physical and financial security.\n\u201cA successful case against Apple in the U.S. will set a precedent that may make it impossible for Apple or any other major international I.T. company to safeguard their clients\u2019 privacy anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said ina statement. \u201cIt is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers.\u201d\nLast month, a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the iPhone used bySyed Rizwan Farook, one of two gunmen in the San Bernardino shooting, and the F.B.I. has said it wants Apple to write software that would give them access to the device.\nApple has resisted the order on the grounds that it violates the company\u2019s right to due process and that forcing it to write the software tramples on First Amendment rights. After some hesitation, many of the technology industry\u2019s biggest names, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo, have filed court briefs supporting Apple and challenging the legal foundations of the government\u2019s case.\nThe high commissioner, who usually avoids taking positions aligned with commercial interests, said he felt strongly that American officials needed to weigh the uncertain benefits of gaining access to one phone against the broader effects of breaching personal security.\n\u201cIn essence, what we have here is an issue of proportionality: In order to possibly \u2014 but by no means certainly \u2014 gain extra information about the dreadful crime committed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, we may end up enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world, including in the United States,\u201d he said.\nThe F.B.I. deserves full support in its investigation into the San Bernardino killings, Mr. al-Hussein said, but \u201cthis case is not about a company and its supporters \u2014 seeking to protect criminals and terrorists \u2014 it is about where a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set.\u201d\nThe encryption debate was \u201ctoo focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cThe other side of the security coin is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security.\u201d\nThe high commissioner\u2019s intervention builds on growing awareness and concern among human rights experts about the crucial role of encryption for safeguarding freedom of speech and of opinion.\n\u201cEncryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,\u201d David Kaye, a United Nations expert on freedom of expression, said in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council last year, addressing ways to shield individuals from scrutiny in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments."

        "fulltext": "Timothy D. Cook has found himself in a strange position. It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple\u2019s flagship product, and won\u2019t tell its chief executive what it is.\nThat could be becauseApple doesn\u2019t payoutside hackers who find exploitable flaws in Apple software. Paying so-called \u201cbug hunters\u201d has become the norm at many tech companies, and the United States government does it too.\nIn fact, that is probably how it attracted a third party that claims to have a method for cracking the encryption on an iPhone. The government was getting ready to take Apple to court to make Apple decrypt the phone used by the San Bernardino gunman, butlate on Mondaythe Justice Department said an outside party had demonstrated a way to get around Apple\u2019s protections.\nThat announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.\nAnd it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.\nAs Nicole Perlroth writes, Google has paid over $6 million to outside hackers who have alerted it to software bugs in its products that could be exploited by malicious outsiders. Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter, among others, also have such programs. Unique among the giants, Apple appears to stand alone, claiming it sees no benefit in paying people to point out your flaws.\nOne reason may be Apple\u2019s iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.\nNow that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.\nThat may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate \u2014 and shut down."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If theF.B.I.wins its court fight to forceApple\u2019s help in unlocking aniPhone, the agency may run into yet another roadblock: Apple\u2019s engineers.\nApple employees are already discussing what they will do if ordered to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they may balk at the work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather than undermine the security of the software they have already created, according to more than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees.\nAmong those interviewed were Apple engineers who are involved in the development of mobile products and security, as well as former security engineers and executives.\nThe potential resistance adds a wrinkle to a very public fight between Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the authorities over access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif.\nIt also speaks directly to arguments Apple has made in legal documents that the government\u2019s demand curbs free speech by asking the company to order people to do things that they consider offensive.\n\u201cSuch conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple\u2019s core principles and would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple and its engineers,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyers wrote in the company\u2019s final brief to the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.\nThe employees\u2019 concerns also provide insight into a company culture that despite the trappings of Silicon Valley wealth still views the world through the decades-old, anti-establishment prism of its co-founders Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an independent culture and a rebellious one,\u201d said Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, a venture capitalist who was once an engineering manager at Apple. \u201cIf the government tries to compel testimony or action from these engineers, good luck with that.\u201d\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, last month telegraphed what his employees might do in anemail to customers: \u201cThe same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe,\u201d Mr. Cook wrote.\nApple declined to comment.\nThe fear of losing a paycheck may not have much of an impact on security engineers whose skills are in high demand. Indeed, hiring them could be a badge of honor among other tech companies that share Apple\u2019s skepticism of the government\u2019s intentions.\n\u201cIf someone attempts to force them to work on something that\u2019s outside their personal values, they can expect to find a position that\u2019s a better fit somewhere else,\u201d said Window Snyder, the chief security officer at the start-up Fastly and a former senior product manager in Apple\u2019s security and privacy division.\nApple said in court filings last month that it would take from six to 10 engineers up to a month to meet the government\u2019s demands. However, because Apple is so compartmentalized, the challenge of building what the company described as \u201cGovtOS\u201d would be substantially complicated if key employees refused to do the work.\nInside Apple, there is little collaboration among teams \u2014 for example, hardware engineers usually work in different offices from software engineers.\nBut when the company comes closer to releasing a product, key members from different teams come together to apply finishing touches like bug fixes, security audits and polishing the way the software looks and behaves.\nA similar process would have to be created to produce the iPhone software for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A handful of software engineers with technical expertise in writing highly secure software \u2014 the same people who have designed Apple\u2019s security system over the last decade \u2014 would need to be among the employees the company described in its filing.\nThat team does not exist, and Apple is unlikely to make any moves toward creating it until the company exhausts its legal options. But Apple employees say they already have a good idea who those employees would be.\nThey include an engineer who developed software for the iPhone,iPadand Apple TV. That engineer previously worked at an aerospace company. Another is a senior quality-assurance engineer who is described as an expert \u201cbug catcher\u201d with experience testing Apple products all the way back to the iPod. A third likely employee specializes in security architecture for the operating systems powering the iPhone, Mac and Apple TV.\n\u201cIn the hierarchy of civil disobedience, a computer scientist asked to place users at risk has the strongest claim that professional obligations prevent compliance,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThis is like asking a doctor to administer a lethal drug.\u201d\nThere are ways an employee could resist other than quitting, such as work absences. And it is a theoretical discussion. It could be a long time before employees confront such choices as the case moves through the legal system.\nThe security-minded corner of the technology industry is known to draw \u201chealthfully paranoid\u201d people who tend to be more doctrinaire about issues like encryption, said Arian Evans, vice president for product strategy at RiskIQ, an Internet security company. But that resolve can wither when money gets involved, he said.\nAn employee rebellion could throw the F.B.I\u2019s legal fight with Apple into uncharted territory.\n\u201cIf \u2014 and this is a big if \u2014 every engineer at Apple who could write the code quit and, also a big if, Apple could demonstrate that this happened to the court\u2019s satisfaction, then Apple could not comply and would not have to,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cIt would be like asking my lawn guy to write the code.\u201d\nMr. DeMarco, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department, also noted that if the engineers refused to write the code, rather than outright quit, \u201cthen I think that the court would be much more likely to find Apple in contempt,\u201d he said.\nRather than contempt, Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said Apple could incur daily penalties if a judge thought it was delaying compliance.\nThe government has cracked down on tech companies in the past. A judge imposed a $10,000-a-day penalty on the email service Lavabit when it did not give its digital encryption keys to investigators pursuing information on Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked documents about government surveillance.\nThe small company\u2019s response could be indicative of how individual Apple employees reacted to a court order. When Lavabit was held in contempt, its owner shut down the companyrather than comply."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For weeks, the United States government has said that the only way to open an iPhone used by a gunman in a mass shooting was to get Apple\u2019s help, a position that set offa clash between the technology giant and law enforcement.\nBut remarks by a federal prosecutor in a court conference call on Monday and a letter from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., published on Wednesday indicated a recent flurry of activity behind the scenes between law enforcement and other parties that have suggested methods to break into the phone.\nMr. Comey, in aletterto The Wall Street Journal, wrote that the case between Apple and law enforcement over opening the iPhone has stimulated people worldwide to try to get into the device.\nAnd in a court transcript of a conference call on Monday with Apple\u2019s lawyers and Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge presiding over the case, a Justice Department attorney, Tracy Wilkinson, said, \u201cThere have been a lot of people who have reached out to us during this litigation with proposed alternate methods.\u201d\nThe comments offer a window into the action that law enforcement agents have seen in the five weeks since the case first erupted with a court order demanding that Apple help unlock the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in theSan Bernardino, Calif., rampagelast year. While the government\u2019s court filings have painted a picture of agents who had run through all possibilities in opening the device, it appears that since the case became public, they have been presented with more options than publicly indicated.\nThose options were partly the result of how atypical this case has become. The unusual prominence of the fight between Apple and the government \u2014 it brought the sometimesabstract debate over privacy and security mainstream\u2014 generated the cascade of behind-the-scenes approaches by third parties to law enforcement over potential ways to open the iPhone.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. and D.O.J. often pursue these kinds of cases under seal, and the public doesn\u2019t know about them at all,\u201d said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization. Mr. Crocker said the \u201cpublic nature\u201d of this case allowed more people to be involved.\nOn Monday,the Justice Department said a third partyhad offered a potential solution for breaking into the iPhone without wiping the data from the device. That led to a postponement of a court hearing in the matter and a reduction of hostilities between Apple and the government.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nIt is unclear if the third-party method will succeed in opening the device; the government said it would present a status report on any progress by April 5. If law enforcement cannot open the phone with help from the third party, the Justice Department may still ask the court to decide whether or not to require Apple to help investigators break into the gadget.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. The agency is not legally obligated to reveal that it has been fielding more potential solutions for opening the phone.\nApple said it declined to speculate on the F.B.I.\u2019s methods and actions. The Silicon Valley company has previously expressed doubts that the government could find no way to break into its iPhone, even as it constantly updates its security protocols.\n\u201cGiven the past exploits that have bypassed the lock screen and the present-day reality of innumerable security firms, malicious actors, cybercriminals and potential adversaries of the United States constantly seeking vulnerabilities,\u201d it seems improbable for the government to conclude that the only way into the phone was for Apple to write new code and weaken its security, Erik Neuenschwander, the company\u2019s manager of user privacy said in a recent court filing.\nThe F.B.I. has tried many ways to get into the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, such as exploiting a previous bug that allowed unsigned code to be loaded and run on the device, Stacey Perino, an electronics engineer with the F.B.I. has said in a court filing in the case.\nThe F.B.I. also tried tools made by the agency and a mobile forensics company, Cellebrite, which let older iPhones load and run code that could crack a device passcode, Ms. Perino wrote. Cellebrite describes itself on its website as a subsidiary of Sun Corporation, a publicly traded Japanese company; it has done work for a number of government agencies.\nYet none of those tools worked, Ms. Perino wrote in the court document that was filed March 10.\nChristopher M. Allen, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the agency could not comment on the identity of the outside party.\nMr. Crocker of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said having to run through additional viable options had slowed government efforts to compel Apple to weaken its security functions.\n\u201cIn having to consider these third-party solutions, I think the D.O.J. has been given a small taste of its own medicine,\u201d Mr. Crocker said."

The password mechanism built into the phone will erase the phone\u2019s data after 10 incorrect password attempts. That security is standard on newer iPhones, and to get around it, Apple says it would have tocreate new software.\nThecompany has fought a federal court orderrequiring it to provide access to the F.B.I., on the grounds that it violates its right to due process.\nApple has said that forcing it to write new software violates its First Amendment right, an argument that has some precedent. Courts have ruled in the past thatwriting code is a form of free speech.\nProviding help to break into this one iPhone, Apple has also argued, could create a permanent way to bypass iPhone password protection for law enforcement officials or even the spy agencies of other countries.\nIn asimilar case in Brooklyn, a judge ruled in Apple\u2019s favor in late February. The Justice Departmentappealedthat ruling. Unlocking the iPhone in the Brooklyn case would be far easier for Apple, because it involves a device running an older operating system with simpler encryption.\nThe Justice Department said in a filing on March 21 thatit believes it has found another way to get into Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. It cautioned, however, that it still needed to be tested.\nIn the case of Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone, the F.B.I. lost a chance to capture data from the phonewhen it ordered that the gunman\u2019s password to iCloud, the Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices,be reset shortly after the rampage.\nF.B.I. personnel apparently believed that by resetting the iCloud password, they could get access to information stored on the iPhone. Instead, the change had the opposite effect \u2014 locking them out and eliminating other means of getting in.\nSimply put, the government contends that cooperation in cases like this could help prevent terrorist attacks against Americans.\nPrivacy advocates and Apple supporters say they worry that if the F.B.I. succeeds in getting access to the software overriding Apple\u2019s encryption,it would create easy access for the governmentin many future investigations.\nApple senior executives, for their part, have said their defiance was not a business choice. But cooperating with the government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally, especially in China, where officials have been pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of technology sold there.\nChina has become Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States. People there spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year.\nSaying yes to the United States government could make it hard for Apple to later say no to China, and saying no could significantly affect the company\u2019s bottom line.\nGoogle, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and a parade of other technology companies fileda barrage of court briefson March 3 in support of Apple.\nDespite what the F.B.I. says, many in the industry worry the San Bernardino case could be a prelude to many others, and they point to a number ofother pending casesin which the government wants Apple\u2019s help to unlock iPhones.\nThough officials like Defense Secretary Ashton Carter say it is not the case, industry leaders worry the government is trying to create a permanent \u201cback door\u201d that would allow investigators or spies to circumvent encryption or password protection.\nApple and law enforcement officials have been explaining their positions to boththe publicandCongress, but in the end it is a court case, not a popularity contest.\nBothAppleand theJustice Departmenthave filed briefs and the federal court was scheduled to hold a hearing on the matter in California on Tuesday, March 22.\nHowever, on Monday, the 21st,the government was granted a requestto postpone the hearing, saying that it mightno longer need Apple\u2019s assistance to extract data from the phone used in the attack. Government lawyers are expected to report on their progress on April 5.\nAdvertisement"
