        "fulltext": "Q.I bought a multifunction printer a few years ago for printing from my Mac, but now I\u2019d like to take advantage of the scanner to digitize some documents. It is not immediately obvious how to use the scanner part of the printer, though. Do I need to download software?\nA.When you installed the driver software that originally came with the multifunction printer/scanner, you may have also added a utility program for scanning. Take a look in your Mac\u2019s Applications folder for programs from your printer\u2019s manufacturer.\nFor example, if you haveHewlett-Packard hardwareand installed the default programs when you were setting it up, check for a Hewlett-Packard folder containing \u201cHP Scan\u201d and other software for use with the printer. You can also download updated versions for your model from the support area of the manufacturer\u2019s website.\nMost recent versions of the Mac operating system (macOS Sierra and earlier editions of OS X) can use the system\u2019sSoftware Updatefeature to automatically download the necessary software for scanning. When your software is ready to go and the printer/scanner is connected and powered on, you can also scan from the Printers & Scanners box \u2014 select the Scan tab above the model name and click Open Scanner to get the scanning controls.\nMacs come with other programs for scanning,too. The sameImage Capturesoftware that imports photos from a connected digital camera canpull in images from a scanner. Just select the connected scanner from the Devices list in the program\u2019s window to get started.\nApple\u2019sPreviewprogram for viewing and editing images and PDF files can alsohandle scans; with the scanner connected and a document on the glass, open Preview, go to the File menu and choose Import From Scanner. Both Image Capture and Preview should be waiting for you in the Mac\u2019s Applications folder."

It will be a breathtaking gathering of some of the most valuable companies in the world.\nBut asDavid Streitfeld reports, the agenda for this round table is full of topics that Mr. Trump has been discussing for some time \u2014 but which will not necessarily make the tech companies look good.\nThere is the matter of jobs. Tech companies, many of which have outsourced their manufacturing outside the United States and have advanced trends like automation, are not in a particularly strong position to argue they have spread jobs throughout the country.\nThere is the matter of the repatriation of money into the United States. Tech companies such as Apple have held billions of dollars outside of the country for years without bringing those funds back in for tax reasons. Again, these companies do not have the strongest hand here.\nThere is also how unpredictable Mr. Trump himself might be andhow he might use Twitteras a pulpit after the meeting to proclaim victory against the tech companies or to castigate the executives. The president-elect has been unafraid to criticize all manner of companies in the past few weeks \u2014 Boeing, Carrierand Lockheed Martinamong them \u2014 using Twitter.\nEven if the companies and Mr. Trump get along, whatever the tech firms do to cooperate with the president-elect might be assailed back home in Silicon Valley, which has been wary about the president-elect. Kara Swisher of the technology site Recodewrote on Mondaythat the tech executives \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves for lining up like sheeple after all the numskull attacks Trump has made\u201d on the tech sector in the past.\nStay tuned for who comes out of the meeting smelling the sweetest, if anyone."

        "title": "An iPhone\u2019s Journey, From the Factory Floor to the Retail Store",
        "fulltext": "ByDavid Barboza\nThe iPhone is Apple\u2019s most profitable and best-selling product. More than a billion have been sold since the first one was released.\nAbout half of all iPhones now are made in a huge manufacturing facilityin the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. This is the story of how an iPhone made there can end up in your hands.\nApple buys many of the components for iPhones \u2014 like the memory chip, the modem, the camera module, the microphone and the touch-screen controller \u2014 from more than 200 suppliers around the world. Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that runs the Zhengzhou facility, even produces some smaller parts, such as metal casings.\nApple orders many of the components from global suppliers, and then sells them, en masse, to one of its contract manufacturers based in China. In Zhengzhou, that means Foxconn.\nFoxconn\u2019s facilities in Zhengzhou cover 2.2 square miles and can employ up to 350,000 workers, many of whom earn about $1.90 an hour. The operation does what is called F.A.T.P., or final assembly, testing and packaging.\nThere are 94 production lines at the Zhengzhou manufacturing site, and it takes about 400 steps to assemble the iPhone, including polishing, soldering, drilling and fitting screws. The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day, or roughly 350 a minute.After the iPhone rolls off the assembly line, it is placed in a sleek white fiberboard box, wrapped and put on a wooden pallet, and then wheeled out to waiting trucks.\nThe newly assembled iPhone is transported a few hundred yards beyond the factory gate, where China built a large customs facility. The customs operation sits in a so-called bonded zone, which allows Apple to sell the iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.\nAs the final point of assembly for the iPhone, China also serves as a starting point for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy. In Zhengzhou, often in the customs facility, Foxconn sells the completed iPhones to Apple, which in turn resells them to Apple affiliates around the world.\nThe process, most of which takes place electronically, allows Apple to assign a portion of its profits to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale. The system is not unique to China.\nIPhones bound for the United States and other parts of the world leave customs by truck and are transported three miles to the Zhengzhou airport. The airport has been significantly expanded in recent years, as production of the iPhone has increased.\nSome years ago, personal computers that were made in China were transported to the United States by container ship, with a trip lasting about a month. Smartphones are small enough to be shipped by plane in huge quantities \u2014 and cost effectively. A single wide-body Boeing 747 can easily carry 150,000 iPhones tucked into its aluminum canisters.\nFrom Zhengzhou, UPS, FedEx and other freight carriers typically fly United States-bound iPhones to Anchorage. There, they refuel, before going on to Louisville, Ky., a major logistics hub, or other points in the country.\nFor an iPhone headed for the China market, customs officials use an electronic system to virtually stamp the goods as \u201cexports\u201d and then restamp them as \u201cimports.\u201d In Zhengzhou, the process happens in the same customs facility just outside the factory.\nOnce the products are declared an import, customs can collect a 17 percent value-added tax, a kind of national tax, based on the import price. Afterward, the goods are approved for transport around China.Domestic-bound iPhones are typically loaded onto a large truck and taken on an 18-hour drive from Zhengzhou to Shanghai, in eastern China, where Apple has set up its national distribution center. A single tractor-trailer holds up to 36,000 iPhones. Because the vehicles have about $27 million worth of freight on board, they are equipped with cameras and sometimes accompanied by armed security guards.\nAfter the iPhone leaves the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, it takes two days, on average, to get to a store in Shanghai, a 590-mile trip. It takes three days, on average, to get a store in San Francisco, some 6,300 miles away.\nChinese customers can pay much higher prices, because of currency fluctuations and the country\u2019s hefty value-added tax.\nA 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 sells for about $776 at the Apple Store in Shanghai. In New York, it goes for $649.\nRelated"

        "title": "Forget AT&T. The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.",
        "fulltext": "The proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly.\nBut if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.\nMark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\n\u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.\nLook at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.\nAlphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet\u2019s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.\nGoogle and Facebook can achieve huge net profit margins because they dominate the content made available on the web while making very little of it themselves. Instead, they both have built their advertising businesses as \u201cfree riders\u201d on content made by others, some of it from Time Warner. The rise of these digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries of our country.\nEvery pirated music video or song posted on YouTube or Facebook robs the creators of income, and YouTube in particular is dominated by unlicensed content. Google\u2019s YouTube has an over 55 percent market share in the streaming audio business and yet provides less than 11 percent of the streaming audio revenues to the content owners and creators. But Facebook, which refuses to enter into any licensing agreement on music or video, is challenging YouTube in the free online video and music world.\nIn the past decade, an enormous reallocation of revenue of perhaps $50 billion a year has taken place, with economic value moving from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms.\nI reached this conclusion from the following statistics: Since 2000, recorded music revenues in the United States have fallen to $7.2 billion per year from $19.8 billion. Home entertainment video revenue fell to $18 billion in 2014 from $24.2 billion in 2006. United States newspaper ad revenue fell to $23.6 billion in 2013 from $65.8 billion in 2000.\nAnd yet, by every available metric, people are consuming more music, video, news and books. During that same period, Google\u2019s revenue grew to $74.5 billion from $400 million.\nThe former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had \u201csucked up $27 million\u201d of the paper\u2019s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.\n\u201cThey are taking all the money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey have algorithms we don\u2019t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.\u201d\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just for musicians, authors, filmmakers or even the phone company. As the former Google \u201cdesign ethicist\u201d Tristan Harris wrote, \u201cIf you control the menu, you control the choices.\u201d\nWe have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the menu (Google\u2019s search rankings and Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed). How that menu is determined by these black box algorithms isn\u2019t known by anyone outside those companies. As more and more of our lives become digital, these new algorithms will assume more power over our lives.\nRegulators should take a hard look at the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. After the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, suggested that what was needed were hearings that would also include Alphabet and Facebook. She\u2019s right.\nBut in some ways, that\u2019s just fighting the last war. We have gone through a long election cycle without any discussion about the unregulated world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley giants. Perhaps in January we can have an honest national conversation on monopoly and our future."

        "title": "Mario, Nintendo\u2019s Mustachioed Gaming Legend, Arrives on iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 What happens when one of the best-selling games in history comes to the most popular category of electronic devices in the world? A mustachioed plumber in overalls is about to reveal the answer.\nOn Thursday, after nearly a decade of doing its best to ignore the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets, Nintendo is finally bringing a game based on its beloved character Mario to mobile devices.\nPeople have been able to play Mario games on portable devices made by Nintendo since the early 1980s, but the release of the new Super Mario Run represents the first time Nintendo has put out an installment for devices made by another company \u2014 in this case, iPhones and iPads from Apple.\nIt is a watershed moment for a game character who is as recognizable to many as Mickey Mouse. Mario is widely estimated to be thebest-selling game franchiseever, with more than a half-billion copies sold since the plumber first showed up in the game Donkey Kong in 1981. So iconic is the character that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan,appearedat the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this year dressed as Mario to promote the next Summer Games in Japan.\nReleasing Mario on phones and tablets was once an unthinkable move for a quirky company that had for years insisted that making both game software and the hardware it ran on was essential to its magic.\nNintendo finally relented as general-purpose mobile devices increasingly cut into sales of its portable game players. Other games publishers filled the void on mobile devices left by Nintendo, threatening to erode the relevance of its game properties, including Zelda and Donkey Kong, for a new generation of players.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really let their brand wilt the last few years,\u201d said David Cole, a games analyst with DFC Intelligence. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve seen how strong that brand still is. There is potential to bring it back.\u201d\nNintendo made some curious choices with Super Mario Run that suggest it is not yet entirely comfortable with mobile devices. The game will require a constant internet connection, which could make it difficult to play on airplanes, in subways and in other areas where connections are unreliable or nonexistent. Company executives have saidin interviewsthat Nintendo is requiring an internet connection, in part, to prevent piracy of the game.\n\u201cWe remain confident that the play style means that the game can be played in a wide range of locations and situations,\u201d Kit Ellis, a Nintendo spokesman, said in an emailed statement.\nNintendo is also pricing the game in an unconventional way for the mobile market. While it will allow players to sample portions of Super Mario Run for free, Nintendo will charge $9.99 for full access to the game. A vast majority of mobile games are free, but some provide players with opportunities to pay $1 or more for useful items inside a game or for access to new challenges.\nOnly a few mobile games \u2014 Minecraft is one notable example \u2014 have successfully charged as much as Nintendo plans to, analysts said.\n\u201cTen bucks for the mobile environment is really high,\u201d said Joost van Dreunen, chief executive of SuperData Research, a firm that tracks the games market. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough ticket.\u201d\nStill, it is hard to understate the passion players feel for Nintendo games, sustained by an almost bottomless well of nostalgia for the company\u2019s products from the 1980s and 1990s. Earlier this month, a $60 miniature version of an old Nintendo console, called the NES Classic Edition,sold outin stores within minutes of going on sale. Nintendo-themed areas arecomingto Universal theme parks in Japan, Hollywood and Orlando, Fla.\nThis summer, Pok\u00e9mon Go, a mobile game based on an entertainment property partly owned by Nintendo, was anenormous hit. That game, created by an independent company called Niantic, benefited from the fact that it was free to play. It also made innovative use of a technology called augmented reality, awarding points to players for capturing Pok\u00e9mon characters that they found in public locations through their smartphone cameras.\nMitch Lasky, a venture capitalist with Benchmark and a longtime investor in games companies, said the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go shows how much pent-up demand there is for Nintendo properties on devices made by other companies. He also said he was encouraged that Shigeru Miyamoto, the renowned Nintendo game designer who created Mario and other Nintendo classics, had a hand in Super Mario Run.\n\u201cI think Mr. Miyamoto is the greatest game designer of his generation, and his apparent involvement on Run gives it a ton of credibility,\u201d Mr. Lasky said.\nThe game has also benefited from months of promotion by Apple. Just before Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 in September, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, announced Super Mario Run and invited Mr. Miyamoto to show it off on stage. The company has heavily promoted the game in its app store since then, with a banner at the top urging fans tosign up to be notifiedthe moment it is available to be downloaded. As of mid-October, 20 million people had done so, according to Apple, which declined to release a more current figure.\nLast week, Apple began offering visitors to its retail stores a sneak peek at the game, with a playable demonstration version loaded onto the iPhones and iPads on display. Mr. Miyamoto alsosat for an interviewin front of a packed house at Apple\u2019s store in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\u201cThis is unprecedented marketing support from Apple,\u201d said Randy Nelson, the head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics firm. He predicted Super Mario Run would be \u201cin terms of downloads, the largest app launch in history.\u201d\nWith so many new games arriving on mobile phones, keeping players engaged is always a challenge. Even Pok\u00e9mon Go faded after the initial hype. According to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm, 23 million Americans played it at least once in November, down from 66 million in July.\nDo not expect Nintendo to stop making its own game players anytime soon. The companyrecently revealedplans to begin selling a new console, Switch, in March that can be played both on televisions in the home and on the go. Analysts believe Nintendo\u2019s primary focus will be on its own devices rather than on mobile games.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more of a sideshow in their overall strategy,\u201d said Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research. \u201cI don\u2019t think Nintendo is getting out of the hardware game.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple and Nokia Battle Over Cellphone Patents",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone is a technological marvel. You can watch streaming video on it, download apps, take photos with its camera and give voice commands to Siri, its digital assistant. You can even make old-fashioned voice calls on it.\nNokia, the Finnish company that was the world\u2019s largest cellphone maker until its business was decimated by Apple and makers of Android-based phones, claims none of those features would exist without its inventions, which were made over many years and after billions of dollars were invested in research.\nFor the past five years, Apple has paid Nokia a modest royalty for the use of its patents. But with that pact about to expire on Dec. 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple license additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia\u2019s price and has accused it of extortion.\nThe impasse, after two years of tense negotiations, broke intoopen warfarethis week in avolley of lawsuits in 11 countries, including the United States and Germany.\n\u201cApple is saying, we want to pay one low price and not have to deal with any of your patents again,\u201d Clem Roberts, an intellectual property lawyer at Durie Tangri in San Francisco, said. \u201cNokia is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want that low price because my patents are worth more than that.\u2019\u201d\nThe fight underscores just how much today\u2019s smartphones rely on an earlier generation of technology. It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best.\n\u201cObviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,\u201d said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. \u201cOn the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.\u201d\nPatent disputes are common in the technology industry. This month, for instance, Samsung won a partial victory over Apple when the United States Supreme Courtruledthat it should not have to give up all of its phone profits for copying the look of Apple\u2019s iPhone. Google, part of Alphabet,won a similar caseagainst Oracle in May after it was accused of copying software code used for Android, the search giant\u2019s smartphone operating system.\nBut the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change.\nWhen the Supreme Court a decade agolimited the leveragethat patent owners had to stop sales of a product that violated their patents, it empowered patent users to play hardball in negotiations, Mr. Roberts, the intellectual property lawyer, said.\nCompanies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licenses with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than a billion dollars a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say.\nNokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to so-called patent trolls \u2014 a derisive term for companies that buy others\u2019 intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users \u2014 with Nokia sharing in any profits.\nIn itslegal filingon Tuesday, Apple claimed that this strategy was a conspiracy between Nokia and its patent partners, which include Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management, to raise patent prices in violation of federal antitrust law.\nApple said Acacia and Conversant had filed 52 cases against the company around the world, many asserting violations of Nokia patents. In September, Acacia won a$22.1 million jury verdictagainst Apple, and last week, Conversantwon$7.3 million.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple\u2019s own inventions they had nothing to do with,\u201d Apple said in a statement about the case.\nIn response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan, on Wednesday and Thursday, accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price.\n\u201cAfter several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple\u2019s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,\u201d Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia\u2019s patent business, said in a statement.\nAnalysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy.\nEricsson, which also had a longstanding legal dispute with Apple before theyagreed to a new licensing deallast year, similarly has a large portfolio of patents \u2014 including technology for how smartphones make calls and how video is beamed onto a handset.\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,\u201d Gustav Brismark, Ericsson\u2019s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents.\nIn the past, Mr. Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson\u2019s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements.\nCentral to the latest dispute between Apple and Nokia is what is a fair and reasonable fee to use Nokia technology that is now part of every smartphone. Patent lawyers say there has been a tradition of charging a modest royalty for patents on standard technologies. Previously, Nokiafoughtbitter legal battles with other smartphone makers, including Samsung and LG, over how they used its patents.\nAs Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to license more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed on Wednesday, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years.\nStill, Mr. Roberts said American courts have been skeptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. \u201cThe whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,\u201d he said.\nBut Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily.\n\u201cWhat is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?\u201d Mr. Brismark of Ericsson said. \u201cYou have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.\u201d"

        "title": "Text Messaging Takes More Apps Into a Chattier Realm",
        "fulltext": "WHETHER it\u2019s by iMessage, WhatsApp, Snapchat, or Facebook\u2019s Messenger or Instagram, we collectively send billions of text messages daily. This fast-paced method of communication has become so ingrained that other apps have borrowed the chat format for different purposes.\nTake a look atHooked. The app takes the idea of epistolary storytelling into the 21st century by delivering a story to readers in tiny chunks that emulate a text-message-based conversation. All someone has to do is click \u201cnext,\u201d and speech bubbles purportedly from each of the characters in the story appear on screen and scroll upward as in a real chat.\nThis app feels unsettling to use at first. But after a while, Hooked becomes fun, and the stories are compelling, particularly the horror-based ones. There\u2019s something satisfyingly voyeuristic about reading someone else\u2019s texts, even though they are fictional.\nHooked has a home page that tempts you to read different stories based on title and a thumbnail image. You can also search by category, like \u201ctop picks\u201d or \u201csci-fi,\u201d or type in a keyword. If you set up a free profile inside the app and feel creative, you can compose and share stories of your own.\nThe interface is fairly easy to use, though sometimes it can be confusing. While you can download the app and read stories free oniOSandAndroid, there are time limits, so you can read only parts of a chat story \u2014 then you must wait awhile to read more. It costs $3 a month and as much as $40 annually to get access to all the features to read when you like and to submit your own pieces.\nAmazon has an app similar to Hooked calledRapids. The difference is that while Hooked has content of all types, Rapids is a chat-based story app aimed squarely at a younger audience.\nWith children ages 7 to 12 years old in mind, the story lines cover simple themes and are edited to be amusing. A glossary allows children to look up the definitions of unfamiliar words. The interface is easy to use, the graphics are cartoonlike and each character has a cheerful cartoon avatar to help identify which person is relating which parts of the story. You can opt to have the story read aloud, which is great for bedtimes.\nYet the idea of telling stories to youngsters in this ultrashort style seemed a bit much to me, particularly if you feel that children are already too distracted by the attractions of the internet. And while Rapids is free to download oniOSandAndroidand there is a short free trial, it costs $3 a month to get all the content.\nIn many ways, episodic messaging in story apps is not new. The format was a big feature of anews app called Circa, which was briefly popular a few years ago.\nWhereas other news apps published straightforward stories, much like those you would read on other websites, Circa revealed the news in short chunks. This supposedly made it easier to keep up with what was happening in the world in real time because you could quickly scan the headlines and a few introductory paragraphs of each story. If you were particularly interested in a story, you could follow it to read more as the events unfolded and the story was updated. But Circa ultimatelyfailed to raise enough money to keep goingand the app was shut down.\nMore recently, theQuartznews app has taken the core idea of Circa and raised it to a whole new level of emulating text messaging. Getting the news from Quartz\u2019s app feels much like having it revealed to you as a series of instant messages. You can answer questions posed by the app by choosing responses that are much like instant messages; these tell it which news stories you would like to read. It also delivers chat-like notifications on a phone or Apple Watch to keep you updated on events.

        "title": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At the top of the agenda when President-elect Donald J. Trumpmeets with tech leaders on Wednesday afternoon: jobs, jobs and more jobs.\nOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.\nThe top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.\nBut mostly, it will be about jobs. The tech community has put its products in every home and pocket, generating enormous wealth along the way. But the companies employ relatively few people, and the wealth is concentrated in places like Silicon Valley and Seattle. Changing this equation isthe task of Peter Thiel, the tech investor who is now advising Mr. Trump.\nThe meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.\nA Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.\nThose attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:\n\u25a0 Elon Musk of Tesla\u25a0 Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent\u25a0 Timothy D. Cook of Apple\u25a0 Satya Nadella of Microsoft\u25a0 Jeff Bezos of Amazon\u25a0 Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook\u25a0 Safra A. Catz of Oracle\u25a0 Brian M. Krzanich of Intel\u25a0 Chuck Robbins of Cisco\u25a0 Ginni Rometty of IBM\nThe companies are generally keeping a low profile about the event. Several of them wereMr. Trump\u2019s targets during the campaignover issues as varied as offshoring, digital security and antitrust issues. They also saw how a post-Election Day meeting with television executives, while supposedly off the record,turned into public humiliationafter Mr. Trump attacked them.\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\n\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201d\nMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.\nThere is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.\nTwo companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.\nPerhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.\nAirbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.\nAn Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.\nApple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.\nOn Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.\nApple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.\nSoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son,pledged last weekto the president-elect that his company would invest $50 billion in the United States and create some 50,000 jobs. After Mr. Trump tweeted that news, some pointed out that the fund had been created before the election and that much of the investment would probably have been in this country no matter what.\nApple\u2019s discussions with SoftBank, which was the first Japanese telecommunications company to sell the iPhone in Japan, are not close to completion, the person briefed on the talks cautioned. And the discussions began well before Mr. Son\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. The talks werereported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Apple declined to comment.\nSilicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.\nMr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.\nMs. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.\nAnd on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\n\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201d"

        "title": "How to Defend Yourself Against Apple\u2019s Calendar Spam",
        "fulltext": "Q.The problem of spam in the iCloud calendar seems to be getting worse. Is Apple officially doing anything about it?\nA.Apple is aware of the current wave of spam messaging showing up as iCloud calendar or photo-sharing invitations. The company released a statement on Nov. 30 that read, \u201cWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.\u201d\nSpam has been infiltrating email, text messages, social media and other forms of communications for decades and, as people often do on those mediums, ignoring the unwanted calendar requests is one way of dealing with the situation. But if you find the garbage invitations too annoying as you wait for Apple to isolate and block spammers from abusing its system, you can still use these workarounds.\nTurning offiCloud Photo Sharingin your iCloud or iOS Photos & Camera settings \u2014 at least until Apple gets the spam blockade in place \u2014 lets you avoid the photo-sharing spam. To divert invitations to your iCloud mail for easy deletion, log into your iCloud account in your web browser, select Calendar and click the gear-shaped settings icon. Select Preferences, click the Advanced tab and in the Invitations area, switch it to the email option.\nTo dump existing calendar invitations without replying to the spammers, open theCalendar appon your iOS device. Tap Calendars at the bottom of the screen, then the Edit button in the top-left corner. In the iCloud area, select Add Calendar, name it Spam or whatever you\u2019d like and tap Done.\nReturn to the main calendar and select the spam invitation in the Inbox. Under the invitation name, tap Add to Calendar and then pick your new Spam calendar. Return to the main calendar screen, tap the Calendars button and then Edit again. In the iCloud list, tap Spam, scroll down to the bottom to choose Delete Calendar and then confirm your decision to zap the Spam calendar for good."

        "fulltext": "Q.In regard to parental supervision, which mobile platform is best for a child\u2019s first smartphone \u2014 Android or iOS?\nA.When choosing a smartphone for your child, factor in the amount of parental control you want to have over the device, and the types of phones already used by other family members. Cost and flexibility may also be considerations. Before making a decision, it may be useful to have a chat with the child about what the phone will be used for \u2014 and how to behave with it.\nThe online Parent Tech Guidedescribes the differencesbetweenGoogle\u2019s Android systemandApple\u2019s iOS software. The site highlights Android\u2019s looser control over what app developers can do, but notes the greater number of versatilethird-party parental control appsavailable; some versions of Androidsupport user profiles that can be somewhat restricted. In comparison, Apple generally keeps a tighter grip over its iOS system and the apps that run on it, although additional device management software can also be downloaded.\nGoogle includesparental controls for its Google Play Store. Apple\u2019s restrictions settings for iOSnot only block access to the App Store (and certain types of content), but also control built-in apps, features and settings on the iPhone. In a phone-to-phone comparison late last year, theTech Fix column found iOS superior to Androidfor overall parental controls.\nOver the years, Apple\u2019s more strictly curated App Store hashad fewer problemswith malware and privacy-invading apps, but the gap has closed and both companies have stepped up defenses to keep children from running up the credit card bill with unsupervised in-app purchases. TheGoogle Play Family Libraryand Apple\u2019sFamily Sharingtools for iOS allow family members to manage and share digital content purchased from their respective online stores.\nBothAndroidandiOSinclude built-in device tracking for locating the phone on a map.\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that has been adapted by many manufacturers to run on their own hardware, which can mean cheaper phone but a less consistent user experience. Apple makes its own hardware and software for its mobile gadgets (as well as for its laptop and desktop computers), so its products tend to work well together. The company also hasits own trade-in programthat may be useful when the child is ready for an upgrade; iPhones have traditionally hada better resale valuethan their Android counterparts.\nFor many parents, buying that first phone for a child is the easy part, but there are plenty of resources online for dealing with the social and safety aspects of smartphone ownership. For example, theCommon Sense Mediasite has a\u201cCell Phone Parenting\u201dsection with a collection of articles to help parents manage their children\u2019s smartphones.Connect Safely, a nonprofit technology education organization, has a helpful nine-page PDF called\u201cA Parent\u2019s Guide to Mobile Phones\u201dthat offers advice and tips for those getting ready to take the plunge."
