        "title": "Hi, Alexa. How Do I Stop You From Listening In On Me?",
        "fulltext": "Many of us ask the digital companions in our homes, whether it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Alexa,Apple\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant, to handle innocuous tasks like setting a timer and playing music.\nWhat most of us may not realize is that in some instances, there might be a person listening in, too.\nIn two separate reports in The Guardian and Bloomberg News, whistle-blowers recently said they had listened in onSiri recordingsandAlexa activationsthat inadvertently recorded couples having sex and criminals making drug deals. Another publication, VRT, chronicled how a Google subcontractor shared more than1,000 excerpts from Google recordings, which journalists then used to identify some individuals.\nIn the tech industry, it\u2019s an open secret that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t all that smart yet. It takeslots of people manually sifting through datato train the computing systems. That means humans occasionally cull through voice recordings to train Alexa, Siri and Google to understand the nuances of speech, such as distinguishing spoken words like \u201cAustin\u201d from \u201cBoston,\u201d or \u201cU2\u201d from \u201cYouTube.\u201d\nBut tech companies have been opaque in disclosing these practices to us. And they may also have overreached in the types of recordings that they gather.\nGoogle, Apple and Amazon have since publicly said that less than 1 percent of recordings were subject to human review. Apple and Google alsosaidthat they suspended their human review programs, while Amazon expanded its Alexa assistant to include a suite of privacy controls.\nThat got me wondering: What can we do to protect our privacy with these smart assistants, short of chucking them into the recycling bin?\nThe good news is that there are steps we can take. Amazon and Google offer the ability to disable human vetting for their virtual assistants. Apple has said it plans to release a software update that will let people opt in to its program, which involves humans grading Siri samples for quality control, rather than being part of the program by default.\nAnd there are other things we can do, such as deleting recordings and turning off sensors, to minimize the information shared with the companies.\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive guide on what to do to protect your privacy with each of the virtual assistants.\nAmong smart assistants, Alexa has the most comprehensive and straightforward set of privacy controls. Amazon recently released theAlexa privacy hub, which has a thorough explanation of the types of data collected by the virtual assistant and how to change its privacy settings.\nOpen the Alexa app on your smartphone and tapSettingsand then selectAlexa Privacy.\nTapManage How Your Data Improves Alexa.\nFor the control that saysHelp Improve Amazon Services and Develop New Features,toggle the switch to theoffposition.\nIn the sameAlexa Privacymenu, selectReview Voice History.\nIn date range, select the time frame of recordings you want to delete, such asAll History.\nTapDelete All Recordings for All History.\nAlexa devices include a physical button to disable their microphones.Hit the kill switchwhenever you are having sensitive conversations. The device will illuminate with a red light to indicate that the microphone is off.\nSome Alexa devices, like the Echo Spot alarm clock, have a built-in camera. The easiest way to disable it is tosay, \u201cAlexa, turn the camera off.\u201dIf you still feel uncomfortable with the camera, consider buying acheap webcam coverthat can slide over the lens.\nAmazon said in a statement that it takes customer privacy seriously. \u201cWe continuously review our practices and procedures to ensure we\u2019re providing customers with the best experiences and privacy choices,\u201d the company said.\nSiri is the most lacking in privacy controls among the virtual assistants, and the process to manage user data is the least straightforward.\nFor example, Apple does not offer an option to let people opt in to its so-called grading program, though it has said it plans to do so in a future software update. In addition, there is no ability to review Siri recordings associated with your account, and deleting recordings is cumbersome.\nSiri does take some steps to mask your identity. When you make requests with an iPhone, for example, the device associates those with a random identifier instead of your Apple account ID,according to the company. To reset that random identifier, you can turn off Siri and then turn it back on.\nDisabling Siri will also delete your data associated with it, including recordings.\nOpen theSettingsapp, then tapGeneral, thenKeyboards. In theEnable Dictationcontrol, switch it to the off position.\nReturn to theSettingsapp. SelectSiri & Search. Then disable the switches forListen for \u201cHey Siri\u201dandPress Side Button for Siri. You will then see a message asking if you want to disable Siri, which will remove your data from Apple\u2019s servers. TapTurn Off Siriand your Siri history will be deleted.\nTo re-enable Siri, go back to each of those settings and turn them back on.\nSome of the sensitive recordings uploaded to Siri appeared to have come from unintentional activations, like when the crown of the Apple Watch was pressed down by accident, which summoned the assistant. (In my experience, this can happen when leaning a hand against a couch cushion.)\nTo prevent the watch crown from triggering Siri,disable the Siri side button on the iPhone. In the Settings app, tap onSiri & Search, then toggle offPress Side Button for Siri. This will simultaneously disable the shortcut on the watch.\nApple declined to comment beyond an earlier statement announcing the suspension of its Siri-grading program.\nGoogle offers some controls for tweaking privacy settings for Google Assistant on Android phones and Google Home smart speakers, among other products.\nWhile Google\u2019s human review program is suspended, you can still make sure you\u2019re not a part of it by opting out. The search company also lets you automatically delete Google Assistant requests made after a period of time.\nVisit Google\u2019sweb toolcalledActivity controls.\nScroll down toVoice & Audio Activity. Toggle this switch off.\nAgain, visitGoogle\u2019s Activity controlsweb tool.\nUnderWeb & App Activity, clickManage Activity.\nClickChoose to Delete Automatically. Then clickKeep for 3 months then delete automatically.\nA Google spokesman declined to comment and referred to a blog post, in which the company described its process ofworking with human language reviewersto improve speech recognition."

        "title": "Lawsuit Over Computer Chips Invokes Trade War With China",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the biggest semiconductor makers in the United States on Monday initiated a broad legal attack on Taiwan\u2019s dominant chip manufacturer, the latest twist in a complex geopolitical battle over electronic components that could affect big chip users like Apple and Google.\nGlobalfoundries, which runs former IBM chip factories in New York State and Vermont but is owned by an Abu Dhabi investment firm, filed a series of suits accusing the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company of infringing 16 patents covering processes used in manufacturing computer chips.\nThe suits were filed in two federal courts in the United States and two German courts. Globalfoundries also complained to the United States International Trade Commission.\nIn addition, the suits name a number of companies that either design chips manufactured by T.S.M.C. or use chips manufactured by that company in devices such as smartphones and networking equipment. Those defendants include Apple, Google, Qualcomm, Cisco Systems, Nvidia, Broadcom, Xilinx, Lenovo and Motorola.\nOne Globalfoundries trade commission complaint said a series of products that use chips built by T.S.M.C., including Apple\u2019s iPhone XS, iPhone 7, Airpods, Watch 4, TV 4K and iPad mini, should be excluded from import to the United States.\nGlobalfoundries\u2019 surprise move underscores the electronics industry\u2019s overwhelming reliance on T.S.M.C., a large manufacturer of chips designed by other companies. The Taiwanese company accounts for nearly 50 percent of the market for outsourced chip production, the market research firm TrendForce estimates. Globalfoundries claims the T.S.M.C. share of production of the most advanced chips is nearly 90 percent.\n\u201cHow did we let that happen?\u201d asked Saam Azar, a Globalfoundries senior vice president in charge of legal and government affairs. These suits, he added, were \u201cdesigned to protect the manufacturing base of America.\u201d\nReliance on foreign manufacturers has worried Defense Department officials who are concerned about trusted sources of components for advanced weapons and intelligence-gathering systems, and the Trump administration has repeatedly complained about theft ofUnited States intellectual property, particularly by China.\nAnalysts said Globalfoundries might have been emboldened by Trump administration comments about the trade war with China.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like someone in the U.S. State Department gave them the green light for this suit, and said \u2018We\u2019ll give you air cover,\u2019\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, with Moor Insights & Strategy.\nGlobalfoundries, though it has been setting up manufacturing facilities of its own in China, said in its trade commission complaint that T.S.M.C. recently completed construction on an advanced chip plant in that country that rides \u201cthe shift in global supply chains out of the U.S. and Europe into Greater China.\u201d\nT.S.M.C. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The other defendants, including Apple, either declined to comment or could not be immediately reached.\nGlobalfoundries\u2019 move, involving 25 separate complaints, is unusual. Many chip manufacturers concluded decades ago that so many common techniques were being used by rivals that it made more sense to issue so-called patent cross licenses rather than be tied up in endless litigation.\nAnother issue is that suing a company like T.S.M.C. runs the risk of angering current or potential customers for Globalfoundries. Mr. Azar stressed that Globalfoundries was compelled to name direct and indirect T.S.M.C. customers to help seek a ban on imports of products containing infringing technology, a common legal strategy to put pressure on defendants in intellectual-property cases.\nGlobalfoundries was founded in March 2009 from former manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Devices. It later expanded with the purchase of Chartered Semiconductor. The company in 2015 took over former IBM facilities in East Fishkill, N.Y., and Essex Junction, Vt., a deal that came with a $1.5 billion payment from IBM.\nThe IBM deal included over 16,000 patents. But Globalfoundries stresses its own substantial technology investments, including a $15 billion factory in Malta, N.Y. Mr. Azar said a majority of patents cited in the T.S.M.C. case were developed separately by Globalfoundries.\nHis company last year announced it was stopping development of advanced production processes beyond those now being used at Malta. It also announced a deal to sell the East Fishkill plant to ON Semiconductor by the end of 2022, and has lately said it has begun turning a profit."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Watch Is Smarter, but My Casio Keeps Getting the Job Done",
        "fulltext": "IPhones haven\u2019t beensellingparticularly well, Apple reported this summer, but itswatchesare becoming wildly popular. And no wonder.\nThe Apple Watch is elegant, versatile and frequently gains new powers. It can track the distance you run, measure the noise you hear on the street, record your heartbeat, play your favorite tune and place a phone call. (Yes, it can even tell time.)\nNew models of the watch, and of the iPhone, are expected in September. How they fare in the marketplace will help to determine whether Apple continues to be one of the most valuable companies in the world.\nBut impressive though the constantly updated Apple Watch may be, I don\u2019t wear one, at least not yet. Instead, I\u2019m sticking with a classic Casio. In its own modest way, it is a marvel, too.\nCasio says my spare, black, monochromatic watch will operate smoothly for at leastseven yearswithout needing a battery charge. And the Casio watch is uncannily accurate. It doesn\u2019t gain or lose more thanthree minutesin an entire year.\nPerhaps most important, it is astonishingly cheap, a claim that I wouldn\u2019t make for any Apple product. The F-91W Casio that I wear has a list price of$18.95; I bought it forless than$11. A slightly more elaboratesport watch, the DW-290favoredby the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and hisdeputies, can be bought forabout$35.\nThose are bargain-basement prices compared with the$279to$1,499that Apple charges for the current models of its watch.\nIn this era of rampant planned obsolescence, the Casio watch remains a remarkable outlier: a once-advanced device that has been available for a quarter-century and still does exactly what it was designed to do.\nStill, my Casio is limited in what it can do: It is just a watch. Basically, it reports the time, date and day of the week, and functions as a little alarm clock and as a stopwatch. Press a button and it lights up in the dark. I\u2019ve worn it in the shower, in swimming pools and in the ocean, although such behavior isn\u2019t recommended. The watch isn\u2019t guaranteed to survive immersion.\nSturdy as it is, the watch won\u2019t last forever. You can replace the battery and the plastic resin watch band, but I\u2019ve found that doing so can be tedious. Since Casio introduced the F-91W in 1989, I\u2019ve owned several, and some of its cousins, which date to the 1970s. Casio called them technological\u201cmiracles\u201dback then. It is their continued availability at reasonable prices, not their aging technology, that makes them minor miracles today.\nReplacing the originals was my choice over the decades; it wasn\u2019t forced on me by Casio.\n\u201cRepairing devices is better for the planet than buying new ones,\u201d said Kyle Wiens, a founder of iFixit, a website with do-it-yourself manuals and other resourcesgeared toward teaching\u201cpeople how to fix almost anything.\u201d Mr. Wiens contrasted Casio, which makes battery replacement a straightforward if delicate task, with companies like Apple, which directs consumers to the company\u2019s own stores or certified technicians.\n\u201cThese companies are deliberately making it more difficult for people to repair their devices,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they push people to replace existing devices that work perfectly well. That\u2019s planned obsolescence.\u201d\nMichael Waldman, a Cornell University economics professor, expanded on that idea.\n\u201cI would define \u2018planned obsolescence\u2019 as the practice of coming out with innovations more quickly than is efficient from the standpoint of social welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a company, it\u2019s a way of maximizing profits, perhaps at some cost to consumer welfare.\u201d By that definition, he said, Apple is engaging in planned obsolescence, while Casio is not.\nConsider what will most likely happen in the fall, when Apple introduces new operating systems. The company says iPhones that can handle that update will be able to operate in\u201cdark mode.\u201dThat should cut back on emissions of light and, perhaps, ease eye strain.\nI\u2019d like to use dark mode but I can\u2019t, unless I reach for my wallet. That\u2019s because my iPhone 6, and olderiPhones, won\u2019t be compatible withiOS 13, the forthcoming version of Apple\u2019s operating system. Owners of older iPads will be in a similar predicament. And owners of new Apple Watches but older iPhones won\u2019t be able toupdatetheir watches unless they get a newer phone.\nHow bad will this be for consumers? In an email, Apple said, \u201cWe work hard to provide our users with exciting new features every year while maintaining performance,\u201d adding that \u201cthis is a difficult challenge, and at some point we need to stop updating older devices so we maintain a good user experience with strong performance.\u201d Even for those older devices, the company said that it would issue security updates it deemed critical \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nIf you\u2019ve got an older Apple device, though, at some point it won\u2019t be able to do everything it does now. I\u2019ve experienced that with an older iPad Mini. Eventually, I found that it could no longer display all of the news reports to which I subscribed, and I replaced it. That will probably happen with my iPhone 6.\nAs I wrote last year, I\u2019ve only been able to hold onto the phonethis longbecause of a battery replacement program that Apple instituted after reports that it was throttling the speeds of older devices. The company is being sued by people who accuse it of deliberately shortening the working life of its products. Apple denies the accusations.\nThese days, in an effort to encourage purchases of new phones, Apple is buying back older iPhones that it refurbishes and resells, often to people living outside the United States.\nIs it coincidental that just as iPhone sales have stalled, Apple is effectively pushing people like me into buying new phones? Maybe. But using multiple levers \u2014 style shifts, marketing and changes in functional design \u2014 to persuade consumers to replace products is an effective and longstanding strategy.\nThat\u2019s not true for just Apple, but for other technology companies, carmakers and razor blade and clothing manufacturers. Planned obsolescence has been practiced for decades but it has been elevated into a corporate art form lately.\nThat\u2019s why it seems to me that simply creating good, inexpensive products that rarely need to be replaced has become an extraordinary accomplishment. Yet Casio, whose sales have been flagging, doesn\u2019t boast about its practices. The company declined to comment for this column.\nThe stock market favors Apple\u2019s approach, not Casio\u2019s. In the five years through Wednesday, Casio\u2019s share price has dropped more than 20 percent. The price of Apple stock has more than doubled in that time.\nDaniel A. Levinthal, a professor of corporate strategy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said: \u201cGiven a choice, most companies would rather be in the position of Apple, which has been innovating and successfully developing new products and bringing them to market and getting consumers to buy them \u2014 than in the position of Casio, which has been much less successful at that, even if it is selling some fine products.\u201d\nThat makes the retro Casio watch even more special. It doesn\u2019t belong entirely to this time."

        "title": "The Phony Patriots of Silicon Valley",
        "fulltext": "Not long ago, many leading technologists considered themselves too lofty and idealistic to concern themselves with the petty affairs of government.John Perry Barlow, a lion of the early internet, addressed his \u201cDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u201d to the \u201cgovernments of the industrial world,\u201d saying that for him and his fellow netizens, these creaky institutions had \u201cno moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.\u201d\nBut that was before privacy scandals, antitrust investigations, congressional hearings, Chinese tariffs, presidential tweets and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\nNow, as they try to fend off regulation and avoid being broken up, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over their Allbirds in a race to cozy up to the United States government. These companies\u2019 motives vary \u2014 some are vying for lucrative public-sector contracts, while others are lobbying against regulation by painting China as a red menace that must be defeated for the good of the country.\nEither way, the game is the same: Salute the flag, save our bacon.\nThe latest example of Silicon Valley\u2019s patriotic playacting comes courtesy ofPeter Thiel, the Trump-backing venture capitalist. Inan op-ed in The New York Times this month, Mr. Thiel took Google to task for opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing while canceling a controversial Pentagon contract, accusing the company of trying to \u201cevade responsibility for the good of the country.\u201d\nMr. Thiel\u2019s obvious conflicts of interest aside (he is on the board of Facebook, Google\u2019s rival, and is the chairman of the technology firm Palantir, which haslucrative government contractsof its own), seeing him lecture anyone on patriotism is rich. He was among the first majorsupportersof the Seasteading movement \u2014 a group of libertarians who wanted to flee the United States and build a floating city in international waters \u2014 and in 2011, hebecame a New Zealand citizenafter buying up property there. (\u201cIt would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen and an enthusiastic supporter of the country,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in his citizenship application.)\nBut Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, is far from the only tech titan trading in his hoodie for a flag pin.\nMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief, has also been warning that if the social network \u2014 the proud,Americansocial network, that is \u2014 is broken up or harshly regulated, it will be only a matter of time before China takes over the global tech industry.\nInan interviewlast year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if Facebook were broken up by American regulators, \u201cthe alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies.\u201d\nDavid Marcus, one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lieutenants and the executive in charge of Facebook\u2019s digital currency project, Libra, echoed that point while testifying before Congress last month.\n\u201cI believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIf we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\u201d\nMr. Zuckerberg, who speaks Mandarin, is an odd choice to lead the charge against China. He has spent much of the last decade trying desperately tocurry favorwith the Chinese government in hopes of getting Facebook\u2019s apps \u2014 which are banned there \u2014 permission to operate in one of the world\u2019s most lucrative markets. Mr. Zuckerberg evenreportedly offeredto let Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, name his second child. (Mr. Xi declined.)\nGoogle, too, is rallying around the flag. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai,went to the White Houseto visit with President Trump in March, to discuss government contracts and reassure the president that Google does not discriminate against conservatives.This month, in a series of tweetsattacking Mr. Pichai and Google, Mr. Trump recalled that meeting, which he described as \u201cMr. Pichai working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China\u2019s military, that they didn\u2019t help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election.\u201d\nLike Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China booster before he began distancing himself from the country. Last year, Mr. Pichai had a large team of Google engineersbuilding a prototype search engine, called Dragonfly, that was designed to be compatible with China\u2019s censorship regime. The project was dropped amid heated internal dissent from Google employees. But itreportedlywould have blocked sites like Wikipedia, as well as other material considered objectionable by Chinese authorities.\nAmazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone toelaboratelengthsto avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also promoting themselves as national champions. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple\u2019s plans to do some of the assembly of its Mac Pro in China, the companyreiteratedits desire to keep much of the computer\u2019s assembly in the United States. And Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, hasknocked rival firmsfor insufficient patriotism, saying that \u201cif big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all declined to comment.\nConspicuous patriotism is not a new tactic for companies accused of bad behavior. In the 1980s and 1990s, defenders of American tech giants like IBM and Microsoftarguedthat those companies\u2019 monopolistic behaviors were necessary to stave off competition from Japanese rivals. During World War II, Hollywood movie studios delayed a federal antitrust crackdown, in part byagreeing to helpthe military in the war effort.\nMeredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University and a former Google employee, characterized the tech industry\u2019s scaremongering about China as a tactical move meant to deflect criticism.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really convenient narrative,\u201d Ms. Whittaker said. \u201cIt evokes nationalism and a red scare trope that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be counter to \u2018winning.\u2019\u201d\nPatriotic posturing may be a cynical tactic, but it could also be a smart one. Today\u2019s big tech companies are in a better negotiating position than most industries under fire. The meteoric growth of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon has bolstered the American stock market and made Silicon Valley a global innovation hub. Even if the motives of the tech giants are questionable, the importance of technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence to the country\u2019s competitive position isn\u2019t lost on lawmakers.\nRepresentativeRo Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley in Congress, has called for greater regulation of tech companies. But in an interview this month, he told me that the risk of losing ground to China worried him.\n\u201cThere is a risk that we could see a Berlin digital wall,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cThe question is, are the values of liberty, privacy and freedom of speech going to be embedded in technology platforms? China\u2019s platforms do not have many of the values that liberal democracies believe in.\u201d\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with the belief that America\u2019s values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should act in the country\u2019s best interest. But lawmakers should be appropriately wary of Silicon Valley\u2019s charm campaign, and they should avoid conflating what\u2019s good for Facebook, Google and other tech companies with what\u2019s good for the nation. Tech executives might be whistling \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\u201d but they really just want to be left alone."

Bill Gates was 19 when he foundedMicrosoftwith Paul Allen. Steve Jobs was 21 when he foundedApplewith Steve Wozniak. The origin stories of those companies and a handful of others helped to shape a myth that tech, and American innovation overall, is fueled by wunderkinds. But fresh-faced founders are the exception, not the rule, according to the study.\nThe research, by the economists Pierre Azoulay of M.I.T., Ben Jones of Northwestern, J. Daniel Kim of the University of Pennsylvania and Javier Miranda of the United States Census Bureau, provides the first systematic calculation of the ages of the founders of high-growth start-ups in the United States.\nPrevious studies had documented that owners of small businesses tended to be in their late 30s and 40s. But most small businesses stay fairly small: restaurants, dry cleaners, retail stores and the like. They are important but aren\u2019t central to innovation in the economy.\nThe new study was able to zero in on high-flying start-ups by bringing together anonymized data collected by different agencies within the federal government. The government matched sales and employment data for start-ups collected by the Census Bureau with information on the founders extracted from Internal Revenue Service filings.\nAfter stripping identifying information, the government provided the researchers with a data set including 2.7 million business founders. The researchers calculated that the founders\u2019 average age was 42. And for the founders of the 0.1 percent fastest-growing firms, the average age was 45. Firms that were successful enough to have an initial public offering or be acquired by a larger company showed the same pattern: Their founders were generally middle-aged.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that youth has no advantages.\nYounger people often have a risk-taking mind-set and that might help them develop game-changing ideas. In addition, raw problem-solving ability \u2014 whatpsychologistscallfluid intelligence\u2014 seems to peak early. It may already be declining by the time we\u2019re in our 20s.\nStill, the findings on age and entrepreneurship echo earlier myth-busting by researchers about scientific breakthroughs. While Albert Einstein did pathbreaking work on special relativity and the photoelectric effect at 26, such early discoveries aren\u2019t typical. A study of Nobel laureates in physics over the 20th century found that those scientists did their prizewinning work atan average age of 37.\nIn applied science, crystallized intelligence, gained through experience, appears to be even more vital: Nobel-worthy breakthroughs in medicine arrived a bit later, at age 40, on average.\nIn short, entrepreneurial success isn\u2019t just a function of raw intelligence and a propensity for risk-taking. It depends on a variety of ingredients, many of which appear to improve with age.\nConsider Mr. Fadell\u2019s story.\nHe started working in Silicon Valley in the early 1990s, designing products at General Magic and Philips Electronics. In the 2000she moved to Apple, where he led the engineering team that created the iPod digital music player, and played a crucial role in the development of the early iPhone. In 2010, after amassing all that experience, he founded Nest withMatt Rogers, a young Apple engineer.\nIn an interview, Mr. Fadell recounted how, after he left Apple, he and his family traveled the world and designed an eco-friendly home for themselves in Lake Tahoe. He said he was dissatisfied with the clunky thermostats offered by his contractor or visible during his travels.\n\u201cThermostats were ugly, outdated, and didn\u2019t help you save money or keep you comfortable,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. He recalls thinking: \u201cThere\u2019s something fundamentally wrong here and there\u2019s no product in the market to address it.\u201d So he created a new thermostat and a new company.\nMr. Fadell said he had tried to start successful companies in college and earlier in his career but they failed because he wasn\u2019t ready.\n\u201cThere were a lot of things I needed to learn to finally be able to nail it,\u201d he said. He learned about product design at General Magic, he said, and about managing teams and financing at Philips Electronics. At Apple, he said, Mr. Jobs showed him how to go beyond designing a product; the key, Mr. Fadell said, was to design the customer\u2019s whole experience, from packaging to messaging.\nWhen he needed to recruit a team for Nest, he said, he was already a Silicon Valley veteran. \u201cI\u2019d been in the Valley for 20 years so I had a huge network of people I\u2019d worked with before,\u201d he said.\nHis thinking, as an older man, was different, too. In his 20s, he said, he was barely aware of thermostats. \u201cCollege students know what college students need,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get older, you start to need and understand other things.\u201d\nA lot of innovation in business benefits from experience. Youth has its triumphs, but some roads to success are lengthy. They require age and staying power."

        "title": "Trump Has Succeeded. Now Lots of Chinese People Are Buying Huawei Phones.",
        "fulltext": "BEIJING\u2014 Earlier this week the Chinese government aggressivelydevalued its currency\u2014 theclearest sign yetthat it is hunkering down for a protracted fight with the United States over trade.\nCurrency devaluation is the mother of all retaliations. The move, designed to help offset the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs against China,could goad America into a currency war, and thatwould rattle the global economymore than any trade war. It also carries significant risks for China, including capital flight and inflation.\nYet the Chinese government seems confident that it can weather these side effects. Why? Because its entrenched position has won over the Chinese public. It has managed the public relations feat of casting the trade war with America as a war not on China,but on China\u2019s people. President Trump\u2019s maximum-pressure tactics has stiffened the resolve of the Chinese government and made it harder to win concessions from it.\nWhen his administration first imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in March 2018,reactions in China were muted. Some Chinese liberals evenviewed Mr. Trump as something of a savior, who might force China to open up and reform its economy.\nBut many people\u2019s tune changed in late 2018 after the United States imposed sanctions on the company Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, and the Canadian authorities, acting at America\u2019s request,arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and a daughter of the company\u2019s founder. The origins ofthe United States\u2019 Huawei investigationpredate the Trump administration: Career officials at the Justice Department were exploring cases against Huaweias early as 2010, under President Barack Obama. But it was Mr. Trump who escalated the Huawei affair, turning a discrete legal case into the showpiece of his broadertrade war.\nAnd yet, much as there was a bipartisan consensus in the United States about getting tough on China, there now seems to be a consensus among both liberals and ultranationalists in China that America is trying to undermine the welfare of the Chinese nation itself. To this perception,Chinese consumers have respondedby buying Huawei\u2019s phones in huge quantities \u2014 even though Ren Zhengfei, the company\u2019s founder, himself has discouraged consumers fromthinking that buying its products is a patriotic act.\nHuawei\u2019s sales increased by 23 percentin the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2018, despite an economic slowdown in China and sanctions from the United States. According to the research firm Canalys, the number of mobile phones thatHuawei shipped in Chinaincreased by 31 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the second quarter oflast year.\nBut this rally is a show of support for Huawei specifically. Other Chinese companies have fared badly in China. The shipments of Oppo, a domestic rival of Huawei\u2019s, declined by 18 percent over the same period; those of Vivo, another Huawei competitor, by 19 percent; and those of Xiaomi, also a competitor, by 20 percent. (In comparison, Apple\u2019s shipments declined by only 14 percent.) Chinese consumers, in other words, appear to have rallied around the one Chinese company that America has pointedly targeted rather than around Chinese companies in general.\nAmericans may think of Huawei as a pawn or willing partner of the Chinese government, but in the eyes of many Chinese people the company symbolizes high-tech and entrepreneurship \u2014 and success in the face of political adversity.\nHuawei was never a darling of the Chinese government\u2019s industrial policy, and plenty of state-owned companies that were, likeGreat Dragonand Shenzhen Electronic Group, haven\u2019t made it onto Mr. Trump\u2019s blacklist. It is Huawei, not those other companies, that pioneered 5-G technology, the next generation of wireless networks that the United States sees as a national security risk.\nHuawei succeeded despite, not because of, the Chinese government\u2019s industrial policies. It is a genuinely private company, owned by its employees. In the 1990s, when the authorities strictly regulated and restricted population mobility, Huawei had trouble obtaining residency permits for staff members in Shenzhen.\nHuawei went to Europe to get away from China\u2019s skewed business environment, and it has become China\u2019s top technology firm because it learned to thrive in brutally competitive international markets. No Chinese company can operate without government support, of course, and in 2004 Huawei receivedcredit from the China Development Bankto expand into developing countries. But it earned recognition from the Chinese government onlyafter passing the market test.\nGoing hard on Huawei was the wrong way for the United States to confront China over its grievances \u2014 even if many of them are entirely valid.\nHuawei did commit intellectual property theft, but it is also investing heavily in research and development. According to the European Union\u2019s Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, in 2019 Huawei ranks fifth in the world in R&D spending, ahead of Apple (which is seventh). Some 45 percent of its employeesare working on R&D. By Chinese standards, the company is collaborative: While it has developed its own operating system, it has also kept using Google\u2019s, Android. Its supply contracts with American companies amount to some $11 billion a year. It counts manyforeign citizenson its staff, includingat senior levels. And so \u2014 supreme irony \u2014 the Chinese who celebrate Huawei seem to do so precisely because it stands for values that should resonate with Americans, too: a can-do attitude, independent outlook and openness to the world.\nOne early misstep of the Trump administration concerns ZTE, another Chinese telecom company. In the spring of 2018, the United States Commerce Departmentprohibited American companies from selling critical chips to ZTE. But the Trump administration laterreversed that decision\u2014 bringing ZTE back from the brink of bankruptcy.\nUnlike Huawei, ZTE is a state-owned company subsidized by the Chinese government and, apparently, garners little love fromthe Chinese public. It also isa weaker companythanHuaweiand, therefore, more vulnerable to being derailed. Targeting ZTE first would have also allowed the United States to keep bolder measures in reserve and escalate matters by confronting Huawei later if that proved necessary.\nInstead, the Trump administration has endorsed going all-out against Huawei \u2014 threateningto blacklist the company, seeking the extradition of Ms. Meng. On Wednesday, it issued a rulelimiting business between United States government agenciesand Huawei, as well as other Chinese companies (this time, including ZTE).\nYet such maximum-pressure tactics have delivered no meaningful results \u2014 other than undermining the good will of the Chinese public and its liberals towardAmerica. The United Statesshould de-escalate tensions and help China come back to the negotiating table by decoupling the Huawei issue from its broader trade concerns.\nA trade war \u2014 which now risks spiraling into a currency war \u2014 is no easy thing to win. And it requires a more grounded understanding of Chinese reality than Mr. Trump has displayed so far.\nYasheng Huang is a professor of international management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Dear Walmart C.E.O.: You Have the Power to Curb Gun Violence. Do It.",
        "fulltext": "The following is an open letter to Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart.\nDear Mr. McMillon,\nThemassacreat your store in El Paso over the weekend was a tragedy.\nSo were the shooting deaths, days earlier, of two Walmart employees, at a Walmart store in Mississippi. So, too, was the mass shooting early Sunday in Dayton, Ohio \u2014 and the multitude of others in recent years.\nIt is clear that this country is suffering from an epidemic that law enforcement and politicians are unable or unwilling to manage.\nIn the depths of this crisis lies an opportunity: for you to help end this violence.\nYou, singularly, have a greater chance to use your role as the chief executive of the country\u2019s largest retailer and largest seller of guns \u2014 with greater sway over the entire ecosystem that controls gun sales in the United States than any other individual in corporate America.\nWhat happened over the weekend was not your fault \u2014 but it is your moral responsibility to see that it stops.\nThe legally purchased weapons that were used in the mass shootings did not come from Walmart. But guns in America travel through a manufacturing and supply chain thatrelies onbankslike Wells Fargo, software companies like Microsoft, and delivery and logistics giants like Federal Express and UPS. All of those companies, in turn, count Walmart as a crucial client.\nEconomists have a term for the kind of influence you wield: economic leverage.\nWalmart has used this leverage for years over its suppliers, partners, distributors, rivals \u2014 even cities and states.\nNow you have the chance to use that clout to help fix a system that is clearly broken, to solve a crisis whose costs are measured in lives, not just in profits and losses.\nOther chief executives are already stepping up. For example, Marc Benioff of Salesforce recently pushed his company tostop working with retailersthat sell automatic and certain semiautomatic firearms, high-capacity magazines for ammunition and a wide variety of accessories.\nEd Stack, chief executive of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, was an early mover in removing guns from his stores. He brought important attention to the issue. But unlike you, with your huge scale, he did not have enough leverage to create real, systemic change.\nYou havealready stoppedselling handguns and assault-style weapons and raised the age limit to 21 to buy a gun from your stores (though you still sell rifles and certain other types of guns). I commend you for that.\nSome critics have suggested that Walmart stop selling guns entirely, but you can use your influence over gun makers for good.\nYou could threaten gun makers that you will stop selling any of their weapons unless they begin incorporating fingerprint technology to unlock guns, for example. You could develop enhanced background checks and sales processes and pressure gun makers to sell only to retailers that follow those measures.\nYou have leverage over the financial institutions that offer banking and financing services to gun makers and gun retailers as well as those that lend money to gun buyers. You could use your heft to influence banks and credit card systems to change their processes around tracking gun sales. They have none.\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, wrote an email to his employees Monday calling on them to \u201crecommit ourselves to work for a more equitable, just and safe society.\u201d Call Mr. Dimon. Tell him you need his help to use the financial system\u2019s plumbing to create a world-class method of tracking gun sales with built-in safeguards. He has resisted \u2014 but you are one of his clients.\nThen call Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who says he is heartsick about the violence. \u201cIt\u2019s time for good people with different views to stop finger pointing and come together to address this violence for the good of our country,\u201d hewroteon Twitter on Sunday.\nMr. Cook should listen to you \u2014 after all, Walmart sells vast quantities of his company\u2019s products. Apple already bans the use of Apple Pay to buy guns and ammunition online, but it hasn\u2019t extended that policy to in-store purchases. Shouldn\u2019t it? And now Apple is preparing to launch a credit card with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard. They could establish a policy from the get-go not to conduct transactions with retailers that sell guns or only those that follow a best-practices protocol.\nAnd what about calling C. Allen Parker, Wells Fargo\u2019s interim chief executive? Wells Fargo is the bank to the National Rifle Association, the leading force against reasonable gun laws.\nNow that there have been killings at your stores, you have a business interest in telling Wells Fargo that as long as the bank works with the N.R.A., you won\u2019t work with it. Wells Fargo boastson its websiteabout a Walmart-sponsored arrangement to provide financing to your suppliers. Maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider that partnership. Or you could go further and consider no longer accepting Wells Fargo-issued credit and debit cards in your stores. Give Mr. Parker the stark choice between working with the N.R.A. and doing business with the country\u2019s largest retailer.\nOver the past decade, Walmart has spent tens of millions on lobbying efforts in Washington, much of it to push for lower corporate taxes, which have juiced your profits. You\u2019ve also lobbied to combat the opioid epidemic and to support veterans.\nIt would be easy for you, and other chief executives, to argue that controlling the gun violence epidemic is Washington\u2019s responsibility, not yours. But in an era of epic political dysfunction, corporate executives have a chance to fill that leadership vacuum.\nThe 22 people who died in your store this past weekend deserve more than words of consolation to their families. They deserve a leader who is going to work to make sure it never happens again."

        "title": "How a Conservative News Site Thrived on Facebook and Google",
        "fulltext": "It may not be a household name, but few publications have had the reach, and potentially the influence, in American politics as The Western Journal.\nEven the right-wing publication\u2019s audience of more than 36 million people, eclipsing many of the nation\u2019s largest news organizations, doesn\u2019t know much about the company, or who\u2019s behind it.\nIn a New York Times investigation, Nicholas Confessore and Justin Bank found that the site, which stokes outrage and curates a narrative in which conservatives and their values are under constant assault, is caught in a high-stakes clash between Silicon Valley and Washington. The site has struggled to maintain its audience through Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s algorithmic changes aimed at reducing disinformation \u2014 actions the site\u2019s leaders see as evidence of political bias.\nYou can read the full investigation here. But if you have time only for the highlights, here\u2019s what the reporters learned.\nThe publication does almost no original reporting, instead repackaging stories found elsewhere that fit into right-wing narratives chosen by the site\u2019s editors. After an editor finds a worthy story, it is handed off to a pool of contract writers, most working remotely. Deadlines are tight: Most articles are filed within an hour or two, and some breaking-news stories are written in as little as 30 minutes.\nIt was a model that worked strikingly well \u2014 for a while. In the three years ending in March, Western Journal posts on Facebook earned three-quarters of a billion shares, likes and comments, nearly as many as the combined tally of 10 leading American news organizations.\nBut each of the tech giants began limiting its reach. Google News blacklisted it for what it considered deceptive business practices, Apple News followed after saying it produced stories that promoted \u201cviews overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community,\u201d and Facebook downgraded The Western Journal after it was repeatedly dinged on fact-checking sites.\nFloyd G. Brown, who founded the site, is a political activist who has chosen writing as his weapon. He began his career with the race-baiting \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad during the 1988 presidential campaign, which used mug shots of a black convicted murderer to stoke fears that the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, was soft on crime.\nIn the 1990s, he peddled opposition research and conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton. In the 2000s, he helped form a network of political action committees that made ads attacking Barack Obama, including one that questioned whether Mr. Obama was a secret Muslim.\nThe company also has unusually close ties with a pro-Trump PAC, America Fighting Back. Mr. Brown is the PAC\u2019s chairman.\nMr. Brown\u2019s son Patrick served as chief executive of the site until he stepped down in August to take a medical leave. Early in his publishing career, Patrick Brown initially focused on uplifting and nonpolitical stories, but eventually adopted its right-wing focus.\nIts leaders didn\u2019t buy explanations from the technology companies on why the publication had been downgraded or suspended, echoing the common complaint in conservative media that Big Tech was biased against them.\nTo cope with the changes, it began, in the words of Patrick Brown, \u201cbacking into something that looks more like a traditional media company.\u201d It launched a corrections page, removed thousands of old stories, published editorial standards and renamed its army of related Facebook pages to tie them to a single brand.\nIt has now rebounded, but is about half of its prior size. Later this year, the Browns will release a smartphone app intended to sidestep the gatekeeping of Big Tech."

        "title": "Huawei Unveils Harmony, Its Answer to Android, in Survival Bid",
        "fulltext": "DONGGUAN, China \u2014 Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, on Friday unveiled its own mobile operating system, Harmony, in an effort to ensure that its fast-growing smartphone business can survive the United States government\u2019s clampdown on the firm.\nHuawei has been at the mercy of the Trump administration for the past three months, ever since the Commerce Department began requiring that American companies apply for special permissionto sell parts and technology to the Chinese firm, which Washington officials accuse of being a potential conduit for cyberspying by Beijing.\nThe moveeffectively choked off Huawei\u2019s access to Google\u2019s Android softwareand American-made microchips and other hardware components, and put a big question mark over Huawei\u2019s future.\nAlthough President Trump said in June thathe would loosen some of the restrictionsto allow American companies to continue working with Huawei, economic ties between the United States and China have grown more tense since then, and the prospect of immediate relief for Huawei seems more distant.\nUnveiling Harmony at a Huawei developer conference in the southern city of Dongguan on Friday, Richard Yu, the head of the company\u2019s consumer business, said that the new operating system was designed to work not only on mobile phones but on smart watches and other connected home devices as well.\nIndeed, the first Huawei products to run on Harmony will not be smartphones but \u201csmart screens\u201d that the company plans to release this year. Mr. Yu said Harmony would gradually be incorporated into the company\u2019s other smart devices over the next three years. But there is no immediate plan, he said, to release Harmony-based phones.\nHuawei\u2019s preference is to continue using Android on its handsets, Mr. Yu said. But he added that there was no technical reason Harmony could not also be used to power a phone.\n\u201cIf we are not able to use the Android operating system, then we can activate Harmony anytime,\u201d he said.\nAt Friday\u2019s developer conference, which was held in a basketball stadium, Mr. Yu described Harmony\u2019s technical features and capabilities, to occasional bursts of raucous applause. But Huawei did not make any devices running the new operating system available for testing.\nHuawei is now the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone vendor, ahead of Apple but behind Samsung. The company\u2019s handsets arebig sellers in Europeand across the developing world, although political pressure from Washington has kept Huawei phones from becoming popular in the United States.\nMr. Yu said he believed that were it not for the Trump administration\u2019s pressure on the firm, Huawei would have finished the year as the planet\u2019s No. 1 smartphone maker. Uncertainty about whether Huawei devices wouldcontinue to support Google servicescaused the company\u2019ssales outside China to plummetafter Washington\u2019s crackdown.\nHuawei began working on Harmony two years ago, Mr. Yu said, and executives at the Chinese firm, which is also a major supplier of equipment for wireless networks around the planet, have been speaking in vague terms about the project for months.In an interviewwith the German newspaper Die Welt that was published in March, two months before the Commerce Department restricted Huawei\u2019s business, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had prepared an operating system as a \u201cPlan B\u201d in case it was cut off from American technology.\nMore recently, Ren Zhengfei, Huawei\u2019s founder and chief executive, has said that the company\u2019s operating system was originally designed for telecommunications networks, not as an Android replacement.\nLike Android, which is far and away the world\u2019s most widely used smartphone operating system, Harmony will be released as open-source software. That means it will be freely available for developers to study, enhance and redistribute.\nThe new operating system\u2019s Chinese name is Hongmeng, a term from Chinese mythology that refers to the chaotic state of the universe before the creation of heaven and earth. But Huawei decided that the name would be too hard for non-Chinese speakers to pronounce, Mr. Yu said on Friday.\n\u201cWe hope to bring greater harmony to this world,\u201d he said."
