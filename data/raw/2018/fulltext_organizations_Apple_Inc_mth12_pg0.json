        "title": "You Should Have the Right to Sue Apple",
        "fulltext": "On Nov. 26,the Department of Justice argued before the Supreme Court in the caseApple v. Pepper, that the millions of us who have bought iPhone applications through Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 the only way the company offers to buy an app for the device \u2014 are not really Apple\u2019s customers.\nSome app buyers allege that the App Store is an illegal monopoly and that Apple forces them to pay higher prices for apps than they would have paid in a competitive market. The question before the Supreme Court is not whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of the law. Instead, this case is about whether app buyers are entitled to present the facts of their case to a court \u2014 and the decision will have consequences for the ability of all Americans to hold corporations accountable for illegal monopolistic conduct.\nUnder a41-year-old precedent,Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, \u201cindirect purchasers,\u201d those who purchased from an intermediary and not from the party that violated antitrust law, cannot sue an alleged monopolist and recover damages. In that case, the court said that state and local governments, which paid higher construction costs to their general contractors as a result of price fixing by cement block manufacturers, could not sue to recover damages from the price fixers. Apple\u2019s lawyers argued that this rule should be used to deny the app buyers in Apple v. Pepper the right to sue Apple, because they, too, are only \u201cindirect purchasers\u201d from Apple. The \u201cdirect purchasers,\u201d Apple says, are the app developers, to whom Apple sells app distribution services through the App Store and who pay Apple a commission on those sales.\nThe Justice Department supported Apple\u2019s reasoning before the court. I sit on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is jointly responsible, with the Justice Department, for enforcement of antitrust laws, and I strongly disagree with our sister agency\u2019s position. Apple users can buy apps only through Apple\u2019s App Store. They must deal directly with Apple as a distributor of iPhone apps rather than with the individual app developers. That is why the lower court decided that consumers are indeed \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d and eligible to sue under the antitrust laws.\nPutting aside the merits of the underlying antitrust claim, this case comes down to first principles. Should the consumers who are potential victims of alleged antitrust violations be allowed to make their case before a judge or jury? Should citizens play a role as a meaningful check against anticompetitive corporate conduct? I believe the answer is yes. America is grappling with serious questions about the levels of concentration and competition in our economy, and the Supreme Court should reinforce rather than constrict the ability of consumers to seek justice for illegal abuses of market power.\nWhen today\u2019s antitrust laws were written a century ago, Congress recognized that government agencies have finite resources, solawmakerscreated a legal mechanism for private citizens to bring suit for damages. The broad language of the Clayton Act provides that \u201cany person\u201d who is harmed by antitrust violations may sue in federal court for those violations. Lawmakers believed that this measure would strengthen antitrust enforcement and deterrence efforts. To encourage private actions, Congress allowed victims to recover three times the amount of damages they suffered.\nFor people who have been victims of anticompetitive corporate conduct, private lawsuits are the primary means for getting compensation. A 2013 study found that 60 of the largest successful private antitrust cases from 1990 to 2011 resulted in at least $33 billion in compensation to victims. Private enforcement also bolsters the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s efforts to stop anticompetitive conduct \u2014 for example, in the pharmaceutical industry.\nA Supreme Court decision that treats iPhone app buyers as too far removed from Apple to bring a federal antitrust suit against the company would undermine Congress\u2019 intent to permit any victim of antitrust violations to seek justice. Worse, it would give a free pass for antitrust law violations in cases in which consumers are the victims with the greatest incentive to go to court. App developers, who Apple claims are the \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d of their app services, may not be inclined to bring an antitrust case against their business partner. Apple is the gatekeeper to the apps\u2019 millions of target customers.\nThe case before the court is not simply about one company or one group of consumers. It is about the right of citizens to hold corporate monopoly power in check in industries across our economy.\nPeople harmed by a company\u2019s illegal monopolistic conduct should be able to seek a remedy from our federal courts to stop and deter corporateconduct that threatens competitive markets.\nAmerica was founded on the promise that every citizen has equal access to the law. Yet in recent years, the Supreme Court hassystematically shut the courthouse doorto consumers, small businesses and workers, especially by forcing plaintiffs out of court and into mandatory arbitration. Apple v. Pepper is yet another instance in which the court will decide whether to keep the courthouse doors open for citizens or to close them before they even get a chance to present their case.\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."

        "title": "Chase for Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This generation\u2019s biggest technology companies \u2014 including Apple, Amazon and Google \u2014 have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.\nDriven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\nThis eastward expansion accelerated on Thursday when Apple said it wouldbuild a $1 billion campus in Austin, expanding its presence there to over 11,000 workers and becoming the area\u2019s largest private employer. The decision followed Amazon\u2019shighly publicized selectionof Queens and Arlington, Va., last month for new offices that would house at least 50,000 employees. Google, too, isshopping for more real estatein New York that could enable it to more than double its work force of 7,000 in the city.\n\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201d\nThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.\nAmazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.\nMany of the companies are trying to cozy up to top engineering schools in cities like Pittsburgh, where Google recently opened an office and where Uber has had a center, or Zurich as they search for hard-to-find talent in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Cambridge, England, nowhosts several A.I. research outpostsfor American tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.\nLike Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.\nThe Seattle area, home to Amazon and Microsoft, is known for experts in cloud-computing services thanks to Amazon\u2019s leadership in that field. Pittsburgh is known for A.I. because ofCarnegie Mellon University\u2019s computer science program. Cambridge, Mass., is associated with robotics, thanks to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And New York is often wherecutting-edge work on financial services technologyis done.\nThe search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\n\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201d\nSome economists said the Trump administration\u2019s tougher immigration policies could also restrict the tech giants from importing skilled workers from abroad to their West Coast headquarters. The Trump administration hasincreased the red tapein applying for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers and has denied petitions more often. Over a five-day window this April, employerssubmitted petitionsfor more than 190,000 specialized work visas, but only 85,000 can be granted annually.\nThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201d\nYet even as the tech companies move beyond the West Coast, their choices toconverge on cities or towns that are already highly educated, wealthy and well employeddo not spread the wealth.\nMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\n\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201d\nAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.\n(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)\nApple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.\nApple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.\nA person familiar with Apple\u2019s decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.\nThe company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.\nSome economists said what was most remarkable was that it took the tech giants this long to aggressively expand beyond the West Coast.\n\u201cIn a sense, what we\u2019re seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said, \u201can industry that\u2019s not located in one incredibly expensive place.\u201d"

        "title": "Don\u2019t Fall for Facebook\u2019s \u2018China Argument\u2019",
        "fulltext": "Over the last year or so, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other American tech leaders have issued a stark warning to those who want to see more competition in the industry. It goes something like this: \u201cWe understand that we\u2019ve made mistakes. But don\u2019t you realize that if you damage us, you\u2019ll just be handing over the future to China? Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201d\nThis \u2014 Big Tech\u2019s version of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d argument \u2014 has a superficial nationalistic appeal. It\u2019s certainly true that the Chinese technology sector is growing and aggressively competitive, and that many of its companies are embraced and promoted by the Chinese state. Byone count, eight of the world\u2019s 20 largest tech firms are Chinese. That would seem to suggest a contest for global dominance, one in which the United States ought not be considering breakups or regulation, but instead should be doing everything it can to protect and subsidize the home team.\nBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.\nThat\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.\nHad the United States followed the Zuckerberg logic, we would have protected and promoted IBM, AT&T and other American tech giants \u2014 the national champions of the 1970s. Instead, the federal government accused the main American tech firms of throttling competition. IBM was subjected to a devastating, 13-year-long antitrust investigation and trial, and the Justice Department broke AT&T into eight piecesin 1984. And indeed, the effect was to weaken some of America\u2019s most powerful tech firms at a key moment of competition with a foreign power.\nBut something else happened as well. With IBM and AT&T under constant scrutiny, a whole series of industries and companies were born without fear of being squashed by a monopoly. The American software industry, freed from IBM, came to life, yielding companies like Microsoft, Sun and Lotus. Personal computers from Apple and other companies became popular, and after the breakup of AT&T, companies like CompuServe andAmerica Online rushed into online networking, eventually yielding what we now call the \u201cinternet economy.\u201d\nBack in Japan, the government was still in love with its champions, promoting NEC\u2019s mainframes, while itdoubled down on supercomputers, which it saw as the obvious future of computing. Japan never broke up NTT, its telephonemonopolist. Over the course of the 1990s, Japan, late to both software and personal computing, began to lag behind the United States. Its brief lead in mobile phone technology was limited by NTT, which left little room for start-ups. Consequently, Japan\u2019s tech sector largely missed out on the software, personal computer and internet revolutions. It has never really recovered.\nThat\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.\nIf we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201d\nAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.\nTim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\u201d\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."

        "fulltext": "PARIS \u2014 With the so-calledYellow Vest movementforcing concessions that have widened the country\u2019s budget shortfall, the French government is accelerating a plan to place hefty taxes on American technology giants that have long maneuvered to keep their bills low while reaping huge sums of money.\nFrance has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal.\nBruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said last week thatFrance would move ahead on its ownif the union did not approve such a tax by March.\nOn Monday, he moved up that date.\n\u201cThe tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to \u201cfight with me\u201d on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201d\nMr. Le Maire estimated the total tax bill for the companies affected at around 500 million euros, or $568 million. It will help pay for\u20ac10 billion in emergency spendingannounced last week by President Emmanuel Macron after waves of angry citizens took to the streets of Paris and other cities to protest growing inequality.\nThe tax, Mr. Le Maire said, would most likely cover not only the companies\u2019 direct sales in France, but also revenue from online marketplaces and the resale of private data. He declined to discuss other details, including the means for introducing the tax or the rate of taxation.\nThe proposal being considered by the European Commission wouldtax digital media companiesbased on where in the 28-member European Union they generate revenue, rather than in the often low-tax countries, like Ireland and Luxembourg, where they have regional headquarters.\nThe push, which has been led by France and Germany, has been resisted by the low-tax countries and has also raised concerns that it willexacerbate Europe\u2019s simmering trade tensions with the United States.\nFrance\u2019s decision to go its own way for now did not appear to derail the European Commission\u2019s proposal.\nA commission spokesman noted in a statement that \u201cabout a dozen E.U. countries already have or are considering a form of taxation of digital activities.\u201d\nThose countries include Britain, where officials recently unveiled a proposal to impose a 2 percent tax on revenue that social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces earn there. Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.\nBut, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201d\nMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.\nAmazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.\nLarge technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.\nFacebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.\nAmazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.\nThe big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.\nFrance and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.\nFrance\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.\nGermany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.\nRegulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.\nThe French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.\nThe European Commissionfined Google\u20ac2.4 billion last year for abusing its dominant market position, while companies likeApple, Amazon andQualcommhave also been investigated or penalized.\nAmazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.\nAnd last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon."

        "title": "Apple to Add $1 Billion Campus in Austin, Tex., in Broad U.S. Hiring Push",
        "fulltext": "Apple said Thursday that it would build a new$1 billion campusin Austin, Tex., where it could eventually employ 15,000 people, amid a broader expansion that will create thousands of jobs in several American cities.\nThe company, which has 90,000 workers in the United States, also plans to open 1,000-worker operations in San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., and add hundreds of employees in offices in New York, Pittsburgh and Boulder, Colo., in the next three years.\n\u201cApple is proud to bring new investment, jobs and opportunity to cities across the United States and to significantly deepen our quarter-century partnership with the city and people of Austin,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.\nThe move coincides with those by other technology giants to expand beyond their West Coast roots. Amazon said last month that it would divide a planned second headquarters between sites in New York and Virginiaafter a yearlong beauty contest, and Google is said to be consideringmore than doubling its 7,000-employee work force in New York.\nApple has been criticized for years for not doing enough for the American economy because it has made most of its products in China and stashed most of its profits abroad to avoid tax payments in the United States.\nIn January, after the company emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of changes in the tax code signed into law by President Trump,it said it would invest more than $30 billion in the United Statesover the next five years and create 20,000 jobs by expanding existing operations and adding a new campus.\nA provision in the code allowed for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.\nMr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.\nIn September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\n\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201d\nNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.\nUnlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.\nThe tech industry\u2019s expansion beyond its West Coast base shows the companies\u2019 increasing importance to the American economy. As Apple, Google and Amazon add jobs and new offices around the country, companies like General Motors areshrinking and cutting thousand of positions.\nThe new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.\nApple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.\n[Photos: In 2016, we went inside Apple\u2019s sprawling Texas campus.See what it looked like.]\nGov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201d\n[Read more: Apple\u2019s rapid growth in Texas has provided a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world\u2019s largest technology company and their economic impact.Read our report.]\nCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.\nBut tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.\nArun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\n\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201d\nApple\u2019s announcement is a sign of the company\u2019s strength after a financially mixed year. In August, it became the first publicly traded American company worthmore than $1 trillionafter a series of remarkably profitable quarters. But its stocktook a hit in Novemberafter the company said it would stop reporting how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter, figures central to understanding Apple\u2019s performance.\nFear of a slowdown in iPhone sales, which account for nearly 60 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue, has weighed heavily on the company\u2019s share price since then. It has beenpulled down furtherby Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestions last month that tariffs might be placed on Apple devices imported from China."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Sundar Pichai Has a Chat With Congress",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHello, dear readers. I\u2019m Daisuke Wakabayashi, a reporter covering Google in our San Francisco bureau. This past week, however, I spent my time in the nation\u2019s capital covering the congressional hearing for Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive. Hefaced questionsabout the company\u2019s data-collection practices, about accusations of bias against conservatives in search results and about Google\u2019s possible plans to provide a censored search engine for China.\nIt was the first congressional hearing I had attended, and the spectacle was eye-opening. It underscored, to me, how Silicon Valley and Washington exist in their bubbles without really understanding each other. Lawmakers seemed like out-of-touch old people with little grasp of how technology works and where the real risks lie. Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google\u2019s business practices.\nAt holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us.\nA New York Times investigationinto the practices of the location-tracking industry came up repeatedly during the hearing and in conversations afterward. Even for people well versed in technology, the volume and specificity of location-data collection was shocking.\nWhile many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn\u2019t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action.\nAll the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth.\nAt bus stops throughout Washington, one of the frequent revolving posters is for the\u201cGrow With Google\u201dcampaign, a feel-good job and technology training program introduced by the company last year. It comes on the heels of Amazon\u2019svery public beauty contestfor HQ2 and, ultimately, HQ3.\n\u25a0 Apple also made clear, in an announcement ofplans to build a massive new officein Austin, Tex., that it, too, creates jobs outside Silicon Valley. Tech companies from the Valley have been opening big offices in other cities for decades, but they\u2019re getting more aggressive about it as they pursue specialized engineering talent.\n\u25a0 An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today\u2019s dominant predator can become tomorrow\u2019s prey. Nokia once dominated mobile phones but lost its standing to Samsung and Apple in the smartphone era.\nSimilarly, Intel, once so overwhelming a force in the semiconductor industry that it was a frequent target of antitrust cases, is struggling to keep pace with a shifting industry. My colleague Cade Metz explained how Amazon is the latest tech companyto start building its own chips, threatening Intel\u2019s grip on the server chip market.\n\u25a0 It\u2019s rare for a bail hearing to make international news, but this was no ordinary arrest.\nMeng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the tech behemoth Huawei and a daughter of the company\u2019s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, for extradition to the United States.\nThe American and Canadian authorities claim Ms. Meng circumvented trade sanctions against Iran, using a Huawei subsidiary. The arrest of a prominent executive at one of China\u2019s biggest tech companies, with close ties to the government, complicates the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations to end a trade war with China.\nOn Tuesday, a judgegranted bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or about $7.5 million. Ms. Meng agreed to 24-hour physical and electronic surveillance and a curfew.\n\u25a0 China was at the center of another interesting tech industry news story. Qualcomm said a Chinese court had orderedApple to stop selling older iPhonesin China. The court, according to Qualcomm, said Apple had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and issued a preliminary injunction on seven older iPhone models.\nIt\u2019s another sign of the deteriorating relationship between the two companies. Apple sued Qualcomm last year, accusing it of monopolistic practices. Qualcomm has accused Apple of patent infringement, while carrying out apublic-relations campaignagainst the iPhone maker.\nDaisuke Wakabayashi writes about Google and other big tech companies from the San Francisco bureau of The New York Times.

        "title": "Apple Computers Used to Be Built in the U.S. It Was a Mess.",
        "fulltext": "In 1988, when Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e took a close look at Apple\u2019s \u201chighly automated\u201d Macintosh factory in Fremont, Calif., what he saw was not pretty.\nMr. Gass\u00e9e,a French specialist in office automation, had just been promoted to president of Apple\u2019s product division by John Sculley, then Apple\u2019s chief executive, andwas responsible for the company\u2019s engineering and manufacturing work. When he first started, Mr. Gass\u00e9e decided to spend two days learning how the company actually built its products by working on a factory production line.\nHis experience assembling a Macintosh computer display and then stuffing chips into a computer motherboard is an important part of the story behind the artful language on the iPhone box \u2014 \u201cDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.\u201d\nAfter Apple announced a large new campus in Austin, Tex. \u2014 creating as many as 15,000 jobs, none of them expected to be manufacturing \u2014 it\u2019s worth looking at the company\u2019s flirtation with advanced manufacturing in Silicon Valley in the 1980s. Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, had an abiding fascination with the tradition of Henry Ford and the original mass manufacturing of automobiles in Detroit, as well as the high-quality domestic manufacturing capabilities of Japanese companies like Sony. But his efforts to replicate either in California were examples of his rare failures.\nIn 1983, Mr. Jobs oversaw the construction of a state-of-the-art plant where the new Macintosh computer would be built. Reporters who toured it early on were told that the plant, located just across San Francisco Bay from Apple\u2019s headquarters, was so advanced thatfactory laborwould account for 2 percent of the cost of making a Macintosh.\n\u201cSteve had deep convictions about Japanese manufacturing processes,\u201d recalled Randy Battat, who joined Apple as a young electrical engineer and oversaw the introduction of some of the company\u2019s early portable computers. \u201cThe Japanese were heralded as wizards of manufacturing. The idea was to create a factory with just-in-time delivery of zero-defect parts. It wasn\u2019t great for business.\u201d\nWhat Mr. Gass\u00e9e found several years after Mr. Jobs was forced out of the company, was that the reality of manufacturing was different than the personal computer pioneer\u2019s original dream.\n\u201cI embarrassed myself attaching a display to the computer bezel with a screwdriver,\u201d Mr. Gass\u00e9e recalled in a recent interview.At the end of his shift,Mr. Gass\u00e9egrabbed a broom and swept up the parts that had fallen off the production line. \u201cIt was really shameful,\u201d he said of the noticeably slipshod process.\nUltimately, the Macintosh factory closed in 1992, in part because it never realized the production volume that Mr. Jobs had envisioned \u2014 such sales numbers for the Mac would only come later.\nSo, the story of Silicon Valley\u2019s success turned out to be the ability of a company like Apple to devise manufacturing supply chains that stretch all the way around the globe, takingadvantage of both low-cost labor and lax environmental regulations.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a manufacturing culture,\u201d Mr. Gass\u00e9e said of the nation\u2019s high-technology heartland, \u201cmeaning the substrate, the schooling, the apprentices, the subcontractors.\u201d\nIt took Mr. Jobs a bit longer tograsp that idea, however.\nIn 1990, just a mile and half from where he had built the original Mac factory, he created another $10 million one to manufacture his Next Inc. personal workstation. Like the early Macintosh, however, he was never able to make flashy jet-black Next machines in quantities to support a Silicon Valley-based assembly operation.\nThat failure taught Mr. Jobs the lesson. He returned to Apple in 1997, and the next year, he hired Tim Cook as Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide operations. Mr. Cook had mastered the art of global manufacturing supply chains, first in IBM\u2019s personal computer business and then at Compaq Computer.\nApple, like many companies in Silicon Valley, had begun outsourcing manufacturing early on. Not long after Silicon Valley emerged in the 1970s, labor-intensive assembly, such as the process ofpackaging semiconductor chips, was moved to Asia,to countrieswith progressively lower labor costs. That trend only accelerated as the company grew.\n\u201cWhen I started my career, all my flights were to Japan,\u201d said Tony Fadell, one of the hardware designers of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. \u201cThen all my flights went Korea, then Taiwan, then China.\u201d\nToday, Silicon Valley has retained a relatively small manufacturing work force, as electronics manufacturing has exploded globally, creating millions of jobs.The small amount of manufacturing still done in the Valley is largely done by specialized contract firms that focus on fast-turnaround prototype systems.\nThe challenge today is that an enormous manufacturing ecosystem is required to make products formass markets, and that ecosystem has largely moved to mainland China, where some450,000 people have worked at a singleiPhone plant.\nIn the early 1990s, when Andrew Hargadon was a product designer at Apple with a portable computer called theMacintosh Powerbook Duo, the ecosystem had already moved to Asia. He worked with a complex web of suppliers.\n\u201cYou can\u2019tbring manufacturing back because of those webs, you would have to bring the entire community back,\u201d said Mr. Hargadon, who is now a professor of technology management at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California, Davis.\nWhen Mr. Jobs fell ill and had to take a leave of absence in 2009, he appointed Mr. Cook as the company\u2019s future chief executive.It was a significant statement about the nature of Silicon Valley and what the mature computing industry there looked like.The dream of manufacturing computers at scale in California was basically abandoned.\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, there were many people who predicted the manufacturing flight would mean the death of Silicon Valley.\n\u201cWhen I started doing research, I begun looking at the chip companies that were moving to low-cost manufacturing regions in the U.S.,\u201d saidAnnaLee Saxenian, the dean of the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of\u201cRegional Advantage,\u201dan early analysis of Silicon Valley\u2019s success. \u201cTheir executives told me that Silicon Valley is going to die because it's too expensive. I wrote my book because I was basically trying to explain why Silicon Valley was different.\u201d\nIndeed, the offshoring of manufacturing jobs didn\u2019t kill the Valley; the region became the world\u2019s leadingindustrial and software design center. But unlike Detroit\u2019s automotive modelof the mid-20th century,relatively few middle-class jobs were created, and the region is marked by a vast concentration of wealth in theupper, white-collar reaches.Hourly workers routinely commute more than 100 miles to their support-staff jobs in the Valley, $100,000 Teslas are a common sight and the median price of a home in Fremont \u2014 the former site of Mr. Jobs\u2019s ill-fated factories \u2014 is $1.1 million."

        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nWise readers! I\u2019m Raymond Zhong, a Times reporter in China \u2014 where, I contend, something is unfolding right now that carries higher stakes than any other tech story on the planet.\nI know, I\u2019m biased. But hear me out.\nChina detainedanother Canadian citizenthis week, the third to have been snatched up in the countrythis month. Beijing denies it, but most people in China see the detentions as retaliation forCanada\u2019s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The United States has accused Ms. Meng of fraud, and is seeking her extradition. She remains in Canada underround-the-clock surveillance.\nIn other words, the United States and China\u2019s contest for technological supremacy has now left four lives hanging in the balance \u2014 hostages to something much larger than themselves.\nTo recap: Huawei is the world\u2019s leading maker of telecom network equipment. You probably don\u2019t ever think about this technology, but it powers our mobile age. Which is why the United States is so nervous that Huawei has become such a powerhouse supplier. Washington has warned for years, without specific evidence, that Huawei\u2019s products can be used for spying by the Chinese government. Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest this month was part of ayearslong effortto curb the company\u2019s rise.\nIt\u2019s an unenviable position for any company to be in \u2014 not least one, like Huawei, that is privately owned and waslong known for secretiveness.\nIn an effort at openness, Huawei this week invited me and a bunch of other reporters to its campuses in southern China, where we toured some research facilities and chatted with Ken Hu, the company\u2019s deputy chairman.\nMr. Hu reiterated points that the company has made for years as it has come underscrutiny around the world. He said that Huawei had a clean record when it came to major cybersecurity incidents. He said that \u201cideological\u201d or \u201cgeopolitical\u201d fears had not cost Huawei the trust of its many customers.\n\u201cConcerns about security should not be aimed without basis at any specific company,\u201d Mr. Hu said. He issued a challenge to governments that raise concerns about Huawei\u2019s products: \u201cIf you have evidence, then make it public.\u201d\nHe declined to discuss the detained Canadians or Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest.\nIn a way, Huawei is itself a hostage oflarger conflicts. The company has built a globally respected brand. It has won customers by investing in research and development, providing attentive service \u2014 and driving its employees really, really hard. (I wrote this week about Huawei\u2019s intense corporate culture.)\nYet to the company\u2019s fiercest critics, Huawei is tarnished simply by being Chinese, and hence within arm\u2019s reach of a government thatconducts aggressive espionageagainst American companies and government agencies. For some people in Washington, it hardly matters that Huawei isn\u2019t state-owned, or that the Chinese government has never asked it to spy on its behalf. The mere possibility is enough.\nAs part of this week\u2019s visit to Huawei, we reporters were treated to a long presentation on the company\u2019s processes for evaluating products for security risks. It was a barrage of details, earnestly presented, that I suspect would have zero chance of changing the mind of anyone in Washington about Huawei.\nHere\u2019s what else caught my eye this week:\n\u25a0 My colleagues at The Times have producedanother blockbuster articlefull of revelations about how user data is collected and shared by giant tech companies.Here are five takeaways.\n\u25a0 The Wall Street Journaltook a lookat Apple\u2019s near-total failure to win over smartphone buyers in a giant, fast-growing market: India. The iPhone is clinging to market share there of around 1 percent, and the company\u2019s revenue in India is half of what executives once hoped for, according to The Journal\u2019s sources. The country simply doesn\u2019t have enough people who are willing to pay Apple prices.\n\u25a0 Well, it was fun while it lasted. TikTok,the quirky short video appthat is nowa worldwide hit, hasa Nazi problem, according to Motherboard. The app\u2019s Chinese parent company, Bytedance, is no stranger to controversies aboutgnarly content on its platforms.\n\u25a0 Finally, I urge you to read thisprofile of Donald E. Knuth, the legendary computer scientist who, for the past 50 years, has been writing \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming\u201d \u2014 a multivolume, still-unspooling bible of its field.\nRaymond Zhong is a reporter for The New York Times in China.
