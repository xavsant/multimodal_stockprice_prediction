        "title": "Tech\u2019s Environmental Impact and What You Can Do About It",
        "fulltext": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives?John Schwartz, a climate reporter, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nWhat does your tech setup look like for work and at home?\nIt\u2019s pretty messy, and it\u2019s all about the laptop. I use a MacBook Pro that I carry back and forth. At work, The Times gives me a big second monitor and a dongle to charge the phone and tie in the backup drive. At home, I have a desk but do much of my evening research and writing in an easy chair in the living room with the laptop propped up on the chair arm.\nMore important than the way my system is set up is what I do with it. I have configured my computer system at work so that along with whatever stories I\u2019m dealing with, the big extra monitor shows me a stream of photos of my grandkids, my children and my folks.\nIt\u2019s no news to readers that the technologies we use can make us jittery, angry and sad. There\u2019sTwitter outrage, Facebook and Instagram FOMO, and the constant nagging of email and Slack. And let\u2019s face it, writing about climate change for a living isn\u2019t exactly cheerful. So that stream of photos brings me little bursts of pleasure throughout my day, a regular lift. Similar images show up on my Apple Watch and iPhone. Why shouldn\u2019t technology bring us joy along with all that angst?\nYou\u2019re a climate reporter and self-proclaimed Apple lover. Many Apple fans buy every new iPhone every year. Does your knowledge of the environmental impact of yearly upgrades change your tech consumption habits?\nI\u2019ve been an Apple guy since buying my first ][+ in 1983. But I\u2019ve never had the money to buy a new machine every year, and that kind of consumerism just isn\u2019t for me, despite my Apple fanboy ways.\nI\u2019m cheap. My car is 11 years old, and I\u2019ll drive it until it dies. I wear clothes until they get so ragged that my wife sneaks them over to the donation bin or into the trash. Even though my employer now provides my laptops, I don\u2019t push for the latest and greatest. (I\u2019ve evenwritten a book about reaching financial security.)\nSo my understanding of the environmental cost of replacing tech hasn\u2019t changed my habits, though it\u2019s definitely a factor people should consider when the tech press starts trumpeting the latest toys.\nBuying gadgets or using any kind of online service consumes carbon and energy. In a looming climate crisis, is it possible to be an ethical tech consumer? If so, how should we go about it?\nThe environmental and climate costs of the technology we use are stunning. But you can minimize your carbon footprint by buying refurbished goods instead of new, holding on to them a bit longer,repairing them instead of replacing them, andresell or recycleso that your old electronic devices are less likely to show up in landfills. I have been very happy with refurbished computers from Apple instead of buying new.\nIf you want to incorporate ethical sourcing and low waste into your purchasing plans, there are companies like Fairphone, the Dutch social enterprise.\nWhat is some of the most interesting tech being used to monitor climate change?\nScience is so wonderfully accessible; some of the most fascinating work is there for you to read for yourself.\nAll you need is a screen, an internet connection and a browser to see what satellites tell us about theextent of ice loss in Greenlandor river levels during spring flood seasonalong the Mississippi River Basin.\nYou can find out the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere atthe Keeling Curve site, and the extent to which the planet, or even your state, has warmed at the Ed Hawkins \u201cShow Your Stripes\u201d site (or check out thisamazingly simple featurethat shows you how much your hometown has warmed since you were born).\nYou can watch Katharine Hayhoe\u2019s amazing \u201cGlobal Weirding\u201d video series or be stunned by theamazing stories about climate changehere at The Times.\nOutside of your job, what tech products are you personally obsessed with?\nFor someone who loves technology, I don't have much of it in my house. My wife is a proud Luddite, and doesn\u2019t like tech for tech\u2019s sake; we don\u2019t have Alexa or HomePod or any of the talking gewgaws, no camera at the door. She yanked out all the wires for the security system that came with the house after it kept going off when the power went out.\nI\u2019m still semi-Luddite in some ways myself. I was recently visiting my daughter and son-in-law, and my granddaughter asked me to turn on \u201cAquanauts\u201d for her. I couldn\u2019t even figure out how to turn on the TV. (It required the game controller to choose among the channels and subscription services.) It was a good excuse to read books instead.\nHaving said that, I love my Apple Watch, which has worked its way into my consciousness in ways I hadn\u2019t expected: It tracks my exercise and lets me see my notifications without having to pull the phone out of my pocket and spend way too much time on my phone.\nThe unobtrusive tech that gives me the most pleasure is my Jabra earbuds, which I use when I\u2019m running and seem to be just about impervious to sweat. And the camera on my iPhone is my constant companion. I take daily pictures on my morning run and post them to Twitter and Instagram.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about recycling, but some of it seems futile. Lots of plastics can no longer be recycled. What should we do?\nRecycling is great in concept and fraught in practice. Like so many of the personal actions people try to take to address climate change, it can only do so much.\nThe most effective action on climate has to come from governments through major policy shifts, so the single most important personal action people can take is to vote their principles and work for candidates whose policies they favor \u2014 not just at the presidential level, but up and down the line, since even policies at the local level can have an effect on greenhouse gas emissions and the environment.\nDoes that mean personal action is worthless? Absolutely not. For one thing, it reinforces that save-the-planet state of mind and serves as an example to others. For another, small things add up."

        "title": "Apple to Ban Vaping Apps From Its Store",
        "fulltext": "Apple removed 181 vaping apps from its online store on Friday, following the lead of federal, state and local regulators, which in recent months have cracked down on e-cigarette products.\nThe prohibition affects apps that help people find vape stores or flavors, allow them to control their vape pens, or gain access to games, news or social networks that promote vaping.\nApple\u2019s vaping app ban is the second significant step the iPhone maker has taken to distance itself from e-cigarettes. The company updated its App Store rules in June to ban new vaping apps, and the move announced on Friday removed the apps it had approved before that decision. The company said it had never allowed apps that sold vaping products.\nIn a statement, Apple cited the rise of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping. Health experts have recently called \u201cthe spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe agree.\u201d\nCases of vaping-related illnesses have been rising, with more than 40 deaths and more than 2,000 illnesses, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.The C.D.C. has urged people to avoid vaping anything because the cause of illnesses remains unclear.\nApple\u2019s vaping app ban reflects its hands-on approach to the App Store, which distributes about 1.8 million apps to iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices.\nAs of Dec. 20, there have been 2,506 vaping illnesses and 54 deaths.More maps and charts.\nCases of lung illness\nDeaths\n0\n10\n50\n100\n150\n250\nMont.\nMinn.\nOre.\nMass.\n3\n2\nMich.\n3\nWis.\nN.Y.\n2\n2\nPa.\nNeb.\nInd.\nIll.\nN.J.\nUtah\nDel.\n5\n5\nMo.\nCalif.\nVa.\nKan.\n2\n2\n4\nTenn.\n2\nS.C.\nGa.\nAla.\nD.C.\nMiss.\n5\nLa.\nTex.\nFla.\nVirgin\nIslands\n2\nCases of vaping-related lung illness\nDeaths\n0\n10\n50\n100\n150\n250\nMont.\nMinn.\nOre.\nMass.\n3\n2\nMich.\nWis.\n3\nN.Y.\n2\n2\nPa.\nNeb.\nInd.\nN.J.\nIll.\nUtah\nDel.\n5\nMo.\nCalif.\n5\nVa.\nKan.\n2\n2\n4\nTenn.\n2\nS.C.\nAla.\nGa.\nMiss.\nD.C.\n5\nLa.\nTex.\nFla.\n2\nVirgin\nIslands\nCases of vaping-related lung illness\nDeaths\n0\n10\n50\n100\n150\n250\nMont.\nMinn.\nOre.\nMass.\n2\n3\nMich.\n3\nWis.\nN.Y.\n2\n2\nConn.\nPa.\nN.J.\nNeb.\nInd.\nIll.\nUtah\nDel.\n5\n5\nCalif.\nMo.\nVa.\nKan.\n2\n2\n4\nTenn.\n2\nS.C.\nGa.\nAla.\nMiss.\n5\nD.C.\nLa.\nTex.\nFla.\nVirgin\nIslands\nHawaii\n2\nBy The New York Times | Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state agencies\nApple requires its employees to manually review each app that applies to the store, encompassing about 100,000 apps a week. They reject about 40 percent. In a weekly meeting, a small team of top executives debate tricky cases of whether a given app belongs on Apple devices.\nThat approach has led to nuanced rules, an App Store with less fraud than other app marketplaces and criticism that Apple abuses its control of the marketplace.\nIn June, Apple added vaping to its ban on apps that encouraged the use of tobacco, illegal drugs or \u201cexcessive amounts of alcohol.\u201d But Apple still allows cannabis-related apps, as long as they are restricted to adults and certain states and don\u2019t offer sales or explicitly encourage recreational use.\nApple prohibits dozens of other categories of apps; the restrictions include the typical prohibitions on nudity, hate speech and physical harm. There is also a broad ban on apps that are \u201coffensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste or just plain creepy,\u201d as well as more nuanced bans on things as diverse as prank-call apps and apps that show maimed animals.\nGoogle\u2019s app store for Android devices is more permissive, and a search on Friday yielded dozens of vaping-related apps.\nApple\u2019s strict approach has drawn criticism. Last year, Apple began removing or restricting apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones, shortly after Apple released a competing tool. After The New York Timesreported on Apple\u2019s movesin April, Apple backed off on the policy.\nApple has also removed a number of apps at the behest of government officials in China, including those from news organizations like The Times and Quartz andan app that helped Hong Kong protesters track the police.\nApple users who have already downloaded vaping apps will be able to continue using them, though the apps will probably lose abilities as Apple continues to update iPhone software.\nApple said many of the vaping apps it had removed were from stores showing off their vaping products, though users couldn\u2019t buy anything in the apps. Some other apps that were banned helped adjust temperature and color, Apple said, though they weren\u2019t necessary for the vaping device to function.\nBecause of spikes in the use of e-cigarettes among minors, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce measures soon that could involve banning most flavored e-cigarettes, including mint.\nProhibiting menthol was mentioned earlier, but the vaping and tobacco industries have intensively lobbied the White House and lawmakers against such a broad ban, given that traditional menthol cigarettes remain on the market.\nJuul Labs, the nation\u2019s largest seller of e-cigarettes, recentlysaid it would discontinue salesof mint-flavored pods, after the latest national surveys showed that teenagers cited fruit and mint as their favorites.\nRestrictions on e-cigarette products are also gaining momentum at the state and local level. San Francisco, where Juul is based, will ban sales of e-cigarettes entirely in 2020 after voters this month overwhelmingly rejected a measure that would have allowed sales to continue in the city under stricter controls.\nApple\u2019s ban was supported by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cBy taking e-cigarette related apps off the App Store, Apple will help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing and discourage youth use of these products,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, the president of the campaign.\nNews of Apple\u2019s decision was first reported byAxios."

        "title": "The Streaming Era Has Finally Arrived. Everything Is About to Change.",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Every three decades, or roughly once a generation, Hollywood experiences a seismic shift. The transition from silent films to talkies in the 1920s. The rise of broadcast television in the 1950s. The raucous \u201cI Want My MTV\u201d cable boom of the 1980s.\nIt is happening again. The long-promised streaming revolution \u2014 the next great leap in how the world gets its entertainment \u2014 is finally here.\nStreaming services, of course, have been challenging the Hollywood status quo for years. Netflix began streaming movies and television shows in 2007 and has grown into a giant, spending $12 billion on programming this year to entertain more than 158 million subscribers worldwide. There are 271 online video services available in the United States, according to the research firm Parks Associates, one for seemingly every predilection \u2014Pongalofor telenovelas,AeroCinemafor aviation documentaries,Shudderfor horror movies,Horse Lifestylefor equine-themed content. (Offerings include a series called \u201cMarvin the Tap Dancing Horse.\u201d)\nWhile all this was happening, however, the three biggest old-line media companies \u2014 Disney, NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia \u2014 largely stayed on the sidelines. Charging into the streaming fray would mean putting billions of dollars in profit from existing cable networks like USA, Disney Channel and TBS at risk. Building video platforms of the size needed to compete with Netflix and Amazon would be frightfully expensive. And mastering the underlying technology would require asharp learning curve. Better to bide their time. When it became clear that protecting their existing business model was more perilous than embracing the future, no matter now disruptive in the near term, they would act.\nThat time is now. And everything is changing.\n\u201cI get asked all the time, \u2018Where does this stop?When does it stop?\u2019\u201d said Brett Sappington, a senior Parks Associates analyst and researcher. \u201cThe truth is that it is only getting started.\u201d\nDisney Plus arrived on Tuesday and costs less ($6.99 a month) than a single tub of popcorn at big-city movie theaters. It allows anyone with a high-speed internet connection to instantly watch Disney, Pixar, \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel movies, along withoriginal series and films, 30 seasons of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and 7,500 episodes of old Disney-branded TV shows. \u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said in April at anevent unveiling the service.\nDisney said on Wednesday that more than 10 million people had already signed up for the service. Analysts had been hoping for eight million by the end of the year.\nIn May, WarnerMedia will introduce HBO Max ($14.99 a month), which will offer 10,000 hours of instant entertainment, including the entirety of \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cSouth Park,\u201d hundreds of Warner Bros. movies, everything Batman, the HBO library, 50 years\u2019 worth of \u201cSesame Street\u201d episodes, and CNN documentaries. \u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d John Stankey, WarnerMedia\u2019s chief executive, said at anHBO Max promotional eventon Oct. 29.\nPeacock, an NBCUniversal streaming service also scheduled for a spring debut, will offer15,000 hours of content: complete seasons of \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFrasier,\u201d Universal films like \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d Telemundo shows, every episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a new reboot of \u201cBattlestar Galactica.\u201d Peacock, unlike Disney Plus and HBO Max, will carry advertising. NBCUniversal is expected to disclose pricing details (and presumably declare that it is \u201call in\u201d)at an event of its own in the coming months.\nAs the Big Three entertainment companies launch their video platforms, streaming competition is mounting from Silicon Valley. Apple rolled outApple TV PlusonNov. 1. Facebook and Snapchat are determined to become bigger video forces. And never count out YouTube, part of the Google family. Feeling the need for more \u201cquick bite\u201d videos while standing in line at the grocery store?Quibi, a streaming start-up led by Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg, is due in April.\nThe onslaught is upending how Hollywood does business in almost every way.\nInstead of relying exclusively on middlemen (cable system operators, multiplex chains) to get shows and movies to viewers, traditional entertainment companies are for the first time selling content directly to consumers. As a result, studios are releasing fewer films in theaters; WarnerMedia said recently that \u201cSuperintelligence,\u201d a Melissa McCarthy comedy scheduled for theatrical release in December, would instead debut in the spring \u2014directly on HBO Max.\nWith more original movies bypassing big screens, the line between TV and film isblurring, prompting once-unthinkable operating questions. Studios, for instance, employ separate executive teams to oversee the development and production of movies and television series. Should that siloed approach end?\nThere has even been some muttering about whether theEmmys and the Oscars should merge.\nSo much change is suddenly happening so quickly that viewers are becoming overwhelmed and, studies suggest, not in a good way. For some people, the cable bundle is starting to seem downright manageable in comparison.\n\u201cConsumers are upset about the imminent changes in the media landscape,\u201d consumer behavior researchers at the Langston Company, a Colorado consultancy,concluded in a September report. \u201cThese negative feelings are driven by fears of fragmentation, erosion of perceived value and the friction-cost of having multiple streaming accounts.\u201d\nNearly 50 percent of consumers are frustrated by the growing number of subscription services required to see the content they want to watch, according toan August white paperby Fluent, a digital marketing company.\nWithout question, analysts say, the flood of new streaming services will cause more people to cancel traditional cable subscriptions. Cable television is still the entertainment industry\u2019s cash cow, but millions of customers in the United States have already cut the cord. The annual pace of subscriber decline hit 5.4 percent in the second quarter, a statistic Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, referred to in a recent report as \u201cfreaking ugly.\u201d\nFor traditional companies like Disney and NBCUniversal, each of which run vast cable networks, that means reduced ad sales and harder negotiations with distributors over fees. \u201cAll signs point to subscriber losses continuing to accelerate,\u201d Richard Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm, wrote in a client note. \u201cVirtually every ambitious, must-see TV show is headed for a direct-to-consumer platform, with TV/basic cable taking the proverbial leftovers.\u201d\nBig cable channels like ESPN, Fox News, Bravo and HGTV aren\u2019t going anywhere, but channels that are already poorly rated \u2014 BabyFirst, Ovation,Viceland\u2014 will have a harder time staying in business, analysts say. The culling of the herd has already started, with cable outlets like Cloo, Esquire, Pivot and Al Jazeera America calling it quits in recent years. Glenn Beck willpull the plugon his Blaze cable channel next month.\nEven so, some of the biggest changes involve talent.\nNetflix and other tech companies, including Apple and Amazon, have beensteadily poaching writer-producersfrom established studios and television networks by offering eye-popping pay packages. Kenya Barris (\u201cblack-ish\u201d), Ryan Murphy (\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d), Shonda Rhimes (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) and David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) have all high-tailed it to Netflix, following stars like Adam Sandler and David Letterman. The establishment has recently been punching back. To keep Greg Berlanti, the TV whiz behind shows like \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cRiverdale,\u201d Warner Bros. dugdeep into its pockets. Warner completed asimilar dealwith J.J. Abrams in September.\n\u201cThere is money being thrown at people and ideas and scripts at a level that has never happened before in Hollywood,\u201d said Mr. Sappington, the Parks Associates analyst.\nEven Netflix is starting to experience sticker shock. Ted Sarandos, the company\u2019s chief content officer, told analysts on an October conference call that new bidders were driving up prices for \u201celite\u201d content. \u201cOn a very competitive show, there has probably been 30 percent price escalation since last year,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said.\nMost definitely, streaming money is sloshing through the Hollywood economy. Producers in backwaters like children\u2019s television arenow in hot demand. Midlevel publicists are driving new luxury cars. Florists, caterers, set decorators, chauffeurs, hair stylists, headhunters \u2014 it\u2019s gravy train time.\nBut fewer Hollywood people are turning cartwheels than outsiders might think. To keep their content assembly lines speeding (495 scripted original seriesaired in 2018, an 85 percent increase from 2011) companies are stretching some employees to a breaking point. Because streaming services order fewer episodes and cancel series after shorter runs, rank-and-file writers are having to switch jobs more frequently.\nThere is also afundamental shift with employment contractsunderway. Disney, for instance, has adopted new terms for TV shows. Under the old model, in place for decades, show creators were paid handsome fees from the beginning. But the big money came in success: a slice of profits from rerun sales. Disney, following amodel popularized by Netflix, now offers higher upfront payments but little or no \u201cback end.\u201d Other traditional companies are doing the same; they say it allows for distribution flexibility inside their corporate ecosystems (broadcast, cable, streaming).\nThe shift has rankled members of the Writers Guild of America, which represents about 13,000 screenwriters and has been whispering about a potential strike. The W.G.A.\u2019s contract with studios expires on May 1. Studio contracts with two additional Hollywood unions, SAG-AFTRA (actors) and the Directors Guild of America, expire on June 30.\nCourtney Kemp, creator of the Starz drama \u201cPower,\u201d campaigned on the topic during September elections for the writers\u2019 guild\u2019s West Coast board. \u201cThe companies are looking actively to \u2018buy us out\u2019 up front, so they don\u2019t have to share profits with us, and they don\u2019t have to pay us for reuse \u2014 and they will never have to tell us the truth about the value of our content,\u201d Ms. Kemp wrote in her campaign statement.\n\u201cThey will own your intellectual property outright and forever,\u201d Ms. Kemp continued. \u201cAs my 8-year-old daughter would say \u2014 no backsies. And that\u2019s an issue worth striking over.\u201d\nRevolutions are not known for their tranquillity."

        "title": "Trump Floats Tariff Exclusions for Apple at Texas Manufacturing Plant",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Wednesday that China had not yet made enough concessions to secure a trade deal with the United States and suggested that he might exempt Apple from an upcoming round of tariffs as he toured a Texas plant that assembles Mac Pro computers.\nMr. Trump, who was joined in Austin by Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, repeated his assertion that China was more eager to reach a trade deal than he was and suggested the two sides still remained far apart. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re stepping up to the level that I want,\u201d he told reporters.\nWhen asked if Apple should receive tariff exemptions, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung,\u201d he said. Samsung is a South Korean electronics giant that has shifted its smartphone production out of China amid a stinging trade war.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments, made during a tour of a Flextronics plant that assembles the Apple Mac Pro, added to growing uncertainty about whether the United States and China will reach a Phase 1 trade deal this year.\nThe president announced on Oct. 11 that the world\u2019s largest economies had agreed on a preliminary deal, but the two sides havecontinued to grapple over the terms, and no signing has been scheduled.\nThat has left companies deeply uncertain about whether the administration will proceed with another round of tariffs on consumer goods, like tablets, smartphones, laptops and other products from China on Dec. 15.\nThe United States has already placed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese products. To help cushion the blow, the administration has allowed companies to apply for an exemption from the tariffs. Companies must demonstrate that the import cannot be obtained domestically. Some of those requests have been approved, and administration officials have insisted the process is apolitical.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments about excluding Apple from the levies couldfurther fuel criticismthat he is playing favorites and picking winners and losers.\nThe heads of smaller technology companies have grumbled that prominent businesses like Apple have been more able to catch the attention of the White House, and that they appear to be receiving more exclusions than other companies.\nJonathan Gold, a spokesman for Americans for Free Trade, which has lobbied against the tariffs, said it was not clear which factors the United States trade representative, which is granting the exclusions, is considering, or why one company would receive an exclusion when another does not. \u201cUntil there\u2019s transparency with the U.S.T.R. exclusion process, people are going to think certain companies are getting preferential treatment,\u201d he said.\nThe trade representative responded that each exclusion \u201cis evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account whether the exclusion would undermine the objective\u201d ofan investigation the president has openedinto Chinese intellectual property theft.\nApple products, which are largely assembled in China, have evaded some, but not all, tariffs. The company stands to be hit much harder by the final tranche of tariffs Mr. Trump threatened against China, which includes more consumer electronics. Some of those tariffs went into effect in September, and some are planned for Dec. 15.\nMr. Trump has vacillated between threatening Apple and holding it up as an example of how his policies are fueling American investment. The president tweeted in July that his administration would deny the company\u2019s request for exemptions from the tariffs, saying they should instead make their products in America.\n\u201cApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,\u201dhe tweeted on July 26. \u201cMake them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\nSince then, the company\u2019s relations with the administration appear to have warmed.\nMr. Cook has periodically lobbied the president and his advisers on the negative effects of the trade war and his company\u2019s contributions to the American economy. Apple has argued that it hasno easy way of substituting the proprietary componentsthat it designs in house and manufactures in China.\nIn recent months, it has received some waivers for certain products and components.\nThe company was granted a reprieve in August from a 25 percent tariff for several of the products it imports from China, including a graphics processing module, power supply units, the Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Trackpad 2.\nThe United States trade representative, which is in charge of the exclusions, has also denied some of the company\u2019s requests. In August, it rejected exemption requests for the company\u2019s imported circuit boards, power cables, USB cables and other products because the company did not demonstrate that the tariffs \u201cwould cause severe economic harm to you or other U.S. interests,\u201d the trade representative said.\nThe trade representative is still reviewing other requests by Apple for exclusions from September and December tariffs, including for the Apple Watch, the HomePod, AirPods, a battery module for its MacBook and various iPhone parts.\nThe tour on Wednesday was meant to showcase some of the American manufacturing jobs created by a company that imports many of its components from across the globe.\nMr. Trump was met by at least a dozen Flextronics employees wearing blue lab coats and gloves, who worked on Apple monitors and Mac Pros inside the plant. During the visit, Mr. Cook pointed Mr. Trump to a sign reading: \u201cApple works with 9,000 companies across all 50 states. Mac Pro components come from companies in 19 states.\u201d"

        "title": "Behind Apple\u2019s \u2018Slow-Roll\u2019 Marketing Push for Its New Streaming Service",
        "fulltext": "Show business may be Apple\u2019s latest big experiment \u2014 but it is not the company\u2019s top priority.\nHow can you tell? By comparing the amount Apple has spent in recent months to advertise Apple TV Plus with how much it has allocated to getting the word out on the latest iPhone.\nIn October, Apple spent $19.9 million on television commercials for Apple TV Plus, the streaming service that went live Friday with a slate of shows featuring Reese Witherspoon, Jason Momoa and Oprah Winfrey. That same month, according to the measurement company iSpot.TV, Apple spent $38.6 million on television ads to market the iPhone.\nThe same disparity was evident in September, when Apple spent $14.9 million on commercials promoting Apple TV Plus and $28.6 million on television ads for the iPhone, according to iSpot.TV.\nApple applied the same spending strategy to the online push. In October, there were 139 unique digital ads for Apple TV Plus, which cost the company less than $1.7 million, while iPhones were featured in 245 separate ads, which cost an estimated $2.3 million, according to the advertising analytics platform Pathmatics. In September, there was an exception. Digital ads for Apple TV Plus that month cost Apple an estimated $3.8 million, compared with $2.4 million for iPhone ads.\nTaken together, the company spent a total of $71.9 million on iPhone ads and $40.3 million on Apple TV Plus spots on television and online in the past two months. (Billboard tracking companies said that data for Apple\u2019s recent outdoor ads are not yet available.)\n\u201cThe marketing is never going to be at the level of iPhone \u2014 that continues to be the Rock of Gibraltar for Apple,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cServices like streaming are more like the fuel in the growth engine.\u201d\nApple, which once spent $1.8 billion on advertising in a single year, has a history of getting the most out of introducing new products. Its ad campaigns, including the dystopian \u201c1984\u201d ad for the Macintosh computer during the 1984 Super Bowl and its \u201cSilhouette\u201d campaign for iPods starting in 2003, created brand loyalty by conferring status on supposedly ahead-of-the-curve Apple users. Its publicity department increased desire for Apple products by cleverly doling out information to the news media. And the company\u2019s slick stage presentations helped turn tech execs into celebs and customers into devoted fans.\nBut as Apple\u2019s first real foray into original entertainment, Apple TV Plus has presented the company with a new marketing challenge. Can its advertising cut through the noise in the increasingly crowded world of entertainment?\nTimes Square offers a clue. Apple has huge billboards on its southern periphery for several of its Apple TV Plus shows overlooking the throngs of wandering tourists and fast-moving commuters \u2014 but it is competing for attention with signage close by for Netflix and HBO.\nOn the New Jersey-side of the Lincoln Tunnel, by contrast, three gargantuan signs for the iPhone 11 Pro, which was unveiled and made available in September, hang above the three tunnel entrances, dominating the sight lines of captive drivers and passengers in the traffic-clogged patch of Weehawken below.\nLee Clow, who crafted many of Apple\u2019s best-known ads over more than 30 years,announced his retirementin February from TBWA\\Media Arts Lab, the agency he founded in 2006 to serve Apple. Geoff Edwards, who has worked on branding for entertainment players like the Walt Disney Company and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, took over creative duties in May for services such as Apple TV Plus, Apple Music and Apple Pay.\nCompared with the marketing blitz forDisney Plus, the streaming service that will arrive Nov. 12, the Apple TV Plus campaign seems more muted. Disney has promoted its service, which will include Pixar films and the Marvel franchise, across its many businesses, including theme parks, stores, hotels, cruise lines and TV channels like ABC, ESPN and Freeform.\nOn Monday, just as the Apple TV Plus series \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d waspremiering at a lavish eventat Lincoln Center, Disney Plus introduced a trailer for its heavily promoted live-action \u201cStar Wars\u201d show \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d The next day AT&T\u2019s entertainment division, WarnerMedia, held an event in Burbank, Calif., to promote its wide-ranging HBO Max streaming service, which will includes everything from Sesame Workshop shows to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on its May debut.\nDan Rayburn, an analyst with Frost & Sullivan, suggested that it might have been wise of Apple not to do an iPhone-level marketing blast for the service, which has a relatively modest lineup compared to the vast libraries offered by its streaming rivals.\n\u201cConsumers are just drowning in content right now, and all of these services are competing for our time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all approaching the market differently. This isn\u2019t some race for Apple. It\u2019s a slow roll.\u201d\nSoon after Apple madedetailsabout Apple TV Plus available in September, ads for the streaming service seemed to surge. The tech giant barraged the71st Primetime Emmy Awardswith commercials. Spots appeared during football games, sitcoms and talk shows. Billboards went up featuring celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Mr. Momoa.\nMr. Momoa, who is starring in the Apple TV Plus show \u201cSee,\u201d stopped by \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d for the Oct. 25 episode. He compared the show to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d saying, \u201cApple put everything in. They invested big on this one.\u201d\nMs. Aniston, who stars with Ms. Witherspoon on Apple TV Plus\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d went on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d where she talked briefly about the program before discussing \u201cFriends,\u201d the hit sitcom that will soon become an exclusive streaming propertyon HBO Max. On Thursday, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King aired a more in-depth conversation with Ms. Aniston and Ms. Witherspoon about the new show.\nSome analysts suggest that Apple\u2019s streaming platform, priced at $5 a month, is meant to be a selling point for consumers interested in springing for Apple devices. The iPhone, Apple\u2019s prize product, generated $33.3 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, compared to $12.5 billion from Apple services like the App Store and Apple Music. But iPhone saleshave been weakening, which may explain the continued marketing onslaught on its behalf.\nThe iPhone shows up frequently in Apple TV Plus programs like \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d and Apple\u2019s retail employees will show off the streaming service during occasional in-store sessions.\nThe company is offering a free year of Apple TV Plus to those who buy a new iPhone, iPad or Mac laptop. Hailee Steinfeld, who stars on the Apple TV Plus show \u201cDickinson,\u201d said on Instagram this week that students with an Apple Music subscription will also have free access to Apple TV Plus.\nIt is \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before the company offers Apple TV Plus as part of a bundle with its news, music and gaming offerings, Mr. Rayburn said.\nAds for Apple TV Plus have appeared on websites like YouTube, Entertainment Weekly and Vogue, according to Pathmatics. Apple is also advertising the service with companies that have competing streaming platforms, such as Hulu and NBC.\nThe tech giant may also be positioning itself to win accolades from Hollywood: Apple took out a full-page ad in the most recent issue of \u201cEmmy,\u201d the publication of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. The issue featured Apple TV Plus in its cover story and included a voucher for a free 3-month trial to the service for 25,000 academy members.\nMr. Ives, the Wedbush analyst, said Apple TV Plus marketing has been \u201caggressive\u201d compared to most other Apple launches. He expects advertising to pick up more during the holidays and also a year from now, when Apple will be trying to convert customers who signed on for a free year.\n\u201cThis is a pivotal juncture for Apple to be successful \u2014 they cannot trip over their shoelace,\u201d Mr. Ives said. \u201cThey were late to the game, they\u2019ve underinvested in content and they have a lot of room to make up.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Richard Stables should have felt vindicated when the European Union announced a $2.7 billion fine in 2017 against Google for breaking antitrust laws. He had raised alarms about the search giant\u2019s power for years.\nBut rather than feel victorious, Mr. Stables felt resigned. His company, Kelkoo, once a leading online shopping destination in Europe, was crushedby Google\u2019s competing service while the case was underway.\n\u201cIt took basically eight years to get something done,\u201d Mr. Stables, 50, said in an interview at his London office. \u201cThat\u2019s a complete disaster.\u201d\nRegulators in Brussels have been heralded as the world\u2019sleading tech industry watchdogs. But Mr. Stables and other veterans of the Continent\u2019s antitrust battles are telling American authorities, who areinvestigatingGoogle, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, something else: There is a lot to learn from Europe\u2019s mistakes.\nAntitrust investigations in Europe have taken years to complete, in part because company lawyers use stalling techniques that give the tech giants added time to squeeze out rivals, according to companies, lawyers and consumer groups involved in the cases against Google. The inquiries have centered on single aspects of the companies, like Google shopping, rather than their entire business. And once regulators have stepped in, the penalties have focused on headline-grabbing fines rather than structural changes that would restore competitive balance.\nEurope\u2019s regulators have taken antitrust actions against numerous tech companies. Nonehave faced more scrutiny over the past decade than Google \u2014 yet critics say it has emerged virtually unscathed. Its revenue rose to $137 billion in 2018, up from $23.7 billion in 2009, when rivals filed the first antitrust complaint.\n\u201cYou have to move fast and impose remedies that actually bite,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, an antitrust lawyer who represented companies against Google in Europe.\nIn recent weeks, the authorities in the United States and Europe have signaled that they believe tougher antitrust enforcement is necessary.\nMargrethe Vestager, the top antitrust regulator in the European Union, who has fined Google more than $9 billion since 2017 for antitrust violations, is pushing new approaches.She has invoked a rarely applied rule, known as\u201cinterim measures.\u201dIt acts like a cease-and-desist order, forcing a company to stop acting a certain way until an antitrust investigation can be completed.\nAnother ideafloatedby Ms. Vestager, whose office is investigating Amazon and exploring cases against Facebook and Apple, would shift the burden of proof in cases involving large tech companies. It would require them to show how their behavior helps consumers. Usually, regulators must demonstrate harm to consumers.\nRegulators in Germany andBritainhave called for tougher rules, including expanding the scope of antitrust enforcement into new areas of the digital economy like thecollection of data.\nIn the United States,Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, recently said remedies as far-reaching as breaking up the companies were\u201cperfectly on the table.\u201d\n\u201cIf the American authorities learn from Europe\u2019s experience, they have a big opportunity\u201d torestore competition,said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a price comparison website that filed the original complaint against Google in 2009. In October, she met with federal and congressional investigators in Washington.\nThe Kelkoo experience demonstrates the challenge.\nFounded in 1999, the website was an early online success story in Europe. With a name that plays on the French saying \u201cquel coup,\u201d meaning \u201cwhat a bargain,\u201d Kelkoo became a top destination for consumers in countries like Britain, France and the Netherlands to compare products listed on different websites.\nThe sector became a hot area of the internet economy. Yahoo bought Kelkoo in2004for about $550 million,before it wassold again in 2008to the British private equity firm Jamplant for less than a quarter of the price amid wider problems at Yahoo. Also in 2008, Microsoftboughtthe owner of Ciao.com, a European competitor, for about$490 million.\nBut in February 2011, the traffic that Google sent to Kelkoo and others tumbled. Google had a similar shopping service and was now putting its own listings at the top of search queries.\n\u201cIt basically smashed the market,\u201d said Mr. Stables, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur free traffic that came from Google dropped by 92 percent in two or three years. Our revenues took a massive hit.\u201d\nHe closed offices in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. More than 150 people were laid off. Mr. Stables and others took their complaints to regulators in Washington and Brussels, arguing that Google was abusing its dominance by changing its search algorithm to force its way into new markets like shopping, travel and restaurant reviews.\n\u201cWe were just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Ms. Raff said. \u201cWe are one of hundreds or thousands of companies that have been hurt.\u201d\nTo Ms. Raff and others, the case seemed clear cut because the companies were armed with data showing how Google had hurt their businesses to help its own.\nBut the companies struggled to find a receptive audience. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commissiondecided not to take on Google.\nThe European Union reached a tentative settlement with Google in the case in 2014, but the agreement was abandoned after complaints that it would not restore competition. In 2015, after Ms. Vestager took over as the top antitrust enforcer, preliminary antitrust charges were filed against Google \u2014 five years after an investigation wasofficially opened. It would be another two years until Ms. Vestager finished the case, imposing the$2.7 billion fine.\nAs the investigation dragged on, rivals say, they suffered and Google solidified its dominance. Competitors complained that Google used stalling tactics, taking advantage of due process rules to resist requests for information and to demand access to evidence submitted by other parties.\n\u201cGoogle used what may charitably be called its rights of defense, which was good lawyering,\u201d said Mr. Vinje, who represented Google\u2019s competitors. \u201cBy the time the decision was issued so many years later, Google had largely achieved its objective of pushing the pioneers in the comparison-shopping market out and basically dominated the market itself.\u201d\nGoogle, which has denied wrongdoing, declined to comment.\nTommaso Valletti, who was involved in the Google cases when he was the chief competition economist for the European Commission, said criticism of European regulation was unfair. American authorities allowed the companies to grow unimpeded for years, he said. Fixing the problems would take more than antitrust enforcement from Brussels.\n\u201cEurope has led the way in realizing that there are potential problems related to digital platforms that can be also dealt withthroughantitrust enforcement,\u201d he said.\nThe European Commission issued its final ruling against Google in the shopping case in 2017, but rivals say the company still hasn\u2019t properly applied remedies outlined by regulators to create a level playing field for websites like Kelkoo.\nIn 2018, thecommission fined Googlea record 4.34 billion euros, worth about $4.8 billion today, for illegally using its Android mobile phone software to block rival search engines. Remedies in that case, including giving customers more search engines to use, are still being argued over.\nIn a third case, related to an online advertising practice that Google has since ended, the European authorities fined Google \u20ac1.5 billion, or about $1.7 billion.\nGoogle is appealing all three decisions, leaving open the possibility that the fines could be voided.\nRivals said the European verdicts validated their complaints.But they warned that the power dynamics had not changed.\nMr. Stables, his voice rising with frustration, implored regulators to act.\n\u201cThis is a very dangerous moment,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually you\u2019ll end up with an internet dominated by just a few companies.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "ByJohn HerrmanNov. 13, 2019\nWhat used to seem like a fight for world domination has now become an uneasy stalemate.\nWhat used to seem like a fight for world domination has now become an uneasy stalemate.\nByJohn HerrmanPhoto illustration by Maurizio Cattelan and Pierpaolo FerrariNov. 13, 2019\nAny suggestion that Big Tech has had a rough time must contend with this fact: Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, spent the past decade growing much faster than the rest of the economy.\nWhatever reckonings they\u2019ve faced so far, and whatever backlash they\u2019ve endured \u2014 in the press, on Capitol Hill \u2014 have beeneasily absorbedin financial terms. These ostensibly embattled firms recorded billions of dollars in profits, and can reasonably expect to continue to do so. It has been a great worst year ever, and next year is promising to be pretty good, too, as well as much, much worse.\nThe tech giants haven\u2019t been considered start-ups for years, and in some cases decades. They\u2019re no mere incumbents, either; they\u2019re some of the biggest companies in the world. But it\u2019s not enough to simply take their measurements. They\u2019re diversified conglomerates whose power is greater than even their staggering user numbers suggest. They were expansionary powers, chasing and luring new customers by the hundreds of millions, laying claim to territory and souls with the zeal of missionary explorers. What they\u2019ve become are superpowers, whose imperative for growth has been replaced with a need to fortify, ally and extract. Reaching a billion users is a successful conquest; keeping them, and turning their continued allegiance into lasting power, is empire.\nThis article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet.\nGoogle is much more than a search engine; Amazon is much more than a simple e-commerce site. This alone complicates the idea of competition. To comprehensively take on Facebook\u2019s expanding coalition of megaservices is implausible; the best a competitor can do is create some sort of service that might steal away time or advertising dollars. Testifying before two Senate committees in 2018, Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his company\u2019s biggest competitor. He struggled to name one, insteadgesturing vaguelyat \u201cthe other tech platforms,\u201d including Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. \u201cWe overlap with them in different ways,\u201d he said, answering as if the question were flawed. Competition is something you do in a market you share with others; it is, in the Facebook investor and board member Peter Thiel\u2019s words, \u201cfor losers.\u201d Overlap is what might occur when sovereign powers happen to occupy the same space, or lay claims to the same populations in the normal course of conquest.\nThe tech giants, in becoming tech superpowers, have been growing in every direction beneath our feet, becoming tangled in ways that we cannot easily see and, together, improvising a new world order that is increasingly hard to route around, or to escape. To use the internet, in 2019, is to engage to some degree with the handful of private entities that control it. To start an internet company is to submit to one or many of them from the start. We, and the rest of the internet between us and them, are but subjects on the surface of a planet they\u2019ve fully colonized and terraformed. Unfortunately for us, theirs are empires we\u2019re stuck with for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately for them, they\u2019re also stuck with one another.\nAt the dawnof our new century, the web was still relatively federated \u2014 a messy, sprawling network of sites and services, some serving millions of users, some just a few. Google was still a search engine, Amazon was best known for selling books and Mark Zuckerberg was in high school. This web never fully lived up to its boosters\u2019 ideals of free, mutually beneficial cooperation, of open standards and citizen empowerment, but it was closer than today\u2019s internet. It was built by, and for, people used to accessing networks through computers; for all its professions of freedom and open access, this web was exclusive by default, rooted firmly in an era in which digital participation was economically and socially limited. But whatever else this web was, it was spacious.\nThe internet is now mobile \u2014 available almost anywhere \u2014 which has significantly expanded the user base and use cases for all sorts of services: You can buy from Amazon while standing in a Walmart, or check Instagram while you\u2019re watching TV. In the past decade, there was also a wholesale migration of online services to a small group of conglomerate hosting companies, from which start-ups and venerable tech firms alike can rent space and computing power instead of investing in costly, and ultimately inferior, physical infrastructure themselves. On their own, each of these trends is, at most, an airport book.Welcome to the mobile revolution! Allow me to introduce you to network effects. As I\u2019m sure you know, The Cloud is the future, and you\u2019d better get to elevation, fast!The ways in which these trends have combined, however, have produced the peculiar results that have actually reordered things.\nIt\u2019s a simple question, and a maddeningly squirrelly one to answer \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t keep economists and advocates from trying. Here we lay out two models: a straightforward one from the Democratic strategy group Future Majority; and a second from data scientists and economists at Microsoft, whose much higher figure comes from the expectation that our future economy will be driven by artificial intelligence that depends on harvesting oodles and oodles of our data to drive its machine learning. Either model, of course, raises an intriguing further question: How much of that bounty should flow to you?\nTHE STATUS QUO MODEL\n$198 billion:Projected total data-derived revenues in 2022 in the U.S. across four major categories: internet platforms, large-scale data brokers and credit card and health care companies. (Up from $52.5 billion in 2016 and $76 billion in 2018.)321 million:Projected total number of internet users among the U.S. population in 2022.$616.82:Per capita annual bounty per internet user.\nTHE A.I. ACCELERATOR MODEL\n$7.1 trillion:Microsoft's Glen Weyl begins with an estimate that by 2030, A.I.-driven production will account for as much as a third of the U.S. G.D.P. Applying that to a projected G.D.P. in 2019 of $21.5 trillion yields $7.1 trillion.329.9 million:Current U.S. population.$21,522:Per capita A.I.-driven G.D.P.\nThe death of the relatively open web, the rise of mobile phones and centralized app stores, the consolidation of media consumption around megascale intermediaries \u2014 all of these trends helped to establish what is now the internet\u2019s reigning business model. What emerged is a tech industry that exaggerates the ugliest features of the global economy in which it operates: crushing consolidation of power by an ever smaller number of dominant firms; stratified marketplaces supported by precarious laborers; sector domination as table stakes. The victors in this process captured enormous amounts of attention and capital along the way, which the savviest among them immediately used for \u2014 what else? \u2014 aggressive, multilateral expansion.\nA result is that the largest companies in the Western tech sector don\u2019t operate on the internet so much as they are synonymous with it. The rise of TikTok, the Chinese-owned social app, is an object lesson in the consequences of this arrangement. To a casual observer, it seemed to explode in the manner of a viral sensation, but in reality, it found many of its Western users through an advertising campaign that costhundreds of millions of dollars in a single year, much of which went straight to American social-media giants \u2014 nominally TikTok\u2019s competitors, but also gatekeepers to an unimaginably massive audience. Or ask Netflix, the leading video-streaming company in the United States, the kind of firm that might be confused for a superpower itself, if not for the fact that it outsources \u201cnearly all its computing and storage needs,\u201din Amazon\u2019s words, to Amazon, which has a video-streaming service of its own, with tens of millions of viewers and its own shelves of entertainment-industry awards.\nThese, it should be said, are success stories. TikTok gained access to its audience, which it can now try to leverage into money and new forms of influence (though it has recently drawn scrutiny not just from the United States government but from Facebook, which has hosted ads for the service). Netflix doesn\u2019t have to maintain an unwieldy and expensive infrastructure of its own, and is the streaming service to beat (although it recently reported losing users in the U.S. for the first time in eight years).\nThis is how the internet business works now: If you need to access new populations, you have to deal with Facebook, and buy your way in. If you need to build a new tech company from scratch, you\u2019re going to need to make a deal with one of the empires that has secured access to certain valuable resources. Have a product to sell? Good luck hitting your goals without listing your wares on Amazon, or without setting up a storefront in Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app marketplaces. The paths to all but the largest websites run through Google\u2019s territory, which is expanding by the day. The app stores are monuments to the smartphone boom, a gold rush that defined an era \u2014 sprawling, peerless capitals through which astonishing volumes of people, products and time pass under the watchful eyes of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s bureaucracies.\nIf it\u2019s stillpossible to exist online outside the territorial boundaries of these tech empires, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to engage them at all. What little space that remains untouched by the tech empires is still menaced by them. To be online, as a business or as an individual, is to accept their premises or demands. What you end up with is situations like that of Pinterest: a well-known brand that reports to having 300 million monthly users, an online destination, as well as a tool that maps over the rest of the web \u2014 another success story.\nThis same Pinterest, however, exists at the mercy of companies that may not think of it as a primary competitor but would not hesitate to release a competing product. In its investor prospectus, this Pinterest listed its competitors as \u201clarger, more established companies such as Amazon, Facebook (including Instagram), Google, Snap and Twitter.\u201d Elsewhere it listed many of those same companies as risk factors: Google can, and it claims has already, limited visitors to Pinterest through search; Facebook and Google can be used to sign into Pinterest, and changes to Facebook\u2019s login system have already \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d user growth and engagement; Pinterest depends on Amazon to host \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of its operation, and is committed to spending at least $750 million with the firm over the next four years.\nImagine, if you will, a huge warehouse. It has a raised floor and thousands of identical metal racks holding dozens of servers and switches apiece: A few hundred thousand square feet speckled with blinking lights and filled with the whir of cooling fans and climate control. This hyperscale data center is what runs the internet, our banking infrastructure, our casinos and our increasingly complex mobile digital lives. And they\u2019re growing like gangbusters, both in number and size. A year ago there were 449 hyperscale centers in the world; today there are 504, with the biggest topping out at millions of square feet.\nOr maybe you use Spotify, the music-streaming app that can credibly claim to have changed how millions of people listen to music as well as what it means to be a professional musician. It\u2019s an enormously successful operation, practically a generic trademark for music streaming. More than 248 million people around the world use it, and 113 million pay for it, according to the company. But there\u2019s another way of looking at Spotify, and it makes the service look somewhat thinner.\nIt\u2019s not just that the company is an intermediary between listeners and content that it doesn\u2019t own, though that is true: Spotify, like all but the very largest tech companies, relies on another company \u2014 in this case, Google \u2014 to host most of its infrastructure. When you hit play on a Spotify song, something happens on servers owned by Google, a privilege and action for which Spotify pays a fee. And for a time after its U.S. launch, in 2011, the only way to sign up for it was by using a Facebook account. Some 70 percent of users access it through an app installed on Apple and Android devices, through app stores run by Apple and Google, each of which has music-streaming services of its own, with comparable pricing and features to the ones Spotify made standard years before. Spotify got its users with Facebook\u2019s help, owns neither the material that it sells or advertises against and in fact negotiates for rights to it alongside much richer competitors that count Spotify as a client.\nIt might be a stretch to attribute Spotify\u2019s success to Facebook\u2019s largess, or to describe app stores as charitable, but these much more powerful companies have created the conditions in which a company like Spotify has been able to thrive, relatively speaking. Ina complaint Spotify filed against Applewith the European Commission, which contends that the App Store policies and fee structures place competitors at a disadvantage to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming services, the company stops short of contending that Apple is deliberately sabotaging its business, or stealing its customers; it simply notes that the conditions created by a world in which Apple has so much power will produce an indistinguishable outcome.\nApple responded publiclyby suggesting its operations amount to more than just a company; it\u2019s an entire economy whose success corresponds with the success of its numerous clients, or partners, or participants, or whatever everyone else is. \u201cSpotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem,\u201d it said, \u201cwithout making any contributions to that marketplace.\u201d All Apple wants to do, it went on, is \u201cgrow the pie.\u201d\nSuch lopsidedrelationships as Apple and Spotify\u2019s provide a preview of the way much bigger conflicts might emerge in the future. The genuine tech empires have always been in competition, but until recently they\u2019ve always had plenty of room to expand in different directions. There were plenty of users to go around, and plenty of ways to make money from each of them. Amazon could dominate retail and hosting. Facebook could dominate social advertising. Google could keep its control over search and mapping and online video, through which it manages a massive advertising marketplace. Their collective success enlarged the tech industry as a whole and created new opportunities within it, as well as nearby.\nWhen imperial ambition came into direct contact \u2014 such as when Google tried to launch its Google Plus social network, or when Facebook tried to create a smartphone platform \u2014 failures were softened by continued expansion elsewhere. It was a prosperous era for those that were a part of it; less so for any company, or industry, or system, that happened to be in the way. (See: retail; media; democracy.) Everything was growing, and future growth was limitless. Among the American tech superpowers, creeping interdependence has likewise been accepted as a necessary, and even desirable, component of a new digital order. But the end of explosive growth, combined with external pressures stemming in part from the worldwide turn against globalization, will illuminate the ways in which the tech giants have power over one another, and how tenuous are the situations of their smaller proxy states.\nAnnual internet traffic is projected by Cisco to hit 4.8 zettabytes of data per year by 2022. Video traffic is driving most of the growth, and will account for 82 percent of all internet traffic by 2022. The total footprint (est.): 125 million square feet = 2,170 football fields. According to IDC, by 2025, stored data worldwide will total 175 zettabytes = the storage capacity of ~1.75 billion human brains.\nThe manners in which the tech empires are entangled are occasionally absurd. Apple is currently being sued for supposedly misrepresenting its iCloud product to customers, who may have assumed they were buying storage for their personal photos solely on Apple\u2019s own servers. Apple, the suit contends, had also built iCloud on top of other companies\u2019 cloud services: namely Amazon\u2019s AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. In other cases, such interdependence has spilled into conflict. On multiple occasions,Apple has suspended apps created or owned by Facebook for breaking its policies\u2014 once evenrevoking Facebook\u2019s ability to test apps internally, which, among other things, rendered thousands of employees\u2019 phones, all full of nonpublic company apps, temporarily useless. They didn\u2019t touch Facebook\u2019s consumer-facing apps, which provide Facebook with nearly exclusive access to the hundreds of millions of people who use the service, and see its ads, in iOS. But the implication was clear: It could if it wanted to; Apple and Facebook are only partners, or allies, as long as both parties agree.\nFacebook could escalate, too, if it wanted, by removing all of its apps from iOS, and preventing Apple users from easily accessing its services. This would be disastrous for Apple, but probably more disastrous for Facebook \u2014 and most disastrous for the user who expected to be able to use WhatsApp to talk with her family back home, who then could not. The recent attempts of Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, to position Apple as a privacy-forward company, at Facebook\u2019s expense, might sound like grandstanding from the outside, but within Facebook they\u2019re heard loud and clear: Apple believes it is in a position to make demands.\nThe American tech superpowers are running out of new users to sign up in their mature markets. But more worrying, for them, is the accelerating collapse of their prospects for expansion into some major international markets \u2014 particularly China, and countries where Chinese tech companies are snatching up territory of their own. This is a significant revision to their outlooks from just 10 years ago, when they could blithely envision the acquisition of the \u201cnext billion\u201d users as nothing more than a matter of engineering resources and time. Now that they can no longer forecast forever growth, the risk of open conflict among these companies in the future seems much higher. Apple and Amazon, for example, might have liked to dominate music streaming \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t? \u2014 but they never needed to destroy Spotify. Apple was making plenty of money every year selling phones, and Amazon\u2019s main line of business has been growing monstrously, and there were always more markets to expand to anyway. But what happens after a few years of slow growth, when secondary businesses like music streaming suddenly need to make more money?\nEven bigger conflicts are possible. It might be unwise, but it would not be impossible, for Amazon to weaponize its hosting services \u2014 declaring that it wouldn\u2019t work with firms it considered competitors, or which provide services that \u201coverlap\u201d with its own. (Jeff Bezos\u2019s ownership may have already been weaponized against him, if indeedthe Pentagon\u2019s unlikely selection of Microsoft for a $10 billion cloud-computing contractresulted from President Trump\u2019s issues with the C.E.O.) Like any advertising provider, Google and Facebook can choose whom they do business with. What if they declined to accept advertising money from the next social app based in China? (Or what if they were just told to do so by the American government?)\nAs users \u2014 as subjects \u2014 we\u2019re not even party to these disputes. What vanishingly little power we did have, to somehow vote with our wallets on services that we generally don\u2019t pay for, is narrowed each time another winner takes all, leaving us with nowhere else to go. We\u2019ve only ever known these empires during periods of expansion. What happens when they run out of land to conquer, and people to claim as their own? How do they rule, and when do they go to war?\nJohn Herrmanis a media and technology reporter for The Times.
