        "title": "Ian Rogers, Apple Music Executive, Is Leaving Company",
        "fulltext": "A crucial executive in Apple\u2019s new music streaming service is leaving the company, just two months after Apple introduced the service and began an intense competition with Spotify for dominance of the online music market.\nIan Rogers, who was in charge of Apple\u2019s online radio services, including its Beats 1 station, has resigned from the company, Apple confirmed on Friday. His departure was said to be abrupt and a surprise to fellow employees. Mr. Rogers was said to be moving to Britain to work for a company unrelated to Apple and streaming music, according to two people briefed on his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. According to one of these people, the new company was a luxury brand.\nMr. Rogers was one of the main forces behind Beats 1, an Internet radio station that features the former BBC radio D.J.Zane Lowe, among other guest announcers like Elton John, Dr. Dre and Pharrell Williams. A longtime figure in the digital music world who has cultivated close contacts with musicians, Mr. Rogers began his career running the Beastie Boys\u2019 website while still in college in the 1990s, and he later worked for Yahoo and thedigital marketing company Topspin.He joined Beats in early 2013 as the chief executive of its planned music service, once code-named Daisy. Beats, best known for its headphone line, was purchased by Apple last year for $3 billion.\nDifferent music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.\nIt was unclear what effect Mr. Rogers\u2019s departure would have on Apple\u2019s new music offerings, which include a monthly streaming subscription plan similar to Spotify. The company\u2019s new music line was introduced in late June, with a three-month trial period for new customers. This month Apple said that11 million peoplearound the world had tried the new service. But the music business is nervously awaiting the end of the trial period \u2014 when customers will have to pay for access \u2014 to judge its success.\nSpotify offers a paid version as well as a free one supported by advertising. Of its 75 million users around the world, 20 million are signed up for paying subscriptions, while the rest listen free.\nResponse to Apple\u2019s subscription service has been mixed, although Beats 1 has largely received high praise for its programming.\nMr. Rogers declined to comment on the news of his departure, which was first reported byThe Financial Times."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Apple\u2019s old iPhoto app had its own Trash area, which held the pictures I deleted from my library until I used the Empty iPhoto Trash command to remove them permanently from my hard drive. The newer Photos for OS X app does not have a Trash area, nor an Empty Trash command, and I don\u2019t see photos I delete in the regular Mac Trash. Are these images instantly erased?\nA.ThePhotos app for OS Xmight not have its own labeled Trash area, but it does not immediately wipe the pictures you delete from your image library or your hard drive. Instead of a Trash folder, Photos dumps the pictures you discard into aRecently Deletedalbum. You can see the unwanted images in Photos by going to the File menu and selecting Show Recently Deleted.\nBy default, the Recently Deleted album does not wait around for you to empty it. Photos that you remove from your picture library stay in the Recently Deleted album for about 30 days before they are automatically and permanently deleted from your Mac; you may get up to 40 days before deletion if you use Apple\u2019siCloud Photo Libraryto share images among your devices and computers.\nWhen you go into the Recently Deleted album, each photo is labeled with the number of days left until it is permanently wiped. If you change your mind and want to restore discarded images to your library, click to select the photos you want to save and then click the Recover button in the top-right corner of the Photos window. On the other hand, you can speed up the permanent erasure of the images in the Recently Deleted album by clicking the Delete All button in the Photos window, or by selecting specific pictures and clicking the Delete button.\nQ.How do you force-quit an app that often freezes on an Android Lollipop tablet?\nA.You can forcibly shut downa sluggish or misbehaving app(and all of its background services) on most Android Lollipop gadgets by opening the Settings icon on the main screen and then pressing Apps (or Application Manager) on the Settings screen. Choose the app from the list of installed programs and then tap the Force Stop button. Android may give you a standard warning about the app behaving badly if you force-stop it and give you a chance to cancel the action.\nIf you need to quit the app because it is behaving erratically or you are troubleshooting the tablet, you have a few more options on the app\u2019s own settings page. For instance, you can clear the app\u2019s cache of temporary files or delete data the app has stored on your device. (Each app\u2019s page of settings also displays the permissions it has to interact with your gadget\u2019s hardware and software, in case you want to see how much access it has to other parts of the tablet.)\nAs general troubleshooting steps, restarting your tablet and checking for updates to its installed apps might fix certain issues. To check for app updates manually, open the Play Store app on your home screen, tap the Menu icon in the top-left corner and select My Apps to see if any new versions are waiting.\nYou can also look for any available Android system updates by opening the Settings icon, selecting About Tablet, then System Updates and Check For Update. If you have had enough of a particular app, you can remove it from the tablet by tapping the Uninstall button in the top-right corner of the app\u2019s settings page."

        "title": "New Dr. Dre Album Serves as a Test for Apple Music",
        "fulltext": "When Apple introduced its new streaming service, Apple Music, at the end of June, one of the big questions hanging over it was whether it could compete with outlets like Spotify to deliver blockbuster results for big new albums.\nIn Apple Music\u2019s first major test, the answer is a qualified yes. Dr. Dre\u2019s album \u201cCompton: A Soundtrack\u201d \u2014 a loose tie-in to the film \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d \u2014 had 25 million streams around the world in its first week, and also sold nearly half a million downloads through Apple\u2019s iTunes store, Apple executives said on Sunday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to show what we can do in terms of communicating music to a worldwide audience and helping artists at the same time,\u201d said Jimmy Iovine, the former record executive who helped build the new service afterApple paid $3 billion last year for Beats, the electronics company and music brand he started with Dr. Dre.\nStill, the album\u2019s performance was not quite enough to send it to No. 1 in the United States.\nWhen Billboard\u2019s latest album chart is released on Monday, \u201cCompton\u201d is expected to open in second place, beaten by \u201cKill the Lights,\u201d from the country star Luke Bryan. According to industry estimates, \u201cCompton\u201d \u2014 which is being offered only through Apple for its first two weeks \u2014 had about 11 million streams in the United States.\nIn the intensifying contest over streaming music, all numbers related to Apple have been scrutinized for signs of whether its early performance represents fast or slow progress for a company of its vast scale. Apple, long the biggest retailer of music, has more than 800 million customer accounts around the world, but as a late entry to streaming it has to rely heavily on the heft of its brand to compete in an increasingly crowded market.\nThis month, Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, said that since Apple Music was released on June 30, it hadattracted 11 million peopleto sign up for trial subscriptions, which are free for 90 days. Once those trials expire, the service costs $10 a month, the going rate for comparable subscriptions from outlets like Spotify, Rhapsody or Google Play.\n\u201cEleven million is not bad,\u201d said Russ Crupnick, an analyst at MusicWatch, which tracks the habits of online music consumers. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a spectacular number if you take in the number of Apple users that exist worldwide.\u201d\nCompared with other big streaming hits this year, the showing for \u201cCompton\u201d is also modest. Drake\u2019s \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late,\u201d released in February, had 48 million streams in one week, while Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d had nearly 39 million in March. Those albums benefited from the popularity of Spotify, which has 20 million subscribers around the world, and another 55 million people who listen to the service free with advertising.\n\u201cCompton,\u201d released by Interscope Records, is Dr. Dre\u2019s first album in 16 years, and its release has already had wide cultural impact. Made in secret by Dr. Dre, one of hip-hop\u2019s most celebrated innovators, it came out on Aug. 7, a week before the release of \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which tells the story of Dr. Dre\u2019s group N.W.A. and had$56.1 millionin ticket sales in its opening weekend.\nThe album very likely benefited from the promotional push for the film. But for the music industry, it also demonstrated the reach and marketing power of Apple\u2019s system. Dr. Dre, who like Mr. Iovine is now a top consultant to Apple, was working on the album until just days before its release. By keeping its existence closely held within Apple, the company was able to prevent it from leaking online, a fate that damages the release impact of many big albums.\nDr. Dre announced the album onBeats 1, Apple Music\u2019s Internet radio platform, and it was promoted heavily through Apple Music and iTunes.\nYet so far Apple\u2019s new service has had amixed reactionin the music and tech press, and its impact on the music charts over all has been minimal. In a comparison of Nielsen streaming data for a dozen popular albums, most had increases of 10 to 20 percent in the week that Apple Music\u2019s numbers were first incorporated into the charts, but had flat results or even a loss the next week.\nOne of the few examples that shows the direct influence of Apple is Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989,\u201d which Ms. Swift made available for streaming only on Apple Music. In the week that Nielsen added Apple\u2019s streaming numbers, \u201c1989\u201d went from a statistically insignificant 5,000 streams a week to 2.4 million, a number roughly equivalent to the weekly streaming totals for comparable artists like Katy Perry and Lorde.\nNielsen does not otherwise divulge sales or streaming numbers for individual retailers.\nApple is expected to begin an extensive marketing push for Apple Music this month, with television commercials and outdoor billboards that could help raise the service\u2019s profile and put more pressure on Spotify, the leading streaming service, in the hunt to sign up new subscribers.\nAnother question for Apple is the effect of its streaming service on download sales, which have been declining rapidly for the last two years but remain one of the music industry\u2019s top sources of revenue.\nThis year, as streaming has grown, album sales are down 3 percent from the same period last year, and last week\u2019s No. 1, the soundtrack to Disney Channel\u2019s TV movie \u201cDescendants,\u201d had thelowest salesfor any top album since at least 1991.\nSo far, Apple Music\u2019s effect on download sales seems minor, said David Bakula, a senior analyst at Nielsen, as millions of customers test out streaming but also continue to pay to download songs from iTunes. But that may change as customers change the way they consume music, and more listeners turn to streaming music.\nAs that happens, Apple\u2019s challenge will be to make itself a consumer favorite at a time when various other streaming services have already begun to take hold.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got really established services out there, like Pandora, Spotify and Deezer, that people really like,\u201d Mr. Crupnick, the MusicWatch analyst, said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to penetrate the market as the second, third, fourth brand in, even if that brand is Apple.\u201d"

Is there security software to protect me?\nA.The\u201cStagefright bug\u201dwas recently discovered by a researcher at the Zimperium security firm, who showed how a vulnerable Android device could be compromised by malicious code embedded in a video sent viaMultimedia Messaging Service(MMS).According to Zimperium, at least 950 million Android devices were at risk from the Stagefright bug, which affects versions of the software as far back as Android 2.2 (Froyo).\nAfter the Exodus Intelligence research firmfound problemswith the original update, a patch for the patch was created and should be on the way fromGoogle,Motorolaand various wireless carriers. Install any update when you are notified one is ready for your phone or tablet. If you have not been notified about an update,check manually in the system\u2019s settingsor contact your carrier to ask about Stagefright patches.\nFree apps that test your device for vulnerability to the Stagefright bug are also available in theGooglePlay store. If you want to scan your device with such an app, it is a good idea to get one from a known mobile-security company likeLookoutorZimperium. While these apps do not fix the problem, they can tell whether you have the problem to begin with.\nAs for security software to protect your device from general threats, several companies offer apps designed to detect and thwart malware on mobile gadgets. Some of the more full-featured security apps include other tools like parental controls, call blockers and message filters. TheAV-Testsite has a roundup and ratings for current Android security products atwww.av-test.org/en/antivirus/mobile-devices.\nStepping Out\nWith iOS 8\nQ.I nowknow how to turn off the iOS step counteron aniPhone, but where do I go to see the number of steps I have actually taken?\nA.If your iPhone has the fitness-tracking setting enabled, you can see your daily step count in theiOS 8 Health app. The app is part of the system and should be somewhere on your iPhone Home screen; its icon shows a small red heart on a white background. The app works on the iPhone 4s (and later) or a fifth-generation iPod Touch running iOS 8.\nOnce you find the Health app, tap it open. The first screen you should see is the Dashboard, which displays the step count and other health-related data that the phone has collected on its own \u2014 or through any other medical or fitness-related apps you install and configure to work with Health.\nThe Dashboard shows a chart of your step count by the day, week, month or year, and provides a daily average. Another chart shows your footwork as measured in the total walking or running distance for the various time periods, as well as the number of flights of stairs you have climbed.\nTIP OF THE WEEKMac OS X users have long had an option in the Print box tosave a document on screen as a PDF fileinstead of sending it to a printer. While Windows users could quickly convert documents to PDF using Microsoft Word or other third-party tools, Windows 10 users can now make PDFs from files without additional software.\nIn Windows 10, click the Print button or press Control-P on the keyboard for a web page, document or other file you want to save.

I am back from my Hawaiian vacation with a fabulous tan and a desire to quit my job and move to Oahu forever. Alas, I will settle for returning to our weekly newsletter, which is ... almost as nice.\nFarhad:Admit it, you couldn\u2019t stand to be away. Our weekly chats about business are much more fun than an island getaway.\nMike:Right. So.\nThis last week has been mostly bad news. The entire stock market took a dive, then rebounded, then rebounded again from that rebound. I have no idea which rebound we\u2019re on now. Tech stocksseem to be up, though, maybethanks to Apple\u2019s chief, Tim Cook?\nWe\u2019re still seeing fallout fromthe hackingof Ashley Madison, the website for extramarital affairs, though apparently the site\u2019s users were mostly men talking towomen who never used the site. Oh, and Amazon\u2019s smartphone and tablet division is having layoffs,per The Wall Street Journal, because I guess people don\u2019t want to buy Amazon smartphones and tablets. (I know I don\u2019t.)\nOne thing I do want to talk about that received some attention on Wednesday:Facebook\u2019s \u201cM\u201d project. It\u2019s a smart digital assistant, built directly into Facebook\u2019s messaging app, and it\u2019s supposed to help people perform menial, everyday tasks like ordering flowers for your spouse or booking a table at a restaurant.\nMy first reactions were A) cool and B) ugh.\n\u201cCool\u201d because this thing uses a mix of intelligent algorithms to suggest things to you and human customer service reps who can help train M to become better. It is also an interesting use of text messaging \u2014 a tool that pretty much everyone is accustomed to using for communication these days.\nBut I said \u201cugh\u201d because this, along with so many other recent Silicon Valley start-ups, seems like a thing created to satisfy the whims of people who are flush with cash and mostly need to worry about so-called first-world problems. If I ever get to the point where my biggest dilemma is that it\u2019s too difficult for me to buy gifts or make restaurant reservations, then you can start playing the world\u2019s tiniest violin for me. Am I being too cynical?\nFarhad:I get your worry about Silicon Valley focusing on stuff for rich people (I\u2019ve fretted about it before), but from what I can tell, Facebook\u2019s M doesn\u2019t sound like an app for \u201cthe 1 Percent.\u201d\nInstead, it sounds more like an improved version of digital assistants like Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana (well,Facebook saysit\u2019s improved; I haven\u2019t tried it). I think of those assistants as friendly user interfaces for that most ubiquitous assistant of all, Google.\nI bet that when these artificial intelligent agents begin to work really well, they\u2019ll be able to compress several Google searches and lots of clicking around the web into a single query: Instead of going to a travel site to search for flights and a hotel, agonizing over lots of choices, you will say, \u201cHey, M, book me a week in New York in the middle of September,\u201d and your software will take care of the whole thing for you. And just as Google is useful for more than just rich people, this sort of thing would probably find mainstream appeal \u2014 as useful for scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment or child care as it is for booking dinner at Per Se and a night at the Plaza.\nCan you tell I\u2019m really excited about artificial intelligence? I find Siri and its kin pretty dumb today, but I can\u2019t wait for these bots to take over the world. Why do you hate robots so much, Mike?\nMike:I don\u2019t know. I watched \u201cThe Terminator\u201d a lot as a kid. I figure Skynet will kill us all at some point.\nLook, Yann LeCun,the man Facebook hiredto work on artificial intelligence, is a smart guy. So I don\u2019t discount his ability to do some truly amazing things in this field, as well as David Marcus, the man running the M project inside of Facebook Messenger.\nCould A.I. one day accomplish a lot of cool things for us? Sure. Am I making a big, paranoid leap of logic when I think that Facebook\u2019s restaurant reservations robot could one day enslave humanity to do its cold, soulless bidding? Probably.\nI\u2019m just saying that someone has to be wary of this stuff, right? I mean, I\u2019ve gotStephen Hawking and Elon Muskon my side. And they\u2019re pretty smart guys, too.\nI sound like a Luddite. Sometimes I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a tech reporter.\nFarhad:So let\u2019s get this straight \u2014 in the span of a few paragraphs, you went from worrying that Facebook was building a tool for the rich to speculating that the new feature might be the first step in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to enslave us all?\nActually, come to think of it, I don\u2019t really have much evidence that you\u2019re wrong.\nNo, but seriously: I\u2019ve been on the fence about these worries regarding artificial intelligence. On the one hand, as you point out, many smart people have expressed real alarm about future A.I. On the other hand,current A.I. seems so unintelligent, and so potentially useful, that I can\u2019t help but celebrate any innovation in the field.\nWhat can I say? Some men like to watch the world burn.\nMike:I think we ended on an optimistic note? It\u2019s good to be back."

        "fulltext": "Rite Aid, the nationwide pharmacy and retail chain, announced on Tuesday it would accept smartphone payments from Apple and Google, two of the largest players in mobile wallet technology, beginning this weekend.\nThat will include Apple Pay, Google Wallet and the coming Android Pay at all of Rite Aid\u2019s 4,600 retail stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia, the company said.\nRite Aid is just the latest national retailer to accept these forms of payment, which require little more than the wave of a smartphone to pay for items with a credit card at the register. Retailers likeMcDonalds and Whole Foodshave accepted Apple Pay since the product first started last year. More stores, including Sephora andBest Buy,also participate.\nBut Rite Aid\u2019s inclusion is a stark change from just nine months ago, when thepharmacy chain shut off the abilityfor its credit card terminals to accept Apple Pay and Google Wallet. That was because of contractual agreements with Merchant Customer Exchange, a coalition of retailers that plans to offer a competing mobile payments\n                                        product, according to two people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.\nSome of these agreements expired this year, according to these people, who requested anonymity because the terms of the agreement are not public.

        "title": "Doubt Starts Chipping Away at the Market\u2019s Mind-Set",
        "fulltext": "In the stock market, until recently, just about any news was good news.\nCompany earnings stumbled? Investors shrugged them off, sending shares higher. Economic growth was disappointing? So what.\nBut now that is changing.\nConsider the recent trading in Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company and a certifiable stock market darling. Apple announcedthird-quarter resultson July 21 that were \u201camazing,\u201d according to Tim Cook, its chief executive. Revenue rose 33 percent over the same period last year, and earnings per share were up 45 percent.\nBut investors seized on the fact that demand for the iPhone and the company\u2019s new smartwatch didn\u2019t meet expectations. Apple\u2019s shares have lost 11.3 percent since then.\n\u201cI thought the break in Apple was a pretty big deal,\u201d said Bill Fleckenstein, a veteran money manager atFleckenstein Capitalin Seattle. \u201cThey made all the numbers, but units were light. Maybe that is a precursor to what the entire tape is going to show us.\u201d\nThe reaction to China\u2019s devaluation was even more telling. Instead of viewing it as a competitive tool to lift exports and stimulate growth \u2014 as was the case when Japan took steps to devalue the yen \u2014 global investors were rattled, fearing that it meant the Chinese government was convinced that its economy was in much worse shape than conveyed by official statistics.\nAs investors absorb the meaning of these moves, they also seem to be opening their eyes to other market wonders that may prove ephemeral. The question is, Are we seeing signs of a sea change in investors\u2019 attitudes?\nAnother example is the recent rout in shares of Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of specialty coffee and single-cup brewing systems. A former highflier that traded as high as $137 in January, the stock collapsed after the company warned on Aug. 5 that sales and earnings would decline this year. The shares lost 30 percent the following day and are down 62 percent year-to-date.\nTrying to plumb the mind-set of investors is always a tricky exercise, of course. But when one investment assumption is questioned \u2014 a perpetually strong Chinese economy, say \u2014 other bits of conventional wisdom go under the microscope too.\nDoubts may be creeping into the notion that companies with no earnings should trade at sky-high valuations. Some are starting to wonder whether corporate profits are being artificially elevated by share buybacks or other tactics.\nThen there\u2019s the biggest assumption of them all \u2014 that the Federal Reserve will always be there to save the day.\nAn aging bull market often coincides with investors\u2019 starting to question these kinds of assumptions, strategists say.\nThat\u2019s the view of James Stack, president ofInvesTech Research, a money manager in Whitefish, Mont., who publishes a highly ranked investment newsletter.\n\u201cThis is the third-longest bull market in 80 years, and we are starting to see some deterioration develop,\u201d Mr. Stack said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at market breadth, the number of stocks participating has been narrowing.\u201d\nEven as the Nasdaq was reaching new highs this year, for example, other indexes, including those made up of transportation stocks or utilities, were trading well off their highs. This divergence is not the sign of a healthy market, Mr. Stack said.\nFrancis Gannon, co-chief investment officer at Royce Funds, which specializes in small-cap stocks, also thinks we are at an inflection point. The upside-down market \u2014 where untested companies\u2019 shares vastly outperform those of more solid companies \u2014 may be in the process of righting itself, he said.\nMr. Gannon noted that fully one-third of the companies in the Russell 2000 stock index do not earn any profits, the highest percentage in a nonrecessionary period. And through the second quarter, a majority of the performance in the Russell 2000 index came from companies that lost money before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, he said.\n\u201cThe laws of finance have been suspended for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Gannon told me last week. \u201cNow this is starting to crack. I think we are on a road to normalization.\u201d\nIf market sentiment is indeed changing, Mr. Stack is concerned that many investors may be quick to sell their shares in a swoon, amplifying a downturn. He\u2019s especially worried about two groups: investors who have bought shares on margin, using borrowed money, and those who have been pushed into the market in search of returns because of low interest rates.\nCertainly the use of leverage to buy stocks is very near its peak. According to the New York Stock Exchange,margin debtstood at $505 billion in June, the most recent figure available. That\u2019s down just a bit from the April peak of $507 billion, but up 9 percent from the same period last year.\n\u201cMoney borrowed to buy stocks tends to be nervous money,\u201d Mr. Stack said.\nEqually nervous may be the legions of traditional savers who felt compelled to buy equities to generate a viable yield on their investments. \u201cThe multigenerational low in interest rates has driven a lot of people into stocks who would not normally be there,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cThat money could exit the markets quickly once rates start to normalize.\u201d\nAs an active fund manager who buys shares of companies with established operations and genuine earnings, Mr. Gannon says he is eager for a market in which investors behave more rationally.\n\u201cThis particular cycle has been affected by the actions of the Fed and the many unintended consequences of what the Fed has done,\u201d Mr. Gannon said. \u201cWe think we are at a point where that is beginning to change.\u201d\nDistinct market shifts are visible only in hindsight, of course. Still, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to be watchful for them and for the profits \u2014 and losses \u2014 they may bring."

        "fulltext": "Evena pep talk from the chief executive of Apple, the single biggest American company by market value, did little to soothe investors on Monday.\nAs the Chinese stock market slump ignited fear around the world, Apple\u2019s chief,Timothy D. Cook, broadcast to Wall Street that the tech giant\u2019s business in China was just fine, thank you. His corporate cheerleading wasn\u2019t just unusual because of its message, but also because of his delivery method, an email to a financial television host.\nIt worked \u2014 for a time. But by the end of the day, Apple and the rest of the market had yielded to the gravitational pull of investor fear.\nWhile Apple\u2019s 2.5 percent loss was milder thanthe overall market\u2019s plunge, Mr. Cook is fighting the same forces as ordinary investors and financial professionals. On some days, market psychology \u2014 and the tendency for panicked sell-offs to feed on themselves \u2014 counts for more than long-term fundamentals like growing iPhone sales in China or strong earnings results.\nInvestors are now trying to separate the fact from the fear, as they digest how China\u2019s problems will affect the rest of the world. And the process could make for some messiness in the markets, particularly in the United States, where investors have been lulled into a sense of security by a long bull run in stocks.\nBy 2 p.m. Monday, Gregory J. Blank, an independent financial adviser based in New York, had already fielded nearly 20 phone calls from anxious investors. He handles assets for about 200 clients, a mixture of younger adults and retirees.\n\u201cThey see it in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get worried. They call.\u201d Mr. Blank said that the older investors were more concerned, since it was harder for them to replenish whatever they had saved up for retirement. But the worst thing to do right now is to panic, he advises them.\nOne retiree, a former secretary at a global investment bank, was among the concerned callers. \u201cShe started the phone call with \u2018Should we sell?\u2019\u201d Mr. Blank said. \u201cBy the end of the phone call, she said, \u2018Well, maybe we should buy.\u2019\u201d\nBut staying put is not always the best option for everyone \u2014 creating the sort of selling pressure that could add to the tumult.\nA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.\nDavid Enrico, a 31-year-old model from Los Angeles, eyed the market with growing anxiety on Monday. Mr. Enrico and his wife are preparing to buy a home and are concerned about the short-term effects on their savings.\n\u201cI just saw this, and I got a little nervous because I don\u2019t want my nest egg, my down payment for the house, to be subject to the market volatility,\u201d he said.\nMr. Enrico emailed Mr. Blank to make sure that he could liquidate his positions immediately if need be, but so far hasn\u2019t pulled the trigger.\n\u201cIn the short run, market sell-offs are limited by psychology,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. The biggest risk here is that we all collectively lose our nerves at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that enough of a frenzy will be whipped up that people could hunker down,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen, but that\u2019s the biggest risk.\u201d\nAdvisers and corporate executives are now trying to assure investors that a slowing Chinese economy isn\u2019t necessarily a big problem for most American companies.\nAnd Mr. Cook\u2019s comments, which were sent to Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d did help Apple weather the worst of Monday\u2019s trading. After opening down more than 10 percent from Friday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s shares quickly rebounded, helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover somewhat from an early plunge of more than 1,000 points.\n\u201cI get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August,\u201d Mr. Cook said in theemail to Mr. Cramer. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring.\u201d\nLike Mr. Cook, many Wall Street seers insist the overall data doesn\u2019t foreshadow an economic slump \u2014 or worse.\nFor starters, Mr. Kelly noted that only about one five-hundredths, or 0.2 percentage point, ofgross domestic productin the United States is generated by exports to China. Long-term investors with multiyear time horizons, he cautions, shouldn\u2019t let themselves be gripped by the fear that has overtaken some professional traders.\n\u201cValuations aren\u2019t stretched, and there isn\u2019t a general economic downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very tough to trade these markets, but that view applies to a much smaller slice of the population.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, China, while an important source of earnings gains for large American companies, isn\u2019t expected to tumble into the kind of outright recession the United States went through from 2008 to 2009. It just may not grow at the 7 percent that Chinese leadership is targeting.\n\u201cEven the most pessimistic observers think China will still grow by 4 or 5 percent,\u201d said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have 4 or 5 percent growth in this country.\u201d\nShe said that the long, steady rise of the stock market this decade, with relatively few downdrafts, is only adding to the sense of panic now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years since we\u2019ve had a correction like this, and that\u2019s a long time to go without one,\u201d Ms. Warne said. \u201cWhen stocks drop, it\u2019s always scary, but it seems more scary this time because we haven\u2019t had this recently.\u201d\nAlso, technological and structural changes on Wall Street in recent years have ways of amplifying the normal push and pull of the markets. The increase inhigh-frequency trading, and the popularity of strategies that employ computer algorithms rather than humans to buy and sell, can exaggerate volatility.\nAnother possibility for why fear can build so quickly nowadays, experts say, is the exit of some traditional players like banks and brokerage firms. Under pressure from Washington and their own investors, banks and brokerage firms have reduced riskier activities like trading, only to be replaced byhedge funds \u2014 with quicker trigger fingers, in some cases.\nOf course, these explanations are cold comfort as ordinary investors watch their savings shrink. Still, some individuals, having survived the trauma of the recession, are showing a bit of sang-froid because of the fear that has overtaken trading floors from Shanghai to New York to Frankfurt.\nMargaret Matteson of Folsom, Pa., said she heard about the market sell-off on NPR as she was driving to work. She said she would only become worried if there were broader economic implications \u2014 she lost her last job in 2009 during the recession. The latest bout of volatility didn\u2019t make her nervous, but she said she was a bit puzzled about what was behind it.\nMs. Matteson, 33, who manages a software database for an art museum, says she only cares if it affects her job. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it does to my portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to sit there for 20 or 30 years. I like it when it goes down. I chip in and play my little game and put in $25.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Stock Reacts After Tim Cook Email Praises China Sales",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last week, Jim Cramer, the boisterous host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d had a company called Skyworks Solutions on his show. The company, a chip supplier for Apple, said its sales were strong in China, but its stock plummeted afterward anyway, following the global markets into the red.\nAnd that gave Mr. Cramer an idea: What would Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, say about iPhone sales in China, a crucial component to Apple\u2019s future growth?\nHe sent the question to Mr. Cook by email Sunday evening. His letter read: \u201cDear Tim, Just trying to do my best to cover Apple, as always, and I keep running up against \u2018China fears\u2019 and \u2018China worries.\u2019 We are in a tough moment in the market, and any clarity I might be able to get before Squawk on the Street at 9 Eastern would really help.\u201d\nMr. Cook, who is known for being an early riser,sent his replyaround 8 a.m. on Monday \u2014 5 a.m. in California, where he lives.\n\u201cI get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August,\u201d Mr. Cook said in theemail to Mr. Cramer. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring.\u201d\nThe email gave Apple a short-term reprieve, helping lift its stock from 10 percent down to positive territory. Apple ended the day down 2.5 percent. The email also spoke to the amount pressure that companies \u2014 even blue-chip brands like Apple \u2014face in the recent market turmoil.\nJan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, said Apple\u2019s stock had taken a beating largely because of growing concerns about China. A simple solution was to send signals of positive performance in China to Mr. Cramer, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Cook was well aware that Cramer would share it with his viewers and it would therefore quickly become public,\u201d Mr. Dawson said. \u201cApple stock has certainly risen sharply since the email was made public, so it\u2019s arguable that it worked.\u201d\nMr. Cramer said he was surprised to get a response. In March, theApple chief called in to \"Mad Money\"to congratulate Mr. Cramer on the 10th anniversary of the show. Beyond that, Mr. Cramer said he had not cultivated a personal relationship with Mr. Cook, though the TV host noted he had long been an advocate for holding on to the Cupertino, Calif., company\u2019s stock. Mr. Cramer is the co-manager of a charitable trust portfolio, Action Alerts Plus, which holdsshares of Apple.\nA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a stalwart in saying, \u2018Don\u2019t trade Apple,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to trade it. I think you should own it.\u201d\nChina has become an increasingly important market for Apple. The company\u2019s growth has slowed over the last few years in mature markets like the United States and parts of Europe, where the smartphone market has become saturated. China, however, remains a huge untapped market where plenty of people are still buying smartphones for the first time.\nApple has long laid the groundwork to reap big sales in China and revenue growth from the region hassteadily gained momentum. The company in late 2013struck an important dealto sell iPhones through China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest phone carrier. Apple is also expanding its operations in the region, planning to increase its number of stores to 40 by mid-2016.\nSome analysts have raised questions about whether Apple, the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization, can maintain its overall torrid pace of growth. Shares in the company are up about 45 percent in the last two years. But in the last six months, the stock has fallen over 18 percent.\nMr. Cook also wrote to Mr. Cramer that he continued to believe \u201cthat China represents an unprecedented opportunity over the long term.\u201d\nOn Monday, some regulatory experts raised concerns about whether Mr. Cook\u2019s email to Mr. Cramer had violated the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s fair disclosure regulations. The rules, commonly known as Reg F.D., require companies to share material information to all investors at the same time.\nIn previous financial earnings calls, Apple had said it was bullish about its strong, long-term growth in China. But the S.E.C. has signaled that reaffirmation of financial guidance, in some contexts, could even lead to a full-disclosure violation, according to Thomas A. Sporkin, a partner for Buckley Sandler and a former S.E.C. enforcement official. In 2005, thecommission charged the Flowserve Corporation, a manufacturer, with violating Reg F.D. for reiterating its guidance to a group of analysts before sharing the same information with the public.\nMr. Cook\u2019s reaffirmation to Mr. Cramer of Apple\u2019s performance in China was softer and more generalized than when Flowserve shared specific numbers, Mr. Sporkin said. But he added that it was unclear whether Mr. Cramer could have a different interpretation of the email based on his relationship with Mr. Cook.\nApple, CNBC and the S.E.C. declined to comment. In response to questions raised about potential violations of the S.E.C.\u2019s disclosure rules, Mr. Cramer would only say: \u201cI got what I got. I got an email from Tim Cook.\u201d\nBill Singer, a regulatory lawyer, said he expected the S.E.C. to investigate the context of the email and provide guidelines as to whether companies can disclose financial information this way to selected news reporters.\n\u201cI can see here that Cook is literally dancing on the edge of a razor,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s one of the largest companies in the world telling one reporter via a private email that our ongoing quarter is actually going to surprise people, and I consider that material.\u201d"

        "title": "Reviewing Olio, the Latest Entrant in the Smartwatch Sweepstakes",
        "fulltext": "What happens when you write about how you were not overwhelmed by yourApple Watchand sent it back? You get a lot of messages about other smartwatches in the making, and how they have solved the problems.\nThe latest offering to come across my desk came fromOlio, a start-up brand founded in part by a not-quite-30-something called Steve Jacobs (I know, I know, take out the \u201cac,\u201d and what do you have left?) who has already been through the training grounds of Apple, HP and Amazon. Olio is really at the beginning of its life span: It has sold one round of 1,000 watches online, and it\u2019s just unveiling the next batch. Over all, I think it has some potential.\nHere\u2019s what I like: It is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. It has a sort of pleasing giantness that is fashiony, as opposed to gadgety. And it doesn\u2019t do everything, but most of what it does seems useful.\nAesthetically, the Olio watch reminds me most of a really oversize Cartier Ballon Bleu \u2014 it has the same curves \u2014 with the more hard-core aesthetic of a sports watch. In size, however, it is most comparable, according to Mr. Jacobs, with the Michael Kors Boyfriend Watch, though a lot heavier and thicker (all that technology). It still takes up the majority of the width of my forearm, but it does do that oversize-watch slide-around, mostly because it is so weighty, which has the optical effect of making your arms look pleasingly slim.\nThe watch comes in a variety of what Mr. Jacobs called \u201cstyles,\u201d that are, in fact, color ways, because while the strap and metal may change, the shape of the watch does not. (This language blunder pretty much summed up the gaps between fashion and technology to me.)\nThe face is either surgical grade brushed 316L stainless steel or matte black, and the bracelets are leather (black, brown, tan), or steel link. Five hundred pieces have been made in steel as well as in black, along with 100 pieces plated in 24-karat yellow and 100 in 18-karat rose gold, with an alligator or link bracelet. I think those are too garish, but the matte black and brushed steel are pretty chic.\nIt is impact and scratch resistant, so you could also take it rock climbing, if the urge so hit.\nThe display is of a digitally recreated traditional watch face complete with hands, though it has a quirky added touch: a \u201ccloud\u201d of notifications that grows between the numbers to create a pictogram of your busiest periods. It doesn\u2019t really serve much purpose other than being able to tell you at a glance when you got the most emails/texts/notifications during a day, which is information that is probably already glaringly obvious. But it\u2019s kind of pretty, and I guess it could serve as a fun party trick. Like most smartwatches, it\u2019s in sleep mode when resting to save power, leaving the impression of a big black hole on your arm, which I still find visually problematic.\nOlio doesn\u2019t work with apps, but it organizes your emails and texts for you; swipe one way and you can see what came in \u201cearlier,\u201d swipe the other for new notifications. Here\u2019s my favorite part, though: It comes with a cloud-based \u201cpersonal assistant.\u201d If you are, for example, driving, and you get a call that you can\u2019t take, you can swipe one way. The assistant will send your caller a text saying that you are driving and will call back, and then it will text you reminding you to do so. The assistant will also learn to prioritize by clocking (no pun intended) user behavior, \u00e0 la Pandora, so if you always look at emails from people X, Y and Z, they will pop up first.\nPrices range from $595 for the steel/leather version to $1,395 for the gold-plated one.\nIn any case, the other nice thing about the watch is that, like most watches worth investing in, it is meant to be used for a while; it\u2019s not a one-year planned obsolescence thing.\nI still think the Olio is mostly going to appeal to men, primarily because of its size and weight. I\u2019m not ready to buy one for myself (or entirely convinced that the wrist is really a body part that needs to be colonized by tech), but when it comes to something I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing on the arm of a loved one, while I wouldn\u2019t call this a big step forward, it\u2019s maybe a pretty sprightly hop in the right direction."
