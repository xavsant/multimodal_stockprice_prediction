        "title": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "This was a terrible year for the tech industry.\nThat\u2019s an odd thing to say at a time of record growth and profits. In 2017, large American tech companies have kept hauling in more money and more users, and \u2014 to a degree that might seem dystopian \u2014 they continued toexpand their foothold in our lives. This was a year in which Amazon created a way for its delivery drivers tolet themselves into your house, andApple created a phoneyou can unlock with your face.\nYet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.\nWhy? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.\nLet me explain how this is all playing out.\n\u201cPlatforms\u201d are the shiniest prizes in the tech business. The reason the five most valuable American tech companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft \u2014 are also the five most valuable American companiesof any kindis that they own these fundamental building blocks of the digital economy, whether they are operating systems, app stores, social networks, cloud servers, or shipping and logistics infrastructure.\nThink of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.\nFor years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.\nIn 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.\nYou could argue that they had no choice. In the past year, social networks and search engines have been blamed for undermining the news media, fostering echo chambers, and spreading misinformation, hate, misogyny and other general social unpleasantness. (YouTube, for example, removed lots of videos ofkids being pretend-tortured by their parents.) There was also, of course, the unfolding saga of the companies\u2019 role in Russia\u2019s propaganda efforts, which resulted in their being hauled before lawmakers.\nAnd then there were the larger questions about who makes the platforms and who benefits from them. The tech industry is overwhelmingly run by men, and it is a place of little racial and class diversity. Awhistle-blowing blog post by Susan Fowler, an engineer who detailed a culture of harassment and misogyny at the ride-hailing company Uber, sparked a women\u2019s movement in tech that was then subsumed by the global #MeToo movement.\nMany tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201d\nNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.\nSeveral other tech execs have expressed similar commitments to a deeper mission. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,told my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkinthat Apple had a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to attempt to heal the nation\u2019s social and economic fissures.\nSure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.\nFirst, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.\nSecond, for the first time in years, there\u2019s real pressure from lawmakers. That has resulted in some real-world retreats. For instance, tech giants last monthstopped fighting a bill in Congressthat would allow victims of sex trafficking to sue websites that supported the sex trade. In another time, this would have been a gimme for tech companies \u2014 they aren\u2019t responsible for how people use their services, remember?\nNot this time.\nIf the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.\nMr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.\nAnd in response to criticism from former Facebook employees that its tech might be addictive,the company saidthis week that it has conducted extensive research on the subject and was \u201cusing it to inform our product development.\u201d\nBut what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?\nI don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\n\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\nOr consider the question of diversity. I asked Ellen Pao \u2014 the former Reddit chief executive whounsuccessfully sued the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byersfor gender discrimination \u2014 what she made of the industry\u2019s efforts to address the issue this year.\n\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201d\nShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\n\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.\nMs. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.\nSo, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse."

        "title": "Apple Provides Hedge Against Tech Backlash",
        "fulltext": "Authorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it\u2019s likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.\nEurope will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.\nFining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon\u2019s listing of own-label products ahead of competitors\u2019 offerings.\nThe biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It\u2019s probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere \u2014 reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.\nParts of Europe\u2019s agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.\nApple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it\u2019s no monopolist. The iPhone\u2019s combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects\u2019 phones. Apple\u2019s inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.\nApple is not carefree. The company\u2019s attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine. Its rivals are looking at major, forced changes in their business models."

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.\nApple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.\nTo put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.\nBut Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.\nThe University of Chicago maintains a database with virtually all companies traded publicly in the United States since December 1925. Alexander Poukchanski, assistant director of index analytics at the Center for Research in Security Prices at the Chicago Booth School of Business,used that datato create a list of the 20 top American companies, ranked by their highest market cap, from 1925 through November.\nNo surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.\nThe list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000. Companies like Intel, Cisco and Oracle appear on the all-time list, too.\nIntriguingly, AT&T made the list twice \u2014 once, in March 2000, and a second time, in July 2016. That is because the University of Chicagosaysthe \u201cold\u201d AT&T went out of existence in November 2005. AT&T was split into many pieces. The new AT&T was formed after SBC, a regional telephone company, bought the old AT&T name.\nWhen you adjust for inflation, the ranking changes.\nHighest market capitalization adjusted\nfor inflation, as of Nov. 30\nPEAK\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\nApple\nMicrosoft\nG.E.\nCisco Systems\nIntel\nAlphabet (Google)\nExxon Mobil\nAmazon\nBerkshire Hathaway\nWalmart\nPfizer\nFacebook\nCitigroup\nAT&T (old)\nJohnson & Johnson\nLucent Technologies\nOracle\nIBM\nJPMorgan Chase\nA.I.G.\n$903\n901\n848\n755\n716\n688\n623\n576\n478\n454\n440\n437\n402\n389\n385\n378\n371\n370\n365\n340\nbillion\nNov. 2017\nDec. 1999\nAug. 2000\nMarch 2000\nAug. 2000\nNov. 2017\nJuly 2007\nNov. 2017\nNov. 2017\nDec. 1999\nJuly 2000\nNov. 2017\nFeb. 2001\nMarch 2000\nOct. 2017\nDec. 1999\nSept. 2000\nJuly 1999\nNov. 2017\nDec. 2000\nHighest market capitalization adjusted\nfor inflation, as of Nov. 30\nPEAK\nApple\nMicrosoft\nG.E.\nCisco Systems\nIntel\nAlphabet (Google)\nExxon Mobil\nAmazon\nBerkshire Hathaway\nWalmart\nPfizer\nFacebook\nCitigroup\nAT&T (old)\nJohnson & Johnson\nLucent Technologies\nOracle\nIBM\nJPMorgan Chase\nA.I.G.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n$903\n901\n848\n755\n716\n688\n623\n576\n478\n454\n440\n437\n402\n389\n385\n378\n371\n370\n365\n340\nbillion\nNov. 2017\nDec. 1999\nAug. 2000\nMarch 2000\nAug. 2000\nNov. 2017\nJuly 2007\nNov. 2017\nNov. 2017\nDec. 1999\nJuly 2000\nNov. 2017\nFeb. 2001\nMarch 2000\nOct. 2017\nDec. 1999\nSept. 2000\nJuly 1999\nNov. 2017\nDec. 2000\nApple\u2019s margin in first place is dramatically reduced.\nIn December 1999, Microsoft\u2019s market cap was $647 billion. That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.\nBut over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.\nGeneral Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.\nEven more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.\nSeven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.\nExxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.\nShare of the total market since 1980\nNO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.\nIn fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.\nThe Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.\nIt may be difficult to remember but, aswe\u2019ve written, IBM had far more stock market swagger in the 1980s than Apple does today.\nIn December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.\nThat is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)\nIn November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.\nIn other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.\nShare of the total market since 1925\nNO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.\nOne explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.\nThat said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.\nFor example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201d\nConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).\nSome formerly colossal companies are no longer stock market powerhouses. For example, U.G.I., now a modest-sized utility company in Pennsylvania, accounted for 2.6 percent of the entire stock market in December 1932. In those days, the firmsayson its website, U.G.I. was a holding company for scores of gas and electric companies, plus major engineering firms.\nBut a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.\nIt is possible that 80 or 90 years from now, journalists and historians will puzzle over Apple\u2019s once titanic stature, too. Why did the iPhone become so important \u2014 and why was it soimmensely profitablefor investors back in the early days of the 21st century?\nThese questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.\nNotes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.
