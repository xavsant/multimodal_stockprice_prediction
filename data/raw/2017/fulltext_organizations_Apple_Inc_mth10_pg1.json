        "title": "Tech\u2019s Troubling New Trend: Diversity Is in Your Head",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Discussing her work at Apple at an event last week about fighting racial injustice, Denise Young Smith,the company\u2019s vice president of diversity and inclusion, said, \u201cThere can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men in a room and they\u2019re going to be diverse, too, because they\u2019re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right: a dozen white men, so long as they were not raised in the same household and don\u2019t think identical thoughts, could be considered diverse. After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments inan email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, \u201cUnderstanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\u201d and \u201cI regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\u201d\nBut Ms. Smith wasn\u2019t the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of \u2014 individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.\nThis overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by aGoogle software engineerthat critiqued the company\u2019s race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \u201cbiological causes.\u201d It included the line, \u201cViewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\u201d\nTo be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won\u2019t do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it\u2019s already achieved.\nIf our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership ofApple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanicin 2016. A recentreport by Recodefound that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.\nThe shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decisionRegents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around affirmative action shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity \u2014 including cognitive diversity \u2014 must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.\nIf this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to theSociety for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016. Employees typically recommend people similar to them in racial identity and gender, so it requires dedicated effort to recruit and hire people who don\u2019t already have identities that match up with those of current employees. Counting up variations of \u201cviewpoints\u201d \u2014 however one might do so \u2014 won\u2019t achieve that. And, to potential applicants from underrepresented groups, statements about \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d will send an unwelcoming message about a company\u2019s real priorities for inclusion.\nAs my former Facebook colleagueRegina Dugan said recently, even if cognitive diversity is a company\u2019s ultimate goal, \u201cwe can\u2019t step away from the idea that diversity also looks like identity diversity.\u201d The effort to hire people with different points of view must not come at the expense of hiring members of actual underrepresented communities who add tangible, bottom-line value \u2014 and who deserve to work in tech as much as anyone.\nMs. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \u201cOur commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d That kind of diversity \u2014 the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive \u2014 is what I hope my industry won\u2019t abandon."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s iPhone X,the most anticipated iPhonesince the original debuted a decade ago, is set to arrive in stores Friday. But unlike past releases, this iPhone may be extra hard to get \u2014 and it might not even be right for you.\nWith a starting price of $999, theiPhone Xis Apple\u2019s first premium-tier iPhone. Its higher price and cutting-edge features skew the device toward early adopters and technology enthusiasts with disposable income. And because of reports about supply constraints, some analysts predict that many iPhone X orders may not be fulfilled until next year.\nSo should you even bother trying to buy one? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the premium iPhone.\nApple openedonline ordersfor the new iPhone last Friday. Just hours after it began taking orders, the website began quoting a shipping time of roughly five to six weeks.\nIn other words, your best bet to get an iPhone X right away is to line up at a retail store on Friday. In a statement, Apple encouraged customers toarrive early\u2014 its stores open at 8 a.m. You could also try your luck at a third-party store, like your carrier or Best Buy, though third-party stores tend to carry fewer units.\nApple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.\nThere are various ways to pay that hefty price.\nThe simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device \u2014 like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier \u2014 whenever you want.\nYou can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.\nAnother option is to go for anearly upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It\u2019s essentially leasing a new phone every year.\nThere are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple\u2019s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you\u2019ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I\u2019m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)\nBefore you splurge, consider your options. Apple\u2019siPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.\nSo what\u2019s the difference? Mainly, the screen.\n\u25a0The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.\n\u25a0The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.\nBoth of the cheaper iPhones have bezels \u2014 the border surrounding the display \u2014 whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.\nOther than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.\nLast but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.\nThe primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.\nFace ID is brand new \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person\u2019s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else\u2019s face is one in a million, according to Apple.\nOlder facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera \u2014 which some people already did withSamsung\u2019s facial-recognitionfeature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.\nIt will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you\u2019re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID."

        "fulltext": "BRUSSELS \u2014 European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon.\nThe effort, which comes as the European Unionconsiders proposalsmeant to increase the sums levied on technology companies, is part of a concerted campaign to revamp how taxes are collected in the 28-nation bloc.\nOfficials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data.\nCritics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies \u2014 an accusation that officials in Europe deny.\nThe moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.\nEuropean officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.\nOn Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner,ordered Luxembourg to collectaround 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, said dated to 2003.\nThe order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when itdirected Ireland to reclaimaround $15.2 billion from Apple.\nIreland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.\nThat earned Irelanda forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager.\nA year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.\nAlthough litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.\nAt the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201d\nThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201d\nApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.\nIn the case of Amazon,the commission saidWednesday that Luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and had conferred on the company a selective advantage. The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing.\nTypically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.\nMs. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201d\nAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\n\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201d\nAmazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.\nIn a statement, Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager\u2019s ruling. \u201cAs Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,\u201d it said.\nIt is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d\nThe investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries haveinvestigated Facebookover its handling of customers\u2019 data.\nMs. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe\u2019s competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country toclaw back about \u20ac30 millionfrom a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case consideringLuxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019sis also continuing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201d\nA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.\nA push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\n\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.\nThe European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries."

Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.\nThe entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.\nYet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.\nThey are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazonhas struggled to make a hit show, while Apple\u2019s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has nowstruck a deal to revive \u201cAmazing Stories,\u201dthe 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there\u2019s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.\nSeveral times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201d\nThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.\nNot long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world\u2019s most popular source of news, a position that hasconsumed its leadersover much of the last year.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.\nDigital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.\nMr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.\nBut there is another side to the story.As I\u2019ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.\nMeanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true:Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants\u2019 eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.\nThe tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201d\nThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?\nIt\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.\nBut even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.\nThis myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or inYouTube\u2019s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.\nThe tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up."

        "fulltext": "CLEVELAND \u2014 It was an honest mistake. That was the conclusion by Major League Baseball on Friday after it investigated why an Arizona Diamondbacks coach was wearing a digital watch in the dugout during his team\u2019s wild card victory over the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday night.\nThe coach, Ariel Prieto, was seen wearing the watch during the game, violating baseball\u2019s rules on the use of electronic communications. Baseball issued a statement saying it had examined the watch and Prieto\u2019s cellphone and had also interviewed him. Nothing suspicious was discovered, the statement said, but Prieto and the Diamondbacks were still fined an undisclosed amount because the watch was in the dugout in the first place.\nLast month, Major League Baseball fined the Boston Red Sox for secretly using electronic communication devices in their dugout in an effort to more quickly transmit the opposing team\u2019s signs to their players on the field. At the time, baseball warned every other team that future violations could incur more serious penalties.\n\u201cM.L.B. found no evidence that Mr. Prieto used the Apple Watch or cellphone for any purpose in the dugout, nor any baseball-related communication on either device during Wednesday\u2019s game,\u201d the statement on Friday said.\nIt also said the fines would be donated to hurricane-relief efforts in Puerto Rico."
