        "fulltext": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Her husband,Steven P. Jobs, famously helped reboot Apple with the \u201cThink Different\u201d advertising campaign.\nNow Laurene Powell Jobs is starting a $50 million project to rethink high school.\nWith an advertising campaign that looks as if it came from Apple\u2019s marketing department, the initiative is meant to create high schools with new approaches to education. In essence, Ms. Powell Jobs and her team of high-profile educators and designers hope they can crowd-source a solution to a problem that has flummoxed policy makers for decades.\n\u201cThe system was created for the work force we needed 100 years ago,\u201d Ms. Powell Jobs said in an interview here Friday. \u201cThings are not working the way we want it to be working. We\u2019ve seen a lot of incremental changes over the last several years, but we\u2019re saying, \u2018Start from scratch.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nCalledXQ: The Super School Project, the campaign is meant to inspire teams of educators and students, as well as leaders from other sectors, to come up with new plans for high schools. Over the next several months, the teams will submit plans that could include efforts like altering school schedules, curriculums and technologies. By fall next year, Ms. Powell Jobs said, a team of judges will pick five to 10 of the best ideas to finance.\nMs. Powell Jobs has for years financedCollege Track, which helps low-income students across the country to enroll and then succeed in college. Since the death of her husband in 2011, Ms. Powell Jobs has taken tentative steps into the public sphere, including advocating an overhaul of immigration laws.\nThe XQ project is the highest-profile project yet of theEmerson Collective, the group that Ms. Powell Jobs uses to finance her philanthropicprojects.\nMs. Powell Jobs has assembled a team of advisers led by Russlynn H. Ali, who worked in the Obama administration\u2019s Education Department as the assistant secretary for civil rights. Ms. Ali, who for the last several years has overseen education grants at Emerson, will serve as the primary public face of the campaign. Michelle Cahill, who has spent more than three decades in education, including as a senior adviser to Joel I. Klein when he was the New York City schools chancellor, has culled much of the research used on the website. Keith Yamashita, a consultant for the project, has worked with Apple, IBM, General Electric and several start-up companies.\nImproving outcomes for high school students has long been a priority in education. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has financed scores of small high schools meant to better educate students through more focused attention and carefully tailored programs. Boston began apushthis year to redesign its public high schools.\n\u201cThere is a huge gap between what students want for their future and what their schools are offering,\u201d Ms. Powell Jobs said. \u201cOnce you have liberation from a system that was designed for the beginning of the century, there\u2019s nobody to blame.\u201d\nMs. Powell Jobs said that while she was committed to ensuring that the new schools are public, she was unsure whether they would be charter schools. She pointed out that she, like most Americans, is a graduate of a public high school. Plans for a national tour to collect ideas for the project do not include a stop at her alma mater in New Jersey, West Milford High School.\n\u201cWe want to make high schools back into the great equalizers they were meant to be,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cThe point is not to have some predetermined outcome. The hunger for change is real, and we\u2019re offering up the tools to communities to make it happen.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hackers have found their way intoApple\u2019s App Store.\nApple confirmed on Sunday that a tool used by software developers for the company\u2019s devices was copied and modified by hackers to put bad code into apps available on the App Store.\nSo farabout 40 appswith malicious code, or malware, have made it into the App Store, said researchers at Palo Alto Networks, an online security company that is investigating the incident. In ablog post, the security company said the breach could potentially affect hundreds of millions of users.\nThe list includes some of the most popular apps in China, like the ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi. Many of the apps are popular elsewhere as well, like the messaging app WeChat, which hasabout 500 million users, and the business card scanner CamCard. The Chinese online security company Qihoo said it has found more than 300 infected apps.\nThe fake developer code \u201cwas posted by untrusted sources,\u201d said Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman. \u201cTo protect our customers, we\u2019ve removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software.\u201d\nIt was unclear on Sunday how many people had downloaded the apps based on the hacked developer tool. Security researchers at the giant Chinese e-commerce companyAlibaba, Palo Alto Networks, the app makers and Apple are working to assess the damage, said Ryan Olson, who leads a threat research team Palo Alto Networks.\nChatter about modified versions of the developer code, called Xcode, started to surface last week on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter.\nResearchers found that some copied versions of Xcode had been modified to embed malicious software into apps. As app makers checked to see whether their products had been infected, Apple and security researchers worked to find and get rid of the bad versions of Xcode, which were all on a cloud hosting service owned by the Chinese Internet company Baidu. Mr. Olson said Baidu has removed them.\nIn a statement posted to an official Tencent blog on Saturday, the company said that the flaw had been repaired and would not affect users who upgrade the WeChat app. \u201cA preliminary investigation into the flaw has revealed that there has been no theft and leakage of users\u2019 information or money, but the WeChat team will continue to closely monitor the situation,\u201d it said.\nApple said on Sunday that it was working with developers to make sure they were using the proper version of Xcode, the tool used to create the apps.\nOnce the infected apps are downloaded, researchers said, the malicious code can open particular websites designed to infect the device with more viruses. It can also open innocuous-looking pop-up screens that ask users for more information, like passwords to their Apple account.\n\u201cSince the dialogue is a prompt from the running application, the victim may trust it and input a password without suspecting foul play,\u201d Palo Alto Networks said in its blog post.\nResearchers said only the most recent versions of the apps created with the counterfeit version of Xcode were at risk.\nThis security breach illustrates the lengths to which hackers will go to break into Apple\u2019s hardware and software, which has long been thought of as having superior security.\n\u201cApple has been extremely successful at keeping malware out of the App Store,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\nMr. Olson said that even in this case, hackers did not crack Apple\u2019s software. Instead they took advantage of the fact that many Chinese developers use copies of Xcode that are held on Chinese servers, since they load faster than the version of the code that\u2019s available from Apple.\nThe bad Xcode was available only to those developers who had disabled Apple\u2019s safety features. Otherwise Apple would have presented a warning that something was wrong with Xcode, Mr. Olson said.\nMany of the websites that were receiving stolen information have been discovered and shut down, according to researchers.\nMr. Olson said versions of Xcode from Apple should be safe."
