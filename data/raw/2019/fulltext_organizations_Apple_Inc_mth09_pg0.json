        "title": "Apple Keeps Making Computer in Texas After Tariff Waivers",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple willmake its new Mac Pro computer in Texasafter the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on some of its Chinese-made parts, the company said on Monday.\nThe United States on Friday granted Apple\u2019s requests for tariff exemptions for 10 Chinese parts in its new $6,000 Mac Pro.\nThe announcement on Monday ended a monthslong public dance between the White House and Apple over tariffs and the company\u2019s ability to build products in the United States.\nApple has for years made the Mac Pro in Texas,an experiment in American manufacturingthat has created some headaches. In June, shortly after Apple unveiled a new version of the Mac Pro,reports surfacedthat Apple would shift the production to China.\nApple then asked the White House to waive tariffs on some components, suggesting it still wanted to make the Mac Pro in the United States. President Trumpresponded on Twitterthat Apple \u201cwill not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China\u201d and that the company should \u201cMake them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\nDays later, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,said Apple wanted to make the Mac Pro in Americabut suggested it needed tariff exemptions to do so. Weeks later, Mr. Trumptweeted thathe was dining with Mr. Cook and that Apple \u201cwill be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!\u201d\nThe Mac Pro is Apple\u2019s most expensive computer, starting at $6,000, and is targeted at professional customers such as photographers and film editors. It is among Apple\u2019s lowest-volume products.\nMr. Trump for years has pressured Apple and other companies to shift manufacturing to the United States. Apple has been able to make a specialized product like the Mac Pro in the United States, but high-volume products like the iPhone would be difficult to manufacture outside China because no country can match China\u2019s number of trained workers and its supply-chain infrastructure, according to analysts and former Apple employees.\nStill, to reduce its dependence on China, where it assembles most of its products, Apple is investigating ways to increase manufacturing in Vietnam and India, even urging some suppliers to open new plants there, according to a former Apple executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements with Apple.\nIn July, Mr. Cook said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock into\u201d discussion that Apple was seeking to diversify its manufacturing from China. \u201cThe vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union.\u201d\nApple\u2019s position in China has emerged as one of the company\u2019s biggest risks. In addition to its dependence on China for manufacturing, the region including mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan is Apple\u2019s No. 3 sales market, accounting for about 17 percent of its overall revenue. A slowdown in Chinese sales has hurt the company\u2019s overall growth this year.\nApple is perhaps the most prominent American company in China, and is among the biggest American manufacturers there, putting it at the center of the trade war between the United States and China. Some Apple products have been subject to tariffs \u2014 costs that the company has absorbed so far \u2014 while others like the Apple Watch have been granted exemptions."

        "title": "Wondering Who Did That Painting? There\u2019s an App (or Two) for That",
        "fulltext": "At the BettyCuninghamgallery on the Lower East Side recently, I noticed an arresting painting: It showed a nude woman curled against a window, asleep, with the old New Yorker Hotel and Empire State Building in view and a fish above her, hanging or floating. I opened a smartphone app calledMagnus, snapped a quick picture, and clicked \u201cUse.\u201d Seconds later, I got that addictive, satisfying click. The app had found a match.\nThe painting was by Philip Pearlstein, according to the app,known for reinvigorating the tradition of realist figure painting. It was titled \u201cModel With Empire State Building.\u201d dated 1992, measured 72 inches by 60 inches, and was for sale for $300,000. In 2010, it had sold for $170,500 at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, the app told me. Magnus then slotted this information into a folder marked \u201cMy Art\u201d for digital safekeeping \u2014 and future looking.\nMagnus is part of a wave of smartphone apps trying to catalog the physical world as a way of providing instantaneous information about songs or clothes or plants or paintings. First came Shazam, an app that allows users to record a few seconds of a song and instantly identifies it. Shazam\u2019s wild success \u2014 it boasts more than a billion downloads and 20 million uses daily, and waspurchased by Apple for a reported $400 million last year\u2014 has spawned endless imitations. There isShazam for plants or Shazam for clothes and now, Shazam, for art.\nThe art-oriented apps harness image recognition technology, each with a particular twist. Magnus has built a database of more than 10 million images of art, mostly crowdsourced, and aims to help prospective art buyers navigate the notoriously information-lite arena of galleries and fairs.\nOther apps are geared toward museumgoers:Smartify, for example, takes an educational approach, teaming up with museums and sometimes galleries to upload digitized versions of their collections, wall texts, and information about artists. Google Lens \u2014 Google\u2019s advanced image recognition technology \u2014 is making new forays into the art world. In June, Google Lensannounced a partnershipwith the de Young Museum in San Francisco to show parts of the museum\u2019s collection. In July, Google begancollaborating with Wescover, a platform oriented toward design objects, public and local art, furniture, and craft \u2014enabling you to learn the name of that anonymous painting in your WeWork space or coffee shop.\nThere are some barriers particular to creating a Shazam for art. Magnus Resch, founder of theMagnus app, laid out one: \u201cThereis a lotmore art in the world than there are songs.\u201d Cataloging individual artworks based in unique locations is far more difficult.\nCopyright law also poses challenges. The reproduction of artwork can be a violation of the owner\u2019s copyright. Magnus contends that because the images are created and shared by users, the app is protected by theDigital Millennial Copyright Act. Galleries and competitors, Mr. Resch said, complained about the uploading of images and data to the app; in 2016, it was removed from the Apple Store for five months, but Apple ultimately reinstated Magnus after some disputed content was removed.\nAnother issue is that image recognition technology still often lags when it comes to identifying 3D objects; even a well-known sculpture can baffle apps with its angles, resulting in the deflating, endless spin of technology that\u2019s \u201cthinking\u201d ad infinitum.\nThen there is a more salient question for these platforms: What information can an app provide that will enhance the user\u2019s experience of looking at art? What can a Shazam for art really add?\nMr. Resch\u2019s answer is simple: transparency. Galleries rarely post prices and often don\u2019t provide basic wall text, so one often has to ask for the title or even the artist\u2019s name.\nJelena Cohen,abrand manager for Colgate-Palmolive, bought her first artwork, a photograph, at Frieze after using Magnus. Before trying the app, she said, the lack of information was a barrier. \u201cI used to go to these art fairs, and I felt embarrassed or shy, because nothing\u2019s listed,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cI loved that the app could scan a piece and give you the exact history of it, when it was last sold, and the price it was sold for. That helped me negotiate.\u201d\nMagnus doesn\u2019t give you an art history lesson, or even much of a basic summary about a work; like Shazam, it\u2019s a little blip of information in the dark. Smartify, on the other hand, wants to app-ify what was once the purview of an audio guide. Hold it up to a GustaveCaillebotte still life, as I did, and the app provides information that\u2019s already available on the wall, including the chance to click-to-learn-more. Part of the app\u2019s mission is ease of use and accessibility. People with visual impairments can use Smartify with their phones\u2019 native audio settings and the app is working to integrate audio. The app is elegant and straightforward, and the source is generally cited and fact-checked.\nSmartify\u2019s major limitation is that because the app teams up directly with museums, it only works well ina fewplaces. London\u2019s National Gallery, where I tested it, was one of them; it didn\u2019t miss a single painting in the permanent collection. But at the Met, where Smartify has uploaded a limited set of images, I spent a frustrating afternoon waving the app at paintings as it failed to return even facts that I could read in the wall texts.\nIt\u2019s telling, perhaps, that even as these apps build out their databases, some museums themselves are starting to shy away from apps altogether. The Metropolitan Museum, whichrolled out its own appwith fanfare in 2014, shuttered it last year.\n\u201cWhile the app was doing a lot of things well, we wanted to create something more seamless,\u201d said Sofie Andersen, the interim chief digital officer at the Met. This translates into content that loads directly in your phone browser as a website, no download required. Similarly, the Jewish Museum introduced anew set of audio tours in July, all on a web-based interface.\n\u201cA few years ago, there was an app craze, and now everyone\u2019s entering this post-app phase in the museum industry,\u201d saidJiaJia Fei, director of digital for the Jewish Museum. She noted that the vast majority of apps that people download sit unused on their phones. \u201cYou just end up using your email and Instagram.\u201d\nAfter a few weeks of trying out apps-for-art in museums and galleries, on street corners and in the occasional coffee shop, I found that they did not increase the quality of my visual encounters. Although the caliber of information in Smartify is quite high when it works \u2014 I was able to learn more about specific figures in J.M.W. Turner\u2019s\u201cUlysses Deriding Polyphemus\u201d\u2014 the simple act of raising my phone to take a picture transformed a vibrant physical painting into a flattened reproduction. The extra information wasn\u2019t worth mediating my museum experience through a screen.\nAnd phones are already everywhere in museums, transforming a visit into cataloging as we go. Ms. Fei referred to this as \u201cscreen suck,\u201d and it\u2019s one reason audio is the preferred medium for the Jewish Museum. Like Shazam itself, the apps are best used for quick answers \u2014 a lifeline in a contextless gallery. What is that? How much does it cost? Who made it? (Here, Magnus is the leader.)\nThe Shazamification of art is a product of a time in which information overpowersthe naked eye.But the app shouldn\u2019t be our sole guide through the visual world. Walking around the New Museum with the Magnus app, I found myself breezing past paintings, not looking too hard at details because the camera was looking for me, and the app knew much more than I did. There was that little addictive, satisfying click of recognition. It was hard to stop."

        "fulltext": "BRUSSELS \u2014 For five years,Margrethe Vestagerwas the scourge of Silicon Valley, levying billions of dollars in fines and initiating investigations against Google, Apple and Facebook for violating antitrust laws and harming consumers.\nAs the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, she and her army of lawyers became heroes to many critics of Big Tech, even as they were loathed in some corporate offices and in the White House.\n\u201cShe hates the United States,\u201d President Trump said, \u201cperhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Vestager assumed more power than ever, expanding her portfolio to become the equivalent of the European Union\u2019s digital czar.\nIt\u2019s a job that analysts say will give her unmatched regulatory reach at a time when public anger is rising over issues like privacy, disinformation, data management and the enormous reach of the largest technology companies \u2014 like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 into the everyday lives of billions of people.\n\u201cMargrethe Vestager will be the most powerful regulator of Big Tech on the planet,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a veteran antitrust lawyer based in Brussels. \u201cShe will have more leverage than anyone else in the world.\u201d\nMs. Vestager\u2019s enhanced status reflects the European Union\u2019s ambition to become the most activist tech regulator in the world, creating a far-reaching role for itself in the global economy. European officials see an opening to become the trusted global regulator, especially as their American counterparts have been criticized for doing too little.\nAs the digital giants branch out into new areas, including finance with Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra cryptocurrency, regulators are finding it harder to keep up with the complex, highly sophisticated and opaque nature of the companies they\u2019re meant to oversee, experts say.\nMs. Vestager\u2019s new role, which combines digital regulation and antitrust enforcement, could be better suited to the new era of digital domination, according to supporters of more aggressive regulation.\n\u201cEurope is clearly signaling that massive data harvesting must be considered a critical part of competition and regulatory analysis of market forces,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, the former chief counsel for policy in the antitrust division of the Justice Department during the Obama administration, referring to the huge amounts of personal information gathered by companies like Facebook. \u201cIt indicates Europe increasingly considers control of massive data likely plays a critical role in attaining dominance in digital markets.\u201d\nThe unique characteristics of the digital world, including the inability for both consumers and regulators to see the algorithms that determine what users see in search results and news feeds, and what advertisers pay to reach them, make righting any potential wrongs in the industry even harder, Mr. Kimmelman, who now works for consumer-rights nonprofit Public Knowledge, said.\nMs. Vestager\u2019s dual role as both a setter and enforcer of European Union rules could raise concerns about conflicts of interest and investing too much power in one office\u2019s hands.\nAs part of her antitrust portfolio, she will be responsible for assessing if companies are using their market share to unfairly block out smaller competitors. And from her new perch as digital regulator, she can advance new rules on company behavior, including how they collect, use and store users\u2019 data; and how they shield themselves against cyberattacks.\n\u201cConcentration of power is an issue,\u201d said Mr. Vinje, the antitrust lawyer. \u201cThere is an efficiency benefit in having those powers combined in one person, but on the other hand there is always a benefit in debate and division of power, so one can question if this results in too much power.\u201d\nIn her regulatory role, Ms. Vestager will be able to propose new legislation, but any law will need to be approved by European Union member states and the European Parliament, meaning her powers will be closely checked.\nMs. Vestager will also continue to oversee ongoing investigations, including whetherAmazon is unfairly using datafrom third-party sellers who use its platform to improve its own offerings. Her office has also faced pressure to investigate ifApple is unfairly using its app storeto harm competition, and to initiate further inquiry of Google.\nUnder Ms. Vestager\u2019s direction, European Union antitrust authorities have already fined Google more than $9 billion over the last few years.\nIn 2017, her office levieda record $2.7 billion fineon Google for unfairly favoring its own online shopping-comparison service over those of competitors. Last year, the E.U. ordered Google to pay anadditional $5.1 billionfor abusing its power in the mobile phone market to cement the dominance of its software on the Android platform. This year, antitrust authorities fined Googleanother $1.7 billion, this time for abusing its dominance in online advertising.\nHer office has alsoordered that Apple pay $14.5 billionin back taxes to Ireland and fined Facebook $122 million for combining the personal data ofFacebook and WhatsApp users, after the company had explicitly said that it would not do so.\nMs. Vestager might broaden the scope of antitrust law to include how digital giants use data to gain an advantage over rivals. Academics, lawyers and competitors have argued that existing competition policies must evolve to better account for the use of personal information by Google, Facebook and Amazon to keep smaller rivals from emerging.\nNot everyone thinks more regulation of the tech world is a good idea.\nMs. Vestager is at the vanguard of tougher tech industry regulation on both sides of the Atlantic, said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington that has received funding from tech companies.\n\u201cThe skepticism, even hostility, toward larger U.S. tech companies goes beyond her,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThe strong danger now is that we\u2019ll have overregulation, rather than under-regulation.\u201d\nApart from the Silicon Valley giants, Ms. Vestager will oversee the technically difficult and politically controversial rollout of 5G across the European Union, where the Chinese manufacturer Huawei remains a powerful player despite being banned from the United States. Her staff will also be at the forefront of scrutinizing cybersecurity efforts across the bloc and its half a billion citizens.\nWhether tech regulators in other parts of the world, notably the United States, will see the European approach as an example to follow remains uncertain.\n\u201cU.S. law and the courts are more conservative on antitrust,\u201d Mr. Kimmelman said. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had very little, almost no enforcement against the tech sector. Europe is in the leadership role.\u201d\nStill, American officials have recently started to follow Europe\u2019s lead in some cases. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nowprobing the tech giants. And over the past week, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general announced investigations of Google and Facebook. Members of Congress have been calling for more oversight of the fast-growing and influential industry.\nAs for charges that she is out to get the United States and its digital champions, Ms. Vestager rejected the claim early on in her career, when she began herfirst investigation into Googlein 2015.\n\u201cMy kids or myself never consider for a minute that this is a U.S. company or a European company,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThe reason we use it is that Google has very good products.\u201d"

        "title": "The Last Apple Keynote(Let\u2019s Hope)",
        "fulltext": "Roughly six minutes into Apple\u2019s annual keynote presentation on Tuesday, I watched with grim fascination as a video game executive guided a digital frog across a bathroom floor in order to carefully avoid scraps of rogue toilet paper, while a second executive provided breathless color commentary.\n\u201cWhoa, what is that?\" Executive Two whooped. \u201cIs that a giant baby wearing sunglasses?! He\u2019s making quite a mess!\u201d (Itwasa giant baby; hewasbeing quite messy).\nThe tightly choreographed scene was a demo of an iPad reboot of the classic \u201cFrogger\u201d game, which Apple was teasing as an example of its new arcade gaming platform. It was also a tidy example of just how peculiar and out of touch the company\u2019s product unveilings have become. And why Apple needs to put an end to its 90-plus minute advertisingspectacles.\nThe evolution of the Apple keynote is understandable. Apple is aglobalcompany that changed computing by putting little ones in all our pockets. Their new phones are big deals by virtue of the fact that they\u2019ve soldmore than 2.2 billion iOS devicessince their debut in 2007. iPhones changed how we communicate with one another and seek information; they\u2019veaddictedus, tethering us to our jobs and helping us feel both attached to and alienated from one another.So it makes sense that we pay attention when the company dreams up a new iteration.Plus, they\u2019re exceedingly shiny and the cameras can turn any point-and-click amateur taking photos of their goofy dog (me!) into Annie Leibovitz.\nBut what started as a Steve Jobs TED talk has become a parody \u2014 a decadent pageant of Palo Alto executives, clothed in their finest Dad Casual, reading ad copy as lead-ins for vaguely sexual jump-cut videos of brushed aluminum under nightclub lighting. The events are exhausting love letters to consumerism complete with rounds of applause from the laptop-lit faces of the tech blogging audience when executives mention that you (yes you!) can hold the future in your hands for just $24.95 per month or $599 with trade-in.\nThe entire event is at odds with our current moment \u2014 one in which inequality, economic precarity and populist frustration have infiltrated our politics and reshaped our relationships with once-adored tech companies. But it\u2019s not just the tech backlash. When the world feels increasingly volatile and fragile, it feels a little obscene to gather to worship a $1,000 phone. Serving journalists pastries topped with gold leaf doesn\u2019t do much to helpeither.\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private?Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletterto explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nApple, for its part, has chosen not to read the room, and so the discordant moments accumulate. While employees at Microsoft and Amazon organize walkouts over their companies\u2019 contributions to carbon emissions, Apple executives are adding applause lines touting that the iPad\u2019s case is made of 100 percent recycled aluminum \u2014 a fact thattech journalists rightly note\u201cmeans essentially nothing.\u201d And, asMotherboard\u2019s Jason Koebler reminds us, \u201cmaking a new iPhone is an incredibly destructive endeavor.\u201d\nThe Pleasantville cheery, sanitized tone of the keynote clashes with Apple\u2019s position as a global tech behemoth. Given the pressures of looming tariffs and trade wars, the event seemed, as the journalist Lauren Goodetweeted, \u201ceerily calm. Like parents throwing a super chill birthday party for the kids when the marriage has gone haywire.\u201d\nLikewise, there\u2019s some cognitive whiplash to this month\u2019s reports (and Apple\u2019sproblematic initial response) that a major iPhone vulnerability targeted the Uighurs, the persecuted Muslim ethnic minority group, and watching Apple executives onstagedays later gleefully trying to make to make slow-motion selfies \u2014 \u201cslofies,\u201d according to Apple branding \u2014 a thing.\nAs a luxury brand, Apple\u2019s been accused of being out of touch in keynotes before. My former colleague Katie Notopoulosskewered the company in 2016for appealing to the prototypical \u201c40-something dad who just wants to FaceTime his adorable children while he\u2019s on a business trip, and also find a local pourover coffee shop while he\u2019s in town.\u201d She dubbed this marketing amalgam, \u201cApple Man,\u201d noting that the needs of this test audience often came at the expense of making the product more affordable or adding features aimed at the millions of loyal customers who don\u2019t worship at the altar of inbox zero.\nTo its credit, Apple has taken steps to address a good deal of this criticism. Its keynotes now feature more women and people of color, and Apple has designed many more accessibility features (somelife-changing) for users with different needs.\nBut even more inclusive products can\u2019t fix the problem with recent Apple keynotes: The company\u2019s flagship product \u2014 the iPhone \u2014 no longer feels like a piece of the future dropped from into the hands of mere mortals. It feels like, well, a phone, a commodity. And so the whole thingseemsgratuitous, self-serving and, most importantly, quite removed from the very fraught relationship most of us have with our phones.\nThat\u2019s part of why the keynotes need to end. Losing them doesn\u2019t mean that the new technology isn\u2019t impressively engineered (machine learning cameras!) or that Apple has failed. It\u2019s probably the opposite. The iPhone set out to change everything, and it did. Mr. Jobsfamously pitchedApple products with the line, \u201cIt just works.\u201d He\u2019s right. It does. And we live with the effects \u2014 the good and the very bad \u2014 every day. There\u2019s no more need for the song and dance \u2014 or Lewis and Clarking a digital frog across a bathroom floor.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "It\u2019s a New Morning for Jennifer Aniston",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Jennifer Aniston was trying to have a quiet weekend away.\nIt wasjustafter her 50th birthday, and she\u2019d boarded a plane for Mexico with six of her best girlfriends\u2014most of whom have known hersince her early days in Los Angeles,before Brad, before Justin, before \u201cFriends\u201d and before the tabloids,when they lived as neighbors on the same street in Laurel Canyon.(\u201cWe called ourselves the Hill People,\u201d she said.) But a few minutes in, the pilot asked to speak with her. They had a tire missing, and they would have to return to Los Angeles.\nAs the pilot burned off fuel, Aniston spent the next four hours cracking jokes and trying to remain calm (she is terrified of flying), while fielding text messages from friends who\u2019d read about the \u201cemergency landing\u201d \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually happened yet.\nThe women landed safely, switched planes and, the next night, gathered for a ritual they\u2019ve been doing for three decades: a goddess circle. Seated on cushions, cross-leggedon the living room floor, they passed around a beechwood talking stick decorated with feathers and charms, much as they had done for every major event of their lives. They had circled before Aniston\u2019s weddings to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux. They circled when babies were born, and when Aniston and Theroux had to put down their dog, Dolly. This time they set the circle\u2019s intention: to celebrate how far they\u2019ve come \u2014 and to toast Aniston\u2019s next chapter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so weird. There\u2019s so much doom around that number,\u201d Aniston said of 50, noting that the New Yorker in her (she spent most of her childhood on the Upper West Side) was slightly horrified at the thought of the term \u201cgoddess circle\u201d appearing in a story about her.\u201cShould we just call it a \u2018circle\u2019?\u201d she asked.\nWe were sitting in the kitchen of her sunny, midcentury Bel-Air home, on a Tuesday afternoon in late August.She was warm and radiant,which is how glossy magazines often describe her,and also thoughtful, inquisitive and self-deprecating, which is not.\nShe asked about the meaning of my tattoo, which led to a conversation about my dog, which led her to ask Siri, \u201cHey Siri, what does a cockapoo look like?\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m like a weird dog person, it turns out, like a dog lady,\u201d she said, running her hand through her dog Clyde\u2019s fresh haircut.) She issurprisingly unguarded for someone for whom the tiniest kernel of news can transform into a thousand stories.\nBut about that age thing:\u201cI\u2019m entering into what I feel is one of the most creatively fulfilling periods of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously,\u201d she continued, pausing to knock on her wooden coffee table. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years and I feel like it\u2019s just about to really bloom.\u201d\nThis is the kind of thing actors say all the time in interviews. But in this case, it feels like more than a platitude.\nSince \u201cFriends\u201d ended, Aniston has had critical success in smaller independent films, mixed reviews for mainstream movies, a lot of product endorsements,a couple of outright flops.But nothing has clicked quite like Rachel Green, the beloved runaway bride she played on \u201cFriends.\u201d She\u2019s spent 15 years taking parts that had the potential to get her past that iconic role, that haircut, that \u201ccloak of Rachel,\u201d as she once put it \u2014 but they didn\u2019t deliver.Perhaps the only way to do that may be to return to the medium that made her famous.\nSo come Nov. 1, she\u2019ll have a homecoming of sortsas the star of Apple\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d \u2014 a big-budget drama set behind the scenes of a news show that looks a whole lot like \u201cToday.\u201d Aniston plays Alex Levy,a serious morning anchor whose personal life is complicated and professional life is more so, compounded by the sudden firing of her longtime co-host (played by Steve Carell) for sexual misconduct.\nFor Apple, the show representsthe shiniest baublein its launch slate as it attempts to challenge the likes of Netflix with a streaming service of its own\u2014 and among the first shows to hang its premise on #MeToo.\nFor Aniston, who is the spine of the show as both alead and an executive producer, it\u2019s the chance to dig into a more sophisticated dramaticrolethat, as she put it, has everything: \u201cchildren, guilt, power struggle, being a woman in the industry, going through a divorce, publicly going through a divorce, feeling alienated, being just a little bit of a screw-up.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a role that is asking her to draw on more of her personal life than ever before. Andit may also be her best chance to finally get the world to see heras an actor, not just a star.\n\u201cThe Morning Show\u201ddidn\u2019t begin as a #MeToo story.\nThree years ago, when Aniston told Michael Ellenberg,a former executive at HBO who oversaw \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201dthat \u201ctelevision is notnotan option for me,\u201dMatt Lauer was still delivering the morning newsand Harvey Weinstein was gunning for Oscars. \u201cI said to him, \u2018I just want to be a part of something great, I don\u2019t care where it lands,\u2019\u201d Aniston recalled. \u201cBecause God knows,the movies have been greatand they\u2019ve been horrible, so you just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWhen Ellenberg later phoned Aniston to tell her he\u2019d acquired rights to \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a nonfiction book bythe media reporterBrian Stelter that delves into the drama-filled world of morning television \u2014 and had also spoken to Reese Witherspoon, with whom he worked on \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d \u2014 the women immediately called each other.\n\u201cWe were so psyched,\u201d said Witherspoon, who has known Aniston since they played sisters on \u201cFriends.\u201d She noted that the two had wanted to work together for some time, but that it was rare to have \u201ctwo very, fully fleshed out female leads in one project.\u201d\nAniston signedonto play Alex, a morning host akin to Ann Curry, who must traversethecutthroat, ego-filled world of TV news as a woman in her 40s who executives declare is past her prime.She collides with Witherspoon\u2019s character, a brash, younger field reporter who may be gunning for her job or could become her best friend, we aren\u2019t yet sure.\nApple bought the show in a bidding war and ordered up two seasons. If the people who brought you theiPodwere going to compete with Netflix and Hulu, Aniston and Witherspoon \u2014 who also serve as executive producers \u2014 seemed like a pretty good bet. \u201cI just felt like this was exactly what we were looking for,\u201d said Eddy Cue, a senior vicepresidentat Apple overseeing the new service, who declined to name the price the company paid for the show but acknowledged that the draw of luring Aniston back to TV added to the appeal.\nBut then Weinstein happened. Charlie Rose was canceled. Matt Lauer was fired from \u201cToday.\u201d \u201cAnd we basically just started over,\u201d said Witherspoon. \u201cWe had to.\u201d\nKerry Ehrin, a creator of the A&E series \u201cBates Motel,\u201d wasbrought into write a new script, replacing the original showrunner. The updated premise:Alex\u2019s longtime co-host is fired after news of his behavior on the job (and in his dressing room) becomes public, throwing the show and her career into chaos.\nCarell would be cast to play the disgraced anchor \u2014 whom Aniston described as a kind of lovable, cocky narcissist who, like so many powerful men before him, \u201cjust thinks everybody wants to sleep with him.\u201d Witherspoon\u2019s character would be positioned as a potential replacement to fill his now openanchor chair.\u201cThe Morning Show\u201d would still tackle gender and ageism, but also tell a more complicated story of what happens when an idol falls.What does it mean for his unknowing co-workers and friends, like Alex? His ability to seek redemption? And, without knowing exactly of what he\u2019s accused, whose side should we be on?\nNow is the point in many of these interviews when the reporter asks the subject if she, too, has a #MeToo story.\nAniston says she does not, though she has certainly experienced her share of sexism in 30 years in the business.\n\u201cAgents,\u201d she began, ticking off a list. \u201cStudios. Finding out what this actor made versus that actor made.\u201d\nIt\u2019s our second meeting at her vast, modernist home, and this time we\u2019re joined byKristin Hahn, Aniston\u2019s best friend of three decades and producing partner of two, who is also an executive producer on \u201cThe Morning Show.\u201dThe duo reflected on what it was like when they began in Hahn\u2019sgaragein Ojai, Calif., 18 years ago (\u201cWe call them the garage band days,\u201dAnistonsaid) to try to make movies.\n\u201cIt was so much harder \u2026\u201d began Hahn.\n\u201c \u2026 to get our phone calls taken,\u201d finished Aniston.\n\u201cNow actors are taken more seriously as producers,\u201d Hahn continued. \u201cBut when we started, even though Jen had been on a TV series for eight years, it was still a little like, \u2018Oh, isn\u2019t that cute.\u2019\u201d\nIt wastherein that garage that Hahn and Aniston, with Pitt, co-founded the production company Plan B, which was then called Bloc Productions, a name that had come to Aniston during a game of Scrabble, she said.Theydeveloped \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife,\u201d \u201cA Mighty Heart\u201d and \u201cThe Departed,\u201d on which Hahn was an executive producer.\nWhen Aniston and Pitt\u2019s marriage ended, Aniston and Hahn decided they would be the ones to leave the company: \u201cIt was the symbolic equivalent of, \u2018I\u2019ll move out of the house,\u2019\u201d said Hahn.Plan B went on to developthe Oscar-winning films\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201dwhile Aniston and Hahn formed their own company, Echo Films, as a side project when Hahn wasn\u2019t writing \u2014 she wrote the screenplay for the Netflix movie \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d \u2014 and Aniston wasn\u2019t acting.\n\u201cOur mission statement was, Tell strong stories about strong women,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cFlawed, complicated, messy. \u2019Cause that wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d(Currently in development: \u201cFirst Ladies,\u201d a political comedy for Netflix in which Aniston will play the first lesbian president opposite Tig Notaro, and \u201cThe Goree Girls,\u201da projectabout one of the first all-female country bands.)\nAs a producer on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d colleagues described Aniston as \u201cdetail-oriented\u201d (Hahn), \u201cthorough\u201d (Ellenberg) and precise \u2014\u201cinvolved with every set, with every costume, with every piece of casting,\u201d said Witherspoon.\nWhen I mentioned to Aniston later that many had noted her attention to detail, she joked that was \u201cbasically nice ways of saying \u2018obsessive.\u2019\u201d\nTo research her role, she went behind the scenes at \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and spent time with Diane Sawyer, studying everything from her clothing choices to hercaffeinehabits, which involved toggling between Coca-Cola, Red Bull and coffee. On set, Aniston handpicked her character\u2019sbooks (\u201c100 Years of Bauhaus\u201d on her coffee table, Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s \u201cBlink\u201d in her work bag), the sconces in her apartment (French modern), and her clothes (tailored; monochromatic; an occasional pop of color).\nShe hung photos of her real-life friends \u2014 the \u201cHillPeople\u201d\u2014 in Alex\u2019s dressing room and apartment.\nThere were times Aniston and Ehrin, the showrunner, had healthy disagreements \u2014 such as whether Alex, upset with her daughter, would actually say a phrase to the effect of, \u201cI practically broke my vagina with that big head of yours,\u201d using an expletive before \u201cvagina,\u201d to describe childbirth.\n\u201cI was like, that would just never come out of my mouth! Alex\u2019s mouth,\u201d said Aniston, becoming animated.\n\u201cAnd Kerry kept saying, \u2018Trust me on this,\u2019\u201d said Hahn.\nAfter two weeks of back and forth, Aniston finally agreed to try the line \u2014 and they got it on the first take. \u201cIt just flew out of my mouth,\u201d she said.\nSo ultimately she thought Alex would say it? I asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, mind you, I\u2019m playing a person who\u2019s a mother. I\u2019ve never shoved anything through my vagina, you know what I mean? So it\u2019s sort of like understanding where it comes from, you know, like tapping into all of the mothers that I know, and understanding how something that hysterical and vulnerable and raw is possible.\u201d\nHahn leaned over to note that Aniston had, in fact, been there \u2014 in the room, at the foot of her bed \u2014 for the delivery of Hahn\u2019s daughter.\n\u201cI could have actually done it if the doctor had let me,\u201d Aniston said.\n\u201cI literally came back into consciousness hearing the doctor saying, \u2018Uh, Jen, you\u2019re in my light. I can\u2019t really see,\u2019\u201d Hahn said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d\nYou could say that the story of Alex Levy is also the story of Jennifer Aniston: one of being underestimated and overexposed, known for a thing that may or may not have anything in common with who you actually are, trying to reassert control over your narrative.\n\u201cJen has lived in the public eye for so long,\u201d said Ellenberg. To play the role of Alex, he says, \u201cshe\u2019s drawing on real stuff in her life.\u201d\nAlex, who is declared by her male boss to have passed her \u201csell-by date.\u201d Alex, whosesmoothsmile appears on billboards across the city but whose life at home is more complicated. Alex, who the world feels they know intimately, personally, but are nowhere near acquainted with.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a similarity to my life,\u201d Aniston acknowledged. \u201cI relate in ways of feeling like, when you don\u2019t want to be seen, and you don\u2019t want to go out of the house, and you want to just scream, and you don\u2019t want to walk on a red carpet. I don\u2019t want to stand behind a podium, I don\u2019t want to have my photograph taken, I want to just cry today. You know?\u201d\nI asked if she could have played this role at any other point in her life.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the experience.\u201d\nThere is a saying that\u2019s popular these days, translated into memes and posted on Instagram, that the freedom of aging as a woman is the ability to just care less (said with a punchy expletive).\nAniston sort of buys that, but she thinks the freedom may come more from working than age.\n\u201cIt\u2019s experience backing up ambition,\u201d said Hahn.\nAs they are talking \u2014and I\u2019m preparing to leave\u2014another member of the goddess circle, Andrea Bendewald, who is Aniston\u2019s oldest friend and also plays Alex\u2019s makeup artist on the show, walks into the house holding a book that the group is reading. It\u2019s called \u201cLifespan,\u201dwritten by a Harvard Medical School scientist, David Sinclair, who makes the case that the key to slowing down the aging process is to access the so-called \u201cvitality\u201d genes.\nThey are worried that mention of this book will make them appear like they\u2019re obsessed with not aging, but perhaps what it signifies more clearly is that they are interested inlongevity\u2014 the longevity to keep working, to keep taking risks, to redefine themselves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken time for me to get where I am and I put a lot of work into my craft,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cI\u2019ve failed. I\u2019ve succeeded. I\u2019ve overcome. I\u2019ve, you know, I\u2019ve stayed around. I\u2019m still here.\u201d\nThat, in Hollywood anyway, is perhaps the most radical thing a woman can do."

        "title": "Apple TV Plus Is Just $5. Will People Pay for It?",
        "fulltext": "Tim Cook went into full salesman mode at Apple\u2019s promotional event on Tuesday as he revealed the price for a monthly subscription for its streaming service, Apple TV Plus.\n\u201cAll \u2014all\u2014 of these incredible shows for the price of a single movie rental,\u201d Mr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d\nApple TV Plus is scheduled to make its debut as a competitor to Netflix and Amazon on Nov. 1. The cost is $5 a month. For anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad or Mac laptop, a one-year subscription will be thrown in free.\nIn the streaming industry, $5 is a figure that grabs attention.\nDisneyannounced $7as the monthly price for its original service, Disney Plus, which has a Nov. 12 start date. An Amazon Prime subscription, which includes streaming, is $10 a month, while Hulu goes for $6 a month with ads and $12 without. CBS All Access costs $6 with commercials and $10 without. WarnerMedia\u2019s new streaming service, HBO Max, is scheduled to go live next year atno lowerthan $15 a month, and Netflix\u2019s standard plan costs $13 a month.\nWhy is Apple the cheapest of the bunch?\nOne reason is that it will offer much less content than its competitors.\nWhile Netflix has a vast library of material from other studios and seems to unveil a series, special or rom-com every other day, Apple TV Plus will offer roughly a dozen shows in its first wave of programming over the next year.\nDisney Plus will be packed to the last pixel with a library of original movies, \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, blockbusters from Marvel Entertainment and Pixar, as well as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and the many other properties it picked up in its$71.3 billion purchaseof much of the 21st Century Fox entertainment empire.\nHBO Max will draw on its vast Warner Bros. film archive, which includes \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and the Harry Potter series, not to mention decades of HBO programming and\u201cFriends.\u201d\nApple TV Plus hopes to attract subscribers with a simple sales pitch: by claiming that its shows and movies will be of higher quality than what they\u2019ll find elsewhere. As Mr. Cook described it as he paced the stage, Apple TV Plus will have \u201cthe best movies, comedies, dramas and kids\u2019 shows.\u201d\nIn effect, Apple is hoping customers will part with $5 a month for the same reason they pay for premium cable channels like HBO or Showtime. But that pitch was easier to make in the days before streaming, when there was a stark difference between what viewers could find on basic cable channels and the broadcast networks. Now there are more shows \u2014 and a greater variety of shows \u2014 than ever before.\nTo prepare for the Nov. 1 debut, the company created anentertainment armfrom scratch, installing the Hollywood veterans Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg as top executives. The division hasspent well over $1 billionto develop more than a dozen shows, cutting checks to Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg,Reese Witherspoonand J. J. Abrams.\nOne of Apple TV Plus\u2019s marquee programs,\u201cThe Morning Show,\u201da drama set in the world of morning television, stars Ms. Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell. \u201cSee,\u201d a fantasy, features Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard. There is also \u201cDickinson,\u201d a quirky comedy with Hailee Steinfeld and Jane Krakowski in lead roles that puts a contemporary spin on the poet Emily Dickinson. Children\u2019s programming includes a \u201cPeanuts\u201d series.\nApple said it planned to roll out new shows each month, including a thriller from the director M. Night Shyamalan and a series starring Octavia Spencer. In the not too distant future, it will have a slate big enough to rival networks that have been in the business for decades.\nThe first hurdle will be the reaction of critics and social media users.\nThen comes awards season.\nApple\u2019s first shows will be eligible for the 2020 Golden Globe Awards; nominees will be announced Dec. 9. If Apple is able to storm the Golden Globes stage at the Beverly Hilton on Jan. 5, any remaining Hollywoodskepticswill have no choice but to consider the tech upstart a major player in entertainment."

        "title": "Lawmakers Urge Aggressive Action From Regulators on Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senators pressed top antitrust regulators on Tuesday to aggressively investigate the power of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, with some lawmakers questioning whether the officials had the will or resources to take on Silicon Valley\u2019s richest businesses.\nIn the regulators\u2019 first hearing since the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department divided up antitrust responsibilities for Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, lawmakers pushed for assurances that the agencies would provide vigorous oversight of the companies.\nBut the regulators \u2014 Joe Simons, the chairman of the trade commission, and Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department \u2014 offered few details about their inquiries into the industry. That frustrated some of the lawmakers at the hearing, held by the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re coming here without any specifics I think reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \u201cWhat the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech \u2014 and no immediate prospect of urgency or active enforcement.\u201d\n[Read more: 16 ways Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are in the government\u2019s cross hairs.]\nThe tech giants are embroiled in investigations around the world over concerns they have abused their market power. In the United States, federal agencies and House lawmakers are looking into the power and influence of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Many state attorneys general have announced investigations into Facebook and Google.\nThe scrutiny has helped upend the companies\u2019 usual place in Washington, where they have long been cheered on as pillars of innovation and a major engine of the country\u2019s economy. The companies\u2019 troubles have escalated in recent years from a range of scandals, including how they handle consumer data and their role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 presidential election.\nIn July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a fine of roughly $5 billion against Facebook for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, by far the largest fine against a technology company in the United States. But Senator Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, on Tuesday questioned Mr. Simons of the F.T.C. about whether the settlement was too weak.\nMr. Hawley homed in on the fact that the agency never talked to Facebook\u2019s top executives during the privacy investigation, using it to suggest that there could be a lack of determination at the agency.\n\u201cDid you interview Mark Zuckerberg during your investigation?\u201d Mr. Hawley asked Mr. Simons. \u201cDid you interview Sheryl Sandberg during the investigation?\u201d\nMr. Simons answered no to both questions.\nConcerns about the tech companies vary. Facebook is accused of shutting out nascent competitors. Google has drawn scrutiny for its smartphone software, ad and search businesses. Critics say Amazon uses its knowledge of independent merchants on its platform to make competing generic products. And software developers chafe at Apple\u2019s status as a gatekeeper for iPhone apps.\nAt the federal level, Mr. Simons and Mr. Delrahim have divided up responsibility for handling antitrust complaints about the companies. The Justice Department took Google and Apple, and the F.T.C. got Facebook and Amazon.\nThe regulators and companies have confirmed only two formal investigations. Googledisclosed in Augustthat it had received a formal request from the Justice Department for information related to a previous investigation of the company, signaling a new inquiry was underway. Facebook isthe subjectof an F.T.C. antitrust investigation related to its acquisition of other services.\nBut the accord between the agencies appears tenuous. Lawmakers pressed the regulators on Tuesday onreportsthat they were at odds over the investigations.\nWhen Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said it sounded like \u201cthings have broken down at least in part\u201d between the agencies, Mr. Simons replied: \u201cI would agree with that.\u201d Asked later to expand on his comments, Mr. Simons declined.\nMr. Delrahim also acknowledged that there was some overlap on the tech investigations. And he said that the state attorneys general investigations could complicate matters, too.\n\u201cI think at the early stage we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re not tripping over each other,\u201d said Mr. Delrahim, calling discussions with the states \u201cproductive.\u201d\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and a presidential candidate, said her concern was not of multiple agencies looking into one company \u2014 but that the companies do not get enough scrutiny.\n\u201cI just look at this is in such a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a split investigation than no investigation.\u201d\nMr. Lee expressed another concern: that the investigations would start to look like those in Europe. Regulators in Europe have been far more aggressive about bringing antitrust cases against the tech companies. But Mr. Lee warned that the motivations were not necessarily to protect consumers.\n\u201cThe primary concern\u201d in Europe, he said, \u201cseems to be protecting competitors rather than competition itself.\u201d"

        "title": "The Week in Tech: An Emerging Twist on Antitrust",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nGreetings from San Francisco. I\u2019m Kate Conger, your reporter for this week's newsletter.\nLawmakers and academicsagree:They have not done enough to curb major technology companies from rising to dominance.\nOn Capitol Hill this past week, lawmakers accused the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department of letting the companies off with wrist slaps andpressed them to be more aggressive. And at the University of Chicago, where academics have for decades set the tone for antitrust regulation,one professor has been wondering if they got it wrong,my colleague Daisuke Wakabayashi reported.\nRegulators and researchers were unprepared for the rocket-ship growth of Facebook and Google, and the companies have successfully argued that they\u2019re providing a benefit to consumers by offering services at little or no cost. Historically, that has been enough to keep them out of antitrust trouble; regulators usually look for signs that monopolies are exploiting their power to skim more money from consumers. The University of Chicago helped shape this ideology, while the F.T.C. enforced it.\nNow the consensus is clearly shifting. Experts are beginning to believe that tech companies aren\u2019t healthy for their users, even if they don\u2019t cost much money to use.\n\u201cOur antitrust laws cannot do anything against these types of monopolies,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, during aconvocation addressin June. \u201cThe world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too.\u201d\nAfter months ofpressure from a group of employees,Amazon increased its commitment to fighting climate change. A day before more than 1,500 of its employees planned to walk out of their offices in protest of Amazon\u2019s climate policies, the company said it would become carbon neutral by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris climate agreement schedule.\nTo meet its climate goals, Amazon will start migrating to electric trucks for deliveries. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, sad the progression of climate change had become \u201cdire.\u201d Still, he resisted several of the demands that his workers had made.\nEmployees wanted Amazon to reach zero emissions by 2030, sever its cloud computing contracts with oil and gas companies, and freeze donations to politicians who deny climate change is happening. But Mr. Bezos said he would not consider cutting ties with companies that used Amazon\u2019s cloud technology tofind and extract fossil fuels. However, he did say the company would take a \u201chard look\u201d at its political donations to determine whether any funds were routed to \u201cactive climate deniers.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that the Paris agreement, by itself, won\u2019t get us to a livable world,\u201d Amazon employees involved in the walkout said in a statement. \u201cAs long as Amazon uses its power to help oil and gas companies discover and extract more fossil fuel, donates to climate-denying politicians and think tanks, and enables the oppression of climate refugees, employees will keep raising our voices.\u201d\nIn a spot of good news, Apple introduced its new iPhones. The iPhone 11 comes in a variety of colors, adds a third camera for better nighttime shots and pet portraits, and provides the faster speeds and longer battery life we\u2019ve come to expect from every smartphone update.\nBut our personal-tech reporter, Brian X. Chen, cautioned against whipping out your credit card to preorder Apple\u2019s latest device. Sure, the phone is nice. But the older phones are nice, too.

        "title": "How Each Big Tech Company May Be Targeted by Regulators",
        "fulltext": "Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have been the envy of corporate America, admired for their size, influence and remarkable growth.\nNow that success is attracting a different kind of spotlight. In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.\nThe four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do theantitrustarguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.\nThe attorney general of New York, Letitia James, said Friday that the attorneys general in eight states \u2014 she and three other Democrats, plus four Republicans \u2014 and the District of Columbia hadbegun an antitrust investigation of Facebook.\nOn Monday, a separate bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is expected to announce an investigation of Google, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement.\nAnd in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.\nHere is the case against Big Tech \u2014 and what Big Tech has said in response.\nLawsuits and investigations could eventually lead to the breakup of some companies and to new laws that alter the balance of corporate power.\nOver the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.\nBut much of the recent scrutiny of Amazonin Europeand Washingtoncenters on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network, to sell their products.\nWhen Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.\nAmazon has expanded what\u2019s available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2015, more than half the sales on Amazon \u2014 51 percent \u2014 were made by these outside sellers. Last year, that grew to 58 percent.\nOne line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazonsells under its own brands, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon hasmore than 140 private labels, according to TJI Research.\nLawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon\u2019s products get preferential promotion on its site.\nAmazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data like overall sales, not information \u201crelated specifically to individual sellers,\u201d and that private-label products make up about 1 percent of total sales.\nItaly\u2019s antitrust authorityis lookinginto whether Amazon gives better visibility and search rankings to sellers that ship products through its vast fulfillment network, which sellers pay to use. Lawmakers in Washington have asked similar questions.\nAmazon counters that products sold via its logistics network do well in its algorithms because it provides a better and more reliable shipping experience for customers.\nAmazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue this past year. Much of that came from product ads that show up high as sponsored listings in search results.\nAt a House hearing in July, Representative Val B. Demings, a Democrat from Florida, asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it \u201cfrom using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.\u201d\nThe lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were \u201can optional service\u201d and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.\nApple\u2019s critics have homed in on its control of the App Store, the digital marketplace for apps on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. The App Store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over which companies can appear in the store and how.\nApple says it has the right to \u201ccurate\u201d the App Store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple\u2019s store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google\u2019s.\nBut while Apple is the App Store\u2019s sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.\nSome app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control of the App Store to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotifyhas filed such a complaint with European regulators, and makers of parental-control appshave complainedto regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States aboutApple\u2019s restriction of their appsafter the release of its own competing service.\nApplehas said that it faces fierce competitionand that itdoesn\u2019t favor its own productsin the App Store; and that it isn\u2019t a monopoly because it doesn\u2019t have a majority share in most markets.\nFor years, venture capitalists and tech strategists across Silicon Valley have admired Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s foresight.\nWhile many industry experts wondered during Facebook\u2019s early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Mr. Zuckerberg was always searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance for his company.\nHis efforts have worked \u2014 perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook\u2019s \u201cprogram of serial defensive acquisitions,\u201d a method of maintaining the company\u2019s dominance in social networking.\nRegulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts \u2014 two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.\nThat could include some of Facebook\u2019s largest acquisitions, like Instagram, the photo-sharing network that it bought for $1 billion in 2012. At the time, it was an enormous sum for a smartphone app. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.\nCompetitors believe that long before Facebook bought either of those companies, Mr. Zuckerberg kept a close eye on start-ups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.\nFor investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook\u2019spurchase of Onavo, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.\nOnavo\u2019s apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren\u2019t common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.\nFacebook walked awayfrom at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny from regulators in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nIt has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous Federal Trade Commission investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices. The social network reached asettlement with the agency in July,paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.\nFacebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further,as it testified before Congressin the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Start-ups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook \u2014 and its advertisers \u2014 value immensely.\nGoogle is dominant in several different markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.\nOne battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user\u2019s query. \u201cWe want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,\u201d Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.\nYears later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users\u2019 questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google,without a click to another site, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.\nGoogle\u2019s new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.\nHow Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90 percent of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.\nThe Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Unionfined Google $2.7 billionfor favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.\nGooglehas said that it faces ample competitionand that its search engine isdesigned to give users the most relevant results, not favor itself.\nWhile Google is predominantly known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.\nOver two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.\nCompetitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet\u2019s ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.\nBrian O\u2019Kelley, the former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google\u2019s competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owed services. And this year, the European Unionfined Google $1.7 billionfor imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.\nGoogle said in response to the fine that it had made several product changesto increase the visibility of competitors. \u201cWe\u2019ve always agreed on one thing \u4e00 that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone\u2019s interest,\u201d the company said.\nGoogle\u2019s Android software backs at least three of every four of the world\u2019s smartphones, according to analyst\u2019s estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free \u2014 almost. In return for handset makers\u2019 use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.\nThe strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than a billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.\nRegulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android\u2019s dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple\u2019s software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.\nThe European Union agreed,fining Google $5.1 billionlast year.\nGooglehas arguedthat Android has increased competition in the smartphone market by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple."

        "title": "A Challenge to Big Tech and Antitrust Thinking in a Surprising Place",
        "fulltext": "Convocation speeches are usually filled with inspiring life lessons or sage advice, but this year\u2019s graduating class at the University of Chicago heard something else: a battle cry against tech monopolies from one of the school\u2019s leading economists.\nWhat madethe rousing speechsurprising was not what he said, but where he said it.\nThe University of Chicago is the intellectual birthplace of the consensus in antitrust thinking over the last four decades \u2014 that monopoly law should place consumer interests, usually in the form of lower prices, above the concerns of smaller business rivals.\nThis hands-off ideology has helped Big Tech amass market power and gobble up potential competitors for years without facing significant antitrust scrutiny. It is so closely associated with the school that the thinking is widely known as \u201cthe Chicago School of antitrust.\u201d\nBut amid growing concerns about the unchecked power of today\u2019s tech giants, economists and legal scholars are questioning whether the Chicago School still makes sense. Even the university\u2019s own faculty is starting to publicly challenge the ideology.\nAt a convocation ceremony in June, Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the university\u2019s Booth School of Business, warned about the corrosive influence of monopolies and declared that the Chicago School had a blind spot when it came to Big Tech.\n\u201cOur antitrust laws cannot do anything against these types of monopolies,\u201d said Mr. Zingales, who is the head of the university\u2019s George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, in his address. \u201cThe world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too.\u201d\nA 56-year-old native of Padua, Italy, who has taught at the school since 1992, Mr. Zingales adheres to many of the traditional hallmarks of University of Chicago economics \u2014 free markets, small government and low taxes. But he is not an ideologue. After the financial crisis, he opposed breaking up the big banks but said later that he had been wrong.\nHis recent work laments that the American capitalist system has become corrupted by cronyism and companies that are too big, too powerful and too enmeshed with the overall economy.\nWhen the Federal Trade Commissiondecided to close a broad investigationinto Google without taking any action in 2013, Mr. Zingales said in a recent interview, it was clear that regulators were not sufficiently aggressive going after the new monopolies.\nAlthough never shy about speaking out \u2014 hepredicted in 2011that Donald J. Trump could win the presidency \u2014 Mr. Zingales became more vocal about the need for the Chicago School position to evolve. He said that today\u2019s tech giants were \u201cunprecedented in nature\u201d and that the rules of traditional economics did not apply to these companies.\nFor the last three years, Mr. Zingales and the Stigler Center have hostedan antitrust summit. The 2018 and 2019 conferences focused on how to deal with digital platforms like Google and Facebook. He gathered most of the leading antitrust scholars, a handful of top regulators, judges and attorneys general to come up with proposals on how monopoly policy should deal with the tech giants.\nDiscussions at those two conferences have been echoed in recent decisions by the Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general to investigate antitrust claims against Big Tech.\nAt last year\u2019s summit, Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, told attendees that his view of the cost of free platforms \u201chas changed\u201d with a greater understanding of the nature and scope of data collection and sharing.\nAn attorney general at this year\u2019s conference, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, was one of the main speakers when states announced an antitrust investigation into Google last week.\n\u201cThe fact that you have prominent people at Chicago calling for antitrust enforcement is changing the game,\u201d said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.\nMr. Zingales started a podcast with Kate Waldock, an assistant professor of finance at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, in 2018called \u201cCapitalisn\u2019t\u201dabout what works well in the current economy and what does not.\nTheir first episode called for more antitrust enforcement of Facebook and Google, centered on the idea of how dangerous it would be if Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, decided to run for president \u2014 whichdidn\u2019t seem so far-fetchedat the time.\nThe Chicago School started to gain prominence in the 1970s in response to concerns about overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. It argued that it was not enough for companies to possess significant market power; regulators and judges had to prove through economic analysis that consumers were harmed through higher prices.\nThe ideology has influenced a generation of judges and regulators, who have taken a restrained approach to antitrust enforcement in the United States based, in part, on the belief that market forces would correct imbalances better.\nThe Chicago School has greased the wheels for the megamergers that have reshaped many industries while providing the intellectual justification for why today\u2019s tech giants are not dangerous monopolies. It\u2019s hard to argue that Google\u2019s or Facebook\u2019s market power is hurting prices when their products do not cost money and Amazon \u2014 while not free \u2014 is celebrated for its convenience and prices.\nKevin Murphy, who teaches at the Booth School of Business with Mr. Zingales, said he still didn\u2019t see a serious alternative to the Chicago School for formulating antitrust policy. He also said there was little evidence that more regulation led to better outcomes for consumers.\n\u201cMost of what I see from companies like Amazon, Google and Apple is that they are successful because they do well in the competitive battle,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThe difference between him and I is that he sees a failure of competition, whereas I see the success of the companies.\u201d\nMr. Murphy said, however, that there was not a monolithic view among the university\u2019s faculty, especially since many of the professors hadn\u2019t been trained at the University of Chicago.\n\u201cThey would probably agree more with what Luigi is saying compared to what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Zingales said the tech industry\u2019s network-driven business models \u2014 based on the notion that a service or a product becomes more useful and valuable as more people rely on it \u2014 was a relatively new area of study for economics.\nPowerful monopolies like Google are a potential threat to democracy, Mr. Zingales added, because they hold so much sway over what we read. Google declined to comment.\nMr. Zingales also noted that the ideology failed to capture the risk of a monopoly\u2019s exerting influence to persuade regulators and politicians.\nIn his address, Mr. Zingales implored the graduates to push back against today\u2019s tech behemoths, just as the colonists had resisted the monopoly of Britain\u2019s East India Company during the Boston Tea Party. He urged the audience to vote for politicians willing to stand up to Silicon Valley.\n\u201cThis country was born fighting monopolies,\u201d said Mr. Zingales, who still speaks with a noticeable Italian accent. \u201cTo fight monopolies, your power as workers, consumers and investors is not sufficient. Your participation in the political process is critical. This is not a Republican or Democratic battle. It\u2019s an American battle.\u201d\nThen he addressed the elephant in the room.\n\u201cMy conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a method of intellectual inquiry without the blinders imposed by conventional wisdom.\u201d"
