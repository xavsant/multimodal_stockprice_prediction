        "title": "Beware. Other Nations Will Follow France With Their Own Digital Tax.",
        "fulltext": "Last Thursday, the French Senate passed adigital services tax, which would impose an entirely new tax on large multinationals that provide digital services to consumers or users in France.\nDigital services include everything from providing a platform for selling goods and services online to targeting advertising based on user data, and the tax applies to gross revenue from such services. French politicians and media outlets have referred to this as a \u201cGAFA tax,\u201d meaning that it is designed to apply primarily to companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 in other words, multinational tech companies based in the United States.\nThe digital services tax awaitsthe signatureof President Emmanuel Macron, who has expressed support for the measure, and it could go into effect within the next few weeks. But it has already caused significant controversy, with the United States trade representative opening an investigation into whether the tax discriminates against American companies, which in turn could lead totrade sanctionsagainst France.\nThe French tax is not just a unilateral move by one country in need of revenue. It is part of a much larger trend, with countries over the past few years proposing or putting in place a veritable alphabet soup of new international tax provisions. They have included Britain\u2019s DPT (diverted profits tax), Australia\u2019s MAAL (multinational anti-avoidance law), and India\u2019s SEP (significant economic presence)test, to name but a few. At the same time, the European Union, Spain, Britain and several other countries have all seriously contemplated digital services taxes like the one just passed by France.\nThese unilateral developments differ in their specifics, but they all seek to tax multinationals on revenue that countries believe they should have a right to tax, even if international tax rules do not grant them that right. In other words, they all reflect a view that the international tax system has failed to keep up with changes in the economy.\nThe general outlines of that system originated in the early 20th century, and all of these recent proposals and provisions suggest that it needs to be updated for a world in which companies can make significant amounts of income without ever being physically present in a country or selling any tangible goods.\nIn response to these many unilateral measures, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentis working with 131 countries to reach a consensus on an international solution by the end of 2020. Both France and the United States are involved in the organization\u2019s work, but France\u2019s digital services tax and the American response raise questions about what the future holds for the international tax system.\nOne possible path is for countries to follow France\u2019s lead and impose their own digital services taxes. The downsides of this are not only that the United States may take retaliatory measures but also that such taxes could subject companies to layers of new taxes, all with slightly different rates, definitions of digital services and determinations of taxing rights. This could lead to the same revenue being taxed multiple times or could make it harder for countries to get what they see as their due if others have already staked a claim to that revenue.\nAnother possible path would be for countries to see France\u2019s move as a portent of the disorder that could arise if they do not reach an agreement at the international level. This could push them to participate more fully in the O.E.C.D.\u2019s digital tax project. The proposals being considered by that group could lead to significant changes to the international tax system, with the potential for increased taxes, taxation in more countries and new rules for companies.\nBut the outcome would represent an international solution. The new rules imposed would be coordinated rather than layered over one another, which could offer companies more opportunities to limit double taxation or make use of dispute resolution mechanisms.\nFrance\u2019s planned tax is a clear warning: Unless a broad consensus can be reached on reforming the international tax system, other nations are likely to follow suit, and American companies will face a cascade of different taxes from dozens of nations that will prove onerous and costly.\nLilian V.

        "title": "Barr Revives Encryption Debate, Calling on Tech Firms to Allow for Law Enforcement",
        "fulltext": "Attorney General William P. Barr said on Tuesday that technology companies should stop using advanced encryption and other security measures that effectively turn devices into \u201claw-free zones\u201d that keep out law enforcement officials conducting criminal investigations.\n\u201cAs we use encryption to improve cybersecurity, we must ensure that we retain society\u2019s ability to gain lawful access to data and communications when needed to respond to criminal activity,\u201d Mr. Barr said in his keynote address at the International Conference on Cybersecurity at Fordham University Law School in Manhattan.\nThe Justice Department has long pushed technology companies to help the government gain access to information on electronic devices, a conflict that last peaked in 2016, when investigators obtained a court order that required Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone recovered after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2015.\nTensions eased after the F.B.I. found a way to get into the phone without Apple, but the case reinvigorated the debate over tech freedom, security and encryption.\nThat conversation gained momentum again at the end of last year, when the Australian Parliament passed a controversial encryption bill that requires technology companies to provide law enforcement and security agencies with access to encrypted communications.\nThe remarks were Mr. Barr\u2019s first significant speech on \u201cgoing dark,\u201d law enforcement\u2019s term for how encryption and other technology innovations have made it harder for investigators to carry out court-approved wiretaps and search for information on electronic devices.\nMr. Barr said that allowing \u201clawful access\u201d to consumer devices should not be incompatible with a company\u2019s business model.\n\u201cOur societal response to advances in technology that affect the balance between individual privacy and public safety always has been \u2014 and always should be \u2014 a two-way street,\u201d Mr. Barr said.\nWhile the attorney general did not mention Apple by name, the company\u2019s strong encryption has long been a selling point. And several technology companies including Amazon, Facebook and Google signed a letter this month criticizing the new Australian law.\nMr. Barr also said that companies that sell encryption with the goal of ensuring \u201cthat law enforcement will not be able to gain lawful access\u201d are \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\nMr. Barr\u2019s position echoed that of former Justice Department officials, including James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who took the lead on the law enforcement side of what has been a long-running tension with technology companies and champions of personal privacy.\nPrivacy advocates have long argued that law enforcement can get most of the information it seeks by subpoenaing technology companies for user records and other data, and that those companies do not need to create ways to break into their own encryption at the behest of the government.\nThe F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, and other officials have long argued that strong encryption was hindering crime solving, previously citing a total of 7,800 mobile devices that investigators were kept out of in the fiscal year that ended in September 2017, even though the bureau had the legal authority to gain access to them.\nBut last year, the F.B.I. acknowledged that it haderroneously inflatedthe number of smartphones and other mobile devices it has been unable to open because of encryption, blaming a programming error.\nPrivacy advocates immediately attacked Mr. Barr\u2019s speech.\n\u201cEncryption reliably protects consumers\u2019 sensitive data,\u201d said Brett Max Kaufman, a senior staff lawyer in the Center for Democracy at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThere is no way to give the F.B.I. access to encrypted communications without giving the same access to every government on the planet. Technology providers should continue to make their products as safe as possible and resist pressure from all governments to undermine the security of the tools they offer.\u201d\nMr. Barr is assuming that the negative impacts of encryption on law enforcement investigations \u201cfar outweigh encryption\u2019s benefits for protecting individuals, business and the nation,\u201d said Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.\n\u201cThat assumption has never been borne out by evidence in the form of actual, accurate numbers about encryption\u2019s effect on law enforcement\u2019s ability to solve crimes,\u201d Ms. Pfefferkorn said.\nBut Mr. Barr said that the current debate over encryption was no different from earlier debates over how to balance privacy when searching a person\u2019s home or car or other objects, which is governed by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s constraints on unreasonable search and seizure.\n\u201cThe Fourth Amendment strikes a balance between the individual citizen\u2019s interest in conducting certain affairs in private and the general public\u2019s interest in subjecting possible criminal activity to investigation,\u201d Mr. Barr said."

        "title": "Apple Pays $1 Billion for Part of Intel\u2019s Modem Business",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple said on Thursday that it would buy most ofIntel\u2019s smartphone-modem business for $1 billion, aiding its push to gain more control over faster wireless technology in iPhones.\nApple will add about 2,200 Intel employees, as well as patents and equipment. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter and is subject to regulatory approval.\nAnalysts say Apple will develop a 5G iPhone by late next year. Those iPhones are expected to use chips from Qualcomm, another chip maker that, until recently, was in a legal fight with Apple over royalties and other business practices.\nBut after that, the business being acquired from Intel will allow Apple to reduce its dependency on Qualcomm.\nAn iPhone capable of running on 5G networks, which offer speeds far faster than current wireless connections, could have big implications. A 5G iPhone could push the spread of such networks across the globe and encourage the adoption of new technologies that run on 5G, such as industrial robots, security cameras, drones and cars.\nThe transaction also gives Apple its first major portfolio of wireless patents, giving it leverage in future licensing negotiations with Qualcomm and other patent holders.\nIn April, Apple and Qualcommsettled a yearslong legal dispute. Although the companies are now on better terms, Apple has long sought to take more control over the critical parts inside of its devices.\nGene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and a partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures, said that given Apple\u2019s enormous cash pile, about $225 billion, the deal was a smart move for Apple.\n\u201cIt makes a ton of sense, given that they ultimately want to replace Qualcomm\u2019s chips and this is the fastest path to that,\u201d he said.\nQualcomm is Intel\u2019s main competitor in the business of smartphone modems, which are critical chips that help phones connect to wireless networks.\nFor Intel, the transaction ends a long-running saga of missteps in mobile phone technology that began in the late 1990s. The company tried and failed initially to become a major supplier of chips that provide computing functions in phones, as it does in personal computers.\nThen Intel shifted its focus to compete in so-called baseband modems, chips that manage cellular communications in phones. That effort began in earnest after it announced a deal in 2010 to purchase Infineon\u2019s wireless chip business for $1.4 billion.\nThat company had supplied baseband chips for the first iPhones but later lost that business to Qualcomm. Intel later won it back amid Apple\u2019s legal squabbles with Qualcomm over patent royalties.\nIntel never made money on baseband chips and showed little chance of doing so after Apple and Qualcomm settled their differences. Robert Swan, named Intel\u2019s chief executive in January, announced plans to exit the business the same day.\nApple is acquiring Intel operations that employ 4,000 people in Munich, Germany; Linz, Austria; and San Diego, Calif. Intel said it was trying to retain or find external jobs for as many of those employees as possible.\nIntel announced the transaction along with second-quarter financial results, which were better than analysts had predicted. The company\u2019s shares jumped 6 percent on the news in after-hours trading."

        "title": "Apple Reports Declining Profits and Stagnant Growth, Again",
        "fulltext": "Apple has long performed like clockwork, growing steadily and producing an ever-growing stream of profit. Not anymore.\nOn Tuesday, the Silicon Valley behemoth said that itsnet income had fallen 13 percentand that its revenue rose 1 percent in the latest quarter, with iPhone sales continuing to decline and gains in the company\u2019s services and wearables business failing to make up the difference.\nThe results showed persistent signs of weakness for one of the world\u2019s financial standouts. Apple built its enormous business on the iPhone, but sales of the device have slipped for three straight quarters in a saturated market for smartphones.\nYet the results also suggested that the company could be starting to halt declines in those sales and other key areas, including revenue from the Chinese market. Over the previous two quarters, Apple\u2019s profits and revenue had fallen over all.\n\u201cObviously on the iPhone, we\u2019ve gone through a period where we\u2019ve seen some revenue declines,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. \u201cBut we are very excited about our product road maps, and we\u2019re very optimistic about the future.\u201d\nApple said net income had dropped to $10.04 billion for its fiscal third quarter, from $11.5 billion a year earlier, with profit of $2.18 a share exceeding Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose to $53.8 billion from $53.3 billion a year earlier. Mr. Maestri said profits had fallen while sales had risen because of narrower margins that he attributed to foreign-exchange rates.\nApple shares rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading. \u201cThey essentially beat fairly low expectations,\u201d said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research.\nMr. Maestri said Apple had slowed the bleeding in its iPhone business by offering financing, cutting prices in some countries and starting a trade-in program for owners of older models after finding that people were keeping their iPhones longer. In the latest quarter, revenue from iPhone sales fell nearly 12 percent, to $25.97 billion, from a year earlier. In the company\u2019s previous quarter, iPhone sales fell 17 percent.\nFor the first time since 2013, iPhone sales did not account for at least half of Apple\u2019s revenue, said Yoram Wurmser, an analyst at the market-research firm eMarketer.\nConsumers are finding fewer reasons to upgrade their iPhones, analysts said, with newer models offering only incremental improvements. The trend could continue this year, when Apple is likely to unveil a new slate of iPhones. The latest models, expected in September, are unlikely to work with the new fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology that offers far faster download speeds than current service. Apple is expected to have 5G iPhones for 2020, analysts said.\nThe other shrinking part of Apple\u2019s business has been China. Sales in the region that includes China fell nearly 25 percent over the previous two quarters, sparking a sell-off of Apple shares in January. Apple blamed the drop in part on economic weakness in China.\nIn the latest quarter, Apple\u2019s sales in the region fell 4.1 percent, while revenue specifically in mainland China grew. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call that business had been lifted in part by Apple\u2019s move to cut iPhone prices there and an economic stimulus program from the government.\n\u201cThere were a lot of questions and uncertainty around China, so the fact that the year-over-year growth rate has improved is likely a relief for investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein.\n[Get theBits newsletterfor the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]\nThe Chinese market, Apple\u2019s third largest for sales, has emerged as one of the company\u2019s greatest vulnerabilities. This month, Chinese officialsdisclosed that the country\u2019s growthhad fallen to its slowest pace in three decades. Apple also assembles most of its products in China, which has drawn the ire of President Trump, who has publicly pressured Apple to build more products in the United States.\nSince 2013, Apple has made its top-of-the-line Mac Pro desktop computer in Texas. Doing soled to headachesthat delayed the computer\u2019s launch. In June, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Timesreported that Apple would shift assemblyof its new Mac Pro to China.\nLast week, Apple filed requests with the United States trade representative\u2019s office asking that components used in the Mac Pro, like power cables and circuit boards, be excluded from tariffs. Apple said in the requests that it could not find the products outside China.\nMr. Trumpresponded on Twitterthat Apple \u201cwill not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China\u201d and that the company should \u201cMake them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cook said Apple still wanted to make the Mac Pro in the United States and suggested that exclusions from the tariffs could help make that happen.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been making the Mac Pro in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to continue to do that.\u201d\nMr. Trump has placed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, but so far, Apple products have largely escaped the tariffs\u2019 effect. Mr. Cook hasencouraged officialsin the United States and China to resolve the trade dispute, but while the countriesresumed trade talksthis week, hopes for a transformative deal are dwindling.\nApple faces other issues in Washington, including antitrust concerns. Last week, the Department of Justice said it wasopening an antitrust reviewof the Big Tech companies. Apple has come under particular scrutiny for how it wields power in its App Store, where it distributes games, ride-hailing programs and more.\nAs Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fall, the company has sought to make up the gap in revenue with an expanding business selling apps and services to its existing customers. Apple now offers subscriptions for news, music and TV services and is preparing to start a gaming service soon. Its services revenue rose more than 12 percent to $11.5 billion.\nApple also showed strength in its wearables business, which includes Airpods and the Apple Watch. That business grew nearly 64 percent to $5.5 billion, surpassing the iPad in sales."

        "title": "Tech Hearings: Congress Unites to Take Aim at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers leveled stinging criticism and sharp questions at Big Tech executives on Tuesday, attacking Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google for their market power, their perceived bias as gatekeepers of communication and Facebook\u2019s ambitions to reshape the financial industry.\nThe criticisms came at three hearings on Capitol Hill that showcased Washington\u2019s widening range of concerns with Silicon Valley. Lawmakers from both parties, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas who oversees a subcommittee on the Constitution, and Representative David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island who leads a subcommittee on antitrust law, took aim at the businesses.\nThe executives acknowledged that technology had changed, and sometimes hurt, companies in industries like retailing, advertising, music and movies. But their companies, they said, have opened new opportunities to millions of entrepreneurs and small businesses. They insisted they faced competitors at every turn \u2014 entrenched big companies, ascendant start-ups and each other.\nAnd consumers, they said, are big winners, benefiting from convenience, lower prices and new products and services.\nBut their celebration of the virtues of Big Tech did not carry the day. Some lawmakers were sympathetic, but this was not their stage. Most were decidedly unconvinced, even disdainful.\n\u201cFacebook has said, \u2018Just trust us,\u2019\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said at a hearing focused on the social media company\u2019s cryptocurrency efforts. \u201cAnd every time Americans trust you, they seem to get burned.\u201d\nThe hearing performances were a telling moment, showing the rising force of the backlash against the tech giants. Not long ago revered as treasures of American capitalism, they are now targets of political attacks from both parties, growing public criticism and regulatory scrutiny. President Trump has also turned up the volume of his critique of tech companies in recent weeks.\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently decided to divide responsibility for potential antitrust investigations. The Justice Department is taking Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. has Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the F.T.C. voted to fine Facebook about $5 billion for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, by far the agency\u2019s largest fine against a tech company.\nThe House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan inquiry into the power and practices of major technology companies. The subcommittee announced the investigation last month and planned to request documents from the companies and hear testimony from confidential witnesses, who may fear retribution from the tech giants.\nIt has also started holding hearings, including one on Tuesday afternoon that was focused on how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google altered innovation and entrepreneurial activity. The practices under scrutiny included acquiring upstart competitors and favoring their own offerings on the digital marketplaces they operate.\nLawmakers appeared to be zeroing in on the areas that concern them the most. In one exchange, Mr. Cicilline addressed whether the tech companies\u2019 marketplaces \u2014 for goods, software apps and online ads \u2014 gave them an unfair advantage over rivals who rely on those marketplaces to distribute their own products or services. He pointed to Amazon\u2019s many lines of private label products, which compete for sales on the company\u2019s site with similar products from other brands.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that create a conflict of interest?\u201d Mr. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, Amazon\u2019s associate general counsel.\n\u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d replied Mr. Sutton, who said that many big brick-and-mortar retailers offer private label brands.\nAmazon\u2019s control of products on its site, Mr. Cicilline said, is different and stronger than that of a traditional retailer that offers some private-label merchandise.\nAt one point, Mr. Cicilline pointedly told Mr. Sutton, \u201cI may remind you, sir. You are under oath.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it the case, Mr. Cicilline pressed, that the best sale for Amazon is the sale of an Amazon-branded product, and that Amazon uses the vast amount of data it collects to favor its own offerings?\n\u201cNo, that is not true,\u201d Mr. Sutton replied.\nRepresentative Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, focused on Facebook.\nHe pointed out that not only is Facebook the world\u2019s largest social network, but that those ranked third, fourth and sixth \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram \u2014 are Facebook properties.\nOwning the four of the top six players in a market, Mr. Neguse said, spoke for itself. \u201cWe have a word for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is called monopoly.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, in the hearing about Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, Libra, lawmakers grilled David Marcus, a top executive.\nThe company has a bold goal with the project: to offer an alternative financial system that makes it possible to send money around the world with few fees. But the company has run into bipartisan resistance from Washington, including the White House.\nThe initiative is far from the first effort of its kind. The best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is in wide circulation, and it introduced the idea of digital currencies that are free from government control.\nBut the Libra effort has put a spotlight on cryptocurrencies and amplified the voices of critics who say the technology has little value beyond speculative investing and illegal transactions, like online drug sales. Last week, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said Libra raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d around \u201cmoney laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.\u201d Mr. Trump and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have also criticized Libra and other cryptocurrencies in the past week.\nThat concern was obvious on Tuesday when members of the committee questioned Mr. Marcus, who leads the company\u2019s cryptocurrency initiative, for more than two hours. Mr. Marcus was asked about a range of Facebook controversies, fromlax protection of the private information of its userstoRussian disinformation on Facebook\u2019s platformsto claims that it tries tomuzzle conservative viewpoints.\nSenator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust you guys.\u201d\nMr. Marcus, a former PayPal executive, was handpicked by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to lead the Libra effort.\nMr. Marcus, adopting a conciliatory tone, said the company would do its best to fight fraud and earn back the trust of the more than two billion people who use Facebook\u2019s services regularly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes in the past,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cWe have been working, and are working hard to get better.\u201d\nGoogle was at the center of the day\u2019s third hearing, about censorship in search, held by a Senate subcommittee.\nRepublican lawmakers used the hearing to air often-repeated but largely unproven claims that Google tilts search results to bias against conservative viewpoints. Democrats called the hearing a charade and raised concerns about Google\u2019s inability to effectively police the content on YouTube.\nThe Republicans took turns battering Karan Bhatia, Google\u2019s vice president for government affairs and public policy. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, delivered the most pointed attacks. He said it was hard to believe Google\u2019s executives when they say that censoring search results would go against the company\u2019s mission and ideology, considering that the search giant had been working on plans to re-enter China with a censored search engine.\n\u201cClearly, our trust and patience in your company and your monopoly has run out,\u201d said Mr. Hawley, who has been a vocal critic of Google.\nMr. Bhatia responded by saying that Google had abandoned plans to restart its search engine in China.\nMr. Cruz, the chairman of the subcommittee, said Congress needed to rethink the legal immunity for internet companies, established in 1996, that protects them from liability for content posted by users. The law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has allowed platforms like Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to grow rapidly without concern of being held liable for content on those services.\nEven before the hearing that focused on Google, the president applied his own brand of pressure with an early morningtweet. He said that his administration \u201cwill investigate\u201d remarks from the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who said that Google had been infiltrated by the Chinese intelligence. Mr. Thiel also accused the technology giant of treason for refusing to work with the Pentagon on a future artificial intelligence project while agreeing to work with the Chinese military. He provided no evidence for his allegations.\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company had not worked with the Chinese military and that it had cooperated with the American government in many areas such as cybersecurity, recruiting and health care.\nWhen asked whether Chinese intelligence had infiltrated the company\u2019s management, software or private data during the hearing, Mr. Bhatia said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "For the last two weeks, I\u2019ve added an extra step to my bedtime routine: strapping a computer around my wrist.\nThe new nightly move was prompted by a cascade of wearable gadgets from companies like Fitbit and Apple, which claim that their sensor-laden bracelets and watches can improve our lives by helping us detect health problems so that we can come up with solutions.\nFor many years, fitness gadgets have measured basic data, like footsteps or calories burned, to motivate us to stay active or shed pounds. Sleep tracking is still a nascent area that tech companies are experimenting with \u2014 one that I\u2019ve watched with interest as someone who has been sleep deprived for many years.\nIn the past, I\u2019ve tried several gadgets with sleep tech, includingFitbitwatches andBose\u2019s sleep-aid earbuds. But I hadn\u2019t consistently tracked my sleep habits and patterns before. Would it really make a difference, I wondered, to have this data? Would it help me to sleep better?\nI decided to test it out. I wore anApple Watch, since it is one of the most popular health-tracking devices. I also downloaded a top-rated app calledAutoSleep, which uses the Apple Watch\u2019s sensors to follow my movements and determine when I fell asleep and woke up. (The Apple Watch lacks a built-in sleep tracker.)Here\u2019s what AutoSleep gathered on my sleep habits.\nBut the excitement ended there. Ultimately, the technology did not help me sleep more. It didn\u2019t reveal anything that I didn\u2019t already know, which is that I average about five and a half hours of slumber a night. And the data did not help me answer what I should do about my particular sleep problems. In fact, I\u2019ve felt grumpier since I started these tests.\nThat mirrored the conclusions of a recent study from Rush University Medical College and Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. Researchers there noticed patients complaining about sleep data collected by apps and devices from Nike, Apple, Fitbit and others.\nIn their study, the researchers warned that sleep-tracking tech could provide inaccurate data and worsen insomnia by making people obsessed with achieving perfect slumber, a condition they calledorthosomnia. It was one of the latest pieces of research supporting the idea that health appsdon\u2019t necessarily make people healthier.\nFor some practical tips on how to get more shut-eye, I sought out Raphael Vallat, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. His most important advice: Do not check your sleep data on a regular basis.\n\u201cIf you look at your data, it can modify the perception of your sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may think: \u2018Oh, gosh, I didn\u2019t sleep well. Should I be tired? Am I in a bad mood?\u2019\u201d\nHere\u2019s what I learned after two weeks of sleep tracking.\nTo understand sleep-tracking data, I delved into how sleep works. There are three main stages: Light sleep, deep sleep andREMsleep (for rapid eye movement).\nThe deep sleep stage is beneficial for physical restoration, like muscle reparation and metabolism recovery, researchers said. REM sleep, the stage in which we dream, helps in repairing our psychological and emotional networks.\nOn average, a person completes a sleep cycle, which includes each of the three main stages, every 90 minutes. To get a good night\u2019s sleep, you need to complete four or five cycles. That\u2019s partly because the cycles are not the same throughout the night: The early cycles have more deep sleep, whereas the later ones have more REM sleep.\nBut our sleep-tracking tech? It generally can\u2019t accurately measure REM sleep.\nIn sleep-tracking labs, the gold-standard scientific equipment typically includes sensors that are connected to someone\u2019s face and neck to measure eye and brain activity, among other variables.\nBut sleep-tracking apps for wearable devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit primarily look at movement and heart rate to determine when you are asleep or awake \u2014 which are generally not precise enough to measure the different sleep stages, Dr. Vallat said. Without a good look at REM sleep, those apps may give an incomplete picture of sleep quality.\nHere is where the AutoSleep app gets credit: It estimates sleep duration and deep sleep using the motion and heart rate sensors, but it does not attempt to guess REM sleep. David Walsh, the computer scientist who developed AutoSleep, said he knew the movement and heart rate sensors would not accurately estimate the REM stage, so he didn\u2019t bother.\nAnother unknown for sleep trackers are the algorithms that are being used to measure people\u2019s sleep, Dr. Vallat said. In contrast, the algorithms used by university sleep labs have been publicly shared for decades.\nSome scientists said consumer-grade sleep trackers should not be dismissed as inaccurate. Michael Grandner, director of the University of Arizona\u2019s sleep research program, who has consulted for Fitbit, said that wrist-worn sleep trackers had a long history of use in scientific research and that some devices could be very accurate at measuring sleep stages. He added that the devices enabled some sleep tracking to be done in the real world, not a lab.\nO.K., but what happens once you collect your sleep data from a tracker or an app? There is no real answer.\nMy sleep-tracking statistics said I needed more sleep. (Duh.) Buried deep inside the data was some general information about sleep, but the app stopped short of offering advice on how to solve my personal sleep problems.\nDr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been wearing a ring on his finger called Oura Ring, which includes a sleep tracker, for nearly a year. The ring measures motion and heart rate to present granular data about the different sleep stages. He said that while the device most likely had a rough sense of when he was sleeping and awake, he didn\u2019t know whether the information about sleep stages was accurate \u2014 let alone what to do with it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no program \u2014 it\u2019s just information,\u201d Dr. Weiss said. \u201cThe question is can you do anything on your own to optimize it? Or is the information just worthless or is it making things worse? Sometimes being aware of it just makes you even more anxious.\u201d\nDr. Vallat shared similar concerns. One big problem, he said, is that many of these tracking apps send daily notifications with users\u2019 sleep statistics. He suggested that people experimenting with sleep trackers look at weekly trends, not daily summaries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle, because if you immediately feel you didn\u2019t sleep enough, it will impact your mood,\u201d he said.\nDr. Grandner of the University of Arizona said that consumer-grade sleep tracking was in its early stages and that it was too soon to tell what people should do with the data.\n\u201cFor a person to be worrying about their sleep stages is like being worried about the gas makeup of the air you\u2019re breathing in,\u201d he said.\nHow do you become a more successful sleeper? Grab a pillow, curl up and keep reading to find out.\nMakers of sleep tech and scientists can agree on one thing: Sleep-tracking apps and devices can be useful for getting a broad look at your sleep, but people should resist drawing conclusions about their sleep health.\nMr. Walsh, the developer of AutoSleep, said people should use his app to look at trends, not to obsess over the daily data.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of customers say this has changed their life, but I get other people saying they\u2019re waking up in the middle of the night and checking their sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them to go back to sleep.\u201d\nFitbit said in a statement that it took accuracy very seriously and that its team continuouslystudiedand tested the accuracy of its products. Apple did not immediately have a comment.\nDr. Vallat told me that if I really wanted toget better sleep, I should simply try to sleep and wake up at the same time every day \u2014 that would help my brain learn how to build a structure for optimal sleep. He also advised making the bedroom a cool environment (about 68 degrees) and as dark as possible; avoiding alcohol in the evening; not checking email or social media right before bed; and asking myself each morning when I woke up, \u201cDo I feel refreshed?\u201d\nThat all sounded reasonable \u2014 and there\u2019s no app needed for any of that."

        "fulltext": "A new batch of apps and pocket-size medical devices that work with a smartphone or smartwatch are changing travel for people with serious medical conditions.\nThe devices allow people with heart conditions, diabetes and epilepsy to discreetly check up on themselves in airport terminals, in train or bus stations, in hotels or even as they travel, sending out information and alerts to doctors and caregivers. In effect, they are helping to create a virtual support and safety net.\nA device is helping cardiac patients like Nicholas LiVolsi, 40, a graphic designer who noticed several years ago that his heart kept beating irregularly after flights.\nHis cardiac electrophysiologist, Dr. Daniel Frisch of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, recommended an additional monitoring measure beyond the standardelectrocardiogram(or EKG or ECG), which requires lying on an exam table and having electrodes stuck to his chest, arms and legs to obtain a dozen views of the heart. The device,KardiaMobile, developed by AliveCor using artificial intelligence and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is a personal EKG monitor that looks like a pack of gum and has two sensors.\nPatients place the $99 device close to their smartphone, rest their forearms on a flat surface and put two fingers of each hand on separate electrodes. It records a medical-grade EKG in 30 seconds, telling users whether they are in normal rhythm or atrial fibrillation, and stores the results as a PDF on the smartphone. It also allows users to add a note for their doctor. The results can be uploaded to the doctor by subscribing to a plan.\n\u201cYou could use it anywhere,\u201d Mr. LiVolsi said. \u201cI always carry it with me when I\u2019m away just in case I need it. It\u2019s easy to use and puts all of my EKG readings on the cloud so Dr. Frisch can review them when needed.\u201d\nThe device, he said, \u201cgives me peace of mind.\u201d\nDr. Frisch, who carries Kardia in his pocket for demonstrations, said it\u2019s \u201cvery useful for me to see what a person\u2019s heart rhythm is at the time of symptoms, or for people that have vague symptoms, to figure out what their heart is doing around those same time points.\u201d\nHe said he also encouraged patients to contact him with questions or concerns after they read their own results. \u201cFeedback is part of the deal with wearables, and it\u2019s a new paradigm that we have to embrace,\u201d he said.\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 also has F.D.A. clearance for both its irregular heart rhythmalertand itsECG, which operates with an electrical heart sensor. Users take an ECG by placing a finger on thedigital crownfor 30 seconds. Electrodes in the crown and in the back crystal work in concert. Afterward, a user can add symptoms and generate a PDF. But there\u2019s no option to automatically send the result to a doctor.\nDr. Frisch said the quality of recordings from the Kardia and the latest Apple Watch were very similar and provide a single view of the heart that is \u201can approximation\u201d of the standard EKG. But Kardia is coming out with a new device, the KardiaMobile6L, which Dr. Frisch said would allow doctors to view the same heart rhythm from six different angles. Users rest the 6L on the bare skin of either their left knee or their ankle and hold it in place with two fingers for 30 seconds.\nDiabetics, too, have new devices that can help them monitor their blood sugar.\n\u201cThe most painful part of diabetes is the finger stick,\u201d said Kathleen Weaver, 59, of Dallas, a dog owner and handler who trains beagles and travels frequently for competitions. She said she used to have to test her blood up to 10 times a day. Now she wears aDexcom G6continuous glucose monitor, which doesn\u2019t require drawing blood.\nIts sensor remains attached to the skin on her abdomen for up to 10 days, and she also uses an insulin pump. The Dexcom transmits glucose readings every five minutes, and connects wirelessly to a reader device or via an app to her smartphone and smartwatch and sends her alarms when her blood sugar goes high or low.\nShe said the biggest advantage of the Dexcom was not having to \u201clet blood every time you need to go check the numbers, and then it does check the numbers a lot more often.\u201d\nSince her medical devices are hidden beneath her clothing, Ms. Weaver said, she can be discreet when she wants to know her number. \u201cI can say, \u2018Hey, Siri, what\u2019s my blood sugar?\u2019\u201d\nHer endocrinologist can see the data stored in the cloud to determine how much insulin she should have throughout the day. Her insulin pump has to be programmed manually. When traveling, Ms. Weaver said, she uses an app to message her doctor.\nDr. Bithika Thompson, the director of the diabetes program at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, said the F.D.A.-approved wearable monitors \u2014 including the continuous glucose monitors and flash monitors like Abbott\u2019sFreestyle Libre, a 14-day sensor worn on the upper arm that can be read by a reader or smartphone \u2014 had \u201crevolutionized diabetes care.\u201d They make it easier for patients, especially those who are insulin dependent, to measure what\u2019s happening with their blood sugar \u2014 where it is at the moment and where it\u2019s going.\n\u201cIt allows for better blood-sugar control because you just have so much more information for which to make the decisions,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\nWearable devices like the Apple Watch contain motion sensors (including an accelerometer and gyroscope) and have GPS capabilities that can provide a person\u2019s coordinates to emergency responders. Apps developed by medicalresearchersto help travelers manage medical conditions gather this data along with heart rate measurements.\nMary Kate O\u2019Donnell, 29, who has lived with epilepsy for more than a decade, said she worried that the stress of flying would cause a seizure on a plane.\n\u201cNo matter how frequently I fly, I have this intense fear of trusting two complete strangers with my safety and simply hoping for the best, which can then cause a seizure during the flight,\u201d she said.\nMs. O\u2019Donnell, who lives in Manchester, Conn., has been usingEpiWatch, an Apple Watch app developed by Johns Hopkins Medicine as part of a continuing study to help patients detect and track their seizures, missed medications and other triggers. When a seizure is imminent, patients participate in responsiveness tests and then complete brief surveys afterward. Seizures are logged as they occur so doctors can review them later. And participants can set the app to automatically contact a designated caregiver when they initially report a seizure or if they fail to respond to an alert from the seizure detector.\nThe goal of the app is to help patients gain more control of their seizures and their lives, said Dr. Nathan Crone, a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who created the app with a colleague, Dr. Gregory Krauss. Dr. Crone said he hoped the project would \u201callow people with epilepsy to privately and discreetly share more detailed information about their condition with their doctors so that treatment decisions can be made more quickly.\u201d\nMs. O\u2019Donnell said that when she felt the onset of an aura, which can be an unusual feeling or movement that might be a harbinger of a seizure, she checked her heart rate on the Apple Watch. The higher her rate, the closer she is to having a seizure.\n\u201cWhen I feel my wrist buzz, I know I need to find somewhere to lay down and someone I can tell that will understand,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIf not, the app will text my emergency contact for me. That is my solace.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "BAC NINH,Vietnam \u2014 No country on earth has benefited from President Trump\u2019s trade fight with China more than Vietnam.\nThe country\u2019s factories have swelled with orders as American tariffs cause companies toreconsider making their products inChina.Now, more big technology firms are looking to bulk up their manufacturing operations in Vietnam, lifting the ambitions of a nation already well on its way to becoming a powerhouse maker of smartphones and other high-end gadgets.\nFirst, though, Vietnam needs to get better at making the little plastic casings on your earbuds.\nVu Huu Thang\u2019s company in the northern city of BacNinh, Bac Viet Technology, produces small plastic parts for Canon printers, Korg musical instruments, and Samsung cellphones and phone accessories, including earbuds. He said it would be hard for his firm to compete against Chinese suppliers as long as he had to buy 70 to 100 tons of imported plastic material every month, most of it made in China.\n\u201cVietnam cannot compare with China,\u201d Mr. Thang said. \u201cWhen we buy materials, it\u2019s 5, 10 percent more expensive than China already.\u201d And the Vietnamese market is too small, he said, to entice plastic producers to set up plants here.\nNegotiators for the United States and China are meeting in Shanghai this week to try to find a way forward in resolving their bruising trade war. Butfor some companies, spooked by what now appears to bea definitive darkeningin America\u2019s relations with China, the appeal of working in the world\u2019s second-largest economy may already be tarnished for good. With smartphones, video game consoles and other consumer favoritespotentially next on Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff list, gadget makers in particular are feeling pressure to find new low-wage places to make or finish their products.\nApple has homed inon Vietnam and India as it intensifies its search for ways to diversify its supply chain.Nintendo has accelerated a shiftin the production of its Switch console to Vietnam from China, according to Panjiva, a supply chain research firm. The Taiwanese electronics behemoth Foxconn, a major assembler of iPhones, said in January that it hadacquired land-use rights in Vietnamand had pumped $200 million into an Indian subsidiary. Other Taiwanese and Chinese partners to Applehave indicatedthatthey are consideringramping upoperations in Vietnam as well.\nEven so, this nation of nearly 100 million people is not about to replace China as a manufacturinghubovernight. Land here can be expensive, and ready-to-use factories and warehouses are in short supply. Recruiting enough trained workers and managers is another potentialchallenge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely stretching Vietnam\u2019s capabilities,\u201d said Frederick R. Burke, a managing director in Ho Chi Minh City for the law firm Baker McKenzie. Even though the country\u2019s labor force is expanding by a million people a year, he added, \u201cpeople are talking about labor shortages already.\u201d\nVietnam also does not have vast galaxies of companies churning out specialized components, parts and materials like those that manufacturers can calluponin China.\nTran Thu Thuy said that \u201cof course\u201d she would love to work with Apple someday. Ms. Thuy\u2019s firm, HTMP, makes metal molds that factories use to produce plastic and die-cast parts. She gestured toward a nearby MacBook. One day, she said, HTMP might be able to make the molds for metal laptop bodies. But she knows the company has to improve in many ways before that day can come.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long list,\u201d she said.\nVietnam is already a colossus in producing shoes, clothes and other types of labor-intensive goods, having long ago begun siphoning business away from its giant northern neighbor.\nNikeandAdidasnow make close to half of their sneakers in Vietnam. As factories have sprung up, the Vietnamese government has pledged to improve roads, ports and power plants. Hanoi has also signed deals with governments around the world to reduce tariffs, including an agreement reachedlast monthwith the European Union.\nThe Trump administration has not failed to notice that its import levies have been shifting global commerce in Vietnam\u2019s direction. The Treasury hasput Hanoi on a watch listfor manipulating the value of the Vietnamese currency, the dong, to help exporters. Mr. Trumpsuggestedlast monththat Vietnam might be the next target for punitive tariffs, calling the country\u201calmost the single worst abuser of everybody.\u201d\nIn response,the Vietnamese government saidit wanted mutually beneficial trade ties with the United States, and it highlighted its efforts to punish exporters who illegally relabeled their goods as \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d to dodge American taxes.\nYet even Mr. Trump\u2019s feuding seems unlikely to reverse the broader shifts that are turning north Vietnam into a major hub for electronics. Many of the hulking factory complexes that stretch across the horizon in long, palm-fringed rows are here in no small part thanks to one company.\nMore than a decade ago, Samsung Electronics, the South Korean titan, set up a plant in Bac Ninh to reduce its dependence on China. The move was prescient. Costs in China continued to increase, andSamsung\u2019s sales there withered after Beijing called forboycotts on South Korean productsover Seoul\u2019s embrace of anAmerican missile defense systemin 2017.\nSamsung has since closed all but one of its smartphone plants in China. It now assembles around half of the handsets it sells worldwide in Vietnam. Samsung\u2019s subsidiaries in the country, which employ around 100,000 people, accounted for nearly a third of the company\u2019s $220 billion in sales last year.\nASamsungspokeswoman said about 90 percent of those sales involved goods shipped from Vietnam to other countries. That implies Samsung alone accounted for a quarter of Vietnam\u2019s exports in 2018, although even that might not fully capture the company\u2019s effect on the wider economy. Samsung\u2019s success in Vietnam helped convince many of its South Korean suppliers that they needed to be here, too.\n\u201cWhen you are a big company and you move to a place, everything follows you,\u201d said Filippo Bortoletti, the deputy manager in Hanoi at the business advisory firm Dezan Shira.\nSome Vietnamese business owners say the blessings are mixed, though. Foreign giants, they say, come to Vietnam and work largely with vendors they already use elsewhere, leaving little room in their supply chains for local upstarts.\nSamsung has 35 Vietnamese suppliers, the spokeswoman said. Apple declined to comment.\nWhen Samsung first set up in the country, it bought some of the metal fixtures used on its assembly lines from a local firm, Vietnam Precision Mechanical Service & Trading, or VPMS. But then more of Samsung\u2019s South Korean partners started coming into the country, and after a year, Samsung and VPMS stopped working together, said Nguyen Xuan Hoang, one of the Vietnamese company\u2019s founders.\nPrice and quality were not the issue, Mr. Hoang said, over the hissing and clanging of machinery at his factory near Bac Ninh. The problem was scale: Samsung needed many more fixtures than VPMS could deliver.\nVu Tien Cuong\u2019s company, Fitek, produces industrial equipment for Samsung, Canon and other big firms around Bac Ninh. He acknowledged that most Vietnamese suppliers had quality and productivity issues that kept them from winning business from multinational companies. But he thinks that the root problem is inexperience, not a lack of money or knowledge.\n\u201cDay by day,\u201d Mr. Cuong said, Vietnam\u2019s supplier base is improving and \u201cgrowingup.\u201d\nNguyen Thi Hue, 28, knows a thing or two about growing up on the job. For a long time after starting her own company in 2015, Ms. Hue worked 16-hour days juggling a day job for another firm while getting her new venture off the ground.\nHer start-up, Anofa, specializes in surface treatments for metal parts. It has worked with suppliers for foreign brands like the South Korean electronics maker LG and the Italian motorcycle maker Ducati.\n\u201cWe really look forward\u201d to Apple\u2019s expanding its supply chain in Vietnam, said Nguyen Van Huan, Ms. Hue\u2019s husband, who is also herlawyer.\nAnofa has invested in new machines to try to win more business from foreign clients. \u201cThey have higher standards and requirements,\u201d Mr. Huan said.\n\u201cWe can meet them,\u201d Ms. Hue said,beaming.\nChau Doan contributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "Video gaming has gone from an activity conducted in arcades, dens and rec rooms to a mobile phenomenon where players meet, live and play in virtual space.\nBut it\u2019s hard for investors to know where the best opportunities are. Investors have done very well recently by buying shares in exchange-traded funds that track the industry, or major components of it.\nBig technology companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon are preparing to offerstreaming videogames, hoping to capitalize on a trend that lifted Netflix to dominance in the entertainment delivery business.\nThen there are the equipment makers, like Microsoft with itsXbox consoleand Sony with itsPlayStation. Both are rolling out upgrades.\nGame publishers like Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive and Ubisoft may be poised to capitalize on the burst of streaming capabilities making their debuts over the next year, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush.\nThe overall industry is expected to reach$180 billion in annual salesin the next year or so, according to the research firm Newzoo, compared with $137 billion in 2018. But there are plenty of reasons for caution.\nDevelopment costs are rising for games that quickly become obsolete, thanks to fast-changing technology. New cloud-based and streaming services threaten to cut into the sales of game equipment, as are games played on mobile devices like phones and tablets.\n\u201cIt remains to be seen which dominant distribution model will emerge and how the economics for publishers and platform operators will ultimately play out,\u201d Mr. Pachter wrote in a recent note.\nFor fund investors, there aren\u2019t a lot of specific offerings, and the few that are around are relatively new. They track a variety of indexes.\nThe biggest video-gaming-specific fund, theETFMG Video Game Tech ETF, which started in 2016, has only $92 million in assets. Expenses are 0.75 percent, and it gained 10.8 percent this year through June, according to Morningstar. It tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech index, and its top 10 holdings include Nintendo, Ubisoft and Glu Mobile.\nThe VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF has $26 million in assets and an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. It was up 17.6 percent through June, according to Morningstar, with top holdings including the chip makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as Tencent, the Chinese company that owns 40 percent of the privately held developer of the video game Fortnite. It tracks the MVIS Global Video Gaming and eSports index.\nAnd there has been a new offering since June 24,Defiance NextGen Video Gaming ETF, formerly a tech fund, with more than $3 million in assets. It holds the device maker Nintendo as well as the game makers Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. It follows theBlueStar Next Gen Video Gaming index.\nBigger funds that have exposure to some big companies in the gaming world include two offerings by iShares. TheiShares PHLX Semiconductor ETFhas $1.5 billion in assets, an increase of 27 percent this year, and its expense ratio is 0.47 percent. It tracks the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector index. And the iSharesExpanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, with $2.66 billion in assets, has stakes in Microsoft and several game makers and was up 25.9 percent through June, according to Morningstar. It tracks S&P\u2019s North American Expanded Technology Software index.\nMr. Pachter says game publishers will most likely benefit as streaming devices and capabilities spread. Microsoft\u2019s xCloud andGoogle\u2019s Stadiawill roll out in the fall, and Xbox One players should be able to stream games in October.\nUnder the hood are the chip-makers Nvidia and AMD, which power the equipment. The two have been locked in a fierce battle for dominance, and Microsoft picked AMD\u2019s processor to power its next generation Xbox.\nAmazon and Apple are likely to offer streaming services of their own, Mr. Pachter said: \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s analogous to Walmart opening another 10,000 stores across the world. More distribution is good for content owners, period.\u201d\nThat bodes well for Epic Games, the company behindFortnite: Battle Royale. While the company is privately held, Tencent Holdings, a Chinese company, has a 40 percent stake and is a worldwide distributor.\nElectronic Arts will roll out its game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, in November, and Activision Blizzard will release Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in October after a rough start to the year that included layoffs and a falling stock price. And Take-Two Interactive, maker of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, has a number of games in development, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, an investment bank.\nUbisoft, maker of the Tom Clancy\u2019s titles, Prince of Persia and other games, recently announced a subscription service called Uplay Plus, giving access to 100 games for $14.99 a month on PC download or through Google\u2019s Stadia.\nThe rise of streaming games may hurt retailers likeGameStop, which has been struggling as sales of physical game cartridges decline. GameStop\u2019s comparable-store sales fell 10 percent in the first quarter. Sales of used games dropped 20 percent, and new equipment sales fell 35 percent.\nCollectibles were a positive note for GameStop. A company calledFunkomakes pop culture toys representing Fortnite characters. They may get a boost in sales at the annualComic-Con conventionin San Diego, which is scheduled for July 18 -21."
