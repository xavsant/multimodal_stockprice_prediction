        "fulltext": "Apple added its Siri assistant to theiPhone 4S model in 2011, giving users a hand-free way to schedule appointments, play music, look up information and perform other basic tasks. Less than a decade later, digital assistants are in a plethora of digital devices, including computers, smart speakers, dashboards and watches, and they can help you ease into the day and keep the household running smoothly.\nWhile the assistants can make life more efficient, it can take time to learn all their abilities. If you received a smart speaker as a gift and don\u2019t know where to start, or you\u2019ve just dabbled with the assistant app on your phone and want to make it useful, here\u2019s a quick introduction to life with a digital companion. Also, we have some pointers for protecting your privacy.\nYour first assistant is likely to be the one that came with your phone, tablet or computer, like Apple\u2019sSiri,Google Assistant, Microsoft\u2019sCortanaor Samsung\u2019sBixby. If your assistant isn\u2019t already on, you\u2019ll need to enable it in the device settings and do a few exercises so the software learns your voice.\nAmazon\u2019sAlexaprogramcan be found on certain phone modelsfrom LG, Motorola and Sony \u2014 in addition toa wide varietyof Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speakers,Windows 10 PCs, wearable gear likeearbudsand, soon,smart eyeglasses. You\u2019ll need the AlexaAndroidandiOSapps to set up most Echo hardware.\nVoice-activated assistants upload recordings of your requests for processing and require some of your personal information (like contacts and location). They are always listening for their wake words. If this makes you nervous,you can take a few stepsto keeps tabs on your data.\nIn your assistant\u2019s settings, you can decide if you want to have it constantly listening for commands or wake with a button press. You should also be able to review recordings and your request history, manage how your data is used, and tell your assistant to forget or delete a request.\nOne of the quickest ways to learn the abilities of your assistant is to just say, \u201cWhat can I ask you?\u201d On a device with a screen, you may also see a series of suggestions. Simple commands include asking for the weather forecast, inquiring about traffic conditions or checking your schedule.\nManufacturers\u2019 sites have detailed instructions. Apple offershelp in using Siri, Google hasthe details on its Assistant, Microsoft provides anoverview of Cortana\u2019s powersand Samsung invites its users tolearn what Bixby can do. Amazon hosts a handyAlexa User Guide.\nVoice assistants on smart speakers have also become the control hubs for wirelessly connected devices like light bulbs, streaming TV boxes, thermostats and othersmart homeappliances. When shopping, just make sure the gadget you\u2019re considering is compatible with your chosen assistant.\nAmazondominatesthe smart speaker market, but Apple has itsHomePodspeaker and Google makes severalHomeandNestdevices. Samsung\u2019sGalaxy Home speakerfor Bixby is in the works. And if you\u2019re on the go,Alexa Auto,Android Autowith Google Assistant andApple CarPlaywith Siri suggestions keep your companion riding along. (Microsoft issteering Cortana away from appsand hardware and intomore Office 365 integration.)\nLike other software platforms, assistants also work with third-party apps \u2014 often referred to as \u201cskills,\u201d \u201cactions\u201d or \u201ccapsules.\u201d These apps greatly expand your assistant\u2019s power, like ordering a pepperoni pie from your favorite pizza chain for home delivery.\nFor Siri on iOS devices, open up theSiri Shortcutsapp in OS 12 and later and tap the Gallery icon to see a series of preconfigured actions you can assign. You can also createautomationsanddesign your own Shortcuts.\nGoogle\u2019s site has aguide for vocally using appsandcreating routines. Microsoft\u2019s site has a page ofCortana skillsto sample. Samsung\u2019s \u201cBixby Capsules\u201d can also runroutines on certain devices.\nAmazon\u2019s site has anAlexa Skillsguide for the assistant\u2019s thousands of voice apps \u2014 or you can just say, \u201cAlexa, help me get started with skills.\u201d By linking Skills together, you can alsoset up Routinesfor multiple tasks at one command \u2014 like easing you into the day with your favorite morning news podcast, turning on the smart coffee maker and gently increasing the brightness on your connected lighting system. Alexa,originally inspiredby the voice-controlled computer in \u201cStar Trek,\u201d even has an official \u201cStar Trek\u201d skilland can speak Klingon on command."

        "title": "Does the F.B.I. Need Apple to Hack Into iPhones?",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHi, everyone. I\u2019m Jack Nicas, and I cover Apple for The Times. My week has been hectic since the United States attorney generalwent in front of reporters on Mondayand pushed Apple to break open two locked iPhones that belonged to a dead terrorist.\nYou probably rememberthe last high-profile clash between Apple and the F.B.I.in 2016, over a different dead gunman\u2019s phone. Since then, Apple has continued to pitch itself as a company focused on customers\u2019 privacy. A go-to line of Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has become: \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d\nYet despite all of Apple\u2019s adstouting the security of its devices, there is one detail it never mentions: The police have long exploited software flaws to break into its iPhones.\nThat has been an awkward reality for Apple\u2019s marketing team \u2014 and a big help for its colleagues in government relations. Software flaws have for years alleviated Apple\u2019s dispute with law enforcement over encryption, giving the police access to criminals\u2019 iPhones and Apple a convenient excuse that it didn\u2019t help.\nNow the F.B.I. says tools for cracking into iPhones are failing for two older devices connected tothe recent shooting at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., though the bureau won\u2019t say why.\nSome members of the Apple team working on the issue are frustrated that the F.B.I. hasn\u2019t tried to crack the phone for long enough,according to our article. And security researchers are also confused about why the F.B.I. can\u2019t find a way in without Apple.\n\u201cAll the tools they have work, they have a network of vendors capable of assisting them, and all the phones are old \u2014 they\u2019re a solved problem,\u201d Dan Guido, head of Trail of Bits, an iPhone security research firm, said of the F.B.I. \u201cThat all makes me really surprised they need Apple to get into the phone.\u201d\nWhether this latest clash evolves into a legal test case that sets a new precedent on government access to private devices will largely hinge on whether Apple is truly the only way to gain entry to the phones. So let\u2019s dig in.\nThe phones at the center of the dispute are an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7 Plus. Those phones were released in 2012 and 2016, and they lack Apple\u2019s most sophisticated software. Tools from at least two companies, Cellebrite and Grayshift, are able to break into those iPhone models, though they pose different challenges.\nThe iPhone 5 is the simpler of the two. It no longer supports the latest iPhone software, and it has effectively the same technology as the device in the 2016 clash between Apple and the F.B.I., an iPhone 5C. In that case, the dispute abruptly ended when a private company broke into the phone for the bureau.\nThe iPhone 7 Plus is tougher to hack. It has a special processor, called the Secure Enclave, designed to improve its security. But it is still part of a group of iPhone models that havea known, unresolvable flaw called Checkm8, said Jonathan Levin, an iPhone security consultant.\n\u201cWe know exactly how to exploit it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so trivial.\u201d\nTools like those from Cellebrite and Grayshift don\u2019t actually break iPhones\u2019 encryption; they guess the password. To do so, they exploit flaws in the software, like Checkm8, to remove the limit of 10 password attempts. (After about 10 failed attempts, an iPhone erases its data.) The tools then use a so-called brute-force attack, which automatically tries thousands of passcodes until one works.\nThat approach means the wild card in the Pensacola case is the length of the suspect\u2019s passcode. If it\u2019s six numbers \u2014 the default on iPhones \u2014 authorities almost certainly can break it. If it\u2019s longer, it might be impossible.\nA four-number passcode, the previous default length, would take on average about seven minutes to guess. If it\u2019s six digits, it would take on average about 11 hours. Eight digits: 46 days. Ten digits: 12.5 years.\nIf the passcode uses both numbers and letters, there are far more possible passcodes \u2014 and thus cracking it takes much longer. A six-character alphanumeric passcode would take on average 72 years to guess.\nIt takes 80 milliseconds for an iPhone to compute each guess. While that may seem small, consider that software can theoretically try thousands of passcodes a second. With the delay, it can try only about 12 a second.\nThe Secure Enclave processor in the iPhone 7 Plus also adds additional delays between passcode attempts, which could make guessing even a four- or six-digit passcode take weeks. But researchers believe Cellebrite and Grayshift have figured out how to disable that delay, because their tools routinely hack into newer phones with the feature.\n\u201cHe might have just picked a good passcode,\u201d Matthew D. Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, said of the Pensacola gunman. \u201cHe did seem to know he was about to commit a serious terrorist attack. It\u2019s entirely possible he did his research and planned ahead.\u201d\nIf that is the case, \u201cthat\u2019s not a problem that Apple can help with,\u201d said Mr. Guido, the iPhone security researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that\u2019s going to take time to crack.\u201d\nThe other possibility is that major physical damage to both iPhones could be stopping the third-party tools. The gunman shot the iPhone 7 Plus once and tried to break the iPhone 5. The F.B.I. said it had repaired the devices in a lab so they were \u201coperational,\u201d but the bureau then couldn\u2019t unlock them.\nIf the damage affected parts of the phone that enabled the third-party tools to hack into the device \u2014 or even the phone\u2019s memory itself \u2014 it may be impossible for Apple to get in, even under a court order, some researchers said.\nChris Betz, a former Apple security engineer who is now the chief security officer for the technology company CenturyLink, said Apple had for years tried to design its phones in a way that even it couldn\u2019t hack into them without the passcode.\n\u201cI think the best capabilities that exist in the world to get in are those that the third-party vendors provide,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re well understood, there are a slew of them, they've been used in court recently. I can\u2019t think of a way that Apple could get in that\u2019s better.\u201d\nIf you want more on this fightbetween Apple and the F.B.I.,here\u2019s our articleon how Apple is cautiously responding to Washington.\nMy colleague Brian X. Chenhad a piece explaininghow you can take back control of your contentin the age of streaming.\nFrom Berlin, Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewingwrote that as Germany decided whether to let Huawei build its 5G wireless infrastructure,China had immense leverage in the debate: It is one of the biggest buyers of German cars.\nHere\u2019sa helpful rundownof what\u2019s in \u2014 and not in \u2014 the new trade deal between China and the United States, by Peter Eavis, Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson.\nAnd in The Washington Post, Drew Harwell discovered that doctored images weren\u2019t just popular with propagandists and trolls. They are alsoincreasingly used by political campaigns.\nHow are we doing?\nWe\u2019d love your feedback on this newsletter.

Cathay Pacific and United Airlines have reduced the number of flights.\n\u2022Starbucksclosed more than half of its storesin the country, its second-biggest market.\n\u2022 The owner of Uniqlo has closed about 100 stores in the affected Hubei Province.\nApple said the outbreak couldaffect its financial forecasts.Tim Cook, its C.E.O., told analysts yesterday that suppliers could be disrupted and that traffic to its stores in China had dropped.\nThe moves come as the disease\u2019s toll continues to grow.The death tallyas of this morning was 132 \u2014 up from 106 yesterday \u2014 and the number of cases jumped 25 percent, to 5,974. And more cases are being reported of people in other countries falling ill, despite having not visited China.\nMarkets offered a mixed reaction.Hong Kong stocks felltoday, their first day of trading after the Lunar New Year holiday. But S&P futures are indicating a positive opening in the U.S.\nBritain, defying calls from the White House to block Huawei products, said it would not ban the Chinese company from being used in its new high-speed 5G wireless network.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson allowed Huawei technologyto be used in some parts of Britain\u2019s 5G infrastructure, though not in essential ones. And \u201chigh risk\u201d vendors who pose potential security risks wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hold more than 35 percent of the country\u2019s overall network.\nThe decision dismissed the Trump administration\u2019s claimsthat using Huawei products could compromise the security of 5G systems.\nBritain is in a tough position:Washington threatened towithhold intelligenceif London allowed Huawei into the country\u2019s 5G network, while China threatened economic retaliation if it didn\u2019t.\nThe decision could embolden other countriesto use Huawei. Canada and Germany are set to decide this year on whether to block the Chinese company.\nA Trump administration official said the U.S. was \u201cdisappointed\u201dby the move and would work with Britain \u201con a way forward that results in the exclusion of untrusted vendor components from 5G networks.\u201d\nThe Fed is expected to announce a decision on interest rates today after the end of its latest board meeting. That will againput the focus on Mr. Powell, the chairman, who continues to face pressure from President Trump as he steers the central bank, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT writes.\n\u2022 \u201cEverything about him, from the simple language he uses at news conferences to his demeanor on Capitol Hill, conveys that he is relatable, ordinary and decidedly undramatic,\u201d Ms. Smialek writes of the Fed chairman.\n\u2022 His quiet approach \u201cis part of a deeper strategy by Mr. Powell, who is trying to convince America that the Fed is a collection of nonpartisan public servants focused on serving the American people \u2014 not a temple of elites wielding unchecked power.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cTo shore up support, Mr. Powell visits Capitol Hill frequently, holding more than 260 meetings with members of Congress since taking over as chair in February 2018.\u201d\nThat approach is repeatedly tested by Mr. Trump\u2019s criticismthat the Fed has kept interest rates too high. Yesterday, the president tweeted that the central bank \u201cshould get smart\u201d and lower rates.\nBut Mr. Powell and the Fed are expected to keep rates steadyand to continue to do so until the economic picture changes.\nProsecutors arrested Charles Lieber, a top scientist at Harvard, charging him with concealing financial ties to China.It\u2019s an escalationin a campaign to stamp out the stealing of secrets from U.S. universities, Ellen Barry of the NYT writes.\n\u2022 Dr. Lieber, who specializes in nanoscale electronics, is not accused of sharing sensitive information with Chinese officials. But he was charged with hiding how much money Chinese funders were paying him. (It was tens of thousands of dollars a year, according to prosecutors.)\n\u2022 He was ensnared in a two-year push by the Justice Department to find individuals at U.S. universities working with the Chinese government. Massachusetts, with its many universities, is a \u201ctarget-rich\u201d environment, according to the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Boston field office.\n\u2022 The drive has meant \u201cresearchers are adjusting to a higher level of scrutiny about foreign funding than they faced in the past,\u201d Ms. Barry writes.\nThe money-management firm State Street plans tovote against directors of companiesin major stock indexes that fall behind targets for environmental, social and governance changes.\n\u201cWe see that shareholder value is increasingly being drivenby issues such as climate change, labor practices and consumer product safety,\u201d Cyrus Taraporevala, the C.E.O. of the firm\u2019s investment management arm, wrote ina letter to corporate boards.\nState Street willstart its campaignwith companies in the S&P 500 and in major European indexes, and then broaden the effort in 2022.\nThe decision matters, given State Street\u2019s size.Its Global Advisors division oversees $3.1 trillion in assets and is a major investor in companies around the world.\nThe big picture:Increasingly, huge money managers are using their influence to push for changes beyond financial performance. BlackRock, which has over $7 trillion in assets, said this month that it would make climate change akey investment focus.\nToday brings a first for the 151-year-old bank: an \u201cinvestor day\u201d for shareholders, as well as for analysts, the news media and even regulators.\nThe event isan attempt to promote a more open imagefor a company that has traditionally been known as a secretive black box of profits and \u201can adrenaline-fueled sales-and-trading juggernaut,\u201d Kate Kelly of the NYT writes.\nGoldman\u2019s C.E.O., David Solomon, will argue that the bank has evolved.The firm has jumped into retail banking and credit cards, for example, and it does more mundane tasks like manage cash for corporations.\nBut some executives reportedly think the firm is trying too hard.\u201cThey want the investor day to focus more on places where Goldman actually makes money,\u201dLaura Noonan of the FT writes, citing unnamed sources.\nMr. Solomon has his work cut out.Goldman \u201cis to some extent grasping at straws strategically,\u201d one investor specializing in financial stocks told Ms. Noonan.\nDeals\n\u2022 The investment firm Platinum Equity has reportedly tried to poach Joe Ianniello, the head of CBS, to lead its takeover bid for Univision.

        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHi, everyone, this is Nellie Bowles, a tech writer for The New York Times in San Francisco. And I\u2019m here to let you in on a sad truth.\nSometimes news breaks that is more exciting or terrifying or compelling for whatever reason than our beautiful articles about tech. Maybe the article was a long feature that came out right after the impeachment vote. Maybe it was a carefully wrought profile that coincided with Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death. Whatever the reason, when there is big, surprising news, there is always, in some other corner of The Times, a reporter quietly heartbroken over the realization that her or his article is now at the bottom of the heap.\nSo in this newsletter, I will quickly run down the news of a slow news week (it\u2019s New Year\u2019s!). And then we will take a tour through the hidden gems produced by my co-workers in 2019.\nBrian Chenlaid out what new tech to expect in 2020 (better home automation, more wearables). AndKevin Roosechose his annual Good Tech Award winners.\nCalifornia\u2019s new law to regulate freelance workis upsetting a lot of freelancers, as I reported with my colleague Noam Scheiber, who followed with news thatUber and Postmates filed a lawsuitto stop it. A new California law on privacy is also creating dismay, though in a different way: Few companies agree on what the law means,Natasha Singer wrote.\nSoftBank, famous these days for its investments in overhyped start-ups, faces trouble in India for funding Oyo, a start-up with a noxious work environment,Vindu Goel and Karan Deep Singh wrote.\nThe day after Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony, Steve Lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concernbut a wealth and power concentration concern, too.\nConsumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.\nThe morning after the House impeachment vote, Karen Weise publishedan investigationinto how Amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.\n\u201cSome guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, \u2018We have changed the rules,\u2019\u201d said Charlie Cole, who runs Tumi\u2019s online business. He pushed back, but wasn\u2019t successful. \u201cIt was like talking to a brick wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to be able to control everything.\u201d\nCade Metzwent to Bhubaneswar, India,to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. He wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless.\nIn facilities like the one I visited in Bhubaneswar and in other cities in India, China, Nepal, the Philippines, East Africa and the United States, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.\nJack Nicas and Keith Collinsexposedthe way Apple\u2019s algorithmskept Apple services ranked high in the App Store. Midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. Apple representatives told Jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors.\nIf you searched for \u201cpodcast\u201d in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.\nJust as the holidays were kicking off,Adam Satariano had a tale from the Faroe Islands, \u201cAt the Edge of the World, a New Battleground for the U.S. and China.\u201d The photos by Ben Quinton are especially stunning.\nNo location is now too small for the United States and China to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. The Faroe Islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across Europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over Huawei, the crown jewel of the Chinese tech sector.\nDavey Alba, the tech team\u2019s new reporter on disinformation,wrote about how Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation.It didn\u2019t happenas promised.\nAs a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.\nDuring summer\u2019s long vacation-filled months, Brian Chen wrote a confessional: \u201cI Shared My Phone Number. I Learned I Shouldn\u2019t Have.\u201d\nFor most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. In August, I learned this was a bad idea.\nNatasha Singerprofiled Baroness Beeban Kidron, a member of Britain\u2019s House of Lords who is fighting Big Tech on behalf of children\u2019s privacy.\n\u201cThe idea that it\u2019s O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons \u2014 it\u2019s not a fair fight,\u201d Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. \u201cIt\u2019s little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.\u201d\nAnd last but not least, Daisuke WakabayashiprofiledLuigi Zingales, a professor from the famously free-market University of Chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.\n\u201cMy conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology.

Sam Mendes\u2019s \u201c1917,\u201d a World War I epic that does not arrive in wide release in theaters until Friday, was named best drama, and Mendes received the Globe for best director.\n\u201cI hope this means that people will turn up and see this on the big screen, the way it was intended,\u201d Mendes said from the stage in an unsubtle swipe at Netflix.\nIt was a humiliating evening for the streaming giant. Netflix went into the ceremony with a leading 34 nominations, including six for Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d more than for any film, and five for Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d But Netflix left with only two prizes: Laura Dern collected the Globe for her supporting role in \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and Olivia Colman (\u201cThe Crown\u201d) was named best actress in a television drama.\nAmazon and Hulu each took home a pair of awards, notably a win by \u201cFleabag\u201d (Amazon)for best TV comedy. But Apple TV Plus was shut out.\nIn contrast, HBO converted four of its 15 nominations into wins, including Globes for best drama (the soapy media family series \u201cSuccession\u201d) and best limited series (\u201cChernobyl\u201d). Sony Pictures, the studio behind \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d was the big winner among film companies.\nThe ceremony began on a frothy and obscene note, as the returning host, the British comedianRicky Gervais, cracked numerous jokes that were bleeped by NBC censors. He mocked Joe Pesci by likening him to Baby Yoda, cracked an extremely vulgar joke that involved the \u201cCats\u201d star Judi Dench licking herself, poked fun at Hollywood\u2019s focus on diversity and pronounced that \u201cno one cares about movies anymore.\u201d\nBut the proceedings grew increasingly serious as the night went on. Michelle Williams, accepting the Globe for best actress in a limited series for FX\u2019s \u201cFosse/Verdon,\u201d pleaded with women to vote. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them.\u201d\nPatricia Arquette, winning for her supporting role in the Hulu limited series \u201cThe Act,\u201d offered a stern dose of reality, reminding everyone that, among other things, America was \u201con the brink of war\u201d and that President Trump had tweeted aboutdestroying Iranian cultural sitesearlier in the night.\n\nThe Globes, awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are not taken seriously as markers of artistic achievement. But Hollywood covets the red-carpet spectacle, which comes during nomination balloting for the Academy Awards. (Voting for the Oscarsstarted on Thursdayand concludes on Tuesday; nominations will be announced on Jan. 13.) Studio marketers will use Globe wins to promote winter films. NBC, which broadcasts the ceremony live, makes a fortune on ad sales.\nOver the last 10 years, the Globes and the Oscars have agreed on best picture winners only 50 percent of the time \u2014 although they did match last year, when \u201cGreen Book\u201d was the big winner at both ceremonies.\n\n\n\nNothing is certain when it comes to the Globes, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was as close to a sure thing as it gets. She won best actress in a drama for her heartbreaking portrayal of a middle-aged Judy Garland in Roadside Attraction\u2019s \u201cJudy.\u201d On the men\u2019s side, Joaquin Phoenix won for hisdemented transformationin the Warner Bros. comic book drama \u201cJoker.\u201d \u201cI cannot believe you put up with me,\u201d he said from the stage to the director Todd Phillips.\nEddie Murphy was the favorite to win best comedic actor for playing a struggling comedian who comes up with a blaxploitation hit in Netflix\u2019s \u201cDolemite Is My Name.\u201d In a surprise, Taron Egerton (\u201cRocketman,\u201d released by Paramount Pictures) was called to the stage. A flummoxed Egerton thanked his mother \u2014 \u201cThis one\u2019s for you\u201d \u2014 and Elton John, whom he played in the film: \u201cThank you for living a life less ordinary.\u201dAwkwafina won best actress in a musical or comedyfor \u201cThe Farewell\u201d (A24).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, stars like Oprah Winfrey and Meryl Streep have appeared on the Globes stage to accept lifetime achievement awards and haveunleashed cris de coeurabout politics and sexual harassment. This time around, the foreign press association seemedto make a statement about a need for niceness. The lifetime achievement honorees were Tom Hanks andEllen DeGeneres, both of whom are known more for uniting than for dividing.\nIn presenting the Globe to DeGeneres, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d starKate McKinnonspoke about what it meant to her, as a young lesbian, to see DeGeneres come out of the closet. \u201cThe only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cAttitudes change, but only because brave people like Ellen jump into the fire to make them change.\u201d\nDeGeneres fought back tears, thanked McKinnon and joked the same was true for her watching Carol Burnett: \u201cEvery time she pulled her ear, I knew she was saying, \u2018It\u2019s O.K. I\u2019m gay, too.\u201d\nHanks, who was battling a cold, choked up once while talking about his family and a second time while reflecting on the process of moviemaking. He said some of the best advice he had ever received came while he was a fledgling actor. \u201cYour job is to show up on time, know the text and have a head full of ideas,\u201d Hanks recounted.\nThe foreign press association was beaten to a pulp on social media for putting forward an all-male slate of director honorees andoverlooking womenlike Greta Gerwig (\u201cLittle Women\u201d) and Lulu Wang (\u201cThe Farewell\u201d), among others. The lack of awards recognition for female filmmakers is a problem that extends beyond the 88-member foreign press association; women could also be excluded by Oscar voters this year.\nBut with giants like Scorsese and Tarantino in the mix, there has been little oxygen left for any other filmmakers on the awards trail.\nGlobe voters could have thrown a curve ball and awarded the best director trophy toBong Joon Ho for \u201cParasite.\u201dBong, the 50-year-old Korean filmmaker, created agenre-defying gem that dazzled critics. But the directing prize went to Mendes instead.\n\u201cParasite\u201d did win best foreign film. \u201cOnce you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\u201d Bong said, speaking in Korean with the assistance of an onstage translator.\nIt was a good night for HBO. \u201cChernobyl\u201d won best limited series and \u201cSuccession,\u201d the network\u2019sdeliriously well-reviewed dramaabout a feuding media dynasty, won the best TV drama prize. One thank-you stood out: Jesse Armstrong, the \u201cSuccession\u201d showrunner, name-checked Richard Plepler, the former HBO chief who recently announced he would beworking exclusively for Apple TV Plus.\nApple, which is hoping to become a player on the awards scene, had two chances in the best actress in a drama category. Jennifer Aniston and her \u201cMorning Show\u201d castmate Reese Witherspoon were both nominated. But Olivia Colman won for her stiff-upper-lip portrayal of Queen Elizabeth on Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\n\u201cI already got a little bit boozy because I didn\u2019t think this was going to happen,\u201d Colman said.\n\nJohn Koblin contributed reporting from New York."

        "title": "Please Stop Big Tech, Small Rivals Tell Lawmakers",
        "fulltext": "For all the criticisms directed at the largest tech companies in the last couple of years, few smaller rivals have been willing to speak up publicly.\nThat changed for a couple of hours on Friday, as executives at four businesses pleaded with federal lawmakers to rein in Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.\nAt a congressional hearing in Boulder, Colo., top executives of Sonos, PopSockets, Basecamp and Tile testified that the biggest technology companies hindered their businesses. Their stories varied, but they shared a theme: The tech giants have used their powerful positions in search, e-commerce, online ads and smartphones to squeeze out them and other rivals.\nTile, which makes small tracking devices, said Apple had put up hurdles for Tile\u2019s smartphone app that didn\u2019t apply to Apple\u2019s competing product. Sonos, the high-end audio company, said Google had copied its patented speaker technology and used its dominance in search to enter new markets. PopSockets, which makes smartphone grips, said Amazon \u201cbullied\u201d it into sales agreements and ignored complaints about counterfeits on the retail platform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like playing a soccer game,\u201d said Kirsten Daru, the vice president and general counsel of Tile. \u201cYou might be the best team in the league, but you\u2019re playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game in their own favor and anytime.\u201d\nThe executives\u2019 criticism provided lawmakers on the House antitrust subcommittee, which conducted the hearing, with personal stories about the power and influence of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies. Last year, the House opened a broad investigation into whether those large companies violated antitrust laws. At the same time, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission opened separate competition investigations into Amazon, Facebook Apple and Google. In addition, nearly all 50 states are investigating whether Facebook and Google engage in anticompetitive practices.\nDespite all of those investigations, few companies have come forward to complain in public. The House antitrust subcommittee has interviewed dozens of companies that accuse the big tech companies of unlawfully stifling competition. Most have insisted on confidentiality. This month,Sonos sued Googleon allegations of antitrust violations and patent infringement, in its first pointed action against the company.\nLawmakers at Friday\u2019s hearing, which was held in Boulder in part to draw more national attention to the House investigation, noted how rarely start-ups spoke out about their complaints, and encouraged them to keep making their case.\n\u201cThank you for your testimony, and quite frankly your courage to be here today,\u201d said Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado. \u201cBecause when you take on dominant players, whether it\u2019s Amazon, Google, Apple or Facebook, you\u2019ve got to have a little trepidation.\u201d\nRepresentative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the antitrust subcommittee, thanked the executives for \u201cdescribing economic retaliation.\u201d\nThe tech companies vehemently deny that they illegally harm competition. Google, for instance, has disputed all the claims made by Sonos and said it would fight the lawsuit.\nThe hearing capped a difficult week for big tech, which was the target of fierce criticism by top politicians. Much of that anger was directed at Facebook, which has refused to police lies shared by politicians on its social network.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that Facebook \u201cjust cares about money\u201d and that the company intended \u201cto be accomplices in misleading the American people.\u201d Former Vice PresidentJoseph R. Biden Jr., who has been the focus of false ads by President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, told the New York Times editorial board that Facebook and other internet companies that allow the spread of misinformation on their sites should lose a critical liability shield for internet platforms. He also personally criticized Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a big Zuckerberg fan,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe knows better.\u201d\nThe hearing on Friday focused entirely on whether the big companies dominate markets. The executives, who argued at length that companies like Google and Amazon unfairly hurt their businesses, received little pushback from lawmakers.\nDavid Barnett, the founder of PopSockets, said Amazon had pressured it to lower listing prices or else allow unauthorized resellers to sell the product. He also alleged that Amazon allowed a flood of counterfeits to compete with PopSockets on the site to pressure the company into spending more on marketing.\nIt is \u201cbullying with a smile,\u201d Mr. Barnett said.\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson, the chief technology officer and a co-founder of Basecamp, a provider of online productivity tools, said Google\u2019s domination of the search industry forced his company to go online with the advertising titan\u2019s demands and decisions.\n\u201cThe internet has been colonized by a handful of big tech companies that wield their monopoly powers without restraint,\u201d Mr. Hansson said.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats appeared to sympathize with him and the other executives.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear there\u2019s abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,\u201d said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado.\nMr. Cicilline said he didn\u2019t expect the executives or their companies to suffer any economic retaliation from the giants for testifying. \u201cBut if you do in any way, it would be of tremendous interest to this committee,\u201d he said."

        "title": "F.B.I. Asks Apple to Help Unlock Two iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Theencryption debatebetween Apple and the F.B.I. might have found its new test case.\nThe F.B.I. said on Tuesday that it had asked Apple for the data on two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in theshooting last month at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., possibly setting up another showdown over law enforcement\u2019s access to smartphones.\nDana Boente, the F.B.I.\u2019s general counsel, said in a letter to Apple that federal investigators could not gain access to the iPhones because they were locked and encrypted and their owner, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani of the Saudi Royal Air Force, is dead. Two people who had seen the letter described it to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity because the government\u2019s investigation into the shooting is still active.\nThe F.B.I. has a search warrant for the devices and is seeking Apple\u2019s assistance executing it, the people said.\nLieutenant Alshamrani isthe Saudi Air Force traineewho federal authorities believe shot and killed three sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in December.\nThe case could become a new point of contention ina long-running disputebetween Apple and the F.B.I. over what digital information should be accessible to law enforcement. In 2014, Applestarted building encryption into iPhonesthat can be unlocked only with a given device\u2019s password, meaning even Apple cannot bypass the security. The technology has frustrated law enforcement authorities, who say Apple has given criminals a safe haven.\nApple said in a statement that it had given the F.B.I. all the data \u201cin our possession\u201d related to the Pensacola case when it was asked a month ago. \u201cWe will continue to support them with the data we have available,\u201d the company said. Apple regularly complies with court orders to turn over information it has on its servers, such as iCloud data, but it has long argued that it does not have access to material stored only on a locked, encrypted iPhone.\nAn F.B.I. spokeswoman confirmed the existence of the letter, which wasfirst reported by NBC News, but declined to comment further.\nBefore sending the letter, the F.B.I. checked with other government agencies and its national security allies to see if they had a way into the devices \u2014 but they did not, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.\nThe official said the F.B.I. was not asking Apple to create a so-called backdoor or technological solution to get past its encryption that must be shared with the government. Instead, the government is seeking the data that is on the two phones, the official said.\nApple has argued in the past that obtaining such data would require it to build a backdoor, which it said would set a dangerous precedent for user privacy and cybersecurity.\nThe Pensacola case resemblesthe 2016 dispute between Apple and the F.B.I.over the iPhone of the man who, along with his wife, shot and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. As in that case, there is a dead gunman, a court authorization to gain entry to a phone, and an early stalemate between law enforcement and Apple.\nBut the San Bernardino investigation turned into a high-stakes showdown after a federal judge ordered Apple to help the authorities gain entry to the phone. Such a court order has not been issued in the Pensacola case, and it is does not appear that the F.B.I. has yet sought such a ruling.\nThe letter could be the first step toward such an order, as the F.B.I. would likely need to show a judge that Apple had refused to assist in executing a warrant. Apple did not respond to a question about whether it would comply with the F.B.I.\u2019s request in the Pensacola investigation.\nAfter the federal judge ordered Apple to create a way to open the San Bernardino gunman\u2019s phone in 2016, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, responded witha 1,100-word letterin which he said that creating such a backdoor would compromise the security of every iPhone.\n\u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201d\nMr. Cook made an aggressive argument to the public that the Obama administration\u2019s actions would undermine people\u2019s privacy and security. But he may find it more difficult to attack the Trump administration, which has long dangled the threat of tariffs on Apple\u2019s products.\nMr. Cook has become an ally of President Trump, visiting him regularly in Washington and recently hosting him at a Mac computer factory in Texas, where the president claimed he had helped spur its construction whenit had actually been open for six years.\nThe dispute over the San Bernardino case was resolved when the F.B.I.found a private companythat was able to bypass the iPhone\u2019s encryption. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector Generallater foundthatthe F.B.I. had not exhausted all possible solutionsto unlock the phone before it tried to force Apple to build a way past the encryption.\nBoth sides have since doubled down on their stances. Apple hasmade its encryption even tougher, closing gaps that law enforcement had exploited to gain entry to iPhones.\nAnd Attorney General William P. Barr has recently turned up his criticism of encryption. He said last month that finding a way for law enforcement to gain access to encrypted technology was one of the Justice Department\u2019s \u201chighest priorities.\u201d\nIn several speeches last year, he noted that drug cartels, human trafficking rings and child pornographers depended on consumer products with strong encryption, such as WhatsApp and Signal, and he has singled out Facebook\u2019s efforts to wrap all of its products in virtually unbreakable encryption as a scourge for law enforcement.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about when you have a warrant and probable cause and you cannot get the information,\u201d Mr. Barr said at a Wall Street Journal conference in Washington last month.\nCompanies like Facebook are selling the idea that \u201cno matter what you do, you\u2019re completely impervious to government surveillance,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cDo we want to live in a society like that? I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\nJack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington."

        "title": "Whose Side Is Bill Barr On?",
        "fulltext": "You could call it d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but everyone knew it was just a matter of time before it would happen again: another mass shooting, unanswered questions and, inevitably, another locked phone that could hold some answers.\nBut how can I say it any more clearly? The safety of our nation does not depend on giving Attorney General William Barr the keys to spy on anyone with a mobile phone. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite.\nYet in another fatuous speech, the kind of which he seems to specialize in,Mr. Barr attacked Appleon Monday for not helping to unlock two iPhones that he claims the government needs to scrutinize, saying the company has given him \u201cno substantive assistance\u201d with an important criminal investigation.\nMr. Barr\u2019s focus was a shooting last month at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., in which a Saudi cadet training with Americans killed three and wounded eight others. (Mr. Barr was also complimentary of Saudi Arabia in the speech; welcome to the Trump administration.)\nApple rightly pushed back against Mr. Barr\u2019s claims, pointing out that the company had, in fact, helped the government by turning over information on the dead gunman from its servers.\nWhat does Mr. Barr specifically want from Apple? He doesn\u2019t say, of course. There is nothing Apple can actually do to unlock the gunman\u2019s phones that government tech geeks cannot do, short of a systematic change that would weaken the security of all phones. Thus, his aim is clear: He wants the power to go in and out of any phone, any time.\nBelieve nothing Mr. Barr says. We should question how long the government has taken to make these requests of Apple (I\u2019m told that the company was made aware of a second phone only last week). And, perhaps most important to keep in mind, the government can probably already break into our phones if it wants to.\nIt has before, even if Mr. Barr seemed to indicate on Monday that the government could not pull it off without help from Apple.\nThat was what happened when federal investigators battled with the company over iPhone encryption after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people in 2015. In that case, the government was trying to get Apple to \u201cbreak\u201d the protection of the suspect\u2019s phone by demanding it create what Apple called in a court filing a \u201cGovtOS\u201d (that is, a government operating system), giving it that metaphorical key to a backdoor to all phones. The F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, and President Barack Obama pressed Apple to help it crack into a device that one of the gunmen had owned.\nThe Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, refused to do it, in what was probably the most difficult decision of his career. He stuck to the principle espoused by his predecessor, the Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had long maintained that the ultimate act of patriotism is to protect the privacy of Apple customers against unnecessary search and seizure.\nOver the years, Apple has increased security for consumers through encryption. In the most simple terms, phones were built to be opened only with a user\u2019s passcode (this tech is also what enables fingerprint and face identification), and the company has built in no power to bypass that. The iPhone has been engineered to offer more and more user control.\nThat\u2019s why Apple would not bend in the San Bernardino case. In the end, reports say, an Israeli firm unlocked the phone for the government, and the collision between Apple and the F.B.I. was averted.\nIn the Pensacola case, Apple has said it has given up all the data it has to the government. But law enforcement officials, as all law enforcement officials tend to do, are asking for more, claiming this time that they want only to look at the particular phones in the Pensacola case, and are not seeking a back door for all phones or a special operating system.\nThe problem? There is no breaking into a single phone without showing the government how to break into all iPhones.\nWhile public safety is important, we have to ask whether getting into these phones is the only avenue the government has to pursue justice or find the truth. We must trust our public officials with confidential and sensitive information to allow them to do their jobs. But the need to guard users\u2019 data \u2014 especially in an age when hackers and more autocratic governments can use it for more nefarious reasons \u2014 still trumps the public-safety concerns Mr. Barr is raising.\nHe said in his news conference, \u201cThis situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that the public be able to get access to digital evidence.\u201d Really?\nDoes it also perfectly illustrate that the United States government did a bad job vetting the Pensacola gunman, a radicalized Saudi cadet? Does it also perfectly illustrate that American officials missed his public postings that indicated an interest in jihadism? Does it also perfectly illustrate that the Saudi government has backed a lot of the type of extremism that might have led to this attack?\nI don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I don\u2019t know how to deal with phones that have become much more secure. But the issues raised here most definitely require real cooperation between tech companies and the government; we may even need legislative solutions.\nBut first we need a whole lot of substantive public discussion and debate about the trade-offs we face as real progress in potentially dangerous surveillance is only increasing.\nApple clearly feels strongly about this matter. The company has benefited from Trump administration policies \u2014 the tax cuts, among others \u2014 and has little apparent incentive to pick a fight with the attorney general. Mr. Cook has met with Mr. Trump many times and has been cordial, even solicitous. Those days seem to be over.\nThe government appears to be trying to make everyone more vulnerable to privacy violations, which is completely backward. A private company should not have to protect us from the government. The government should be protecting us \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s not should be the scariest thing of all.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "How Much Are We Paying for Our Subscription Services? A Lot",
        "fulltext": "Online subscriptions sure sound cheap, but what do a few bucks a month to watch TV shows, store photos online and stream music add up to?\nQuite a lot, it turns out.\nIn 2019, we each spent $640 ondigital subscriptionslikestreaming videoandmusic services, cloud storage, dating apps and online productivity tools, according to an analysis for The New York Times byMint, the online budgeting tool owned by Intuit, using data from millions of its users. That was up about 7 percent from $598 in 2017.\nWe increased our spending the most last year on streaming TV services, paying $170 to subscribe to the likes of Netflix, Hulu and new entrants like Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus. While that was far cheaper than most traditional cable TV packages, which cost roughly $1,200 a year, it was up 30 percent from the $130 we spent on streaming TV services in 2017.\nOur spending on digital subscriptions is likely to only rise as more of our possessions become connected to the internet, like our television sets, home security systems and cars. At the same time, it will become harder and harder to keep track of all of the services we pay for.\nJust ask Josu\u00e9 Rojas, an artist who runs a nonprofit in San Francisco. He said he paid for Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify and Apple\u2019s iCloud storage service \u2014 all told, his annual cost is roughly $410, which is below what the average consumer pays.\nBut Mr. Rojas occasionally loses track of his spending. Last year, he said, he and his wife subscribed to the CBS All Access streaming app to watch the Grammys. After the ceremony concluded, the couple forgot to cancel the $6 subscription for several months.\n\u201cComing home from work and essentially needing a spreadsheet to keep track of all these different subscriptions can be pretty overbearing very quickly,\u201d Mr. Rojas said.\nKevin Westcott, a vice chairman for the research and consulting firm Deloitte, who led a study on digital media trends, said the No. 1 reason that people subscribed to a streaming service was to watch exclusive content \u2014 like original TV shows, including HBO\u2019s \u201cWatchmen\u201d or \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d on Disney Plus.\n\u201cThe question that arises is, once you\u2019ve watched that series, do you continue to use it?\u201d Mr. Westcott said. \u201cIs there enough of a library that keeps you engaged? Otherwise, it becomes a subscription you have that you haven\u2019t used.\u201d\nPlenty of us have fallen into this trap. It\u2019s wise to regularly audit our subscriptions and prune the ones we no longer need. Here are some tips.\nMany of us wait until the last minute to cancel a subscription, but there is generally no drawback to ending payments ahead of time.\nLet\u2019s say Netflix bills you on the 28th of each month. If you decided on Feb. 5 that it was time to cancel, you would still be able to use Netflix until Feb. 28. There is no benefit to waiting until Feb. 27 to end the subscription.\nWith some forethought, you can get savvy about managing your active subscriptions. For example, if there is a six-episode TV show on Disney Plus once a week, you can set a calendar reminder to cancel your subscription a few weeks before the show ends its run. If the calendar alert appears and you realize there is still something you want to watch on Disney Plus, you can continue paying and reschedule the calendar reminder to appear again a month later.\nUsing budget-tracking toolslike Mint and regularly checking your credit card statement are obvious steps to watch your spending, but subscription charges can easily be overlooked when they carry generic labels like \u201cAmazon\u201d or \u201cGoogle.\u201d\nIt can also be challenging to find out what services you are still subscribed to, let alone how to discontinue memberships. So here\u2019s a cheat sheet for finding the controls to cancel the most popular types of subscriptions:\nOn Apple mobile devices, open the Settings app and tap on your first and last name at the top, then tap Subscriptions. You can see a list of the apps you have subscribed to, like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, HBO Now and Hulu Plus, and cancel the ones you no longer use.\nOn Android devices, open the Google Play Store app. Tap the Menu icon (three horizontal lines) and then tap Subscriptions.\nAmazon subscriptionsare the most confusing to manage because the company offers so many different types of subscriptions and the controls are scattered throughout different parts of the website. Here are the most important settings:\nFor cancelingmembershipslikeAmazon Prime and ComiXology, hover over \u201cAccounts & Lists\u201d and click on \u201cMemberships & Subscriptions.\u201d\nForAmazonapp subscriptions, hover over \u201cAccounts & Lists\u201d and click on \u201cYour Android Apps & Devices,\u201d and then select \u201cYour Subscriptions.\u201d\nFormanagingAmazon photo storage, hover over \u201cAccounts & Lists,\u201d click on \u201cYour Amazon Photos,\u201d then click \u201cManage Storage\u201d and, finally, click \u201cCancel my plan.\u201d\nFormanagingKindle books subscriptions, hover over \u201cAccounts & Lists,\u201d click \u201cYour Kindle Unlimited\u201d and, under \u201cManage Membership,\u201d select \u201cCancel Kindle Unlimited Membership.\u201d\nFormanaging AmazonMusic, hover over \u201cAccounts & Lists,\u201d click \u201cYour Music Library,\u201d then click \u201cYour Amazon Music Settings\u201d and select \u201cAmazon Music Unlimited.\u201d Finally, click \u201cCancel\u201d in the Subscription Renewal section.\nFormanaging Audible audiobooks subscriptions, visit Audible.com, click \u201cAccount Details\u201d and click \u201cCancel my membership.\u201d\nIf keeping track of subscriptions sounds daunting, that\u2019s because it is \u2014 and this is partly why many companies have shifted toward subscriptions. But a subscriptions audit is worth undertaking at least once every three months.\nAfter thoroughly vetting my credit card bills and subscriptions dashboards, I noticed my wife was paying for Audible, the audiobook service, even though she no longer downloaded audiobooks. I confess I gave her something of a hard time \u2014 only to realize later that I had neglected to cancel my subscription to Amazon\u2019s ComiXology Unlimited after starting a free trial to read one comic book.\nI ended up canceling the ComiXology subscription, but only after paying an extra $18 over three months."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Apple\u2019sprofit grew for the first time in a year with the help of an old friend: the iPhone.\nSales of Apple\u2019s flagship product had fallen sharply for the past year, but on Tuesday, Apple saidiPhonerevenue was growing again. The company said customers spent heavily on its latest models, increasing iPhone sales by 7.7 percent to nearly $56 billion in the latest quarter from a year ago.\nThat growth helped lift Apple\u2019s profit by 11.4 percent to $22.3 billion. The numbers easily beat Wall Street expectations and were welcome news to Apple investors, who had watched the company\u2019s typically strong growth suddenly evaporate over the past year.\nBefore Tuesday, Apple had postedfour consecutive quarters of shrinking profit, the longest such streak since 2016.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that demand for Apple\u2019snewest iPhones\u2014 the iPhone 11 series, released in September \u2014 exceeded expectations. He attributed the strong sales to new features, like a better camera and longer battery life, as well as financing options to buy a new phone and a $50 price cut for the cheapest model.\nDaniel Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said there was pent-up demand for the new iPhones because many people had waited to upgrade their older devices. \u201cThis was a jaw-dropper in terms of how strong phone sales were,\u201d he said. \u201cEven more than the bulls were hoping for.\u201d\nApple also was lifted by some of its newer products.\nApple\u2019s services revenue, or sales from its App Store and subscription products, rose by nearly 17 percent to $12.7 billion from the prior year. And sales in its so-called wearables division, which include the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones, grew by 37 percent to just over $10 billion.\nThe growth in services and wearables \u201cattests to the fact that the company continues to reinvent itself,\u201d said Daniel Flax, an analyst at the investment firm Neuberger Berman.\nApple also showed continued improvement in China, its second-largest market after the United States. A year ago, Apple had to pre-emptits earnings reportwith news that its sales in China would come in much lower than forecast.\nThe news sent its stock sliding and raised fears that the slump was a precursor to global economic decline. Applereported that its salesin the China region fell by nearly 27 percent that quarter, contributing to a slight decline in its overall profit.\nBut since then, Apple\u2019s business has rebounded, the global economy has remained largely stable, and the company\u2019s stock has roughly doubled. On Tuesday, Apple said its sales in the China region increased for the first time in five quarters, growing 3.1 percent. Mr. Maestri, the Apple executive, attributed the company\u2019s improving fortunes in China partly to the strengthening economy there.\nApple\u2019s revenue rose by almost 9 percent to $91.8 billion. The company forecast that its revenue would rise 9 percent to 15 percent in the current quarter.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on a call with analysts that Apple\u2019s forecast was less precise than typical because the company was uncertain about the impact from the rapidly spreadingcoronavirus.\nIn addition to its large sales presence in China, Apple also assembles most of its products there. Mr. Cook said that some Apple suppliers would remain closed into February as a precaution from the virus, and that traffic into its retail stores in the country had also fallen off.\nApple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading.\nApple\u2019s recent success on the stock market has reflected a number of good signs for its business, including easing trade tensions between China and the United States. Apple is among the companies with the most at risk in a trade war between the two countries, given its enormous manufacturing and sales presence in China.\nIn the latest quarter, Apple debuted one of its biggest efforts to expand its services business: Apple TV Plus, a package of exclusive TV shows produced by Apple that costs $5 a month, cheaper than most offerings from rivals.\nStill,early market estimatessuggest the service has not been a big draw for new paying subscribers over the first several months, in part because Apple is giving a free year subscription to the service to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac computer.\nPart of Apple\u2019s strategy to expand its services business is to continue to increase the number of people using its devices. On Tuesday, Apple said there were more than 1.5 billion active Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, up from about 1.4 billion a year ago.\nStill, sales of some of Apple\u2019s older products fell in the quarter. Mac revenue decreased 3.5 percent and, on the week of the iPad\u2019s 10th anniversary, its sales declined 11.2 percent."
