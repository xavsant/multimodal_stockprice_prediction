        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two days after Donald J. Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world.\n\u201cThere is a lot of fear within Google,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.\nSixteen months later, Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under anew tax law signed by Mr. Trump. Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s looser regulations for self-driving cars and delivery drones, as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google\u2019s liability for user content on its sites.\nOnce one of Mr. Trump\u2019smost vocal opponents, Silicon Valley\u2019s technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House. When Mr. Trump was elected, tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies\u2019 values. Now, many of the industry\u2019s executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests, even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr. Trump on social issues.\nThe relationship remains bumpy. Mr. Trumplashed out at Amazonon Twitter on Thursday, accusing the e-commerce giant of evading taxes. (Amazon said it had saved $789 million under the tax law Mr. Trump signed.) The president is also expected to sign legislation,passed by the Senate last week, that would strengthen policing of sex trafficking online \u2014 a bill that internet companies once opposed because they worried it would make them liable for content posted by their users.\nYet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\nThose include lowering corporate taxes, encouraging development ofnew wireless technology like 5Gand, so far, ignoring calls to break up the tech giants.Mr. Trump\u2019s tougher stance on Chinamay also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay.\nMr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.\nMr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hitler or Mussolini here,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And even though thepresident\u2019s new tariffson steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, \u201cdisagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cEveryone who is married knows that.\u201d\nMr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.\nAfter Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a$350 billion \u201ccontribution to the U.S. economy\u201dover the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good ona campaign pledgeto get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States.\n\u201cYou know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants,\u201d the presidenttold members of Congresslast month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to personally thank him.\nIn fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.\nMr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, whileother politicians have called formore regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analyticaimproperly harvested the informationof 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\nMichael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, \u201cin places where we do see eye to eye, I think we\u2019re achieving extraordinary success.\u201d\nDean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201d\nThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.\nSome tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November,Microsoft sued the administrationto protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California\u2019s lawsuit on that issue.\nEven so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with somemeeting him at Trump Towerbefore his inauguration and again atthe White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple\u2019s Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple\u2019s headquarters.\nSilicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administrationto pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government\u2019s digital infrastructure.\nBut Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companieslobbied for corporate tax reformfor years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill.\nTech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes,according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion \u201ccontribution\u201d to the economy over five years.\nMost of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.\nThe president was quick to tweet the news.\nThe shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees. A Facebook page called \u201cAngry Googler,\u201d with nearly 1,000 followers, has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president.\n\u201cNot happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump? Same here,\u201d said the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the page, which suggests it is run by a Google employee. This month, the pageposted an articleabout Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from organizing the world\u2019s information to \u2026 optimizing weapons of war,\u201d the page said.\nMessages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.\nSome tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president\u2019s allies. Last month, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising,played down Russia\u2019s impact on the 2016 electionafter theJustice Department charged 13 Russianswith trying to subvert its outcome, including by using Facebook. Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Goldman approvingly.\nFacebook was uncomfortablewith that association with the president, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nTwo days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\n\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d"

        "title": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.\nOn Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.\nThe proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.\nThe global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.\nBut there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\n\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been trying to coordinate global efforts to combat tax evasion.In a reporton digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy.\nOfficials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\n\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\nPascal Saint-Amans, the director of theO.E.C.D.\u2019s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated, global effort to crack down on tax avoidance.\n\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201d\nThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.\nFor example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.\nAmazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.\nAmazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.\nWithin the past few years, the European Commission hasordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billionin back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officialsfined Qualcomm, the chip maker, \u20ac997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said itwould appeal the ruling.\nLast year, the European Commissionfined Google \u20ac2.42 billionfor using its search engine tofavor its own comparison shopping service\u2014 called Google Shopping \u2014 in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling.\nNow, as the European Union prepares to institutecomprehensive new data protection rulesin May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants\u2019 vast information-gathering operations aspotential anti-competitive abuses.\nIn December, Germany\u2019s federal cartel office said Facebook hadabused its dominantposition by requiring its users to let the social network \u201climitlessly amass\u201d data by tracking them through other online services \u2014 including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were\u201cnot convinced that users have given their effective consent\u201d to Facebook\u2019s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles.\nIn a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely \u201cpopular in Germany.\u201d The company also said it would \u201cbe working directly with relevant data protection officials\u201d to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation.\nThe European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.\nThe exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\n\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201d\nAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.\nIn 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.\nBut European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.\nThere is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers."

        "title": "With One Battle Over, a Bigger One Looms for Qualcomm: Apple",
        "fulltext": "Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm thanJerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund.\nEndeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor\u2019s assets, a highly concentrated position.\nBy pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing \u2014 avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well \u2014 Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation\u2019s most successful investors.Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fundfirst among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods.\nThen, this week,President Trump killed Broadcom\u2019s takeover bidon national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund.\nYet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president\u2019s decision \u2014 he applauded it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a shareholder, I voted against it.\u201d\nThat\u2019s partly because, \u201cas a citizen, I didn\u2019t like the deal,\u201d he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.\nHe agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.\nBut as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.\nApple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\nIf Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well pastBroadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.\nThat, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.\nAt the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.\nApple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.\nQualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.\nMr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.\nIn Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.\nStill, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d\nBut if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recentlyamended its agreement with Samsungwithout abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.\nA Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.\nLong-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, whenQualcomm halted rebatesit was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.\nLawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.\nWhile Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)\nQualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)\nNumerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.\nWhile armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.\nQualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.\nStill, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.\nNow that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.\nLast week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d\n\u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said."

Data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday should reveal whether they\u2019re spending the extra cash or saving it.Last month\u2019s reportshowed that Americans\u2019 after-tax incomes jumped in January because of the tax plan, but those gains were mostly theoretical \u2014 companies didn\u2019t actually begin withholding less money from employees\u2019 paychecks until February. As a result, consumer spendingslumped in January. The report on Thursday should show another increase in incomes, but the outlook for spending is less certain, despite the tax changes: An earlier report found that retail salesfell in February. Economists will also be watching this week\u2019s data for signs of an increase in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than it currently plans.Ben Casselman\nFINANCIAL\nAmerican, British and Australian marketswill close in observance of Good Friday, but some Asian exchangeswillremain open.

        "title": "Qualcomm Needs a Mediator More Than a Buyer",
        "fulltext": "Call it cheeky, sentimental or delusional, but Paul Jacobs\u2019s idea of making an offer for Qualcomm, the company he chaired until this month, is certainly daring. The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.\nThere are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.\nValuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.\nA simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.\nMr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.\nWould SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere."

        "title": "Apple Unveils New iPad to Catch Google in the Classroom",
        "fulltext": "CHICAGO \u2014 Appleunveiled a new iPadaimed at classrooms and other education tools on Tuesday, in a bid to catch up to Google for students\u2019 attention \u2014 and win more school districts\u2019 dollars.\nApple said the new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and supports Apple Pencil, a stylus that previously paired with just its pricier iPads. The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers, the same price as its previous version, and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes, from 5 gigabytes.\nIn addition, Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork, an app for teachers to create and track assignments, and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music, video, photography and art.\n\u201cOur place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago\u2019s North Side.\nApple, Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers.\nEven Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday, announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network.\n\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.\nApple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, butGoogle has shot past Applewith inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.\nOf the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.\nSchool districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.\nStill, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.\nApple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.\nBut as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201d\nApple\u2019s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements. But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.\nThe 84-year-old brick school\u2019s front lawn was swarmed with black-clad security guards, including two with bomb-sniffing dogs, and dozens of chipper greeters from Apple in yellow knit hats and green sweatshirts \u2014 Lane Tech\u2019s colors.\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you in unless you\u2019re excited!\u201d one said as guests entered."

        "title": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.",
        "fulltext": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.\nHe leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201d\nIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.\nFacebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201d\nWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.\nThe community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.\nMr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.\nDepends how it goes. Facebook is testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so muchthey will live inside of them? When the project was announced last summer, critics dubbed it Facebookville or, in tribute to company co-founder Mark Zuckerberg,Zucktown.\nThe company has not warmed to these names. \u201cI owe my soul to the company store,\u201dTennessee Ernie Ford sang.But Facebook\u2019s ambitions are now confronting a more urgent problem: an escalating crisis over the company\u2019s power to sway elections, its casual approach to data privacy and its susceptibility to Russian manipulation. If Facebook\u2019s image is permanentlysullied by the furor over Cambridge Analytica, the data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, Zucktown will falter before it is finished.\nThe social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.\nA few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201d\nThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.\nGoogle will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.\nZucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.\nAs workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.\nThe push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.\n\u201cCorporations are paying for things that the city or county and state used to pay for,\u201d said Cecilia Taylor of Belle Haven Action, a community advocacy group. \u201cThey have a lot of money. Alotof money. More than the city does. And a lot more power.\u201d\nOn a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.\nThe notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.\nIn the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.\nThere were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.\nCorporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.\nIn Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.\nBy the 1960s, the era of the company town in America was fading, even as countries like China picked up the notion. Zhengzhou is a remote Chinese city that was once impoverished. It now has350,000 workers building iPhones.\nHardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.\nThe free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\n\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.\nOnly seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.\nMr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.\nCity Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201d\nMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201d\nSince that June 2011 meeting, the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestionhas doubled to 66,000. About300,000 new jobs have been created, pushingthe median apartment rental rate up 37 percentand the median cost of a home to $968,000.\nMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.\nApple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.\nSo the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201d\nWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.\nHowever enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.\nMeasure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201d\nDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201d\nMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\n\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.\nAcross the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.\nIn Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\n\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201d\nMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.\nThe Peery Foundation, a grantmaker based nearby in Palo Alto, madea short videotwo years ago documenting how the area around Facebook\u2019s headquarters was changing. It interviewed dozens of local residents, including one woman who referred to landlords who had been renting to low-income families and were now selling their properties. \u201cEventually,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be nobody here but Facebook.\u201d\nFacebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.\nMs. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\n\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.\nAnd it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\nMs. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201d\nA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\n\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201d\nMr. Jobs promised Cupertino nothing \u2014 and that\u2019s about all Cupertino got. Apple gave $6 million to an affordable housing fund andpays certain fees to the city, but the gleaming new campus is resolutely closed to the public.\nIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make Apple Park for other people,\u201d Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ivesaid at a recent talk in Washington. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t made for you.\u201d\nMs. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201d\nHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.\nIf Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.\nIn 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\n\u201cInstead of being beholden to the public, public servants will be beholden to a private company,\u201d a local activist, J.T. Faraji,said at a City Council meeting.\n\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201d\nDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\n\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201d\nIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.\nIn Toronto, an offshoot of Google won approval last fall toredevelop a 12-acre chunk of the waterfront. Chicagowas so eager to land Amazon\u2019s new headquartersthat it proposed returning to the company half of all the state income tax its employees paid \u2014 money that would enrich the company, one of the world\u2019s most highly valued, at the expense of the community. Chicago is now a finalist. So is Newark, where the stateis offering up to $7 billion in tax credits.\nAs Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.\nThe 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Goes to Hollywood. Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?",
        "fulltext": "Known for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201d\nAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.\nOr, to be more precise: Culver City, Calif., the former home city of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where Apple is building a new 128,000-square-footheadquartersfor its entertainment division.\nApple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.\nSince October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.\nWhen Apple began courting producers last year, it said it had abudget of about $1 billion to work with. Now it is becoming clear that the company will blow well past that figure. Perhaps more meaningful, though, is that Apple\u2019s strong brand name and its willingness to write big checks have quickly made it a top draw for show creators and stars.\nApple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.\nThe week after \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d made its debut, Mr. Cue greatly improved the company\u2019s standing in the entertainment industry byhiring the veteran television executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlichtaway from Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\nThe two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201d\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d\nApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.\nWith the rise of streaming, the old Hollywood system is cracking. With plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018, Netflix has committed to a strategy of offering something for everyone, and other companies have been tempted to try their luck in an increasingly crowded field. There were487 scripted shows released last year, a number that will rise to more than 500 in 2018. To keep up with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have thrown money at new projects, while marquee cable players like HBO and FX are focused on holding their place in the market.\nAfter a hotly contested bidding war, Appleopened its wallet to signMs. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston to star in a series about a morning TV show. It alsostruck a deal for a serieswith Mr. Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d who will write and direct every episode of a new series, the details of which the ever-secretive Apple has not divulged.\nIn addition to those shows, the company has announced that it willreboot Mr. Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmazing Stories\u201dand has signed Ronald D. Moore, the producer of \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cOutlander,\u201dfor a new space drama. Apple also has deals in place for an animated series from the creator of Fox\u2019s \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d;a comedy starring Ms. Wiig; a drama starring Ms. Spencer; and a documentary series about lavish homes from Matt Tyrnauer, who made the fashion documentary \u201cValentino: The Last Emperor.\u201d\nProducers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\nApple has two advantages over its potential rivals: cash \u2014 the company has morethan $285 billion on hand\u2014 and the promise of working with one of the most successful companies on earth.\n\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201d\nAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.\nIndeed, two Apple projects are progressing slowly. Bryan Fullerleft as executive producerof \u201cAmazing Stories\u201d after his vision was regarded by Mr. Spielberg\u2019s Amblin Television, Apple and Universal Television as too dark \u2014 and too expensive. Seven weeks after his departure, he hadn\u2019t been replaced. And Apple\u2019s plans for its morning-show drama starring Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston, which the company purchased four months ago, was still in need of a script, with a draft scheduled to arrive this week.\nApple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.\nAs Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\n\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201d\nAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.\nWith that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending."

        "fulltext": "PARIS \u2014 On a cold evening several weeks ago, a coterie of editors and influencers gathered around a candlelit table at the restaurant Caviar Kaspia here for a dinner party hosted by De Beers.\nAfter the finale of Champagne and strawberries, diamond bracelets, necklaces and rings were served up for the guests\u2019 review. They all whipped out their smartphones \u2014 and tapped the KiraKira+ icon, the wildly popular app that adds twinkling effects to iPhone and Android pictures and videos.\n\u201cI remember when friends on the front row first started using KiraKira+ last season, we were all completely obsessed and wanted to know what it was and how we could use it too,\u201d said Doina Ciobanu, a model and fashion blogger based in London who has 372,000 followers on Instagram. Her sparkle-enhanced content proved a huge hit, she added, and she has used the app regularly, particularly for jewelry posts.\n\u201cI think people are always looking for something new and fun that can make their pictures really stand out,\u201d Ms. Ciobanu said. \u201cKiraKira+ helps users do that, and is particularly female orientated, given how pretty and dreamy it makes everything look.\u201d\nKiraKira, which means sparkly in Japanese, was introduced in 2015 by Kentaro Yama. He created the app as a side project to his full-time job at Tha Ltd., an interactive design studio in Tokyo. But after its enthusiastic adoption last fall by Eva Chen, Instagram\u2019s head of fashion partnerships, its success has been stratospheric.\nAt 99 cents in the Apple iOS store, it\u2019s now rated as the second most-popular app in the American store\u2019s Photo & Video group.\nThe app, which works through a phone\u2019s camera, highlights any reflections or hint of shine in an image with a shimmery twinkle, and filters allow for varying degrees of color intensity and sparkle. Last month, Swarovski became the first brand to partner with the app, sponsoring a new Brilliance filter inspired by the aurora borealis.\nFans of the app include the makeup artist Pat McGrath, the supermodel Rosie Huntington Whiteley and all the Kardashian clan. And the Belgian makeup expert Peter Philips loved KiraKira+ so much that it inspired the beauty look he created for the Dries Van Noten spring 2018 show.\nMr. Yama, who also has developed two other photo-editing apps, A-HDR and AHDR2, said that he was delighted by social media users\u2019 appetite for sparkle, and the success of what had been just a hobby.\nFar more economical than buying actual diamonds, it\u2019s an app that is a shine of the times."

        "fulltext": "Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\n\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\n\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\n\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\n\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\n\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.\nGet this in your inbox each morning. Sign uphere.\nStocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.\nIt was the largest one-day point gain for the Dow since October 2008, according toThe WSJ, and the biggest one-day percentage gain for S.&P. 500 and Dow since August 2015.\nWorries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.\nTensions seemed to relax over the weekend.The WSJ reportedlate Sunday that \u201cChina and the U.S. have quietly started negotiating to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.\u201d Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that he\u2019s\u201ccautiously hopeful\u201dthat China will reach a deal to avoid tariffs.\nShares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\n\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\n\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\n\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\n\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.\nInvestors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.\nPerhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\nFroma CNBC interviewwith Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:\n\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d\nMr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to aWSJ articlereporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.\nInvestors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozurshowedthe depth of the divide there.\nMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\n\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d\n(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)\nStill, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.\n\u2014Peter Eavis\nThe stockis down 6.5 percentMonday morning as the Federal Trade Commissionconfirmed that it has openedan investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.\nAlso on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\nFacebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.\nTo put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\nDespite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings,according to Bloomberg.\nThe Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government shouldtighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:\n\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nApple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deletedSpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to\u201cstep up to the mark\u201dand be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting howadvertisers want more transparencyabout performance. (Users also complained that the Android app trackedcalls and text messages.)\nMeanwhile, Facebook took outfull-page adsin several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.\nElsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that aCanadian data company linked to Cambridge Analyticahad played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa Maydemanding an investigationinto what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.\nAndrew\u2019s take\nMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.\nAs for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.\nElsewhere in privacy:Growing calls for privacycould seriously dent the business model of ad-supported internet. Federal law enforcement officials are renewing apush for a legal mandatethat would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.\nThe activist investor\u2019s fund, Third Point,has built a positionin United Technologies,according to an antitrust filing.\nHe is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackmantold CNBCthat his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor.\nContext\nAt a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies,said the company was thinking of splitting up:\n\u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201d\nShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.\nGebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.\nIn rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.\nKnauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.\nBerkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG,according to the filing. The optionwould be exercisableonly if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.\nFrom Reuters:\nThe option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.\nThe $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.\nShares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.\nWith Sears Holdings increasingly desperate in its efforts to stay afloat, the company\u2019s C.E.O. gave his first in-depth interview in roughly 15 years to William D. Cohan ofVanity Fair. Mr. Lampert spoke about his past successes and his current travails as the head of the troubled retailer. (Mr. Cohan also spoke with Renaldo Rose, the man who spearheaded the kidnapping of Mr. Lampert in 2003.)\nThe money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\n\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\nA bonus quoteon Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s college roommate and a director of Sears before becoming Treasury secretary, from Mark Cohen, the former C.E.O. of Sears Canada:\n\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201d\nAfter a Friday that saw the markets sink amid fears of a trade war, the U.S. and China are holdinghigh-level talks to defuse tensions, the WSJ reports. Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing\u2019s economic czar.\nAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\nMr. Mnuchin told\u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of a trade war, but that\u2019s not our objective.\u201d\nNews of the talks havelifted marketsin Asia and Europe, while S.&P. 500 futures jumped this morning. It will also undoubtedly ease the fears ofC.E.O.s,economistsandforeign leaders and allieswho have openly fretted about the prospect of a trade war. A sample quote, from Larry Fink of BlackRock: \u201cThe world does not need a public fight in which we reduce future opportunities.\u201d\n\u2022 Stormy Danielstold \u201c60 Minutes\u201dthat she signed a nondisclosure agreement, for which she received $130,000, about an alleged affair with Donald J. Trump because she was worried about her safety and that of her daughter. \u201cLeave Trump alone,\u201d a stranger told her in 2011. Readthe NYT profileof her from this weekend.\n\u2022President Trump decided not to addJoseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing to his legal defense team in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.

Saturday\u2019s marches could make gun controla potent issue in the midterm elections. And the U.S.\u2019s broad support for gun controlhas many nuances.\nThe media mogul spoke to Maureen Dowd ofthe NYTabout: President Trump (not a fan); the current state of the media business (bullish on Netflix, bearish on Hollywood); and cloning his late dog, Shannon (he did it). Here\u2019s what he had to say about workplace misconduct:\n\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\n\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201d\nBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201d\nThe ride-hailing giant finally sealed a deal tosell its Southeast Asian businessto the (SoftBank-backed) Grab in exchange for a stake in its competitor. Like the sale of its Chinese and Russian businesses, this gets Uber out of a costly fight as it readies for an I.P.O. next year. But does this mean that Uber is also set to leave other competitive markets,like India?\nOn self-driving cars: Even before a pedestrian was killed in Tempe, Ariz., Uber wasstruggling with its autonomous vehicle efforts, needing human intervention nearly every 13 miles on average in Arizona tests. Those technical issues made being an operator of Uber\u2019s carsvery stressful.\nElsewhere in tech:Amazon is collecting local taxes, but several citiesaren\u2019t seeing a dime.
