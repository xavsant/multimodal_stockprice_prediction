        "title": "Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer",
        "fulltext": "COPENHAGEN \u2014 At first blush, Margrethe Vestager\u2019s decision to investigate Apple\u2019s planned acquisition of the music-identification app Shazam seems fairly minor, at least by her standards. As Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.\nButwhat interests Ms. Vestager about the transactionis not the amount of money at stake, but the amount of data. In a rapidly expanding information economy, she believes the control of data is a new regulatory frontier.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data \u2014 how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \u201cWhat will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\u201d\nIf not a household name in the United States, Ms. Vestager, 50 and a native of Denmark, is perhaps the world\u2019s most famous (or infamous,depending on where you stand) regulator. She has spent the past four years investigating American tech firms, finding them wanting and ordering them to pay billions of dollars in fines and back taxes.\nHer rulings against Apple, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm have positioned the European Union, rather than Washington, as the world\u2019s de facto Big Tech regulator \u2014 and established Ms. Vestager as an international regulatory celebrity, if such a thing is not an oxymoron. She helped to inspirethe lead character in a Danish television series. Crowds flock to hear her speak.\n\u201cEurope is acting to enforce antitrust laws where the U.S. is not,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, who feels that American regulators dropped the ball when they decided not to pursue a case against Google in 2013 (Yelp is a longtime Google antagonist). \u201cIronically, many of the complainants in the E.U. antitrust case against Google are U.S. companies, pursuing justice in Europe precisely because the U.S., has not acted,\u201d he said in an email.\nWhile Ms. Vestager\u2019s global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.\nThough a long shot, Ms. Vestager isamong the potential contendersfor president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. It is the most powerful job in the bloc \u2014 one never held by a woman, or by someone with her public profile.\nHer appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.\nCritics of Ms. Vestager include leaders of American tech companies who have crossed her and who take issue with both her approach and her facts; Republicans in Congress; some members of the Trump administration;the Wall Street Journal editorial board; and groups likethe Business Roundtable, a conservative-leaning, pro-business collection of American chief executives.\nApple is especially aggrieved. In 2016, Ms. Vestagerordered Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros in back taxes, or about $15.5 billion, saying that the company had illegally received a tax break that was not available to others. Apple has begun paying the money into an escrow account, but both the company and Ireland have appealed the decision. They say it ignores how much tax Apple has already paid to Ireland, misrepresents the tax rate the company is subject to there, and reflects either a willful misreading or an ignorance of tax law.\nCritics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\n\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.\nBoth Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief, have traveled to Brussels to argue their cases in person, apparently in vain. Last June, Ms. Vestagerfined Google \u20ac2.4 billion, or about $2.8 billion, after concluding that it had unfairly used its search engine to favor its services over those of its rivals. It was the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history, and more than double similar fines levied by the United States.\nLast May, shefined Facebook \u20ac110 million, or about $131 million, after concluding that it had misled the European authorities about its acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp. And in January, shefined the American chip maker Qualcomm \u20ac997 million, or about $1.2 billion, saying it had abused its market dominance to shut out competitors.\nFor the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.\nAs the top European official enforcing competition laws, Ms. Vestager has primarily concentrated on how a range of companies use, or abuse, their market dominance. But she has also emerged as a major voice of warning about the effect of tech firms on our habits, our privacy, our ability to make human connections and even democracy itself. (Europe has a new data privacy lawthat is to take effect May 25.)\n[Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.]\n\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\nHe added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d\nAppearing last November at a tech summit meeting in Lisbon, Ms. Vestager wasinterviewed onstage by Kara Swisher, host of the Recode Decode podcast, as about 15,000 people looked on. Many in the audience were young techies who greeted the commissioner with something like euphoria, particularly when she declared that \u201cwe need to take our democracy back\u201d from social media.\n\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d\nOther jurisdictions are following Europe\u2019s regulatory lead. Brazil, among other countries, has begun an antitrust case against Google, and one of the search giant\u2019s Brazilian competitors said last summer thatit would use the European argumentsin its own lawsuit. And in November,the state of Missouri opened an investigationinto whether Google violated the state\u2019s antitrust and consumer protection laws.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.\nShe was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)\nTrained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)\nShe entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.\n\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.\nAs for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201d\nMs. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.\n\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201d\nHer party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.\nShe made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201d\nIn 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.\nMs. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\nLately she has been thinking about power \u2014 what it is, who has it, how it is used \u2014 after reading the historian Mary Beard\u2019s latest book, \u201cWomen and Power.\u201d \u201cThe #MeToo movement can be maybe the most important catalyst for decades in doing that,\u201d Ms. Vestager said. \u201cIt tears down our understanding of power.\n\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts",
        "fulltext": "Republican candidates have pretty much stopped talking about their party\u2019s only major legislative achievement under Donald Trump, the 2017 tax cut. Ads touting the tax law have largely vanished from the airwaves. But the Koch brothers \u2014 big boosters of the cut and among itsbiggest beneficiaries\u2014 haven\u2019t given up.\nTheir latest move: spending $20 million to mobilize an army of salespeople who aregoing door to doortrying to disabuse voters of the perception that the tax cut was a big giveaway to the wealthy, offering little to ordinary working families.\nBut they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut, and who doesn\u2019t, are accurate, a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback.\nTo be fair, the notion that a big tax cut for corporations \u2014 which was the main element of last year\u2019s law \u2014 might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn\u2019t crazy. But the two key words here are \u201cmight\u201d and \u201ceventually.\u201d\nThe story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations, Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity, driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages.\nAnd for a little while Apple seemed to be following the script:Back in Januarythe company announced that it would be bringing most of the $252 billion in cash it was holding abroad back to America.\nBut what does \u201cbringing money to America\u201d mean? Apple didn\u2019t have a huge, Scrooge McDuck-style pile of gold sitting in Ireland, which it loaded onto a homeward-bound ship. It has digital claims \u2014 a bunch of zeros and ones on some server somewhere \u2014 which in effect used to bear a label saying \u201cthis money is in Ireland.\u201d Now it has changed the label to say \u201cthis money is in America.\u201d What difference does this make?\nWell, it alters the company\u2019s tax liabilities to the U.S. and Irish governments, which was the point of the change. But otherwise it makes no difference at all.\nWhat would make a difference would be if Apple chose to spend more on actual stuff: hiring more workers, building new structures, installing more equipment. But it isn\u2019t doing any of these things. Instead, this week it announced that it\u2019sbuying back$100 billion of its own stock, which is good for stockholders but does nothing for workers. Lots of other companies are doing the same thing.\nAnd while many Americans own some stocks, the great bulk of stock value is held by asmall, wealthy minority\u2014 10 percent of the population owns 84 percent of the market. So the perception that this is basically a tax cut for the rich is right.\nBut why aren\u2019t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers?\nOne answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run, it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn\u2019t as global as all that \u2014 the investment world, we might say, is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy, and even in the long run it can\u2019t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return \u2014 which means more for stockholders and less for workers.\nAnd at a deeper level, tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from.\nIn the world according to Trump officials, or right-wing think tanks like theTax Foundation, corporate profits are basically a return on physical capital \u2014 on bricks and mortar and machines. Cut taxes, and companies will add more physical capital, increasing competition for labor, and profits will go down while wages go up.\nApple, however, is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position \u2014 its brand, if you like. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist; what matters is that given its position, it can and does charge what the market will bear, pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes, it gets to keep more of its profits, but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by, say, building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks.\nAnd these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it; there are still businesses \u2014 say, trucking companies \u2014 whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic \u201crents,\u201d profits not tied to physical capital, are a big, growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents, there\u2019s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty, even in the long run.\nThe bottom line \u2014 which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise \u2014 is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is, in fact, a big giveaway to wealthy investors."

        "title": "Apple Says It Will Buy Back $100 Billion in Stock",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since Apple said in January that it wouldbring back most of the $252 billionit held abroad under the new tax law, investors have wondered what the company would do with the enormous cash pile. On Tuesday, those investors learned that they are in line for a big chunk of the money.\nApple said it would buy back an additional $100 billion in stock, by far the largest increase in its already historic record of returning capital to investors. The company didn\u2019t provide a timeline for the repurchases. Apple also increased its dividend by 16 percent to 73 cents a share, pushing past Exxon Mobil to become the largest dividend payer, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nApple\u2019s stock buyback fits intoa broader trend of companies using the financial windfallfrom President Trump\u2019s tax cut to reward shareholders. Share buybacks, which are reaching record levels, are great for investors, including executives and employees, because they reliably lift stock prices by limiting the supply of shares for sale.\nBut critics say the actions can take money away from potential investments in hiring or research and development, and can increase economic inequality because they typically benefit wealthier people.\nInvestors should want companies to reinvest in themselves and their employees versus repurchasing their own stock to increase the share price, said William Lazonick, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who studies stock buybacks. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.\u201d\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that Apple was making significant investments in hiring, research and development, and manufacturing, \u201cbut we also have a very, very profitable business.\u201d\nHe said that \u201cbecause we\u2019re making all the right investments all around the company, it makes perfect sense for us not to keep the cash on our balance sheet but return it to investors.\u201d\nNo company has ever done stock buybacks like Apple. In the most recent quarter, Apple repurchased $23.5 billion in stock \u2014 the largest single stock buyback ever and more than the market value of 275 of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nApple said Tuesday that it had now returned $275 billion to shareholders since 2012 and that it planned to finish its previous stock-buyback program in the current quarter, about nine months early.\nIn March, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat,introduced legislationthat would restrict companies\u2019 ability to buy back stock, though the bill has little chance of passing.\nOther academics and investors cheered Apple\u2019s continued returns to shareholders.\n\u201cPeople like to believe the stories that C.E.O.s do things to boost the short-term stock price and line their own pockets,\u201d said Alex Edmans, a finance professor at the London Business School. \u201cBut if you look at hundreds of examples, you find that stock buybacks do increase long-term value.\u201d\nHe said that companies typically bought back stock only when they had extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise, and that investors would spend that money elsewhere.\nApple said its profit increased 25 percent to $13.8 billion in the most recent quarter on the back of strong revenue growth for iPhones, the Apple Watch and its services business. Apple earned $2.73 a share, it said, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion.\nThe three months ending with March were Apple\u2019s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone, the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs, including the financial results of Apple\u2019s suppliers, that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple\u2019s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result.\nApple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price \u2014 driven by the $1,000 iPhone X \u2014 helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hit back at the notion that the iPhone business, which accounts for 62 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, had little room to grow. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the view that the market is saturated,\u201d he said.\nInvestors have also worried that Apple\u2019s influence in China, the company\u2019s No. 2 market, is waning amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals. But Apple\u2019s results suggest that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for the pricier iPhones. Apple said revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion, the largest increase in 10 quarters.\nAnd Apple\u2019s services revenue, which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales, rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion. Apple said consumers had paid for more than 270 million subscriptions for its services or ones sold via its App Store, up from roughly 170 million a year earlier."

        "title": "Why a Trade War With China Isn\u2019t \u2018Easy to Win\u2019 (Slightly Wonkish)",
        "fulltext": "At this point, it\u2019s looking as if Trump\u2019s tough talk on China trade will turn out to be as empty as his tough talk on, say drug prices. Faced with the prospect of actually going toe to toe with powerful interests \u2013 as opposed to doing harm to desperate immigrants, poor people who need health care, etc. \u2013 Trump keeps backing down, ignominiously. But what happened to all that bluster about trade wars being \u201cgood, and easy to win\u201d?\nI can think of four reasons Trumpran away:\n1. Someone actually managed to explain the economics to him, and he realized that the trade war wasn\u2019t actually a good idea\n2. He just lost his nerve, as he consistently does when confronting people who aren\u2019t powerless\n3. He was bribed, with China offering sweet deals to his personal business interests\n4. The Chinese also have some kind of tape\nIt tells you a lot about the state of American leadership that (1) is highly implausible, while 2-4 all seem quite possible. And this means that what I\u2019m about to say may amount to overthinking the issue.\nStill, I think there are some good reasons why even a crude mercantilist looking at the China situation might conclude that this particular trade war isn\u2019t nearly as easy to win as it might appear at first glance.\nOn the surface, the U.S. would appear to very much have the upper hand in any trade confrontation. After all, last year we onlysold China$130 billion in goods, while they sent us $500 billion. So they have a lot more to lose, right?\nWell, it\u2019s not as clear as all that. You need to look at the realities of modern trade. And when you do, the story looks quite different. It goes without saying that Trump is wrong about the economics of bilateral trade imbalances. But he\u2019s also wrong about thepolitical economy, which isn\u2019t the same thing.\nAdmittedly, the political economy of trade is kind of mercantilist, because it\u2019s driven largely by producer interests. Long ago I wrote about \u201cGATT-think\u201d, the view of trade, enshrined in international negotiations, that sees exports as good, imports as bad, so that letting someone sell us stuff, even if it\u2019s better and cheaper than we could make ourselves, is a \u201cconcession.\u201d The genius of the postwar international trading system was that it harnessed this special-interest reality, using the ambitions of exporters to offset the protectionism of those competing with imports, to engineer a kind of enlightened mercantilism that vastly expanded world trade.\nBut GATT-think needs some modifying in an era of complex international value chains. Even if producer interests predominate over consumer interests, what producers should care about is not how much they export but how much income they derive from exporting. That is, they should care about \u201cincome at risk,\u201d not \u201cexports at risk.\u201d These numbers can be very different, and in the case of US-China trade they are.\nConsider the over-used but still illuminating case of the iPhone, which is assembled in China out of components made all over the world. That final assembly accounts for only3 to 6 percent of the manufacturing cost, but the whole price of an iPhone shipped from China to America is counted as a Chinese export. If I\u2019m doing the numbers right, this means that China exports around $17 billion worth of iPhones to America each year, but Chinese producers account for only around $1 billion of that.\nSmartphones are an extreme case, but there\u2019s a lot of that sort of thing. The income China derives from exports to the US is probably not much more than half the face value of those exports. There\u2019s a bit of the same thing going on in the other direction \u2013 US aircraft, for example, contain quite a few foreign components \u2013 but it\u2019s much less extreme.\nWhat this means, in turn, is that even if we only focus on narrow producer interests \u2013 even if we take a mercantilist view \u2013 US-China trade is a lot less lopsided than it seems, which in turn means that the pain from a trade war would be a lot less asymmetric than the raw trade numbers might suggest.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Apple sells those iPhones for considerably more than it costs to import them from China. This adds a whole additional chunk of US income at risk to the bilateral trade relationship. True, given time Apple could probably find other suppliers \u2013 but not right away, and not easily. Foxconn wasn\u2019t built in a day.\nOverall, it\u2019s still probably true that China would be hurt worse than the U.S. in an all-out trade war. But the pain wouldn\u2019t be at all one-sided. And it\u2019s possible, I guess, that Trump dimly recognized that reality, or at least noticed that his beloved stock market really doesn\u2019t like trade war talk.\nActually, I\u2019m still betting that it\u2019s a bribe and/or some kind of tape. But worth talking through, anyway."

        "title": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing",
        "fulltext": "Good Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\n\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\n\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\n\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.\n\u2022 On the earnings calendar: Tesla, where Elon Musk will faceplentyofquestions.\nGet this in your inbox each morning. Sign uphere.\nTesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.\nNow, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.\nWhile reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.\nCash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.\nIn its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.\nBut the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.\nAnalysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.\n-- Peter Eavis\nTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.\nBut Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.\nHere\u2019s a look at the numbers:\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\n\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019snegative free cash flow increasedto about $1 billion in the first quarter, up from $277 million during the fourth quarter of last year.\n\u2022 The company had $2.67 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, compared with $3.37 billion at the end of December.\nThe music streaming firm\u2019s first results as a public company disappointed investors.Reuters reports:\nShares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.\nHere\u2019s a look at the numbers:\n\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\n\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\n\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\n\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\n\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\n\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\n\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.\nThe Trump administrationis considering executive actionto further restrict the sale of Chinese telecommunications equipment in the United States,\nWhat is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\n\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\n\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.\nThe order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\n\u2022 In March, the Federal Communications Commissiontook action to block broadband companiesthat receive federal subsidies from buying equipment from suppliers that are deemed a risk to national security.\n\u2022 In April, the Commerce Departmentbarred ZTE from purchases of American technologyfor seven years, saying that the company failed to punish employees who violated sanctions.\n\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.\nAs expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.\nThe central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.\nPerhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\n\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\nThe Fed uses the word \u201csymmetric\u201dto emphasizethat its goal is to prevent inflation running persistently above or below 2 percent. Put another way, investors should not see a 2 percent inflation rate as a level never to be breached. Indeed, on Wednesday, investors appeared to view the Fed\u2019s use of \u201csymmetric\u201d as a signal that the Fed was willing to allow inflation run above the 2 percent level for a period. Ward McCarthy, the chief financial economist at Jeffries, wrote:\n\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201d\nApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.\nApple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.\nApple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.\nApple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\nRepurchasing $100 billion worth of sharesshould use a lot of Apple\u2019s famous $252 billion cash hoard. But it isn\u2019t an investment in R.&D. or hiring, and it disproportionately affects wealthier stockholders rather than most people.\nThe buybacks aren\u2019t coming at the expense of U.S. investment or job-creation, Apple says. (Its C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said Apple was indeed investing, but that didn\u2019t mean it should keep extra cash on its balance sheet.) But there\u2019s a pattern of American companies using their tax windfallsto reward investorsrather than to expand.\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: The amount sounds like a lot, but Apple has a huge stock market value, and investors are now used to buybacks.\nHow Apple\u2019s business looks:Pretty good. Higher iPhone prices helped. And services revenue is growing strongly.\nMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.\nBut investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.\nHere\u2019s what to watch:\n\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\n\u2022 Are risks to the economy increasing? Fed officials are broadly optimistic about the strength of the economy, but a fewhave noted that there are some risks on the horizon for growth\u2014 most notably a potential drag from atrade dispute with other nations. Growing concerns about these risks would likely to be taken by the markets as evidence that the Fed will not deviate from its plan to raise rates gradually.\nAmazonhas reportedly made an offer to buya 60 percent stake in India\u2019s leading online retailer Flipkart, according to CNBC affiliateCNBC TV-18. Amazon\u2019s offer would set up a potential bidding war with Walmart, whichthe NYT reportedlate last month was nearing a deal to acquire a 60 percent stake in Flipkart. The deal would value Flipkart at about $20 billion, the NYT reported.\nThe stockis down more than 18 percentafter Snap\u2019s revenue, profit and daily average users all fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates.

        "title": "Telegram App Says Apple Is Blocking Updates Over Dispute With Russia",
        "fulltext": "Apple was thrust into the middle of a long-simmering dispute on Thursday between the encrypted messaging app Telegram and the Russian government, which has sought to shut down the service since it declined to help Moscow intercept communications sent through its platform.\nPavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, accused Apple of refusing to allow the messaging service\u2019s software to be updated globally after Russian authorities ordered the iPhone maker to remove Telegram from Apple\u2019s App Store. The appran afoul of the Russian authoritiesfor refusing to cooperate with the country\u2019s security agencies.\nThe allegation from Mr. Durov is significant because it undercuts the importance that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has placed on privacy and encrypted communication, and adds to criticism that the company too easily acquiesces to the demands of governments in important foreign markets. Last year, Apple agreed to Chinese government rules toremove appsfrom its App Store that allowed users to avoid the country\u2019s online censorship through virtual private networks.\nThe compromises contrast with Apple\u2019s dealings with authorities in the United States. In 2016,Apple was taken to courtfor refusing to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation gain access to encrypted messages sent by one of two attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\u201cRussia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users\u2019 communications to Russia\u2019s security agencies,\u201dMr. Durov said in a statementposted to his official Telegram channel. \u201cWe believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, Apple didn\u2019t side with us,\u201d he continued.\nA Russian national, Mr. Durov left the country in 2014 after he lost control of Vkontakte, Russia\u2019s popular rival to Facebook. In 2013, he founded Telegram, selling it as one of the few remaining ways to communicate while avoiding the intelligence services. The app was particularly popular in Russia andIran, where it has also beenblocked. In March, the company said Telegram had reached 200 million active daily users.\nMr. Durov said that while Russia accounted for only about 7 percent of Telegram\u2019s user base, Apple\u2019s move had effectively barred it from updating software for all of its users worldwide since mid-April. He said that had meant Telegram was also unable to fully comply withnew privacy rulesput in place in the European Union last week.\nAn Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Durov\u2019s statement.\nThe situation highlights the messy gatekeeper role that Apple plays, with its App Store acting as the main way people can download apps, along with Google\u2019s Play store. Apple finds itself caught between the interests of encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal, which want to prevent anybody from intercepting communications between users, and governments, which want access to messages to identify security risks and other issues.\nThe Russian authorities have repeatedly said Telegram is a threat, claiming that extremists use it to coordinate their efforts. Russian human rights activists and many otherwise apolitical users, however, saw the move as an attempt by the Kremlin to curtail freedoms and as only the first step in a broader plan to introduce online censorship.\nThousandsrallied in central Moscowat the end of April to protest the shutdown.\nThe Russian government\u2019s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has been trying to block Telegram since the end of April, when a Moscow courtcleared the wayfor it to do so. The agency went to court after the app refused to share its encryption keys with the Russian security services.\nSo far, the attempts to shut Telegram down have been clumsy, with the app remaining available on many devices in Russia, including some that began to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to hide their geographic location from authorities.\nIn order to hinder access to the app, Russian authorities took the unusual step of shutting down entire segments of the Russian internet. Many small organizations, including language schools and museums,have been blocked as collateral damage."

        "title": "Goldman Sachs and Apple Plan to Offer a New Credit Card",
        "fulltext": "One company has a devoted customer base teeming with wealthy, well-traveled young adults. The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers.\nNow they\u2019re trying to join forces.\nApple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing.\nThe product would be Goldman\u2019s first credit card offering and could help the bank\u2019s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant\u2019s digital payment service.\nThe two companies have been talking for months and haven\u2019t settled on all the details, said one of the people.\nAndrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment.\nThe partnership was reported earlier on Thursday byThe Wall Street Journal.\nThe new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come.\nThe card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer.\n\u201cThis seems to make sense,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, \u201cIt\u2019s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer finance business.\u201d\nPart of Goldman\u2019s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times.\nApple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products.\nIt was unclear what, if any, benefits the new card would give consumers. But adding the Apple Pay branding would be a change. Appleintroduced Apple Pay in 2014as a way to pay for everything from a sandwich to a laptop with the wave of a smartphone instead of the swipe of a card. In effect, users upload their credit- or debit-card information to Apple and then use their iPhone, Apple Watch or other Apple products to pay for goods in stores or online. Apple takes a small cut of each transaction.\nApple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple\u2019s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don\u2019t yet accept digital payments, the person said.\nThe research firm Loup Ventures estimatedlast year that just 13 percent of active iPhones had activated the service. And Apple Pay isn\u2019t even the most popular mobile-payment service. It faces stiff global competition from Samsung Pay and Google\u2019s Android Pay, as well as Alibaba\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay in China.\nGoldman, too, would face a crowded field, where competitors have recently learned that making money from credit card loans isn\u2019t easy. JPMorgan Chase reported a$200 million lossfollowing the introduction of its Sapphire Reserve card, after customers rushed to take advantage of a generous sign-up bonus that accompanied it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,\u201d said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. \u201cThe Apple Barclays card isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to turn that person\u2019s head, in terms of making them want to get a card. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what these two brands can do to create something that might make more of a splash.\u201d"

        "title": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 Facebook and Google are under the microscope for the ways their technologies can spread misinformation, while Amazon\u2019s growing market power is a regular target of President Trump. And Apple pioneered the modern smartphone, a device increasingly seen astoo addicting.\nThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.\nAmong the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.\nOn Monday, the conscientious side of Microsoft was on display again at Build, a three-day conference for developers in Seattle. Mr. Nadella announced a program, A.I. for Accessibility, that will award $25 million over five years to researchers, nonprofits and developers who use artificial intelligence to help people with disabilities. Mr. Nadella, whoseadult son was born with cerebral palsy, has written about how his son\u2019s disability helped make him more empathetic.\nEchoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.\nBut while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\n\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201d\nSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.\nTwo decades ago,Microsoft was depicted as a bullythat ran roughshod over competitors in a landmark antitrust suit brought by the federal government, followed by similar cases brought by the European Union and private companies. Mr. Smith was brought in to make peace in Microsoft\u2019s antitrust battles, and Mr. Nadella was the company\u2019s first chief executive to start in the job since those suits were settled.\nIn a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\nThis year, Microsoftpublished a bookthat outlined some of the harmful effects that could come from artificial intelligence, such as bias in job recruiting. It has litigated four lawsuits against the United States government over the past five years in efforts to defend customers\u2019 privacy rights. One of them, a fight over law enforcement access to data stored in an overseas Microsoft data center,went to the Supreme Court, which dropped the case after Congress enacted a law that mooted it.\n\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201d\nThe closest analog among Mr. Nadella\u2019s peers is Tim D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who has painted Apple as a staunch defender of its customers\u2019 privacy. He has jabbed atFacebookandGoogle, both advertising-supported businesses that profit from the personal data they collect from their users, a contrast to Apple\u2019s business model of selling devices.\nFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.\nMr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.\nMr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.\nMicrosoft is still occasionally cast in the role of villain. A California man who sold recycled electronic waste recently pleaded guilty for creating thousands of unauthorized discs that helped people restore the Windows operating system on refurbished PCs. The recycler, who has been sentenced to 15 months in prison,has said Microsoft supported the caseagainst him, which was brought by federal prosecutors, because he threatened part of its business. Microsoftpublished a long blog postthat portrayed his actions unfavorably.\nStill, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\n\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.\nMr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\n\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple once had grand aspirations to build its own electric self-driving car and lead the next generation of transportation. Over time, the tech giant\u2019s ambitions ran into reality.\nSo Applecurtailed its original vision, first by focusing on software for self-driving cars and then by working solely on an autonomous shuttle for its own use with employees. Now, the tech giant has settled for an auto partner that was not its first choice.\nIn recent years, Apple sought partnerships with the luxury carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz to develop an all-electric self-driving vehicle, according to five people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But on-again, off-again talks with those companies have ended after each rebuffed Apple\u2019s requirements to hand over control of the data and design, some of the people said.\nInstead, Apple has signed a deal with Volkswagen to turn some of the carmaker\u2019s new T6 Transporter vans into Apple\u2019s self-driving shuttles for employees \u2014 a project that is behind schedule and consuming nearly all of the Apple car team\u2019s attention, said three people familiar with the project.\nApple\u2019s deal with Volkswagen, which has not been previously reported, and the failure of its talks with other automakers reflect the continuing travails and diminished scope of the company\u2019s four-year-old car program.\nThe project has suffered fromrepeated changes in directionthat have hurt morale and led to hundreds of departures from its peak of more than 1,000 members two years ago, five former Apple employees said. They added that the project lacked a clear plan beyond the vans, including any near-term commercial goals.\nThe fits and starts have most likely put Apple even further behind in the race toward the self-driving future. Waymo, the self-driving business spun out of Google, as well as start-ups and some carmakers have been testing various autonomous vehicles on public roads for years. Some of the programs have hit hurdles \u2014 Uber on Wednesday said it wasshutting down its self-driving operations in Arizonaand laying off about 300 employees in the area \u2014 but many have already gathered extensive data on autonomous driving patterns to improve their technology.\nApple declined to comment.\nApple originally began its car project \u2014 known internally as Titan and T172 \u2014 in 2014. At the time, Apple planned to build a single vehicle that would upend society and industry, in what would be the automotive version of the iPhone. The company set to work on an electric driverless car with a lush interior reminiscent of a lounge or living room, where passengers face one another instead of the road, according to two early employees of the project.\nApple enlisted software programmers, automotive engineers, rocket scientists and the industrial-design team of Apple\u2019s design chief, Jonathan Ive, to reimagine the car. They entertained a series of unconventional concepts, including augmented-reality or holographic displays embedded in windshields and windows, a sunroof made of a special polymer that reduces heat from the sun, and windows with adjustable tints \u2014 like those on Boeing\u2019s new 787 Dreamliner jets.\nTwo former Apple employees also recalled how their colleagues built a model of a sport-utility vehicle with four seats facing one another, which some employees tested by sitting inside, similar to a designMercedes advertised in 2015.\nAs recently as 2016, Apple planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build research and development labs around its Cupertino, Calif., campus, including a machine shop and labs for electric car batteries, according to interviews and documents about the plans viewed by The New York Times.\nMembers of the car project soon found that even designing and building fundamental parts of a new car was not simple. Apple initially intended to build the car in-house, with preliminary discussions of an Apple automotive plant in the south of the United States, two former employees said. But those plans quickly shifted to finding a manufacturing partner to build \u2014 but not design \u2014 the cars.\nTwo former employees said Apple\u2019s requests of partners gradually evolved. At first, the company asked for help building an Apple-designed vehicle. Then, it began asking potential partners to provide foundational car pieces like the chassis and wheels. Eventually, Apple requested that potential partners retrofit their own vehicles with Apple\u2019s sensors and software.\nIn late 2015, Apple bought two Lexus S.U.V.s and hired a Virginia firm called Torc Robotics to retrofit the vehicles with sensors, a project known internally as Baja, one former employee said. The fleet has grown, and California regulators have authorized Apple to use 55 such S.U.V.s to run self-driving tests on public roads, the most of any company in the state after General Motors \u2014 but still fewer than Waymo has across six states.\nBut Apple did not partner with Lexus, and it has long sought a formal partner. The company first worked with Magna Steyr, a Canadian-Austrian contract manufacturer that has produced low-volume vehicles for other automakers, like theMercedes G-Wagen, according to two former employees. A few dozen Magna Steyr employees joined Apple\u2019s car team in California but gradually left after the partnership ended.\nBMW was long Apple\u2019s top choice, given its focus on high-end but mainstream products, former employees said. Many Apple executives, including the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, also drive BMWs. Mr. Cook visited BMW as early as 2014 to discuss a partnership, and those on-and-off negotiations continued for years. But a person close to the talks said any deal now appeared dead because both Apple and BMW wanted to own the customer experience and relationship.\nApple\u2019s other favored choice was Mercedes-Benz, internally code-named Bruce, according to one former employee. The two companies held partnership talks for more than a year, said three people familiar with the discussions. But those negotiations were halted because of similar disagreements over control of the experience and data, said one person close to the talks.\nApple also met with Nissan in Japan, BYD Auto in China and sports-car maker McLaren in Britain, among other companies, one former employee said. None of the talks resulted in a deal because either the automaker was reluctant to give up control to Apple or Apple was holding out for a more attractive partner.\nLate last year, Apple found that partner in Volkswagen. Buffeted by a scandal aroundcheating emissions tests\u2014 and lagging some rivals in development of self-driving cars \u2014 Volkswagen jumped at the chance to work with Apple, former Apple employees said. Volkswagen\u2019s code-name at Apple is Jetstream, one of them said.\nNow, at a lab near Turin, Italy, run by a Volkswagen subsidiary called Italdesign, the companies plan to remake Volkswagen\u2019s T6 vans as electric self-driving shuttles, these people said.\nThe frame, wheels and chassis of the T6 vans will remain, but Apple is replacing many components, including the dashboard and seats, said two people familiar with the project. Apple is also adding other computers, sensors and a large electric car battery, they said. The shuttles will ferry employees between two of Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley campuses, and will include a driver behind the wheel to take control if needed, as well as an operator in the passenger\u2019s seat tracking the van\u2019s performance.\nExecutives leading Apple\u2019s car project had told Mr. Cook that the shuttle would be completed by the end of 2018, but that deadline will be missed, one former employee said. It is unclear whether Apple\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen will extend beyond the shuttle."
