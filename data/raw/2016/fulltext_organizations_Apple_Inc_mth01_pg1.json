        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: A Not-So-\u2018Basic\u2019 Shift in Start-Ups",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad:Hey Mike, welcome to mysquad! See what I did there? This week, our friends at The Wall Street Journal publisheda handy dictionary of slang terms used by millennials. I thought I\u2019d try out some of these \u201ccool-kid\u201d words in our newsletter. That\u2019slit, right?\nMike:I\u2019m still not calling you mybae.\nFarhad:O.K., on to this week\u2019s tech news, which was pretty minimal actually \u2014 the January doldrums are upon us. A few small items: Anthony Foxx, the United States transportation secretary,announced an initiative to streamline rulesfor self-driving cars, a move that pleased many auto and tech companies that had been critical of the patchwork of state regulations around robot cars.\nAnd Grindr, the app for gay men to find fun nearby,sold a majority staketo a Chinese gaming company.\nMike:What kind of fun? Like amusement parks? Skee-Ball?\nFarhad:Um, no. And there were some headlines about Apple:The Financial Times reportedthat Apple\u2019s new streaming service, Apple Music, had acquired 10 million subscribers in its first six months. Spotify has at least twice as many paying users \u2014 and it has 75 million users total, counting its free tier \u2014 but Apple seems to be catching up. Also,BuzzFeed reportedthat Apple was altering its iAd business, a system for app makers to run ads in their apps, which had always been a tiny business for the company. Apple will no longer employ an ad sales staff for the system, Buzzfeed says \u2014 instead iAd will become an automated platform. The upshot: Apple is not an ad company, and it never will be.\nAlso, the Nest thermostat, the epitome of Internet-connected home devices,suffered a major glitch recentlythat plunged people\u2019s homes into the ice age. That is what you get for relying on robots, I say. That\u2019s why I heat my house with garbage fires.\nMike:You heat your house with your tweets?\nFarhad:Har-Har. Speaking of which, let\u2019s talk about start-ups. Foursquareraised another $45 million, as you wrote. And shares of GoPro, the sports-camera company that went public in 2014,fell to an all-time lowafter the companyannounceddismal holiday sales and layoffs of 7 percent of its staff.\nIf you ask me, the start-up scene sounds sobasicrn. But what do you think?\nMike:Well, if by \u201cbasic\u201d you mean boring, I disagree. But for a different reason than you might think.\nI feel that the theme of start-ups of this era is the evisceration of old industries, particularly in the logistics and service economies, aided by new technologies. Uber is perhaps the seminal harbinger of that change; take one well-entrenched industry (taxi and livery service) with a corner on the market and no need for innovation. Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea. Repeat.\nSo while things like food delivery or on-demand office cleaning or whatever are certainly not as world-changing and attractive as robot monkey butlers, it is pretty much par for what Silicon Valley stands for: the destruction of the old in the name of efficiency and expediency.\nFarhad:Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that not only is someone working on robot monkey butlers but that they will be attractive robot monkey butlers? Take my money!\nMike:I\u2019m being serious! These new start-ups come with a whole bunch of other problems. Who are we serving? Who gets hurt? And who are the real winners? These are the questions I am constantly asking myself and others. And those questions certainly deserve to be asked instead of waved off in the name of some nebulous idea of progress.\nAnd that, my basic friend, is what is interesting to me: those being marginalized while the death and rebirth of new industries are widely celebrated by a handful of people in a small enclave of California. (I also like the technologies themselves, some of the time, at least.)\nBut I am curious as to what would not bore you right now. What sort of start-ups are you looking for? What more do you want than on-demand booze and cookies?\nFarhad:Oh, I think you have the wrong idea. I did not mean that the start-ups themselves were boring. I actually agree that these logistics companies could in fact be pretty world-changing.\nWhat I do think is pretty basic right now is the start-up financing scene. A year ago, the market looked crazy. Venture capitalists were funding anything that moved, and unicorns were everywhere. Then, in the fall, a gloom fell over the market, and it seemed we were headed for some kind of bust.\nNow, though, something different is happening \u2014 things have slowed down, and everyone seems kind of O.K. with it. Foursquare\u2019s effort was a \u201cdown round,\u201d meaning its new valuation is lower than its old one. On Friday, Jawbone, the fitness-device start-up,said it had raised $165 millionin an investing round that valued the company lower than investors thought it was worth in 2014. These are probably the first of many down rounds we will see. But its investors say Foursquare\u2019sbusiness is thriving. It has set its sights lower than in its high-flying early days, but the new vision is more realistic and plausible. It all sounds so \u2026 sensible. It\u2019s neither a bubble nor a bust; it feels like business as usual. Or, as the angel investor Jason Calacanissaid in a blog post this week, the bubble has been successfully \u201cdeflated.\u201d\nThis new reality sounds good for the start-up environment. But for those of us covering it, a \u201ccontrolled deflation\u201d does not make for a juicy story. It is not one that will make you go,yassss!\nMike:I really hope my midlife crisis does not come in the form of testing a faddish horrible vernacular. I would prefer hair plugs and a Ferrari.\nAnyway, I think you discount the fiscal irresponsibility of many 20-somethings given millions of dollars. Sometimes venture capitalists pray they are funding the next Facebook, and end upgetting a Clinkle.\nThat is to say, there will certainly be spectacular flameouts to come. And they will not be lit, as it were. Ugh, why did I say that?\nFarhad:It\u2019s because you\u2019rethirsty, my friend. You\u2019re just so thirsty. See you later."

        "title": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine",
        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.\nIt\u2019s true that in anearnings reporton Tuesday, after weeks of speculation by Wall Street that iPhone sales would finally hit a peak,Apple confirmed the news: IPhone sales grew at their lowest-ever rate in the last quarter. And the company projected total sales of as much as $53 billion in the current quarter that ends in March, which would be a decline of 8.6 percent from last year and Apple\u2019s first revenue drop in more than a decade.\nBut if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.\nIt\u2019s necessary to start with these caveats because people have a tendency to react strongly, almost apoplectically, to any suggestion of weakness on Apple\u2019s part. Like pickles, cilantro and Ted Cruz, Apple inspires extreme opinion. The doubters are now ascendant. Apple\u2019s share price has fallen more than 11 percent over the last year, in stark contrast to gains by theother four American tech giants.\nSo this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.\nCould it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worrying about Apple in 2015 or Apple in 2016,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst who runs the siteStratechery, and whoquestioned Apple\u2019s far-off future in a recent piece. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the arc of Apple from 1976 to Apple in 2046. The iPhone era has been the pinnacle of everything that Apple does best. Anyone fretting about Apple right now is totally overstating it. But if I look out 10 years, 20 years, each of Apple\u2019s advantages starts to fade.\u201d\nI\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).\nApple\u2019s iPhone business is now so huge it sounds almost fantastical \u2014 Apple books more revenue from the iPhone (about $154 billion in its last fiscal year) than Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard or IBM generate from all of their operations.Two-thirds of the world\u2019s countrieshave gross domestic products smaller than annual sales of the iPhone.\nYet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.\nThe primary criticism of Apple\u2019s recent performance is that it\u2019s doing too much, and as a result, thegeneral quality of its products has slipped. Related to that is the notion that Apple has lost some of its innovative and design magic. It has put out a larger-than-usual number of features and products that have failed to thrill reviewers. As Gizmodo put it in a headline summing up 2015, \u201cEverything Apple Introduced This Year Kinda Sucked.\u201d\nApple stilldoes noteworthy new things, but I can understand Gizmodo\u2019s frustration. TheApple Watch is a work in progress. Apple Music and Apple News feel awkward, far less pleasant than dedicated music-streaming and news apps that have long been available in the app store (like Spotify and Flipboard). The Apple TV offers little I couldn\u2019t get on other devices, and its remote is heroically unfriendly. And 3D Touch and Live Photos, the new features in the latest iPhone, are nice but not groundbreaking.\nBut there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.\n\u201cMost of these critics are those who spend most of their time in this world of Apple analysis, so of course they\u2019re hypersensitive to their devices,\u201d said Horace Dediu, a fellow at the Clayton Christensen Institute, a think tank, and an analyst who follows Apple at his site,Asymco.\nMr. Dediu said customer satisfaction data showed continuing love for everything Apple sold. Almost everyone who has purchased an Apple Watch loves it. The same is true for iPhones and iPads.Apple\u2019s crash logs showthat its software isn\u2019t getting buggier, contrary to what heavy users might think. \u201cAnd people have short memories \u2014 they forget that the first iPhone was also full of bugs, that things in the past weren\u2019t perfect,\u201d he said.\nMr. Dediu is one of a chorus of analysts who argue the iPhone is far from its peak. With incremental improvements to the device\u2019s interface and capabilities, Apple can add more than enough to keep people hooked to its devices. He calls the current peak in sales a \u201clocalized peak\u201d \u2014 a blip from which Apple will soon emerge. In a piece last fall,I echoed this theorythat the iPhone can\u2019t lose;so has Mr. Thompson.\nBut if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201d\nApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.\nGiven all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.\nThe basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?\nThese are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.\nBut ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry."

        "fulltext": "Q.WhenI migrated from iPhoto to Photos for OS X on my Mac, all of my iPhoto Events were converted into albums and buried in a parent folder called iPhoto Events. This makes reaching them very time-consuming. Is there a way to move all these old events into the main Albums tab?\nA.Apple\u2019s upgradelast year from its olderiPhotoprogram toPhotosfor OS Xmade a number of changesto the way pictures were organized on the Mac. In addition toiPhoto Events\u2019 becoming albums within the iPhoto Events folder, certain types of iPhoto Smart Albumsmay be missing or look different. The Photos app alsoconvertsstar ratings and flags into searchable keywords.\nWhile certain changes from the iPhoto-to-Photos conversion cannot be reversed, you can at least dig out and move your old iPhoto Events groups from their new location and put them with the rest of your albums. One way to move just a few events (typically cataloged by date) out of the iPhoto Events folder is to start by clicking on that folder in the Photos sidebar; if you do not see the sidebar on the left side of the Photos window, go to the View menu and choose Show Sidebar.\nThe main part of the window now displays all the groups in the iPhoto Events folder. From there, you can click and drag the thumbnails for separate events out of the iPhoto Events window and put them in the sidebar under Albums so that they show up with the rest of your collection.\nFrom the sidebar, you can also click the triangle next to iPhoto Events to reveal all the subfolders within it, and then drag specific events up the sidebar and drop them under the Albums heading. If you would prefer not to display the sidebar in your Photos program, or want to move all the items out of the iPhoto Events folder at once, you can do that too.\nClick the Albums tab and open the iPhoto Events icon to reveal all your old events on the screen. Press the Command and A keys on the keyboard (or choose Select All from the Edit menu) to highlight all the events. Next, right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) and choose \u201cMove [Number] Albums Out Of \u2018iPhoto Events\u2019\u201d to transfer everything out of the folder and into the Albums view. If you do not want to move all the events at once, you can also hold down the Command key while clicking specific events, before right-clicking (or Control-clicking) the batch to get the menu with the Move option."

        "title": "Daily Report: The Tech News Cycle is About to Ramp Up",
        "fulltext": "Just 11 days into 2016, it has already been a busy period fortech news\u2014\n                                        and that\u2019s about to ramp up further.\nThis Thursday is the official kickoff of the tech earnings season, with Intel scheduled to report financial results. The chip maker\u2019s report will be followed by those from other tech giants \u2014 Apple, Facebook\n                                        and Microsoft among them \u2014 over the next few weeks.\nThe results will be closely scrutinized. For Apple and Amazon, the earnings will reflect the demand they saw over the crucial holiday sales quarter. Any positive news will likely send the companies\u2019 stocks up\n                                        after they tumbled last week in the first trading week of the year. And some of the financial results will be used as report cards on turnarounds \u2014 yes, Jack Dorsey at Twitter and Satya Nadella at Microsoft,\n                                        that means you.\nPerhaps the most closely watched earnings this time around will be Yahoo \u2014 and it won\u2019t just be for the numbers. Last year, Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, announceda plan to spin off the Internet portal\u2019s core businessafter facing pressure from activist investors. At the time, Ms. Mayer promised to reveal more details about the plan during the company\u2019s next earnings report.\nAmong the next steps may be layoffs,writes Vindu Goel. Morale among employees at the company\n                                        has sunk and there is plenty of churn in the work force. To stem the tide of departures, Ms. Mayer is having to offer retention bonuses, writes Mr. Goel. So Yahoo\u2019s earnings report will have implications\n                                        for more than just investors in the onetime Silicon Valley web pioneer."

        "title": "On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 for journalists to whine about International CES, the annual consumer electronics show that brings gadget-hounds and billionaires like a nerdy plague upon Las Vegas this week. As many have complained \u2014yours truly included\u2014 CES long ago devolved into a noisy parade of puffed-up announcements that usually amount to nothing.\nBut if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that\u2019s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We\u2019re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn\u2019t quite ready.\nIt\u2019s not that today\u2019s tech is terrible \u2014 lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d autonomous cars and drones \u2014 into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays.\nBut that future will take a few years to pan out. In the meantime, you can expect to be bombarded with early versions of tomorrow\u2019s tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete. Welcome to Prototype World, a brief intermission in your regularly scheduled program of disruption, during which everything new will more or less stink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the junior high years in technology,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re in those awkward teenage years where everything looks and feels funky.\u201d\nOver the next couple of CESes, there\u2019s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won\u2019t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place.\n\u201cIt will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it\u2019s not there right now,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.\nIt\u2019s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what\u2019s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We\u2019re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology \u2014 the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation.\nVenture capitalists are eager to see these trends continue. Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Union Square Ventures, told me he was paying close attention to opportunities for mobile devices and social networks to alter health care, finance and education.\nHunter Walk, of the firm Homebrew, echoed this idea. \u201cIt may be true that there\u2019s not a consumer-tech phenomenon that breaks through this year, but the cascading wave of tech goodness from mobile isn\u2019t close to being done when we look at this other part of your life called work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not bored.\u201d\nI take his point; we in the press are often quick to become bored and demand the next great thing. And yet, what can I say? I am kind of bored. Even if smartphones and social networks have lots of room to grow before conquering the world, they feel like old, mature tech. This is an industry that moves on anticipation of the next great thing. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles and wearable computers are the building blocks of tomorrow\u2019s great tech cycle. The trouble is, the cycle is just getting started.\nTo understand what it\u2019s like to live in Prototype World, considerApple\u2019s current hiccups. As Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote recently,2015 was Apple\u2019s \u201cyear in beta\u201d\u2014 a year in which the company released a bunch of new stuff that fell short of the usual dazzle. The most obvious example was Apple Watch, a device that every reviewer said hada lot of potential, but in its current form felt a bit kludgy. If only the watch were faster, smaller and did more.\nBut how will Apple get there from here? Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years \u2014 smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn\u2019t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won\u2019t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You\u2019ll just have to wait.\nSimilar hurdles await every other next-gen buzzword. Take virtual reality. After years of promise, some observers are calling 2016 the year that virtual reality goes mainstream. The CES floor is littered with goggles that promise to fly you into worlds more interesting than your own. Oculus, the Facebook subsidiary,began taking ordersfor its much-anticipated Rift headset on Wednesday.Microsoftsays that itsHoloLens\u2014 which technically is closer to \u201caugmented reality\u201d than \u201cvirtual reality,\u201d but potato-potahto \u2014 will also be ready soon. A decade from now, we may well look back on 2016 as the year virtual reality turned the corner from a futuristic novelty into a mainstream possibility.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll enjoy virtual reality in 2016. According to the graphics-chip maker Nvidia,your computer will most likely not be able to support most virtual reality devices. Even if you\u2019re able to get them up and running, the first devices will be underpowered and expensive. The goggles might make you nauseated or give you a headache, and doctors are still figuring out the deeper ways thatsimulated reality may affect your psyche. As with new video game consoles or media formats, you can expect most of the initial virtual reality content to be lackluster or unsavory (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that). Don\u2019t discount the time it will take everyone to learn how to use virtual reality \u2014 and the time it will take app makers to create software that conforms to how people begin to use it.\nSimilar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don\u2019t make you tear your hair out.\nAll this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.\nThat\u2019s a good vision to keep in mind as you struggle, over the next few years, to get anything to work as it should."

        "title": "Try to Interview Google\u2019s Co-Founder. It\u2019s Emasculating.",
        "fulltext": "I started as The New York Times\u2019s Google beat reporter in August 2014. Shortly thereafter, I told the company\u2019s public relations people that at some point I would love to interview Larry Page, the company\u2019s co-founder. I\u2019ve been waiting ever since.\nMr. Page is a fascinating character who has changed the world a few times over and is worth tens of billions of dollars. But he makes little time for the press. He rarely grants interviews, and, when he does, they are usually limited to staged events like TED.\nThat presented a big hurdle while I reported on aprofile of Mr. Pagefor Sunday\u2019s paper. He declined several requests for comment on my article, as did a good number of past and present Google employees who have worked closely with him.\nBefore we go any further, I want to say loud and clear that I don\u2019t think Mr. Page or any other business leader has a responsibility to talk to the press. He is a busy man and his media shyness probably should not be confused with reclusion. Mr. Page is visible at Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus and regularly talks to the company\u2019s 60,000 employees there and around the world (via videoconference), during the company\u2019s weekly T.G.I.F. gatherings.\nBut companies are run by people, so it is extremely difficult to understand Google without understanding Mr. Page. If you can\u2019t talk to the man himself, the next best thing is to talk to people who have worked with him.\nAs I reported the story, two things kept surfacing. The first was that a number of recently departed Googlers told me that after they gave notice, Mr. Page personally asked them to stay. They said that, during these conversations, he honestly laid out his concerns and aspirations for the company and its future.\nThe second thing was that as I reported the profile \u2014 as well as other technology stories \u2014 I kept meeting scientists and other researchers who had bumped into Mr. Page at Google\u2019s various academic and scientific gatherings.\nWhat these groups had in common was candor. They provided a glimpse, though narrow, into how Mr. Page thinks about technology and Google, which recentlyreorganized into a holding company called Alphabet. The profile I wrote was hardly an expose, but it helped me \u2014 and therefore helped Times readers \u2014 get a better understanding about Mr. Page and his company, which has moved far beyond search into self-driving cars, space travel and biotechnology, among other areas.\nWhenever someone asks me what I do at The Times, and I tell them I cover Google, the result is often a confused stare. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\nNot really. Our technology group tends to work thematically, meaning that we try to focus on how tech is changing our readers\u2019 work and personal lives. Google is the main focus of my reporting, and it is a brutally competitive beat. It takes me an hour to go through the day\u2019s headlines each morning, and there are dozens of competitors and talented journalists on the tech beat. That means I\u2019m often scooped, and the scrum of daily news can make it hard to see the bigger picture.\nIt\u2019s worth it, though. There\u2019s a strong argument that Google is now the most important company in the world. It is worth $500 billion and is neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company by market capitalization. Six Google products have more than one billion users. I use Google to research stories, I email my editors through Gmail, and I use Google Maps to go to meetings.\nGoogle\u2019s power is unparalleled and partly explains why it and other giant technology companies have faced a bit of cultural backlash in the wake of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents about government spying.\nGoogle\u2019s omnipresence is such that it is often hard for me to get away from work. For example, a few weeks after Mr. Page announced the formation of Alphabet, the author Jonathan Franzen published \u201cPurity,\u201d his fifth novel. I read the book for fun, but, as often happens on the Google beat, it quickly turned into work.\nOne of the main characters in Mr. Franzen\u2019s novel is Andreas Wolf, a hacker who has exposed secrets about the East German Stasi and the United States nuclear arsenal, but, during one fictional exchange, refused to publish leaks from two Google employees for fear that the company might use its search engine to tar Mr. Wolf\u2019s reputation.\nI emailed Mr. Franzen, via a publicist, to see if he might be willing to tell me what kinds of real-world concerns led to that imaginary exchange.\n\u201cThat paragraph came out of the distance between what the N.S.A. was collecting in terms of metadata, basically the Snowden leak, a relatively paltry amount of data compared to the rather large amounts of data we are willingly giving up \u2014 or unwillingly giving up by clicking the \u2018I accept the terms box\u2019 \u2014 to these very powerful corporations,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd my feeling is, you look around at who is powerful in the world now, and, yes the U.S. government still has drones and a nuclear arsenal \u2014 it has some might \u2014 but in terms of power over people\u2019s daily lives, I think it\u2019s shifted to the private sector.\u201d\nLater, he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate always to resist concentration of power in the hands of too few. There is bound to come a point where that becomes dangerous.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s power is predicated, of course, on the enormous volume of information at its disposal. Its competitors, as I noted in myprofile, have accused the company of abusing its dominance in the search space to steer consumers to Google services over theirs, and the European Commission seems to agree.\nBut Mr. Page has also used his own power \u2014 through an unusual share structure, he and co-founder Sergey Brin control the company outright \u2014 to isolate himself from Wall Street\u2019s demands. In the 16 years I\u2019ve been covering business I have met countless C.E.O.s who describe their jobs in almost academic terms, using phrases like \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to dodge questions about what kind of role their company has to society.\nIn public comments, Mr. Page goes out of his way to say the opposite, describing Google more in terms of a nonprofit than a gigantic corporation. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, he said he wished there were a vehicle for people to donate money to their company so that it could be used for projects that had some kind of social purpose.\nThese are some of the ideas I tried to get at in the article, but of course I would love to have included an interview with the man himself. There is a popular image of reporters as a pack of pushy cold callers who will stalk anyone to get their story, and while that is true at times, I can tell you from experience that it is really awkward and emasculating to try to interview someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk. You feel like a big dork.\nIn total, I have encountered Mr. Page three times for a total of five minutes or so. Once was at an off-the-record gathering where nothing interesting happened, and another was at a press event where he politely shook my hand before heading in another direction.\nThe other time, I was at Google\u2019s Mountain View campus, talking to an executive, when Mr. Page rode up on his bike to say hello to his employee. I introduced myself as a New York Times reporter and he immediately pedaled away.\n\u201cThat went well,\u201d the executive said.\nIt\u2019s not always the most flattering work, but I do believe it\u2019s important."

        "fulltext": "Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all delved into virtual and augmented reality technology. NowAppleis dipping a toe into the space too.\nApple recently acquired an augmented reality start-up called Flyby Media and hired Doug Bowman, who ran the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech and who has researched topics such as immersion in virtual environments.\nAn Apple spokesman confirmed the Flyby deal and said, \u201cApple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.\u201d The acquisition and the hire wereearlier reportedby The Financial Times.\nVirtual and augmented reality are growing fields in the technology industry. Supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, have said virtual reality is the next big platform after mobile. The technology, which can make users feel transported by immersing them in different environments, has the potential to transform games, movies, social networks and work. Almost $4 billion has been invested in virtual reality start-ups since 2010, according to PitchBook, a research firm.\nDeveloping virtual and augmented reality technology is about creating \u201cthe next operating system,\u201d said Linc Gasking, co-founder and chief executive of 8i, a company that creates virtual reality software. \u201cApple currently owns the computer in your pocket, and it needs to be part of the next big user interface if it wants to retain that ownership.\u201d\nFacebook bought the virtual reality headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. Microsoft hasdemonstrated its HoloLens device, which is focused on augmented reality, a related technology that lets people wearing smart glasses or headsets see and manipulate digital objects in the real world. And Google is the biggest outside investor in Magic Leap, a secretive start-up that is developing a wearable device for mixing real and digital images.Google\u2019s Cardboard glassesalso let people watch virtual reality video on their smartphones.\nApple has not, until recently, been publicly enthusiastic about virtual reality. While it has made tiny acquisitions in the field, it has not made a deal as large as Facebook\u2019s Oculus purchase and has not brought any hardware to market.\nNow rivals are delivering products to consumers. In addition to Google\u2019s Cardboard, an inexpensive product that has been on the market for months, Facebook plans toship its $599 Rift headsetin March. Facebook\u2019s partner Samsung is already selling a more rudimentary $99 headset, theGear VR.\nApple has filed dozens of virtual reality-related patents in the past, including one in 2008 for a head-mounted display apparatus. The patent illustration shows a large pair of glasses that can hold an iPhone, and it looks much like Google\u2019s Cardboard.\nMatt Miesnieks, who is setting up an augmented reality-focused venture capital fund, said Apple had also been meeting with \u201cadvanced optics\u201d start-ups, referring to the lens that a viewer looks through. Apple currently lacks such technology, he said.\nIn a phone call with analysts to discuss Apple\u2019smost recent quarterly results, the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was asked about virtual reality. He said he thought the technology was more than a niche.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt has some interesting applications.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday announced an overhaul of its efforts to respond to online propaganda from the Islamic State after months of acknowledgments that it had largely failed in its attempts to counter extremist recruitment and exhortations to violence on social media.\nThe administration has emphasized that it needs the assistance of some of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies, and a group of top White House and national security officials flew to California on Friday to plead their case with executives.\nIn a reflection of just how urgent the White House considers the efforts, the discussions involved officials like Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Lisa Monaco, the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser. They met with Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google.\n\u201cGiven the way the technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting began in California.\nA task force will be created in the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to coordinate the government\u2019s new effort. The State Department announced the creation of a center to respond to disinformation from extremist groups by highlighting their misdeeds and creating positive images of the West. It hopes to cultivate a global network of governments and nongovernmental organizations to help the effort.\nAfter the terrorist attack last year that killed 130 people in Paris, President Obama delivered a series of speeches seeking to reassure the country while demanding rapid changes within the administration to improve responses to jihadist propaganda.\nMr. Obama has been speaking for some time about the need for the West to more effectively counter the austere and apocalyptic pronouncements of Islamist extremists. At the United Nations in September, he toldworld leadersthat \u201cideologies are not defeated with guns; they are defeated by better ideas \u2014 a more attractive and compelling vision.\u201d\nBut the State Department has largely foundered in its efforts to fashion the kind of war room that would effectively counter the propaganda flowing out of the Islamic State, which is widely seen as adept at using social media to recruit and inspire followers.\nFor help with these challenges, the administration turned on Friday to Silicon Valley. \u201cI do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.\nThose executives, however, are in charge of global corporations whose revenues are increasingly derived from people outside the United States. The executives have long pushed back on demands by governments to censor posts, provide access to user accounts, or hand over the keys to encryption technologies.\nIf the companies begin to work with the government to monitor and remove posts or create antiterrorism counternarratives, they might have a harder time resisting similar requests from foreign governments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?\u201d said Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy in Technology, a think tank.\nShe said the consequence could be an erosion of trust by consumers. That erosion of trust began in the wake of revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who showed previous coordination among some technology companies with American surveillance efforts. Executives are eager to avoid a repeat.\nThere is also the technological challenge of sifting through vast amounts of user-generated content in different languages on a growing number of platforms.\nLaw enforcement officials for years have expressed frustration that technology companies are increasingly creating products like smartphones with encryption technologies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to monitor conversations. But the discussion on Friday, while touching on encryption issues, was expected to focus largely on how social media companies could more effectively police their platforms.\nSome former top administration officials now work at prominent technology firms, including Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, who is now a senior vice president at Amazon. Megan Smith, the administration\u2019s chief technology officer, who worked at Google, and Alexander Macgillivray, the administration\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, who worked at Twitter, both attended the meeting on Friday in California.\n\u201cThis meeting is the latest in the administration\u2019s continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism,\u201d said Melanie R. Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department."

How do I move my iTunes library and photos to a new computer, and is there a way to still burn music discs for the car?\nA.Apple\u2019s OS X software includes a program calledMigration Assistantto transfer user accounts, files and settings from one Mac to another. To use the program, you need a way to connect the two computers. You can link them over the same wireless network or over a wired Ethernet network. Since most new Mac laptops do not include Ethernet ports these days, you can either invest in an adapter thatconverts a USB port(or one of thenewer Thunderbolt portson some Mac laptops) to an Ethernet port; MacBook models with the singleUSB-C portmay need aUSB-C to USB adapteras well.\nIf your Macs haveports in common, like Thunderbolt, you can hook them together with the appropriate cable. And, as another data-transfer method, if you use Apple\u2019s Time Machine backup software with an external drive,you can use it to move your filesfrom the old Mac to the new one.\nOnce you get your iTunes library and the rest of your files moved to the new Mac laptop, you need to find a compatible external CD/DVD drive to connect to it so you can resumeburning music playlists to disc. Apple recommends its ownUSB SuperDrivefor use with iTunes andmany of its Mac models, but itadmits that some third-party drives also work. Third-party CD/DVD drives, like those from LG Electronics and Samsung, are often less expensive, but check the hardware specifications to make sure the drive is compatible with your new laptop and Apple\u2019s currentOS X 10.11operating system."

        "title": "Siri, Alexa and Other Virtual Assistants Put to the Test",
        "fulltext": "WHEN I asked Alexa earlier this week who was playing in theSuper Bowl, she responded, somewhat monotonously, \u201cSuper Bowl 49\u2019s winner is New England Patriots.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s last year\u2019s Super Bowl,\u201d I said. \u201cEven I can do better than that.\u201d\nAt the time, I was actually alone in my living room. I was talking to the virtual companion insideAmazon\u2019s wireless speaker, Echo, which was released last June. Known as Alexa, she has gained raves from Silicon Valley\u2019s tech-obsessed digerati and has become one of the newest members of the virtual assistants club.\nAll the so-calledFrightful Fivetech behemoths \u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,FacebookandGoogle, now part of Alphabet \u2014 now offer virtual assistants, which handle tedious tasks in response to voice commands or keystrokes, on various devices. Apple\u2019s Siri is the best known, having been available since 2011, but Microsoft now has Cortana, Facebook is testing one called M, and Google builds its voice assistant into its search apps.\nThese companies are presentingscorecards of their progresswith quarterly earnings reports in the next few weeks, so what better time to hand out report cards to their artificially intelligent assistants? With that in mind, I set up tests for the assistants and graded their abilities to accomplish 16 tasks in categories that most consumers generally enjoy: music, productivity, travel and commuting, dining, entertainment and interests like sports.\nIn the end, none of the voice assistants earned a report card that would make a strict parent proud. Here\u2019s how they stacked up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0.\n\u25a0 Google (Google) \u2014 3.1\n\u25a0 Siri (Apple) \u2014 2.9\n\u25a0 Cortana (Microsoft) \u2014 2.3\n\u25a0 Alexa (Amazon) \u2014 1.7\nApple was the strongest at productivity tasks like calendar appointments and email; Google was the best at travel and commute-related tasks. Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend\u2019s account. More on that later.\nApple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.\nSiri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.\nGoogle, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.\nWhen I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.\nOn travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.\nAlexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)\nFor food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.\nAs for special interests, I asked each assistant two fairly obvious questions: Who won this past Sunday\u2019s football games, and who will beplaying at the Super Bowl?\nGoogle, Cortana and Siri loaded scores for Sunday\u2019s National Football League games. But only Google and Cortana could say the Carolina Panthers would face the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, whereas Siri could only say that the big game would take place on Feb. 7 atLevi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Alexa, on the other hand, was as clueless about sports as I am: She couldn\u2019t answer either question.\nThat brings me to Facebook\u2019s elusive M assistant. The social network denied my request to meet her \u2014 it has grantedaccessto only a small number of testers \u2014 so I used a privileged friend\u2019s Facebook Messenger account to meet M. According to the company, M iscontrolled partly by artificial intelligenceand partly by humans; you talk to the assistant by sending messages to M through Facebook\u2019s Messenger service, just as you would send messages to a friend.\nIn my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).\nM pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201d\nM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\n\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\n\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.\nIn other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\n\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201d"
