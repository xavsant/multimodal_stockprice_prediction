        "fulltext": "That the Nasdaq composite index closed over 5,000 this week for the first time in 15 years is not just a reminder of the virtues of patience. It\u2019s even more a testament to the transformative power of capitalism.\nThe Nasdaq composite that peaked at 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, in what turned out to be the height of the technology bubble, bears little resemblance to today\u2019s Nasdaq index. Of the top 20 Nasdaq companies by market capitalization in 2000, only four \u2014Microsoft,Cisco Systems,IntelandQualcomm\u2014 remain in the top 20 today. Eight no longer exist as independent companies, most as a result of bankruptcy or acquisition, and several are shadows of their former selves. The current Nasdaq composite index has only about half as many companies as it did in 2000.\n\u201cJoseph Schumpeter was spot on when he said capitalism is all about creative destruction,\u201d said Richard Sylla, an economics professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and a specialist in the history of markets, referring to the Austrian-American economist who described the phenomenon in 1942 in \u201cCapitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\u201d\nIn the intervening 15 years, a new generation of entrepreneurs, newly public companies and entire industries have emerged and seized the dominant positions in the Nasdaq index even as their predecessors faltered.Apple, now the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, barely registered in 2000, and the first iPhone was not announced until 2007. Over a billion smartphones were shipped in 2014.\nGoogle, which now ranks third and dominates the market for Internet search advertising, went public in 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value then of $23 billion. Today, its market capitalization is over $360 billion, and its shares were trading this week above $570.\nFacebook, now No. 5 in Nasdaq\u2019s ranking, dominates social networking, another industry that did not exist in 2000. It went public less than three years ago, and is already valued at over $180 billion.\nHad the Nasdaq index itself not been transformed by innovation and competition, it would be nowhere near its previous peak. The stocks of many of the surviving companies, like Microsoft and Intel, have not come close to the levels they reached before 2000. That means investors who bought and held the stocks of individual companies in 2000, as opposed to broadmutual fundstied to the Nasdaq or index funds like the QQQs, are still underwater \u2014 a cautionary note for investors who try to pick individual stocks.\nMany investors have forgotten that the plunge in the Nasdaq that began in 2000 was no steeper than its rise in the late 1990s \u2014 a classic formation and bursting of an investment bubble, as a glance at a chart of the Nasdaq over the past 20 years makes clear. The plunge was so severe in large part because the index\u2019s steep rise resulted from not one, but two simultaneous bubbles \u2014 one in dot-com stocks and the companies that supplied them, the other in telecommunications.\nSome of the flashier companies that attracted the most absurd valuations were consumer Internet companies like Pets.com, WebVan and Urbanfetch. But investors were also whipped into a frenzy by the promise of wireless communications. Larger telecommunications companies likeJDS Uniphase,Juniper Networks, Sycamore Networks andPMC-Sierrahad far more impact on the rise and subsequent plunge in the index. All four were among the top 20 by market capitalization in 2000, ranging in size from JDS Uniphase ($44 billion) to PMC-Sierra ($33 billion). Sycamore, once a leader in routing Internet traffic, dissolved in 2013. The other three have market capitalizations today that are tiny fractions of their peak values.\n\u201cI never expected to see the Nasdaq at 5,000 again in my lifetime,\u201d said Jeffrey W. Smith, a Nasdaq managing director in economic research, and co-author of a paper called \u201cThe Nasdaq Composite Index, a 14-Year Retrospective.\u201d\nThe Nasdaq was up 15.67 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,982.81 on Thursday.\nNo one thinks the Nasdaq composite, or any other broad stock index, is in bubble territory today, despite the prolonged rally that began in 2009. \u201cToday\u2019s levels are justified by the fundamentals,\u201d said Paul Wick, who has lived through both boom and bust as portfolio manager of the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund, which he began managing in 1989.\nHe notes that the Nasdaq index trades today at a far lower price-to-earnings ratio than it did in 2000. \u201cThe biggest company in the index is Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cBy every yardstick, it\u2019s a great company and it\u2019s very modestly valued.\u201d\nProfessor Sylla suggested that investors, now twice burned by market plunges in 2000 and 2008, were far more cautious than in the late 1990s. \u201cThe dot-com bubble was just 15, 16 years ago, so just about everyone 35 or older, an age when people begin to have money to invest, remembers it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese folks have learned some lessons about bubbles, fortunately. So current valuations, while high by most historical standards, are more reasonable than they were 15 years ago.\u201d\nNevertheless, at the market\u2019s current elevated levels, he said, \u201ccaution is warranted.\u201d\nMr. Smith, of Nasdaq, said that as a group, Nasdaq companies today \u201care bigger, older and more mature,\u201d though still younger, on average, than those in the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the other leading market indexes.\nThey are also more diversified. Although the Nasdaq is often considered a proxy for technology companies, they now make up about 43 percent of the Nasdaq listings, down from nearly 65 percent in 2000, according to Nasdaq. Among the nontechnology companies ranked among the top 20 today are the biotechnology companies Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Celgene and Biogen Idec as well as the retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance, Costco, eBay and Priceline, and the coffee chain Starbucks.\nThat\u2019s not to say that what Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, characterized as irrational exuberance has vanished from today\u2019s markets. There are still companies that trade at stratospheric price-to-earnings ratios or have no earnings. Indeed, it\u2019s possible to construct an index of highflying stocks today that would not look all that different from the Nasdaq of 2000. Such an index might include the electric automaker Tesla (market capitalization $25 billion), the social messaging siteTwitter($30 billion) and the Internet real estate database Zillow ($6.5 billion) even though they lose millions of dollars a quarter.\n\u201cYou could argue that these are 2000-era stocks,\u201d Mr. Wick said. \u201cTo some degree, there are always people who are willing to roll the dice. They want to own companies that might be the next big thing, and they\u2019re just wired to take the chance that some companies might turn into that. They look at exponential revenue growth, and it\u2019s easy to imagine that somewhere down the road, they\u2019re going to be hugely profitable.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a different tone even with these highflying stocks, Professor Sylla said. \u201cUnlike in 1999, when adding dot-com to your name caused your company\u2019s valuation to soar, in these more mature, more sober times the recipe for stratospheric valuations is a promising product (Tesla cars) or fast-growing revenues and widespread product acceptance (Amazon), coupled with charismatic leadership.\u201d\n\u201cI think our markets are still doing what they long have done, namely financing entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo one can know the future, but the markets encourage investors to make bets on it and some of those bets pay off, for investors and buyers of innovative products. Wall Street is much more than the rich man\u2019s racetrack, as some have described it. It\u2019s what helps to move our economy and our standard of living forward.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple and Beats Developing Streaming Music Service to Rival Spotify",
        "fulltext": "In what would be the biggest change to its music strategy in years,Appleis pressing ahead with a sweeping overhaul of its digital music services that would allow the company to compete directly with streaming upstarts like Spotify.\nAlmost a year after agreeing topay $3 billion for Beats, the maker of hip headphones and a streaming music service, Apple is working with Beats engineers and executives to introduce its own subscription streaming service. The company is also planning an enhanced iTunes Radio that may be tailored to listeners in regional markets, and, if Apple gets what it wants, more splashy new albums that will be on iTunes before they are available anywhere else, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.\nIn a sign of how important Beats is in reshaping Apple\u2019s digital music, the company has made a musician a point man for overhauling the iPhone\u2019s music app to include the streaming music service, as opposed to an engineer. Trent Reznor, the Nine Inch Nails frontman who was the chief creative officer for Beats, is playing a major role in redesigning the music app, according to two Apple employees familiar with the product, who spoke on the condition they not be named because the plans are private.\nPerhaps most telling for Apple is what its new streaming service will not have: a lower price than rival services.\nAccording to several music executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private, Apple recently tried but failed to persuade record labels to agree to lower licensing costs that would have let Apple sell subscriptions to its streaming service for $8 a month \u2014 a discount from the $10 that has become standard for services like Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio.\nThat $2 markdown may be small, but Apple\u2019s failure to secure it reflects a shift in the company\u2019s relationship with the music industry. While Apple once enjoyed enormous negotiating power as the dominant force in digital music \u2014 an area it helped pioneer more than a decade ago with music downloads \u2014 it now faces an array of new competitors and finds itself in the position of needing to modernize its offerings to catch up to the streaming revolution.\nThat has weakened Apple\u2019s leverage \u2014 and the labels could not be happier about it.\nToni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said that Apple\u2019s apparent struggle over lowering the pricing of its music service now was a result of being late to the streaming game.\n\u201cThey\u2019re used to being a shaper rather than a responder,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cThis is one of the few times where Apple is playing catch-up and not necessarily coming from a position of strength.\u201d\nTom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment or make executives including Mr. Reznor available for interviews.\nApple\u2019s turn toward streaming is a matter of necessity, as listeners increasingly shift from music downloads to streaming. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, downloads generated $2.6 billion in revenue in 2014, down 8.5 percent from the year before. Streaming made $1.87 billion last year, and overtook CD sales for the first time.\nAs the biggest retailer of music, Apple remains a crucial marketing partner for the music industry. Yet its absence from streaming has let others get a head start. Spotify, which started in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States in 2011, said in January that it has 15 million paying subscribers around the world, as well as 45 million more who listen free, with advertising. (Apple\u2019s iTunes has more than 800 million customer accounts.)\nExactly how Apple will match Spotify is unclear. Music executives say they have not been shown a prototype of the new streaming service, nor been given much detail on it.\nThe new music app, which is a collaborative effort between Mr. Reznor and other Apple and Beats employees, including Jimmy Iovine \u2014 who founded Beats with the hip-hop star Dr. Dre \u2014 will feature the streaming music service with many of the same characteristics as the Beats Music streaming service, one Apple employee said. Those may include curated playlists and a more vivid visual appeal, while conforming to Apple\u2019s sleek and minimal design aesthetic, one person said. The name Beats Music will most likely be shed.\nAccording to an Apple employee, the service is being tested as part of a new version of the company\u2019s mobile software system, iOS, which has been given the code name \u201cCopper\u201d and is expected for public release this year.\nMr. Iovine has set the tone of the transformation of Apple\u2019s music plans, according to music executives. Mr. Iovine, who reports to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of software and Internet services, has been leading aggressive talks to secure prominent album releases that will be exclusive to Apple, akin to what Beyonc\u00e9 did when she released her self-titled album on iTunes in December 2013. One music executive involved in the negotiations described this part of the new iTunes as \u201cSpotify with Jimmy juice.\u201d\nA crucial difference for Apple\u2019s streaming service is that unlike Spotify, it will have no free tier. That has greatly pleased top executives at major music labels, who have begun to complain openly that so much free music has given consumers too little reason to pay for it.\nApple is also expected to overhaul iTunes Radio, the free service that the company introduced in September 2013 as a competitor to Pandora, and which has had little impact on the marketplace. One new player is Zane Lowe, a former BBC radio D.J. known as a trend-spotter. Last month he announced that he would join Apple in Los Angeles, where the Beats team is concentrated.\nMr. Lowe is expected to play a role reconfiguring iTunes Radio. Among the ideas that have been floated for iTunes Radio are a more geographically targeted approach that would bear some resemblance to a traditional radio station, with Mr. Lowe as the voice, music executives said.\nWhether or not Beats is a success, it would make just a small dent in Apple\u2019s overall business. Mr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein noted that if Apple\u2019s streaming music service were to make as much money as, say, Pandora, which generates roughly $1 billion in revenue a year, that amount would be only slightly more than half of 1 percent of Apple\u2019s annual $183 billion in revenue.\nBen Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said that the hope for online entertainment services like Beats is to add more hooks for people to keep buying Apple products. But a music service is just one potential lure among many others in Apple\u2019s offerings, like apps, movies and the iPhone\u2019s operating system.\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, this isn\u2019t trying to be the next big business,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said of Beats Music. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to be an evolution in their ecosystem that has many moving parts, not just one.\u201d"

        "title": "European Union Moves to Limit Special Tax Deals",
        "fulltext": "BERLIN \u2014 European Union officials on Wednesday proposed new rules to try to discourage tax-avoidance deals with multinational corporations, which critics say give some countries unfair business advantages.\nSome of the bloc\u2019s smaller countries, like Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, have offered the deals to attract the likes of Apple, Starbucks and Amazon. The companies, in turn, have saved huge sums on their corporate tax bills. But European Union authorities have been trying to curb that practice.\nThe legislation, proposed on Wednesday in Brussels by the European Union\u2019s policy-making arm, the European Commission, aims to dissuade governments from giving special tax breaks by forcing them to publicly disclose more tax information. If approved by member governments this year, the rules would oblige each of the bloc\u2019s 28 national tax authorities to share basic information on tax rulings each quarter, beginning in 2016.\nGovernments now share very little information, and member nations are loath to cede any of their sovereignty in that sphere. Those sensitivities limited the scope for more far-reaching proposals by the European Commission.\nStill, if the rules are passed, \u201cat least we know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said at a news conference in Brussels.\n\u201cObviously, we want Europe to continue to be attractive,\u201d said Mr. Moscovici. He said he expected the bloc\u2019s governments to agree to the measure without much resistance.\nMr. Moscovici said he could not give a figure for the total amount of tax avoided through these kinds of deals, but he said it was \u201ca lot of money.\u201d\nAs the special tax deals between big companies and some governments have come to light, they have generated public indignation. Many European citizens are still struggling economically after years of austerity policies aimed at lowering government debt and budget deficits. Officials in larger member states like France and Germany have criticized the deals as a form of unfair tax competition.\nThe proposal was immediately criticized by antipoverty groups like Oxfam International as too weak.\nAlain Lamassoure, a French member of the European Parliament, said the proposal should be merely \u201ca first step.\u201d He called for \u201cmaximum possible transparency\u201d so companies and members of the public can also assess the fairness of the deals.\nEuropean Union officials said they were not yet ready to go that far and first needed to assess whether broader disclosure requirements would discourage multinational companies from setting up, or expanding, operations in Europe.\nThe issue of aggressive corporate tax planning is politically awkward for the commission, whose president is Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr. Juncker was prime minister of Luxembourg for nearly two decades.\nThat country became the focus of scrutiny in November, when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalistspublished a reportaccusing more than 300 companies, including the Pepsi Bottling Group, Ikea and FedEx, of benefiting from preferential tax deals with Luxembourg.\nMr. Juncker has declined to recuse himself from taking part in the final decisions on the cases in Luxembourg.\nThe legislative push is separate from a series of investigations begun last year into the arrangements involving Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Amazon and a unit of the carmaker Fiat in Luxembourg. Those investigations are being led by the European Commission\u2019s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager."

        "fulltext": "I hate the new Apple Watch. Hate what it will do to conversation, to the pace of the day, to my friends, to myself. I hate that it will enable the things that already make life so incremental, now-based and hyper-connected. That, and make things far worse.\nThis has nothing to do with Apple. We can still be friends. I\u2019m writing on a MacBook Air, my constant companion since I kissed off my hometown Microsoft-programmed clunker for the sleek and far less needy Mac some time ago. I\u2019m closer to my iPhone 6 than to some of my siblings \u2014you never call, you never text, you never share,not a selfie in six months.\nNo, my animus for Apple\u2019s smartwatch \u2014 excuse me, wearable technology \u2014 is for what it will do to us. Things are too complicated as it is. At dinner with friends, or in a meeting that I\u2019m supposed to care about, when can I look at my phone? Who\u2019s phone-ignore worthy, and who\u2019s not? At what point is looking down rude? And how long into a conversation till all sides get to call a truce and take a screen dive?\nI say this as an information obsessive. I wish I could say recovering information obsessive. Like most of us, I\u2019m in need of digital detox, not a fresh hit. Those restroom breaks at restaurants were not about bladder relief. God knows how many times I\u2019ve sneaked away from the table just to peek at a football score, a \u201cDaily Show\u201d clip, a text, a photo or email, my Amazon book number. What a miserable wretch. But it could be worse: I have a friend who texts while skiing.\nApple says its smartwatch, which it rolled out at one of its Dear Leader-like events in San Francisco this week, will make interactions between human and screen less complicated, and less rude. Instead of reaching into pocket or purse in front of someone, the user will just glance at the wrist. In fact, Apple calls the new feature in which the watch is touched to access the Internet a \u201cglance.\u201d\nJust a glance, nothing rude there. Oh, really? Remember how off-putting it was when George Bush the elder checked his watch during a question period from the audience in a presidential debate? It may have cost him the election in 1992.\nPeoplecheck their phonesabout 150 times a day. Now, imagine how many glances they\u2019ll take with all the information in the world on their wrists. Imagine how many people will attempt to drive while glancing, to walk while glancing, to talk while glancing, to make love while glancing.\nTo the complaints that our smartphone addiction has produced a world where nobody talks much anymore, nobody listens and nobody reads, you can add a new one with the smartwatch: nobody makes eye contact.\nTim Cook, the Apple C.E.O., seems like a decent and likable guy \u2014 no tech overlord in a Darth Vader suit. But his presentation of the new watch on Monday creeped me out, and offered a road map to a world I\u2019m not sure I want to join.\n\u201cThe Apple Watch is the most personal device we have ever created,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just with you, it\u2019s on you.\u201d Ewwww. It sounds like a digital dog collar, complete with an anti-flea component. From here on out, there is no down time, and no excuses for reality escapes. You are connected, 24/7.\nCook tried to humanize Apple\u2019s latest culture-disrupter. You can talk to your wrist \u2014 it\u2019s a phone! You can check your heartbeat \u2014 it\u2019s a doctor! And if you don\u2019t adequately exercise during the week, your watch will remind you of your failure \u2014 it\u2019s a nag!\nHe seemed most rapt in describing how much closer together the Apple Watch will bring us all. \u201cYou can tap your watch and get your friends\u2019 attention,\u201d he said. Ah, there\u2019s a rich relationship. I can think of a number of places once considered off-limits for cellphone intrusions \u2014 the classroom, the dinner table, the bathtub \u2014 where the watch can interrupt. And who\u2019s to know: it\u2019s only a glance.\nThere is some evidence that heavy smartphone usemakes you dumber. The theory is that a having the world at the other end of a mobile search makes for lazy minds, while people who depend less on their devices develop more analytical skills.\nAdd to this concerns about privacy: that the watch is a tracking device, which sends all your personal information to a central database \u2014 a corporate control center that already knows far too much about the preferences and habits of smartphone users.\nIt\u2019s encouraging that smartwatches, thus far, have not sold very well. This could be because many of them look like those fluorescent wrist bands that people have to wear at all-inclusive resorts in order to line up at the buffet table. Or perhaps people are repulsed, as I am, by this most intimate of invasions.\nBacklash is inevitable. A few days ago, Patrick Pichette, Google\u2019s chief financial officer, announced that he was retiring because he wanted to spend more time offline. He hadthis epiphany, he wrote, while watching the sunrise from Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife \u2014 an experience Apple has yet to be able to meld to a wristwatch."

        "title": "Silicon Valley Leaders, New to Social Issues, Come Together Over Indiana Law",
        "fulltext": "The technology industry\u2019s leaders have found their collective voice on a social issue in the last week, rallying with great intensity against a new Indiana law that will allow businesses, they predict, to discriminate against gay couples. The heads of Apple, Salesforce.com, Yelp and Square have all publicly criticized the law, as have some leaders from other industries.\nBut on many other issues of the day that ignite strong passions \u2014 from race relations to income inequality to gun control \u2014 tech leaders are much quieter.\nThe contrast is a reminder of the balancing act happening in the executive cubicles of Silicon Valley. On the one hand, there is the dread that nearly every corporate leader has about taking strong stands on issues that might offend customers, partners and employees. On the other, there is the exuberance of an industry just learning to embrace its role as a cultural and business leader, one often animated by grandiose corporate mission statements about wiring the world and empowering people with information.\n\u201cSo many tech companies have embraced a mission that they say is larger than profits,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm. \u201cOnce you wrap yourself up in a moral flag, you have to carry it to the top of other hills.\u201d\nUntil recently, tech leaders have waded into political battles when there was a direct connection to their businesses, staking out positions on immigration reform, copyright legislation and Internet service regulation. Many of them write checks to finance candidates and ballot initiatives \u2014 to Democrats and progressive causes, more often than not.\nWith gay rights andsame-sex marriagethough, any remaining hesitation has vanished.\nOpponents of the law, signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, fear it will be used by business owners to refuse services to people participating in same-sex weddings. Governor Pence said on Tuesday that he wanted the lawchanged by the end of the week. A similar bill waspassed on Tuesdayby the Arkansas legislature.\nInan opinion articlepublished online on Sunday by The Washington Post, Timothy D. Cook, chief executive of Apple, declared, \u201cWith the lives and dignity of so many people at stake, it\u2019s time for all of us to be courageous.\u201d\nMarc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which has a significant presence in Indiana, canceled all company events in the state, and has exhorted others to follow suit on social media. But in an interview on Tuesday he said he had deliberately sought to make a business case \u2014 not a moral case \u2014 for his objection to the Indiana law.\n\u201cI\u2019m a C.E.O.,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a pastor or politician or a civil-rights leader.\u201d\nMr. Benioff said that he had emailed friends of his in tech to join him in opposing the law. \u201cWe\u2019re wading into territory none of us is comfortable in, which is social issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was crystal clear that, by all of us going in together, it was going to be O.K.\u201d\nThe last generation of tech leaders, including Steven P. Jobs of Apple, Andrew S. Grove of Intel and Bill Gates of Microsoft, were more focused on building their companies than on social issues, at least while they were running them, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.\n\u201cThe great success at companies such as Apple and Salesforce, in combination with more socially conscious C.E.O.s, has made it easier to speak out,\u201d said Professor Yoffie.\nTechnology companies are wellsprings of support for gay rights. The industry is centered in the San Francisco Bay Area, long a bastion of gay culture, and most large tech companies have large, active gay-employee groups. Mr. Cook, whoannounced he was gay last year, leads the most valuable company in the world.\n\u201cWhen it comes to gay rights, it\u2019s an easier topic to get into,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cGenerationally, the population is there with the C.E.O.\u201d\nWhile there is still vocal opposition to same-sex marriage from religious conservatives, the issue has quickly lost the divisiveness it once had. Most polls show 50 to 60 percent of the American public supports same-sex marriage, and hundreds of companies have urged the Supreme Court to strike down state laws banning such unions.\nTech executives who are not on board with same-sex marriage have found themselves out of a job. Last year, Brendan Eich, chief executive of Mozilla, a web browser maker, waspressured into resigningafter it emerged that he had donated $1,000 in 2008 to support a California measure banning same-sex marriage.\nTechnology leaders as a group have not shown the same kind of full-throated support for other social issues. In a joint statement, Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, who run the Kapor Center for Social Impact in Oakland, Calif., said Silicon Valley had done a commendable job of taking a stand against overt discrimination, including in Indiana. But the companies, they said, have been less effective at increasing the \u201cdismal representation\u201d in their work forces of other groups, including women and minorities.\n\u201cWe would like to see the same level of steadfast commitment and action with respect to the hidden biases that permeate the valley,\u201d they said.\nBig technology companies are taking steps to increase the diversity of their workplaces by encouraging more girls and minorities to study computer programming in school. They have only recently started to come clean on how far they have to go by publishing employment statistics under pressure from civil rights leaders like the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.\nThere is still a strong countervailing school of thought among tech leaders that Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, where the key to being rewarded is talent and hard work. The fault lines over that issue were further exposed by a gender discrimination lawsuit by Ellen Pao, who sued her former venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Ajury ruled against Ms. Pao\u2019s claimson Friday.\nTechnology leaders have been hesitant to inject themselves into broader discussions about race relations, even as the national debate over police treatment of black men became a national issue over the last year. One exception was Jack Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter and the chief executive of Square, an Internet payment company.

        "title": "In Chase of Apple, Smartphone Makers Shift Strategies",
        "fulltext": "BARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Big phones, small phones, cheap phones, expensive phones, curved phones \u2014 and all of them hoping to take a chunk out of theiPhone.\nMany of the world\u2019s top smartphone makers used the huge industry trade show held here this week, Mobile World Congress, to entice buyers around the globe.\nBut despite the conspicuous absence ofApple, its iPhone was the clear target of those announcements. And the iPhone seems unstoppable. A little over a month ago, in what is becoming a familiar pattern, Apple reported record iPhone sales, includingan 83 percent increase in sales in Chinaversus the same period last year. According to a report from Canaccord Genuity, an investment firm, Apple might earn as much as93 percent of the profitin the entire handset industry.\nSo, what does that leave for everyone else? A dogfight over scraps.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the kings of the hill,\u201d said Ben Wood, mobile and wireless analyst at the research firm CCS Insight, referring to Apple. \u201cThey are sustaining gravity-defying margins at a time when most other manufacturers are struggling just to break even. There\u2019s so little margin left for everybody else that it\u2019s just intensifying the competition.\u201d\nThat dynamic was clear at the show, where device makers were trying different strategies to separate themselves in the chase for second place.\nSamsung, probably Apple\u2019s strongest competitor, turned to its most iPhone-like devices yet. The new phones, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, have all-glass unibody designs, superhigh-resolution screens, fast processors and a focus on cameras, fingerprint technology and a forthcoming mobile payments service.\nThe phones look more polished and luxurious than previous Galaxy models. The strategy, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaws Research, just might revive Samsung\u2019s smartphone sales, which have recently trailed off.\n\u201cSamsung has had a great time selling into the consumer market until now,\u201d Mr. Dawson said. \u201cBut the challenge is that it\u2019s been charging iPhone-like prices for devices that have been nowhere near as special or different as the iPhone.\u201d\nBut even Samsung seems to acknowledge that might not be enough.\nLike many other companies at the conference this week, Samsung tried to push its devices as the best option for businesses. Samsung promoted its Knox service, which is basically an app that allows you to keep work apps and services separate from personal information on a single phone, and more than once suggested it was a phone that information technology managers would love.\nAgain, though, Samsung will be going into an area of strength for Apple.\n\u201cApple\u2019s already secured a substantial position in the enterprise,\u201d Mr. Wood said. Just last month, the Mobility Index Report from Good Technology, a mobile device management company,reported that almost three times more new iPhoneswere activated in the workplace in the last three months of 2014 than Android phones.\nAnd Apple has been trying to make even more enterprise inroads, announcing a deal last December with IBM to create apps and cloud services that are more business-friendly.\nDan Bieler, an enterprise and futures analyst at Forrester Research, said companies were hoping that the business-to-business market will make up for slowing consumer sales, because even if companies do not make as much money on each sale, the sheer number of sales is appealing.\nAnalysts say the iPhone is too expensive for every business to offer it to every employee. Of course, that means business buyers will experience sticker shock from Samsung\u2019s premium Galaxy S6, which is roughly the same price.\nThe same goes for the expensive new HTC One. But one other giant company may be making some inroads:Microsoft.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a space where, interestingly, Microsoft has a massive opportunity,\u201d Mr. Wood said. He said chief information officers \u201csay they can buy three or four highly capable mid- or low-tier Windows phones for the price of one iPhone.\u201d\nTo that end, Microsoft introduced two new lower-cost Lumia phones at Mobile World Congress, and Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president of the devices division, Stephen Elop, said in an interview that businesses were in his sights.\n\u201cWe want to have a business phone, properly connected with what is typically Microsoft infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Elop said. \u201cMicrosoft is very strong in security and data centers, and businesses have built custom applications around them, and all of a sudden they say there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to spend this amount of money for an iPhone 6 or Samsung.\u201d\nThe strategy of lower-end models, he said, is \u201cvery deliberate on our part.\u201d\nOf course for Microsoft, just about any smartphone sales are good ones.Microsoft has less than a 3 percent market shareon global smartphone shipments. But the price argument is a compelling one.\nOther manufacturers plan to make different sales pitches to businesses. The phone company Blackphone and the privacy communications company Silent Circle this week announced the second iteration of their privacy-oriented phone.\nThe companies said some 70 percent of their revenue stream came from bulk orders from businesses. But with each Blackphone 2 expected to cost $649 \u2014 about the price of an iPhone but without many of the same bells and whistles \u2014 businesses have to be take privacy pretty seriously.\nStill other enterprise-oriented phone makers are hoping to sell either phones or services.BlackBerry, which introduced the throwback BlackBerry Classic last year, showed off a lower-cost, all-touch-screen device at Mobile World Congress called the BlackBerry Leap.\nAfter falling to 0.4 percent market share in 2014, according to IDC, BlackBerry is also trying to become a software and services company, and this week introduced a suite of apps and services that will be available on iOS, Android and Windows devices later in 2015.\nPhone makers are also keeping an eye on growing markets like China and India. But in China, too, Apple is in a strong position,close to overtaking the disruptive electronics maker Xiaomiin terms of market share in the country, according to some reports.\nSamsung\u2019s sales in those countries, meanwhile, is being eroded by Xiaomi, Lenovo and Huawei. (Huawei, a Chinese phone maker, introduced a 5.5-inch phone called the Honor 6 at Mobile World Congress, along with a well-received smartwatch).\nAll of that is just opportunity for Apple to sell more iPhones to wealthy, aspirational people in China, although Mr. Dawson of Jackdaws Research said the iPhone was \u201csimply too expensive\u201d to be the most dominant phone in the world in terms of market share.\nBut sheer numbers may not matter. \u201cThe iPhone is capturing the most attractive and profitable customers, leaving the majority of share \u2014 but not money \u2014 to others,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.\nWorse for phone makers: Once people actually have an iPhone, they\u2019re less likely to switch away. Smartphones have always locked in buyers with their ecosystems to some extent, but Apple\u2019s layer of services is more powerful than ever, between music and app sales, cloud storage of precious digital items like photos and eventually even control over your smart home or your car.\nNone of that is to say the iPhone will be ascendant forever. Actual hardware is less and less important these days, and the services more and more important, so Apple will have to get services like maps and messaging right \u2014 as well as more complicated services like HealthKit and HomeKit, its frameworks for collecting health and fitness data and connecting to smart home devices.\nBut here in Barcelona, the Apple shadow was everywhere. The company is, by all accounts, a powerful moneymaking machine and, on top of that, the devices and brand are widely adored. That is a pretty steep hill for anyone else to climb.\n\u201cOther manufacturers just look on in awe,\u201d Mr. Wood said."

Previously, Chinese consumers have had to wait longer for Apple devices, such as when the iPhone 6 went on sale last year.\n\u201cChina\u2019s presence was felt throughout the almost two-hour-long keynote presentation, which opened with a video of Apple\u2019s new concept store by Hangzhou\u2019s West Lake, which opened in February.\u201d\nand\n\u201cChina is also widely regarded as the key market for the Apple Watch, particularly the US$17,000 solid gold Edition. The high-end model they should call the \u2018China\u2019 watch as it\u2019s clearly targeted at emerging markets, aspirational consumers who are looking to spread their feathers (flaunt their individualism and wealth) with what has become the ultimate self-expressive benefit brand: Apple,\u2019 luxury expert Scott Galloway of digital innovation think tank L2 told Business Insider.\u201d\nCLAIRE COLEMAN,in The Telegraph,LondonFrom \u201cNewsflash: Women just don\u2019t wear watches anymore. Sorry Apple\u201d:\n\u201cFor we women, watches seem a little anachronistic. So much so that when I wear one, people actually comment upon it as an unusual quirk, rather as if I\u2019d turned up riding a Penny Farthing. Which makes it almost quaint that Apple (bless) think that they\u2019re going to be able to bring them back.\u201d\nQIAN RUISAH,online for The Shanghai DailyFrom \u201cSapphire to get a lift from Apple Watch\u201d:\n\u201cThe Apple Watch is expected to benefit Chinese sapphire suppliers by driving demand for the highly durable sapphire glass, a Taiwan-based research firm said.\n\u201cMore smartphone and consumer electronics manufacturers are likely to adopt sapphire material for their future products, according to analysts.\n\u201cApple Inc. was set to launch the Apple Watch yesterday in California. The watch glass is made of sapphire glass which is supplied by Chinese companies.\n\u201c\u2018Apple has provided an unprecedented, game-changing opportunity for China\u2019s sapphire industry,\u2019 said Figo Wang, Trendforce\u2019s senior analyst.\u201d\nSVERRE HOLM-NILSEN,in Verdens Gang, a Norwegian daily newspaper, in OsloFrom \u201cThe Apple Watch is here: Norwegian experts don\u2019t think the smart clock will be a success\u201d:\n\u201cApple says that the battery for its smart watch will have a life of 18 hours and require a separate charging device to recharge it. The VG (Verdens Gang) experts were not impressed.\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s no denying that that you\u2019ll have to charge this at least every night,\u2019 added Broyn.\u201d (Magnus Broyn, a mobile telephone expert.)\nDEEKSHITA BARUAH,in Hindustan Times, New DelhiFrom \u201cI am a fashionista and I love the Apple Watch\u201d:\n\u201cFirst things first: I like it. I\u2019ve seen other smartwatches like the Moto 360 and the Pebble and they just look dorky compared to the Apple Watch. The 360, in particular, feels like a honking wall clock strapped to your wrist. The slender design of the Apple Watch speaks the elegant language of analog Swiss timepieces. There are dozens of straps to choose from \u2014 everything from basic rubber to a beautiful Milanese loop \u2014 that are to die for.\u201d\nand\n\u201cThe only time I\u2019d ditch the Apple Watch for something a little more traditional, however, is a big, fat Indian wedding. You\u2019re going to look like a jackass if you pair what is unmistakably a 21st-century device on your wrist with your blingy lehenga-choli.\u201d\nTREVOR TAN,in The Straits Times, SingaporeFrom hislive blogat the Apple event in Cupertino, Calif., and, later, onthe Straits Times\u2019 homepage:\n\u201cApple Watch to cost S$483 \u2014 $13,000; Singapore not on list of launch countries\u201d\n\u201cThe Apple Watch might not be the first smartwatch in the market. But like the iPhone was not the first smartphone in the market, the Apple Watch has the potential to disrupt the entire wearable genre. Unfortunately, Singapore won\u2019t be among the first to get the Apple Watch. We will just have to wait for our turn in the queue.\u201d\nANDREW GRIFFIN,in The Independent, London:From \u201c\u00a312,000 smartwatch is likely to be obsolete in a year\u201d:\n\u201cApple went to great lengths in its launch event to show that the Watch\u2019s cases had been built to last, showing long shots of metal being melted and cast, and demonstrating the virtues of \u2018cold-forged\u2019 stainless steel. But while the cases may not age, the insides will \u2014 and Apple\u2019s challenge could now be convincing people that the watch is worth buying, when it could easily be out of time by next year.\u201d\nJOHANN DURIEZ-MISE,on the French radio network Europe1 websiteFrom \u201cApple Watch: What should we think about this smartwatch?\u201d:\n\u201cWhat we have learnt: No \u2018Wow\u2019 effect, not one revolutionary application and no great novelty: The second presentation of the Apple Watch did not amaze, to say the least. We were shown applications such as Uber, Shazam, Passbook and even the possibility of being able to open your garage door from afar (thanks to the app, Alarm.com). Nothing particularly mind-blowing, especially as Apple informed us that we would have to charge the watch every single night.\u201d"

        "title": "Device Syncing: Call From Computers and Text From Tablets",
        "fulltext": "RECENTLY, I sat next to a woman on a plane with a serious collection of devices: a laptop, a tablet, aniPhone, an Android phone and aBlackBerry. I made a comment to her about all her gadgets, and she sighed deeply and said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t everything just be on all the gadgets, all the time?\u201d\nA totally synchronized life is what we were promised when this idea of the \u201ccloud\u201d came along. To some extent, we have it. When we delete emails, they\u2019re gone across all devices, and we can access webmail accounts from just about any machine, just about anywhere in the world.\nIf you\u2019ve gone a step further and enabled services likeGoogleDocs, you can store documents, spreadsheets, photos and videos in the cloud and open them on any computer. The same is true for files and photos stored somewhere like Dropbox or Box.\nBut all that syncing applies just to files, folders, photos and email. The new holy grail is unifying communications: to get your phone to talk to your computer, so you can view and respond to things like text messages and phone calls on any device.\nThat reality is here, and althoughApplehas the best-known solution, it\u2019s not the only one.\nApple\u2019s newest mobile operating system, iOS 8, and computer operating system, OS X Yosemite, include features calledContinuity and Handoff. Continuity lets you share information like directions, browser windows and email drafts on multiple devices, as long as all those devices are from Apple and are running the latest software.\nOnce you\u2019ve upgraded your devices, the features are often enabled by default. And when it starts working, it\u2019s pretty easy to use and even works with some apps that aren\u2019t made by Apple. With Continuity, your phone oriPadconnects to your Mac using Bluetooth. If the device is in range of the computer (say 10 or 20 feet), it can pick up what you\u2019re working on and transfer it to the phone.\nFor example, while writing this column in the Google Chrome browser, using Google Docs, I tapped the home button to turn on my iPhone screen. At the bottom of the screen, in the left corner, there was a little browser icon. When I tapped the icon and swiped up, the phone automatically opened a browser window that brought up the very Google Doc I was working on.\nAn even more useful example is navigation. If I use Safari to search for directions and open them in Apple Maps on the computer, a Maps icon will pop up on the phone. When I swipe up on that icon, I see the directions on the phone.\nUsing the Handoff feature, you can also use your phone\u2019s cellular connection to make and receive calls on your Mac, and you can send and respond to text messages on any of your iOS devices. Making a call works with phone numbers in Safari. If you search for a business on Safari on your computer, for example, and find a phone number, you can click on the number to make the call. The call itself happens on the computer, using its speaker and microphone. You can also make calls from your Contacts app \u2014 it just has to be up to date.\nYou can also choose to forward text messages from one iOS device to another, and you can send and receive texts on either your iPhone or iPad.\nAgain, though, all that assumes you use only Apple products. There are other options for getting your phone to talk to your computer, and the next most comprehensive option is Google.\nThe combination of Gmail, the Chrome browser and the Google Hangouts app will let you see and sync email and open tabs, directions and messages on your phone, tablet or computer \u2014 even if some of those devices are made by Apple or another company.\nUnfortunately, as with many Google solutions, it takes some doing to get it all working. For example, you can make voice calls from within Gmail at no charge using the Google Plus Hangouts app, but only to other Hangouts users.\nAnd to send and receive texts and voice mail on your phone, tablet or computer using the Hangouts app, you\u2019ll have to set upGoogle Voice. That\u2019s a free service (available only in the United States) that assigns you a new phone number. The good thing about the product is that you can attach multiple numbers to your Google Voice number \u2014 so when someone dials the Google Voice number, it could ring your cellphone and home phone simultaneously. But if you\u2019ve had the same number for a while, it could be a pain to give it up.\nOnce you\u2019re using Google Voice with Hangouts, however, the service can handle calls on your phone or computer, transcribe voice mail messages and send them to you in emails, and send or receive text messages and calls anywhere you have the Hangouts app installed.\nThe Hangouts app works on Macs, PCs, iPhones, Android phones and other phones as well.\nGoogle also offers an extension for Chrome called Chrome to Phone (not the same as an older extension called Chrome to Mobile, which has apparently been disabled) that will let you send links to web pages, phone numbers or directions from the browser to your phone with one click.\nYou can alsosync Chrome\u2019s browser tabsbetween a computer and the mobile version of Chrome on either iOS or Android \u2014 just enable it in Chrome\u2019s settings under Advanced Sync Settings.\nThere are also apps that make it easier to sync between devices. One I really like isPushBullet, which is available free for Mac, PC, Android and iOS, and as an extension in most major browsers. There are versions of the app for BlackBerry and Windows Phone, too. The app delivers notifications from your phone to your computer and lets you easily share files, links and messages between those devices.\nBlackBerry offers an interesting sharing service, too. The company makes desktop software calledBlackBerry Blendthat loads messages, emails, photos and files from newer BlackBerry phones onto your Mac, PC or tablet \u2014 including iPads. You\u2019ll see notifications and read and respond to emails and work as if you were on the phone. All the messages and files open in a separate window, walled off from the rest of the other data on your computer.\nMotorola makesMotorola Connect, which works with the Moto X, Droid Turbo and a couple of other phones, and also lets you see and send text messages or answer or decline calls on your computer. It works as a Chrome browser extension.\nAs we collect more devices and add more forms of communication to our lives, it doesn\u2019t make sense to be able to get text messages only on a phone and to send files or browse the web only on a computer. We\u2019re multidevice creatures, and every day, we\u2019re a little closer to moving seamlessly between our gadgets.\nSo while we may not be getting any closer to having just one device with everything on it, at least it\u2019s easier to manage the collection."
