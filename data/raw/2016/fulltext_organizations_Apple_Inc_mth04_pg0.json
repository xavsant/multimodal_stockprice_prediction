        "title": "F.B.I. Used Hacking Software Decade Before iPhone Fight",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In early 2003, F.B.I. agents hit a roadblock in a secret investigation, called Operation Trail Mix. For months, agents had been intercepting phone calls and emails belonging to members of an animal welfare group that was believed to be sabotaging operations of a company that was using animals to test drugs. But encryption software had made the emails unreadable.\nSo investigators tried something new. They persuaded a judge to let them remotely, and secretly, install software on the group\u2019s computers to help get around the encryption.\nThat effort, revealed in newly declassified and released records, shows in new detail how F.B.I. hackers worked to defeat encryption more than a decade before the agency\u2019s recent fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone. The Trail Mix case was, in some ways, a precursor to the Apple dispute. In both cases, the agents could not decode the data themselves, but found a clever workaround.\nThe Trail Mix records also reveal what is believed to be the first example of the F.B.I. remotely installing surveillance software, known as spyware or malware, as part of a criminal wiretap.\n\u201cThis was the first time that the Department of Justice had ever approved such an intercept of this type,\u201d an F.B.I. agent wrote in a 2005 document summing up the case.\nThe next year, six activists were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Protection Act in the case. An appeals court upheld the convictions in 2009, and said that the use of encryption, among other things, was \u201ccircumstantial evidence of their agreement to participate in illegal activity.\u201d\nRyan Shapiro, a national security researcher and animal welfare advocate, provided the documents in the case to The New York Times after obtaining them in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. Several important details remain secret, including whether the tactic worked. The wiretap was disclosed at trial but the software hacking was not, said Lauren Gazzola, one of the defendants, who now works for the Center for Constitutional Rights.\nIt is also unclear why the Justice Department, which is required to report every time it comes across encryption in a criminal wiretap case, did not do so in2002or2003. The Justice Department and F.B.I. did not comment Wednesday.\nThe Trail Mix documents provide an unusual, if dated, glimpse at the cat-and-mouse game that the F.B.I. has been playing for years with people who use technology to keep their affairs secret. The records show that, even when encryption was not widely used, there was a growing frustration about it in the F.B.I. To defeat it, agents built and used surveillance software earlier than was known.\n\u201cThe documents show that the F.B.I. has been in the hacking business for a long time,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union who reviewed the records.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nIn 2008 the F.B.I. began a campaign called \u201cGoing Dark\u201d to build support for laws requiring companies to allow government access to data in unencrypted form. But the Trail Mix records show that agents were frustrated by encryption many years earlier, and saw the fight against terrorism as an opportunity to get new authority.\n\u201cThe current terrorism prevention context may present the best opportunity to bring up the encryption issue,\u201d an F.B.I. official said in a December 2002 email. A month later, a draft bill, called Patriot Act 2, revealed that the Justice Department was considering outlawing the use of encryption to conceal criminal activity. The bill did not pass.\nThe Trail Mix investigation focused on sabotage and stalking at Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company with a New Jersey laboratory that conducted pharmaceutical testing on animals. The group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty strongly opposed the company\u2019s testing and advocated protests to end it.\nF.B.I. agents contended members of the group were also behind criminal attacks that included nuisances like sending nonstop faxes of all-black paper and hacking attacks that caused more than $450,000 in damages and lost business. Federal law labeled such attacks eco-terrorism.\nThe activists communicated using a well-known security program called Pretty Good Privacy, which makes emails unreadable by anyone without a password and a digital key. The agents tried several tactics, including getting a \u201cfull-content\u201d wiretap that intercepted every byte that left the group\u2019s computers. Yet the encryption proved unbreakable.\nMore than a decade later, the F.B.I. still cannot break sophisticated encryption such as the kind used on Apple\u2019s iPhones. Early this year, in its investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack, the Justice Department tried to require Apple to remove some security features from a locked iPhone so the F.B.I. could guess the password. Eventually, a private consultant developed a way to hack into the phone without Apple\u2019s help, and sold the idea to the F.B.I.\nAgents in the Trail Mix case also found a workaround. Like the San Bernardino case, the Trail Mix solutions were classified.\n\u201cPlease be advised that the tool itself is classified SECRET,\u201d an F.B.I. computer specialist from Quantico, Va., wrote in early 2003 while delivering an early version of the tool. \u201cFurther, any indication that the tool is specifically software in nature is also classified.\u201d\nExactly what the software was built to do is still not clear. But language in the documents suggests that it may have copied the digital keys, kept track of keystrokes to help the F.B.I. identify the passwords, or both.\nIn a Mafia case years earlier, agents sneaked into a Philadelphia office and attached a device to a computer that recorded every keystroke. That classified device helped agents break into an encrypted file. But until Trail Mix, such a tactic had never been tried using software as part of a wiretap, the documents show.\nCases like Operation Trail Mix and the San Bernardino shootings are examples of why many government officials say they need a new law to guarantee access to encrypted data. Going case-by-case, hack-by-hack is impractical, they say.\n\u201cIndividually tailored solutions have to be the exception and not the rule,\u201d Valerie Caproni, the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer, told Congress in 2011."

How would I do that?\nA.Most popular PDF apps for iOS, includingAdobe Acrobat Reader DCand Apple\u2019siBookssoftware, have at least one or two options for sharing the files. Two common methods for sharing are emailing the documents, or saving them to an online cloud storage site that you can get to from your computer. (If the files have copy-protection built in, you will probably need the password to open them at some point.)\nWhen you have a file open in the Adobe Acrobat Reader app, tap the screen to summon the toolbar and then tap the Share icon in the lower-right corner of the screen. A menu appears with various destinations, including Adobe\u2019s subscription-basedDocument Cloudor the Share File command, which lets you send the file by iMessage or Mail. You can also choose to save the file to an app likeEvernoteorMicrosoft OneNote, or to one of the various cloud storage services likeDropboxthat sync with a PC.\nThe Share menu in Apple\u2019s iBooks app gives you a commandto email an open PDF, but if yousync the iPad with iTunes on your Windows computer, you canadjust your iTunes sync settingsto copy all the PDFs in your iBooks library over to the PC at once; the documents should be in the Books folder in theiTunes Media folderin the computer\u2019s Music library.

        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: To Be or Not To Be an Uber Employee",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: Hey, Mike! How\u2019s it going? I\u2019ve been in Africa for three weeks. I bet you missed me a lot. It must be difficult to try to decipher the week\u2019s tech news without me to guide you along. Well, dry your eyes, I\u2019m back!\nMike:I started going to therapy to deal with your absence. Turns out you and I are fine, but I have a whole lot of other issues. I hope we have good insurance.\nFarhad: So, on to the news. Remember the huge battle between the F.B.I. and Apple over the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist\u2019s phone? It all sort of fizzled this week: CBS News reported that after the F.B.I. finally got into the phone (without Apple\u2019s help), it foundnothing of significanceon the device.\nMike:LOL. After all that, nothing. It\u2019s almost too perfect of an ending to the saga.\nFarhad:But nothing didn\u2019t come cheap! The bureau spent at least $1.3 million to get into the phone, James Comey, the F.B.I.\u2019s director,told a security conferencethis week.\nHas anyone spent so much for so little before? I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?\nMike:I considered the free sandwiches left in the conference rooms at N.Y.T. HQ to be part of my \u201cbenefits package.\u201d\nFarhad:O.K., so there were a lot of corporate earnings this week. Let\u2019s run through them in a flash. The first three tell a familiar story \u2014 the era of personal computers is well and truly over.\nIBM reporteda huge decline in revenue and profit, but the numbers were in line with what analysts were expecting. Intel, on the other hand,whiffedon its earnings numbers, and it announced layoffs of 12,000 workers, around 11 percent of its work force. And if Intel didn\u2019t prove that surviving the crash of the PC business isn\u2019t easy, Microsoft came along to underscore the point, announcinga dip in sales and profits.\nMike:I still have no clue what these companies are going to do to, like, stop firing people. I guess just become a lot smaller?\nOh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.\nFarhad:Oh \u2014 Ikind of hated it. Anyway, newer tech companies aren\u2019t faring any better. Google also missedanalysts\u2019 earnings expectations, in part because of lower prices paid for Internet ads. And Google was hit by another storm \u2014European regulators announcedthe start of what looks to be a long-running investigation into whether the company is using its Android operating system to block competitors from users\u2019 phones.\nFinally, there was Yahoo, the perennial basket case of the web industry. Its earnings report was also dismal:revenue fell 11 percent since last year, and the firm lost $99 million in the quarter. But the report was essentially overshadowed by Yahoo\u2019s efforts to sell its Internet businesses. Bids for those beleaguered assets were due this week; among the contenders are Verizon and a few private equity firms. Yahoo\u2019s board will now have to look through the bids to figure out which, if any, could save this ailing patient. Wish them luck!\nMike:Poor Yahoo executives will only have their tens of millions of dollars in prenegotiated severance packages to turn to for comfort after their company is sold for parts. What a tragedy.\nMeanwhile I\u2019m literallybuying cases of ramen on Amazonto save money.\nFarhad:But let\u2019s leave today\u2019s tech giants \u2014 and your dinner plans \u2014 aside for a bit. Instead let\u2019s talk about tomorrow\u2019s giant: Uber. Asyou reported, the ride-sharing company settled a long battle in California and Massachusetts this week over the legal status of its drivers. So does this finally put to rest the controversy over Uber\u2019s practice of keeping its drivers as contractors rather than employees?\nMike:In short, not really. The settlement \u2014 which still is subject to the acceptance of the judge presiding over the case \u2014 applies only to California and Massachusetts drivers. There are still lawsuits in a bunch of other states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania. I\u2019m sure more will pop up over time, since everyone loves to sue a company with deep pockets.\nHere\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.\nFor one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.\nThat seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.\nFarhad:Those actually sound like pretty good reforms. If Uber does use this settlement as a template for other states, it seems like it could be creating what some labor experts had been calling for when this contractor-versus-employee dispute first came along \u2014 a new, third category of employment that sat somewhere between full-time and independent contractor work.\nThis settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.\nAm I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?\nMike:Only partly! As usual.\nThe counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.\nAnyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.\nGood to have you back in town! Also, thank you for thebag of biltongyou brought back. I ate every last bit and have yet to develop a stomach bug.\nFarhad:You\u2019re welcome! I look forward to snacks from your next vacation. Actually, more than that, I look forward to your vacation."

On Monday, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is expected to reveal his plans for reducing his country\u2019s dependence on petroleum, a response to thefall in government revenues. His economic reform proposal may include a partial stock market listing ofSaudi Aramco, the national oil company.\nSeveral of the world\u2019s largest oil companies are also scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, with BP leading off on Tuesday. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest American oil companies, will follow on Friday. Oil prices that averaged around a third lower for the quarter than they were in the same quarter last year are likely to translate into lower earnings.Stanley Reed\nTECHNOLOGY\nPrivacy regulators from the United States, Europe and around the globe will gather in Berlin for a two-day conference starting on Monday to discuss how some of the world\u2019s largest companies like Google and Facebook use people\u2019s digital information. The meeting comes astension has been mountingover a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer deal that some European regulators say does not give their citizens sufficient protection when information is moved to the United States.Mark Scott\nSeveral of the best-known technology companies \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Twitter \u2014 will report earnings this week. After a disappointing string of earnings reports fromIntel,MicrosoftandAlphabet, the parent of Google, the tech sector could use some good news. Investors will be watching Apple\u2019s iPhone business closely to see if the rate at which sales are falling has begun to slow. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, vowed recently to make bold investments, which could come at the expense of profits. Investors would love to see growth in Twitter\u2019s user numbers, while there is wide anticipation that Facebook will continue to show strength as an Internet advertising juggernaut.Nick Wingfield\nECONOMY\nWhy is this Federal Reserve meeting less important than most Fed meetings? Because at this Fed meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the central bank\u2019s policy-making committee is unlikely to raise interest rates and is unlikely to say much about its plans for future rate increases. The Fedhas already signaledthat it isn\u2019t planning a second step on the road to higher rates any earlier than June. The Fed will also not update its economic forecasts at this meeting, and the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will not hold a news conference. Those who closely watch the Fed will parse the post-meeting statement for clues. Everyone else can safely pass over this one.Binyamin Appelbaum\nBANKING\nIt should be a busy week for earnings reports in Europe as several of the region\u2019s biggest banks are expected to share their first-quarter results. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the British lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group and Banco Santander of Spain are all expected to update investors on their results. The first quarter hasn\u2019t been kind to banks this year as uncertainty in the financial markets and problems in the oil and gas industry have weighed on results at the biggest American banks, includingJPMorgan Chase,Bank of AmericaandGoldman Sachs. Europe\u2019s largest lenders haven\u2019t been spared the pain of their American counterparts and are expected to report similarly weak numbers.Chad Bray\nECONOMY\nOn Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of 2016. Wall Street is looking for a growth rate of 0.6 percent, well below the 1.4 percent annual rate of growthrecorded in the fourth quarterof 2015. The likely slow pace of expansion comes despite healthy hiring, and if the economy did indeed stumble early this year, it would repeat the pattern offirst-quarter decelerationseen in 2014 and 2015. As was the case in those years, most economists expect growth to quicken in the current second quarter.Nelson D. Schwartz\nEurozone finance ministers could meet on Thursday as part of efforts to prevent Greece from returning to the brink of bankruptcy. Though Greece agreed to a third bailout last year, the country must still enact additional reforms to obtain funds to pay back debt that matures in July. A deal is also needed to allow the International Monetary Fund to contribute to the bailout and for the lenders to start negotiations on ways to ease the country\u2019s debt burden. There weresigns of progressat a meeting late last week in Amsterdam where the eurozone and the I.M.F. agreed to hold Greece to a supplementary set of reforms.

The media company announced last week that it hadstruck a multiyear agreementfor Dish to continue to carry Viacom\u2019s bundle of TV networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Viacom stock, which is down about 36 percent in the past year, was up about 14 percent on the news last week. Yet the company still has much to prove to Wall Street. It has reported persistently weak earnings in recent quarters and investors will watch for whether the TV and film company has been able to reverse its fortunes.\nWall Street will also be watching earnings reports this week from Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable for an update on their proposed merger.Emily Steel"

        "title": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face",
        "fulltext": "For years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.\nApple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.\nLast week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.\nThe about-face is startling, given Apple\u2019s record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products \u2014 like itsmobile payments system Apple Pay\u2014 in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company.\nTo a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software \u2014 including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad \u2014 to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is alsoreliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales.\nThe company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. ItsChina numbers will be dissectedon Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings.\nChina\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.\nChina has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\n\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201d\nAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\n\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.\nSince the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.\nSales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids,investigationsandfines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses.\nThough Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.\nIn 2013, Apple signed an agreement with China\u2019s largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, to sell theiPhonein the country, after six years of wooing the carrier. Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple\u2019s products in the company\u2019s last fiscal year. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has made multiple visits to China. And while the company has faced occasional opposition \u2014 most notably an attack by state and Communist Party media against its customer support \u2014 it has largely been left alone.\nThere have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201d\nIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.\nApple\u2019s recent battle with the F.B.I.over unlocking an iPhone for a terrorism investigation is unlikely to help it in China. Chinese lawyers have pointed out that the country\u2019s antiterrorism law requires companies to help with decryption when the police or state security agents demand it for investigating or preventing terrorist acts.\nOn Tuesday,at a congressional hearing, Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said that the Chinese government had asked the company to share source code in the last two years, but that it had refused.\nThe two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.\nThat push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.\nIn the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\n\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said."

        "title": "F.B.I. Says It Needs Hackers to Keep Up With Tech Companies",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. defended its hiring of a third party tobreak intoan iPhone used by a gunman in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting, telling some skeptical lawmakers on Tuesday that it needed to join with partners in the rarefied world of for-profit hackers as technology companies increasingly resist their demands for consumer information.\nAmy Hess, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, made the comments at a hearing by members of Congress who are debating potential legislation on encryption. The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security.\nThe hearing followsa recent standoff between the F.B.I. and Appleover a court order to force the company to help unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple opposed the order, citing harm to the privacy of its users. The F.B.I. later dropped its demand for Apple\u2019s help when it found a third-party alternative to hack the device.\nYet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F.B.I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no one-stop solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption.\n\u201cThese types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,\u201d Ms. Hess said.\nThe focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of \u201cgray hat\u201d hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think relying on a third party is a good model,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of third-party hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups.\nMs. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using third-party hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation \u201cto make sure that we identify the risks and benefits.\u201d The F.B.I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone\u2019s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique.\nApple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes.\n\u201cAs you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,\u201d Mr. Sewell said. \u201cBut technologists and national security experts don\u2019t see the world that way. We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve \u2014 and prevent \u2014 crimes.\u201d\nMr. Sewell also defended Apple\u2019s security practices, saying the company always aimed to keep its devices safe from prying eyes. Within the last two years, he said, the Chinese government has requested Apple\u2019s source code but the company has refused to hand it over. Ina public reporton Monday, the company said American law enforcement officials made 4,000 requests for customer data covering more than 16,000 devices in the second half of last year.\nLaw enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground \u2014 particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases \u2014 because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals.\n\u201cMake no mistake \u2014 criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,\u201d said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.\nThe F.B.I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F.B.I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday\u2019s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, \u201cI hope not.\u201d\nThe encryption debate is continuing in other quarters. Apple is fightingan order in a federal court in New Yorkto provide access to a phone involved in a criminal drug investigation. And last week, Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, released a draft version of a bill that would require tech companies to decrypt data if requested by a court.\nTech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple\u2019s pro-encryption position, are lobbying against the draft bill.\nTimed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill.\n\u201cWe believe it is critical to the safety of the nation\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create government-mandated security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,\u201d the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. \u201cAny mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences.\u201d\nMichael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, \u201cThis is urgent because the one thing you don\u2019t want is Congress coming in a knee-jerk fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now.\u201d\nCity and state law enforcement officialssupportthe Senate draft bill, but it faces strong opposition from many in Congress.\nPresident Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry. In a speech in March, the president warned against \u201cfetishizing\u201d encryption and urged more compromise between tech companies and the F.B.I."

But the effects of the case linger.\nOn Tuesday, two developments showed that the debate touched off by the case \u2014 weighing digital privacy against national security \u2014 is still going on.\nIn one, the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer gave an update on the San Bernardino attacker\u2019s iPhone, which the agency was eventually able to crack with the help of an unidentified third party. James A. Baker, the bureau\u2019s general counsel, said the F.B.I. had extracted data from the device and was putting it to use, without answering whether the information was useful to the San Bernardino investigation,Eric Lichtblau writes.\nAt the same time, WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, said it had fully encrypted all communications on its service,Mike Isaac writes. The move thrust WhatsApp deeper into a debate about digital data \u2014 with more encryption of everything, including photos, videos and group texts \u2014 that will only make it harder for law enforcement to get information from the messaging company. All of which is to say, the push-pull between tech companies and the federal government over access to digital data and communications is far from over."
