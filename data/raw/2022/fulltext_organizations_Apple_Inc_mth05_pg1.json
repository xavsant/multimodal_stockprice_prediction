        "title": "Apple Store Showdown: Inside the Battle for Union Representation",
        "fulltext": "ATLANTA \u2014 Sydney Rhodes\u2019s frustration was rising. Seated at a hotel conference table across the street from the Apple store where she worked in Atlanta, she listened as her boss suggested to a dozen colleagues that they should be grateful to be paid more than other retail employees.\nIt was among a series of arguments he made this month at an off-site meeting ahead of the store\u2019s vote on whether to join the Communications Workers of America union. Ms. Rhodes, a 26-year-old union organizer, considered the roughly $4 more per hour that Apple paid relative to other stores insufficient.\nBefore a recent promotion, she supported herself by bouncing from part-time work helping customers with iPhones to a second job delivering Amazon packages to a third shift loading boxes at FedEx. She had championed the union because she thought it could boost hourly pay and increase full-time opportunities for a largely part-time staff.\nIn April, Ms. Rhodes\u2019s advocacy helped garner support from 70 percent of the store\u2019s 100-plus workers for a union election. But as her boss pushed back over dinner at a Sheraton Hotel, she could sense that support beginning to fray.\n\u201cAny time someone asked me a question,\u201d she said, \u201che would come with an opinion about unions that didn\u2019t apply to us at all.\u201d\nThe exchanges cut to the heart of a contest with implications for some 272 Apple stores across the United States. Two decades after redefining retail with sleek architecture and concierge tech support, Apple is being confronted by the industry\u2019s latest trend: organized labor.\nUnionization has been on the rise at Starbucks, REI and Dollar General as employees feel the squeeze of inflation and tire of pandemic risks. The stresses unleashed by those forces also have roiled the tech sector, helping employees emboldened by a tight labor market win support for unions inthe video game industryand at anAmazon warehouseon Staten Island.\nMs. Rhodes and colleagues were expected to be the first Apple store to vote on joining a union this Thursday. But late last week, they suspended the election. Apple stores in Towson, Md., and New York City\u2019s Grand Central Terminal are still expected to hold votes in coming weeks, and more than two dozen more have expressed interest in organizing, union leaders say.\nThe labor movement has worried Apple executives, who strive to foster love for Apple among employees and customers. The unions could bring an end to 20 years of burnishing the Apple brand with cheerful salespeople hawking $1,000 phones. The company has suggested that they also have the potential to increase operating costs and hobble the introduction of new products.\nApple has hired Littler Mendelson, an employment law firm, to blunt the labor push. It also has furnished store managers with talking points, including that unionizing could result in fewer promotions and inflexible hours, which was reported earlier byVice. And last week, its leaders urged employees not to unionize and said they would increase wages to $22 an hour from $20.\n\u201cI worry about what it would mean to put another organization in the middle of our relationship, an organization that does not have a deep understanding of Apple or our business,\u201d Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of retail, said in a video sent to many of the company\u2019s roughly 65,000 retail employees. The video was reported on earlier byThe Verge.\nJosh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, declined a request for interviews with Ms. O\u2019Brien and Alex Burrus, the manager of the Cumberland Mall store, which is about 10 miles from downtown Atlanta. And employees who are on the fence or against the union push were reluctant to speak with The New York Times.\nIn a statement, Mr. Rosenstock said the company provided numerous benefits to retail employees, including health care, tuition reimbursement and family leave. \u201cWe deeply value everything they bring to Apple,\u201d he said.\nApple has countered the union push even as online orders diminish the importance of its stores. About 6 percent of Apple\u2019s sales come from its retail locations, roughly half the share before the pandemic, according to Loup Ventures, a firm that specializes in tech research.\nDespite the stores\u2019 waning financial importance, employees like Ms. Rhodes view them as Apple\u2019s physical connection to the wider world. She started working at Apple because she loved its products. She bought her first iPhone at 16 with money she earned working at McDonald\u2019s. She became obsessed with the company, tuning into hourslong product events to feed a growing interest in \u201cthe way they worked.\u201d\nIn 2018, she impressed a store technician with her knowledge about the Apple Watch, leading a manager to encourage her to apply for a job in her hometown, Louisville, Ky. She later moved to Atlanta and transferred to the Cumberland Mall store, sandwiched between a Bath & Body Works and a Pandora jeweler.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Ms. Rhodes said, she was grateful that the company was among the first to send its workers home. Employees at the Cumberland Mall were paid for several months without being required to do any work, said Frank Howard, the store manager at the time. Apple later shipped them a computer and asked them to provide remote sales and technical support.\nTheir return to the store after the arrival of coronavirus vaccines led to frustrations with management. Apple lifted the mask requirement for staff and customers just before Christmas, and a number of workers got Covid-19, Ms. Rhodes and another union organizer said.\n\u201cWe went through Covid, and y\u2019all made so much money,\u201d Ms. Rhodes said of Apple, which increased its profits to $95 billion in its 2021 fiscal year, 71 percent higher than its last fiscal year before the pandemic. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we be paid more?\u201d\nDerrick Bowles, who works with Ms. Rhodes in Atlanta, was listening to a podcast about theunion effort at Amazon\u2019s warehouse in Bessemer, Ala. Pay increases for his job as a genius technician was capped at 2 percent, not enough to keep pace with inflation. After calculating that he was making 15 cents less per hour after inflation, he contacted the Communications Workers of America and started organizing a union drive.\nMr. Bowles first recruited seasoned colleagues. Having been at Apple a decade, he said they were most familiar with how support of retail had dwindled, with perks like the rental of an entire bowling alley for a 2010 party giving way to Christmas gifts such as backpacks. One year, Mr. Bowles said, employees received a printed copy of Apple retail credo on heavy card stock and a T-shirt.\n\u201cThe next year we stopped getting Christmas gifts completely,\u201d he said.\nMs. Rhodes was initially skeptical but warmed to the union, she said. She had recently been promoted to a full-time job, earning $26 an hour, but only after a colleague with 14 years\u2019 experience departed. Most of her colleagues were part time, working less than 30 hours a week. She thought the union could help create more full-time opportunities.\nThey drafted a letter outlining goals, including fair compensation, career development opportunities, improved benefits and a bigger voice in safety policies related to Covid-19. They polled staff on whether they should hold a vote to unionize andwon twice the support they needed. Afterward, Mr. Bowles distributed red wristbands that said \u201cStronger Together.\u201d\nIn May, store managers increased their counteroffensive, posting a letter in the break room from an employee of the Grand Central Terminal store who expressed opposition to unions, Mr. Bowles said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not an Amazon warehouse that didn\u2019t get sick leave or bathroom breaks during the pandemic,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re not an understaffed Starbucks.\u201d He wrote that he understood the calls for \u201cmore money\u201d but that \u201cnothing with a union is guaranteed.\u201d\nManagers also included anti-union comments in their morning briefings of staff, according to a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board. In a statement to reporters about the meetings, Mr. Bowles said Apple was \u201cputting its thumb on the scale.\u201d\nThe pressure has divided employees. On a recent Sunday evening at the Cumberland Mall store, about 15 employees in blue T-shirts with a white Apple logo attended to customers browsing rows of colorful watchbands. None of the employees wore a \u201cStronger Together\u201d bracelet.\nMost stopped wearing the bracelet because they felt it made management treat them differently, Ms. Rhodes said.\nAs support in Atlanta wavered, union leaders in Towson and New York said they could still prevail in their elections. They pointed to the success of Amazon organizers on Staten Island after a similar push failed in Bessemer.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 where the rebels win and things work out perfectly,\u201d said David DiMaria, an organizer advising employees at the Towson store on behalf of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. \u201cWe appreciate all the information Atlanta has shared to let us know what to expect. We still feel good.\u201d\nIn the days leading up to the vote, a Covid outbreak spread through some Cumberland Mall employees, Ms. Rhodes said. Apple, which did not comment on the outbreak, required masks in the store. Ms. Rhodes hoped the setback would remind colleagues of the value a union could offer by giving them a voice in decisions related to their health.\nLess than 24 hours later, the union\u2019s organizing committee decided to suspend the vote. In a statement, the union blamed Apple's campaign for creating an environment of fear and coercion. Mr. Bowles said he had not abandoned his campaign."

        "title": "Guns, Law and the Uvalde Elementary School Shooting",
        "fulltext": "The horrificschool shooting yesterday in Uvalde, Texas, has ramped up the intensity of the national debate over gun control and the emotions around it.\nThe gunman killed 21 people, including 19 children, making this the deadliest shooting at a U.S. elementary school since the 2012 attack at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. Because he turned 18 this month, the gunman was able to legally purchase two AR-15-style rifles in Texas,The Houston Chronicle reported.\nSoon after the shooting, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, moved to clear the way to force votes on legislation that wouldstrengthen background checksfor gun buyers. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said he was \u201chorrified and heartbroken\u201d by the shooting. But he and other Republican lawmakers gave no signal that they might drop their longstanding opposition to tighter gun laws, even though polls show that Americansoverwhelmingly supportsuch measures.\nWith the Senate divided 50-50, any legislation on guns would have to draw the support of all Democrats and at least 10 Republicans to advance. The Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has said he still supports the legislation on background checks that he and the Republican Senator Pat Toomey introduced after Sandy Hook, but yesterday he saidhe did not favor eliminating the filibusterto pass such a bill.\nHere is how the latest mass shooting is likely to reverberate in Washington and elsewhere:\nPresident Biden\u2019s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Steven Dettelbach, is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee today.The hearingwas already going to put a spotlight on Biden\u2019s stalled agenda on gun control, but the shooting raises the stakes. Republicans have portrayed Biden\u2019s nominee as a threat to Second Amendment rights.\nThe National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meetingopens on Friday in Houston, 300 miles from the site of the massacre. Former President Donald Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Senator Ted Cruz are among those scheduled to speak, and their words will get close scrutiny. Asked yesterday about the need for gun control measures, Cruz blamed Democrats and the media for rushing to \u201ctry to restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\u201d\nThe shooting could increase pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A., assome didin the wake of the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. That attack led to a bigger push for boycotts than other recent shootings, perhaps because the survivors were teenagers who were skilled at leveraging social media.\nJust after the shooting, the California Senatepassed a bill allowing citizens to suemakers or sellers of untraceable \u201cghost guns\u201d and illegal assault weapons. The bill was inspired by the abortion law in Texas that also deputizes private citizens. Other states could try similar approaches to regulation.\nRenewed calls for tighter controls couldlead to a spike in gun sales. One month after the Sandy Hook shooting, a record two million guns were sold.Shares of gun makers often riseafter mass shootings, but the performance of major gun stocks was mixed in premarket trading this morning, with Smith & Wesson up 1 percent, Sturm Ruger down 1 percent and Vista Outdoor falling 2 percent.\n\u201cThe gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons, which make them the most and largest profit,\u201d Biden said in a speech to the nation yesterday. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.\u201d This could be the mass shooting that leads to significant change \u2014 or it could jointhe long list of other atrocitiesthat have been followed by policy stalemates.\nHere are someways to help the victimsof the shooting in Uvalde.\nThe Biden administration blocks Russia from paying American bondholders.The moveincreases the likelihood of the first default of Russia\u2019s foreign debtin more than a century. Meanwhile, fighting is intensifying in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, whereUkrainian officials say they expecta devastating siege in Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city still under Ukrainian control.\nOne in five adult Covid survivors in the U.S. may develop long Covid.A large study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which evaluated electronic medical records for nearly two million people, found that the most common post-Covid conditions, regardless of age, were respiratory problems and musculoskeletal pain.\nGlencore will pay $1.1 billion to settle bribery and price-fixing charges.U.S. prosecutors said the settlement with the mining and commodity-trading giant followed a \u201cmultiyear scheme to manipulate benchmarksused to set prices for oil at two of our country\u2019s busiest ports.\u201d\nTwo candidates in Georgia beat Trump-backed challengers.Gov. Brian Kemp trounced David Perdue in a victory that represented a resounding rebuke of former President Donald Trump.The victory sets Kemp up for a rematch with Stacey Abrams. In the secretary of state race, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican incumbent, averted a runoff against Representative Jody Hice.\nThe U.K. approves the sale of Chelsea F.C. to a U.S.-led investor group.The British government approved the $3.1 billion sale of the soccer club after receiving assurances thatnone of the proceeds would go to its Russian seller, Roman Abramovich, who hurriedly put his team on the market three months ago, almost as soon as Russian troops crossed into Ukraine.\nThe venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has bet big on crypto through market ups and downs. But nothing like this.\nWith the cryptocurrency market reeling \u2014 after the collapse of a so-called stablecoin helped tank the price of Bitcoin and wiped out $300 billion in value from the broader crypto economy \u2014 the firm announced this morning that it was launching its fourth and biggest crypto fund, dedicating $4.5 billion to blockchain investments. \u201cThis speaks to the size of the opportunity,\u201d Arianna Simpson, a general partner at the firm, told DealBook. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to double down.\u201d\nThe new fund will bring the firm\u2019s total crypto investment to $7.6 billion.About $1.5 billion of the fund will go to seed investments, and $3 billion to venture bets, backing projects of all kinds from infrastructure to middleware to consumer apps.\nAndreessen Horowitz, often called A16Z, believes the internet can be improved by creating a new layer of infrastructure known as web3, built on blockchain technology andfueled by cryptocurrencies. Believers say it will transform commerce and finance, allowing users to transact without intermediaries, get paid for participation and help govern companies.\nCurrently, tech companies are \u201cprimarily extractive, taking and profiting from data,\u201d Simpson said, but web3 offers \u201ca completely novel approach to ownership.\u201d\nThe firm is concerned that the recent crash will spur officials to enact regulations that could crimp crypto\u2019s growth, Simpson said.

The investors are mostly a mix of small to midsize hedge funds based in the U.S. and Canada. The hedge funds Pentwater Capital and Sabby Management are two of the bigger investors in the private placement,as previously reported by The Times. Funds associated with Pentwater, a $10 billion hedge fund based in Naples, Fla., stand to get the largest number of shares through the deal, according to the draft document.\nOther big investors include Anson Funds Management, Kershner Trading Americas, K2 & Associates, Yorkville Advisors and MMCAP.\nAt the moment, Trump Media \u2014 whichhired former Representative Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump ally, as chief executive in December \u2014 has no disclosed revenue, and its social network has struggled to gain traction. Two people briefed on the matter said a final version of the draft was expected to be filed with regulators tomorrow, although the timing could change.\nTrump Media\u2019s bankers told potential investors that those willing to put up at least $100 million would get a call from Mr. Trump, according to five people who were briefed about the pitches but were not authorized to speak publicly.\nAmong the funds that turned down Trump Media\u2019s bankers were Millennium Management, a $57 billion hedge fund; Hudson Bay Capital, a $15 billion hedge fund; and Balyasny Asset Management, a hedge fund with $13 billion in assets.

        "title": "Apple Delays and Modifies Its Return to Office Plans",
        "fulltext": "Apple, in a blow to its efforts to restore normalcy to its operations, has suspended its requirement that employees return to the office this month for at least three days a week because of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.\nThe reversal was welcome news for thousands of employees who pushed back against the company\u2019s demand that they begin coming to the office three days a week in late May. Early this month, the group, which calls itself \u201cApple Together,\u201dpublished a lettercalling on the executive team to allow for a hybrid and flexible work schedule, saying they could collaborate remotely using online tools such as Slack and spare themselves hours of commuting.\nOne of Apple\u2019s leading artificial intelligence engineers,Ian Goodfellow, resignedin early May because of the office return policy. Mr. Goodfellow didn\u2019t respond immediately to requests for comment.\nApple said in a note to employees on Tuesday that it would proceed with a pilot program to bring some workers back to the office twice a week in the weeks ahead. It said anyone in that program who felt \u201cuncomfortable coming into the office\u201d would have the \u201coption to work remotely.\u201d\nThe company also asked that employees who do come to campus wear masks in common areas and elevators. It said it would continue to monitor Covid cases and provide employees with updates at least two weeks before any future changes to its office policy.\nThe pandemic hit less than a year after Apple celebrated the opening of its new, $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a splashy circular building that resembles a spaceship. It has largely sat unused for the past two years."
