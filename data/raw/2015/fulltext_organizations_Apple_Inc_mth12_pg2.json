        "title": "Samsung\u2019s Patent Loss to Apple Is Appealed to Supreme Court",
        "fulltext": "Less than two weeks ago, Samsungagreed to pay Apple $548 millionin damages in Federal District Court, as their yearslong legal conflict seemed to be tailing off to a cease-fire.\nBut the clash is not yet over.\nOn Monday, Samsung, the Korean electronics company, filed an appeal to theSupreme Court, arguing that the legal framework for design patents \u2014 at the center of the suits between the companies \u2014 is outdated for the modern digital world. The issue at stake, Samsung says, extends well beyond the courtroom skirmishes of the two large corporations.\nThe case, if heard, could have far-reaching implications for design patents, which cover how a product looks, and the sort of financial penalties allowed under the law. Design patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how a product functions.\nThe legal framework for design patents, according to Samsung, some other major technology companies and legal experts, is largely shaped by a 19th-century law intended to protect the designs of carpets, fireplace grates and ornamental spoons.\nBack then, the design was the heart of such products, so seizing most or all of the gains of a copycat \u2014 known as the \u201ctotal profit rule\u201d \u2014 was justified. But today, a complex product like a modern smartphone is a dense bundle of intellectual property with more than 100,000 patents conceivably laying claim to some small aspect of the phone.\n\u201cThe law was written for a time long before the smartphone was invented,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford University program in law, science and technology, who has previously filed a brief in support of Samsung.\nAppledeclined to comment publicly about the appeal. But the company has argued in the past that the three design patents Samsung is challenging represent the essence of theiPhone\u2014 the look of its user interface, its rectangular display and its rounded shape and flat front. A jury agreed with Apple, as did the federal appeals court that specializes in patent cases.\nIn its appeal on Monday, Samsung declared that the sweeping ruling against it, if left in place, would set a precedent \u201cto reward design patents far beyond the value of any inventive contribution.\u201d\nIn a supporting brief filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, eight technology companies including Google, Facebook and eBay and the former Hewlett-Packard said that the ruling on design patents against Samsung, if left to stand, would \u201clead to absurd results and have a devastating impact on companies.\u201d\nSeveral of the companies joining that brief in support of Samsung compete with Apple in one market or another. Most prominent among them is Google, whose Android mobile operating system runs most of the smartphones produced by Samsung, Apple\u2019s leading rival, and other phone makers.\nMr. Lemley\u2019s argument in support of Samsung, filed in the appeals court, was signed by more than two dozen law professors.\nStylish design defines Apple\u2019s products and its corporate reputation. On two of the three patents in dispute, the named inventors include the two people most identified with Apple design, Steven P. Jobs, the company\u2019s co-founder, and Jonathan Ive, its chief design officer.\nIn the jury trial, Apple submitted an internal Samsung memo saying the iPhone showed that Samsung faced a \u201ccrisis of design.\u201d Apple\u2019s evidence included a series of photographs of Samsung smartphones before and after the iPhone was introduced in 2007, and the models increasingly came to resemble Apple\u2019s design.\nSamsung, according to Apple, made a \u201cdeliberate and conscious\u201d decision to copy the iPhone.\nIn early December, when Samsung agreed to pay Apple $548 million damages, it reserved the right to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Last year, the companies agreed to drop all patent litigation outside the United States.\nIn the United States the legal standard for infringement of a design patent centers on the \u201cordinary observer\u201d test, and whether that observer \u201cwould be deceived into thinking that the accused design was the same as the patented design.\u201d\nSo while there are fundamental questions about the reach of design patents on modern high-tech products, and large damage awards, legal experts say the Supreme Court could well decide that this is not the case that cleanly presents the larger issues.\nThe Supreme Court is not expected to decide whether to take up the Samsung appeal until February at the earliest. And no matter what happens in the legal arena, the smartphone market has moved on, with generations of new models coming to market since Apple filed suit in 2011.\nIt is striking, analysts say, how little effect the court rulings seem to have had on the marketplace so far. Undeterred, Samsung has brought new, popular models to market that represent a steady evolution of the phones found to have infringed on Apple\u2019s designs.\nSamsung, analysts say, has forged ahead, perhaps with designs that are slightly modified, but not so much that an \u201cordinary observer\u201d is likely to notice.\nThe business threat of copycats, in theory, is that their lower-cost offerings will eat into the profits of the innovator, undermining the leader\u2019s incentive and ability to invest in future inventions.\nBut Apple has kept rolling out new products and recording record profits year after year. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not obvious that Apple needs more incentive to innovate,\u201d said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThe market has rewarded Apple very richly as it is.\u201d\nBeyond this case, design patents will probably get more legal attention in the future, said David J. Kappos, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. As high-tech products become increasingly complex, the skill that yields a competitive advantage is making products easy to use. \u201cAnd usability comes down to design,\u201d said Mr. Kappos, a former director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office."

How bad is it and is it worth upgrading?\nA.Most major operating system updates have their share of unsquashed bugs at their debut, and Apple\u2019sOS X 10.11 (El Capitan)was no exception when it was released in late September.\nAlthough the system included numerous adjustments and enhancements to programs like Mail and Notes, new window-management tools, improved search functions and mass-transit directions in its Maps app, early adopters were quick to report problems.\nMajor complaints from users focused on system slowness, severe errors with Microsoft Office, iTunes issues and printing woes. Apple released anOS X 10.11.1 updatea few weeks later to address a number of the problems (including compatibility with Microsoft Office 2016), applya security patchand add 150new emojicharacters.\nAnother update aimed at fixing additional problems with Wi-Fi, Mail, Photos and other appsis in the works, but officialcommunity forums for El Capitan complaintsare still fairly active. (The company has an area of its website devoted toOS X supportand anonline user guide for El Capitan, but these may not address specific bugs.)\nIf you are on the fence about updating your MacBook, make a list of all the programs and peripherals you rely on, and check the websites of those manufacturers for compatibility information. Some may suggest updating your drivers \u2014 or installing patches for their own programs \u2014 for smooth running on El Capitan; the Roaring Apps site collectscrowd-sourced reportsthat can help get you started.\nIf you have hardware or software that you really need and problems using them with El Capitan have been noted, postpone upgrading until you find reports that the issues have been resolved."

What can I do?\nA.Apple\u2019s round of fall software updates to its OS X and iOS systems has come with typical bugs for users. However, many who rely on Google\u2019s free Picasa application to import, organize and edit digital photoshave been complaining specificallythat the OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) update has taken away the picture program\u2019s ability toimport photos directlyfrom some USB-connected cameras \u2014 including iPhones.\nOver the years, Google has shifted its attention from Picasa to Google photos, but it stilloccasionally updates Picasafor the Windows and Mac OS X versions; a Linux edition wasput out to pasture in 2012. Google has yet to formally comment on the importing issue with OS X or put out an update to Picasa.\nYou have other ways to transfer the photos from your phone to your computer. The key is that once the photos have been copied to the Pictures folder or another folder on the Mac, you can just open Picasa and allow the program to scan and index the images so they are ready for you to organize.\nApple includes anImage Captureutility with OS X that can be used to pull in photos from a connected phone or camera\u2019s memory card. Since you are using a newer iPhone with El Capitan, you can also use theAirDrop featureto wirelessly beam photos from your phone to the Mac\u2019s Downloads folder over your home Wi-Fi network and a Bluetooth connection.\nOnline syncing solutions like Apple\u2019siCloud Photo Libraryor the third-party appPhoto Synccan also move images between devices.

        "title": "Farhad and Mike Ruminate on the Peaks and Abysses of 2015",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: Hey, Mike! How\u2019s it going? It\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year: The last newsletter I\u2019ll have to write with you in 2015.\nMike: Don\u2019t lie. You\u2019ll miss me when I go away on my vacation to Puerto Rico, which coincidentally is on the verge of amajor bond default. I\u2019m not sure what that means, but I think it has something to do withDaniel Craig.\nAnyway, we\u2019ll get through this together. While being apart, that is.\nFarhad: O.K., on to the week\u2019s tech \u2014 actually, let\u2019s skip all that.Apple shuffled some executives around, Californiaproposed rules for self-driving carsandFacebook and Uber hooked up, but for the most part nothing major happened this week.\nInstead, let\u2019s look at the whole year. What were the most important tech stories of 2015? The biggest news, by far, was the inauguration of this weekly newsletter, a development that rocked the tech world from San Francisco to South San Francisco.\nMike:I recently showed my parents how to subscribe, mostly to convince them I have a real job and have done something with my life. So our audience is growing.\nFarhad:But enough about us. Let\u2019s talk about the tech bubble. Tech financing went a little nuts in the first half of the year. Hedge funds and mutual funds joined traditional tech venture capitalists in trying to get a stake in hot new companies, so a tsunami of money poured into start-ups. \u201cIt might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Stewart Butterfield, the co-founder of the business messaging company Slack,told me in April.\nAlso, \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 a term for tech companies valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 became as common as mosquitoes. And with rising real estate costs and an invasion of tech bros, San Francisco became unbearable.\nMike:Can I ask that we coin a new term besides \u201cunicorn\u201d in 2016? I was thinking something like, \u201cLiger.\u201d You know, the hybrid child of a tiger and a lion. Plus unlike unicorns, they actually exist!\nAlso, to be fair to the tech bro wave, I will say that the bro has always existed in the wild, in his many forms, across many industries. As long as there are young people thrust into ridiculous amounts of money, whose egos exist unchecked amongst approving peers, there will be bros.\nFarhad:Good point, bro. But in the second of half of the year something suddenly shifted. Investors began to worry about \u201cexits\u201d \u2014 tech companies weren\u2019t doing very well on the stock market, so how would all these start-ups ever get a big payday? A lot of firms also seemed to be spending way too much money; several were actually upside down on their unit costs, meaning they were spending more to serve each customer than they were making from them. And the mutual funds that had eagerly poured money into private tech companiesbegan to \u201cmark down\u201d their investments\u2014 that is, declaring them worth less than they\u2019d paid for them.\nSo that\u2019s the recap. But where do you think we are now? Are we headed for a huge blowup, or is it going to be the proverbial soft landing?\nMike:I think if one continuously says, \u201cWe\u2019re in a bubble and it\u2019s going to burst\u201d for years and years, they will eventually be proved right, but it doesn\u2019t really make them prescient. So I won\u2019t do that.\nWhat I do think will happen: A gradual slowdown in funding \u2014 which in some areas is already occurring \u2014 and a tightening of belts on some of the lavish start-up spending we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Feelings of austerity tend to reverberate in cocoons like the technological one in which we exist.\nI\u2019m not saying Dropbox and Pinterest will stop serving sushi tomorrow. A number of these companies are sitting on huge cash reserves, and may take years to go under or slowly fade away into acquisitions. The shift will be subtle, but notable.\nFarhad: In fact, I ate a delicious lunch at Dropbox just the other day. Grilled mahi-mahi, spinach salad, wheat berries \u2014 it was a like a fancy restaurant. Based on the lunch, it\u2019s doing fine!\nMike: That said, if you give out exorbitant sums of money to untested idealists for a long enough period of time, you will certainly see spectacular flameouts. Clinkle is a perfectexample, as was the implosion of Fab. Evernote, Jawbone and others are on the watch list. There will be more. There will be blood.\nFarhad: Another big story in tech: This industry is terrible for women. That\u2019s not news, really \u2014 it\u2019s been clear for years that the tech industry hires and promotes women at a far lower rate than men. But this year the problem finally got attention in the media and from some of the field\u2019s top execs. Ellen Pao, the former chief executive of Reddit \u2014 itselfa cesspool of misogyny\u2014 sued the venture firm Kleiner Perkins for alleged gender discrimination during the years she worked there.Pao lost the case, but the lurid descriptions of sexism that surfaced during the trial cast an ugly light on the industry. So, do you think the case, or the attention, will change anything for women in tech?\nMike:I think the Pao case, and subsequent fallout, certainly raised the profile of systemic and longstanding problems of gender and race discrimination in the Valley. That folks are discussing it more openly now is undoubtedly a good thing.\nBut this stuff runs deep. There are many, many people in Silicon Valley who believe it is, and always should be, a pure meritocracy, where advancement is race- and gender-blind and should be judged solely on the quality of work. That sort of attitude, while not always professed in public, will take years to unravel. And I\u2019m not sure that those currently in power see much incentive to make those sorts of changes, except for public relations purposes.\nNot to be a downer, but my outlook is not so good here for the short term. Maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s a chance in the long term for change if the issue isn\u2019t just a \u201cdu jour\u201d menu item.\nFarhad: I guess I disagree, but only slightly. I think you\u2019re right that this should be a long-term commitment for tech companies. Talking to many of the big tech firms about this issue over the past year, I got a sense that they\u2019re not just paying lip service to diversity. But maybe I\u2019m just easy to fool.\nMike: I hope you\u2019re right! I really do.\nLast thing we should address: The inexorable rise of Uber, the ride-hailing company I seem to spend all my time covering. They\u2019re valued at $62.5 billion, have raised more than $10 billion, and seem to be taking over the world faster thanStar Wars mania.\nAnd yet, I think the mainstream \u2014 that is, those who are not insufferable coastal elitists like ourselves \u2014 really have just begun to wake up to the phenomenon that is ride hailing. Sure, I may take an Uber from Manhattan home to Brooklyn at 2 a.m., but I doubt my folks in Fort Worth are doing the same thing. Also, they don\u2019t stay out that late.\nSo what do you think hails for Uber in 2016? What\u2019s the next big challenge on their horizon?\nFarhad:There are two key questions, I think. The first is whether they can put a meaningful dent in car ownership and use. As they begin to expand services like UberPool, which allows multiple people to ride together at low prices, will they start to convince some people that getting around in Ubers is much cheaper than owning a car? If that happens \u2014 and it seems possible in cities, but an open question in suburbs \u2014 Uber could be far larger than it is now.\nThe second question is whether the international expansion works. The company is spending huge amounts to replicate its success in the United States across the world, but it faces stiff competition and skeptical regulators. In 2016, we may begin to see signs that the expansion is panning out \u2014 or whether it\u2019s a costly failure.\nBut next year is still two weeks away. Until then, pal. Happy holidays!\nMike:Same to you, sir! May our 2016 be filled with many more jocular exchanges and occasional insights.\nThe Saturday tech newsletter will be on hiatus until Jan. 9."

        "fulltext": "ByVALERIYA SAFRONOVADEC. 17, 2015\nFor some people, 2015 was the year of the Apple Watch. \u201cHamilton\u201d was all others could talk about. Still others fixated on Cookie\u2019s one-liners, Harper Lee\u2019s long-forgotten novel, emoji, Caitlyn Jenner, Kanye West\u2019s high-fashion line and so on. All in all, things happened. Many things. So many that electing to ignore one or two or possibly several of them was inevitable, and perhaps healthy. In this age of information overload, a selection of prominent citizens tell us what they skipped, and why.Related Article\nI\u2019m theNo. 1theater junkie. The idea that I haven\u2019t seen\u201cHamilton\u201dyet is nuts. People want to talk to me about it,and I\u2019m like\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201dand they\u2019re like,\u201cWhat?\u201dI\u2019m just too busy. My oldest child has seen it \u2014 plays me songs, explains the plot to me. But I still haven\u2019t seen it. But come January,I will be there. New Year\u2019s resolution.\nI haven\u2019t watched \u201cEmpire.\u201d I just am so knee-deep in shows. And there\u2019s like 22 episodes, so it\u2019s a big thing to get into. But I actually want to see a couple of episodes because I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s great, and I love everybody in the show.It\u2019s watched by like 11 million people or something. If we can get the commercial-break audience from that show to watch our show, life would be different.\nIt seems like every time I turn on the television, there\u2019s another shooting. And they go, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not the guns, it\u2019s the people with the guns.\u201dSo I find that issue at this point somewhat intractable and therefore I do tendtoavoid it.\nThe biggest thing I decided to skip is the Trump craze. When you\u2019re a New Yorker, Donald Trump is a staple part of the city. He\u2019s like the crazy uncle. Why I came to this country and why I love it so much is diversity. Diversity of thought, of people. So when I hear about loudmouths screaming at journalists or hating women or calling our president stupid, I check out.\nI did try to watch\u201cEmpire,\u201dbut that was never going to take for me. I watched one episode and then I tried to watch the second one, but I wasn\u2019t stoned, so it didn\u2019t work as well. Everybody is talking about this book \u201cFates and Furies,\u201d and I started reading it and I thought it was so silly. Then I saw in Peoplemagazine that Obama had read it, and I thought,\u201cWait a second, if he read this book, I must not have gotten far enough.\u201dI was swayed by the idea that maybe Barack Obama was reading it,and then I went back and thought:\u201cNo,I don\u2019t really care if he read this or not. I still can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI sat out the Apple Watch. I was launching The List App, so I made it my business to be up on all the new technology and all the new platforms. I am someone who checks my phone constantly when I\u2019m with people, and I\u2019m told that\u2019s the rudest thing you can do. Except there\u2019s one ruder thing you can do, which is to check your watch while talking to somebody. So the AppleWatch combines the two rudest activities you can do into one activity.\nI sat out on \u201cGo Set a Watchman.\u201d After \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d became so huge, if there had been the possibility of another great book there that an editor could see, the first thing any editor will do is go to the author,\u201cHey, let\u2019s capitalize on this.\u201dThe fact that that didn\u2019t happen just made me think that this was a draft that was never meant to see the light of day, and it looked like a tawdry cash grab. A lot of authors have ashoe-boxnovel. It\u2019s something you wrote that should never leave theshoe box\u2014 you know it, your agent knows it, your publisher knows it. I wonder how many authors actually trashed their shoe boxes after \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d came out. Or left notes on things saying,\u201cThis is not to be published\u201d or \u201cNot to be sold\u201d or \u201cNot to be readby anyone.\u201d It\u2019s sort of a doomsday scenario. You can\u2019t control the marketing, the narrative, the cover. That\u2019s the scary part.\nI missed out on Snapchat, but I don\u2019t care that I missed out. I don\u2019t have a need to vlog every moment of my life. But a friend of mine said,\u201cYou have to follow D.J.Khaled on Snapchat.\u201dI was blown away by how unintentionally funny D.J.Khaled is. I can\u2019t believe I missed the boat for so long. We\u2019re in the same time zone. So I\u2019ll be like,\u201cI wonder what he\u2019s doing this morning.\u201dBut he\u2019s the only person I follow. I don\u2019t post anything myself. I\u2019m really boring. When I eat and hang out and do stuff, I\u2019m a pretty boring person.\nI skipped the Marie Kondo\u201cart of tidying up\u201dphenomenon. It\u2019s kind of how I roll already. I make tons of stuff, but my life motto is,\u201cIf your heirs won\u2019t fight over it, we won\u2019t make it.\u201dIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve been living. I felt that a lot of people were talking about it, and like prefab homes or moving to Portland, it\u2019s a fantasy people have about simplifying their lives. Those are just little emotional escapes from reality. And I have so much stuff, but each and every item means something to me.\nI haven\u2019t seen one episode of\u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dAnd I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m missing the boat there. I\u2019m debating that. It\u2019s always so violent. We did a big story about several characters who were all killed off on the same day, and I thought:\u201cWow. Oh no.\u201d\nI skipped the\u201cMad Men\u201dfinale. I love that show and I love all the performers, and I had sort of dropped off, and I kept thinking,\u201cI\u2019ve got to get caught up.\u201dAnd then I realized it\u2019s just not going to happen. This was a year where whatever dinner you sat down at, someone was like,\u201cDo you watch this show fill-in-the-blank?\u201dAnd if you said no, they were like,\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dAnd my list kept getting longer. By the end of the year, there are now like 20 shows I need to watch. So the\u201cMad Men\u201dfinale came around,and I just had to let that one go.\nI hate owning something that everybody has. Even, for example, Yeezy:$2,500 sweaters, $4,000 coats with holes in them? I would rather go to Gucci.\nThe things I regret I missed: the Amy Winehouse documentary. I don\u2019t know yet who\u201cJessica Jones\u201dis. I hear about these things in the ether, I know they exist, I have three kids who talk about things. But I haven\u2019t found the time to engage. The other one I really need to get into is\u201cTransparent.\u201dAnd I know that\u2019s an important one. A few of my girlfriends are amazing with film, fantastic with art, television. I have such great things passed my way all the time. I can probably talk at a dinner in a very peripheral way, but I really need to take a bite of these things I haven\u2019t had time for yet. The other thing I\u2019m learning more about is the subtext of \u201cNetflix and chill,\u201d which is not just chilling. I was explaining to my 10-year-old that you go to your friend\u2019s house and you chill out and watch Netflix, and my 15-year-old started laughing in the other room, which led me to believe there\u2019s a deeper meaning.\nI didn\u2019t go to the Venice Biennale for the first time in a long time. I feel like these big gigantic exhibitions hold less and less for me as a viewer. I find everything is so big, dizzy, highly produced. There\u2019s so little intimacy in the works of art. I\u2019m not against crowds, I don\u2019t hate the art world, but the type of art that\u2019s generally featured in these exhibitions is not enriching enough for me to travel halfway around the world. I think it\u2019s become kind of generic for me.\nI missed the Caitlyn Jenner interview. I was out to dinner,and all of a sudden people started texting me,tweeting,tumbling, wondering what my opinion is. It was the first time I had ever had something specific about my identity or background implicated in this big cultural moment. I was implicated in this interview with a former Olympic athlete turned reality TV star. I guess I was the trans person people reach out to in these cases. Prior to this interview, people didn\u2019t know she was trans yet. People suspected it, but it\u2019s not like I was marking my calendar as this special trans day.\nIt seems that every few weeks,a new iteration on the contouring trend evolves. Everything from strobing (highlighting/reverse contouring),baking (the process of letting makeup set after applying powder) to the most extreme incarnation\u2014clown contouring (using contour makeup/color correctors to create designs like clown face paint, and in some cases sugar skulls and cat faces).\nWhile I skipped the clown contouring phenomenon, I love a creative transformation, and clearly I have never been one to shy away from unconventional, over-the-top trends.\nThis year I skipped all the awards shows because there\u2019s way more important stuff going on in the world in terms of social justice, geopolitics, local politics, U.S. politics. I skipped Tidal because I don\u2019t need another music service. There are too many. And it didn\u2019t have the most successful launch. I skipped the new James Bond because I heard terrible things about it. I stopped walking on crosstown streets like Canal, Chambers, 14thStreet and 72ndStreet. I find them really oppressive and ugly.\nI\u2019m such a sucker for the hot new thing. I marked the Adele album\u2019s drop date on my calendar as if it\u2019s a national holiday. IWhipped andNaeNaed my little heart out. But I skip a lot of electronic hype. I would still be using my clickwheel iPod if I could. I marvel at, but will never step on, a hoverboard. What is that craziness? I didn\u2019t hop onto the Periscope game. There are so many social outlets for your face and your words and thoughts, I don\u2019t know what I would do with another one.\nThe food trend I skipped out on this year is sitting through four-hour,50-course tasting menus. We did it for a little while at one of our restaurants years ago,and just doing it turned me off. I\u2019ve eaten so many of these incredibly precious, many, many hourlong meals. I would rather just eat at a \u201cnormal\u201d restaurant. It\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s generally not delicious because it\u2019s so manipulated and played with and you rarely get food hot. It\u2019s food that\u2019s made to look pretty. It\u2019s a wow-Instagram moment,and you put it in your mouth and think,\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\nPeople started wearing vests again. I skipped it. I can\u2019t fit my love handles into a vest and make my body look not like an upside-down cupcake.\nI missed Eric Church, Chris Stapleton, this whole new wave of country that\u2019s not really country. You know:The country star who goes out of their way to tell you how noncountry they are but they still have jeans with a million rhinestones on the pocket.\nI also skipped Cuba being free. I was walking by a Best Buy and saw on the news that it\u2019s easier to go to Cuba now, and I was like,\u201cOh, cool.\u201dNo one in my life proposed a trip to Cuba. Jews, when we go on vacation, countries with conflicts are never high on our list. I don\u2019t know the history of Cuba and Jews, but I haveafeeling there\u2019s some trouble for me there.\nIwatched the first couple of episodes, and I thought everyone was nuts. I didn\u2019t understand why I was supposed to like the British girl. It wasn\u2019t resonating. And it was like:\u201cOh, great. Let me just sit here with my husband and watch people cheating on each other and being happy about it.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t sound productive.\nAdvertisement"
