        "title": "Russia Intensifies Censorship Campaign, Pressuring Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "As Russia attacks Ukraine, the authorities in Moscow are intensifying a censorship campaign at home by squeezing some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.\nLast week, Russian authorities warned Google, Meta, Apple, Twitter, TikTok and others that they had until the end of this month to comply with a new law that requires them to set up legal entities in the country. The so-called landing law makes the companies and their employees more vulnerable to Russia\u2019s legal system and the demands of government censors, legal experts and civil society groups said.\nThe moves are part of a Russian pressure campaign against foreign technology companies. Using the prospect offines,arrestsand theblocking or slowing downof internet services, the authorities are pushing the companies to censor unfavorable material online while keeping pro-Kremlin media unfiltered.\nApple, TikTok and Spotify have complied with the landing law, according to the Russian internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, and Google has taken steps to do so as well. Twitch and Telegram have not. Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Twitter have complied with some parts of the law but not others.\nThe situation puts the tech companies in a bind, caught between their public support for free expression and privacy and their work in countries with authoritarian leaders. It has forced them to weigh having their services available in Russia againstleaving altogether.\nIncreasingly, the companies are facing pressure from Ukrainian officials and U.S. lawmakers to limit their involvement in Russia. Ukraine\u2019s vice prime minister has asked Apple, Google, Netflix and Meta to restrict access to their services inside Russia. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Meta, Reddit, Telegram and others, urging them to not let Russian entities use their platforms to sow confusion about the war.\nThe companies are facing contradictory demands from all over the globe. Censorship issues that were once isolated to China, which is home to perhaps the world\u2019s most restrictive internet, have spread to Russia, Turkey, Belarus, Myanmar and elsewhere as some of them try to build a more tightly controlled web.\nFor Russia, censoring the internet isn\u2019t easy. While China has built a series of filters known as the Great Firewall around its internet, Russia\u2019s internet is more open, and U.S. tech platforms are widely used in the country. To change that, the Russian government hasbuilt new technical methodsfor blocking content, which it used last year to throttle access to Twitter.\nNow Russia is expected to ramp up pressure on the tech companies as the authorities try to control what information is disseminated about the war in Ukraine. Russians have used Facebook, Instagram and other foreign social media outlets to criticize the conflict, stoking concerns of a crackdown on the platforms.\nOn Friday, Roskomnadzor said it would restrict access to Facebook by slowing down traffic. The regulator said the social network had interfered with several pro-Kremlin media outlets.\nNick Clegg, Meta\u2019s top policy executive,saidthe company had refused Russian demands that it stop independent fact-checking of posts from four state-owned media organizations. The company said it wouldbar Russian state media from running adson the social network.\nTwitter, which had said it waspausing adsin Ukraine and Russia, said on Saturday that itsservice was also being restrictedfor some people in Russia. On Sunday, Roskomnadzor also demanded that Google lift restrictions on some Russian media outlets after the company had limited their ability to make money from advertising on YouTube.\nThe clampdown \u201cis an attempt by the Russian government to increase control over these companies and the content online in Russia,\u201d said Pavel Chikov, a human rights lawyer in Russia who specializes in censorship cases. \u201cThe Russian government will be pushing them, step by step, to go further down this road.\u201d\nWestern companies and organizations are just beginning to sort out their ties to Russia in light ofsanctionsintended to economically isolate the country.Energy companiesare grappling with the possibility of reduced supplies of oil and natural gas. Food producers are facing a potentialshortfall of Russian and Ukrainian wheat. Even European soccer clubs have dropped sponsorships from Russian companies, with a majorchampionship match movingfrom St. Petersburg to Paris.\nThe situation is especially fraught for tech companies. Apple and Google control the software on almost every smartphone in Russia and have employees there. YouTube, Instagram and TikTok are popular sites that are used to get information outside state-run media. Telegram, the messaging app that started in Russia and is now based in Dubai after disputes with the government, is one of the country\u2019s more popular communication tools.\nThe new landing law is a move by the Kremlin to counter attempts by the tech companies to minimize their physical presences in Russia. The law, which took effect on Jan. 1, requires foreign websites and social media platforms that have over 500,000 daily users to register as legal entities in the country, with a locally based leader. It also requires the companies to register an account with Roskomnadzor and to create an electronic form for Russian citizens or government authorities to contact the companies with complaints.\nEstablishing more of a local presence makes the companies vulnerable to intimidation by the government, human rights and civil society groups have warned, leading some to call it the \u201chostage law.\u201d Last year, the Russian authorities threatened to arrest employees of Google and Apple to force them to remove an app created by supporters ofAleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader.\n\u201cThe Russian government would like to have embassies of those companies in Russia,\u201d said Aleksandr Litreev, who worked with Mr. Navalny and is the chief executive of Solar Labs, a maker of software to circumvent online censorship. \u201cThey would like to have a way to pull a lever to manipulate information and how it is spreading around the internet.\u201d\nIn November, the governmentlisted13 companies that must comply with the new landing law: Meta, Twitter, TikTok, Likeme, Pinterest, Viber, Telegram, Discord, Zoom, Apple, Google, Spotify and Twitch.\nOn Feb. 16, a Roskomnadzor official said companies that did not comply by the end of the month would face penalties. In addition to fines and possible shutdowns or slowdowns, the penalties could disrupt ad sales, search engine operations, data collection and payments, according to the law.\n\u201cFor those companies that have not started the procedure for \u2018landing\u2019 we will consider the issue of applying measures before the end of this month,\u201d Vadim Subbotin, deputy head of Roskomnadzor, told the Russian Parliament, according to Russian media.\nMeta said that while it was taking steps to comply with the new landing law, it had not changed how it reviewed government demands to take down content. Apple, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the law. TikTok, Telegram, Spotify and the other targeted companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nHuman-rights and free-speech groups said they were disappointed that some of the tech companies, often viewed inside Russia as less beholden to the government, were complying with the law without public protest.\n\u201cThe ulterior motive behind the adoption of the landing law is to create legal grounds for extensive online censorship by silencing remaining opposition voices and threatening freedom of expression online,\u201d said Joanna Szymanska, an expert on Russian internet censorship efforts at Article 19, a civil society group based in London.\nMr. Chikov, who has represented companies including Telegram in cases against the Russian government, said he met with Facebook last year to discuss its Russia policies. Facebook executives sought advice on whether to pull out of Russia, he said, including cutting off access to Facebook and Instagram. The company complied with the laws instead.\nMr. Chikov urged the tech companies to speak out against the Russian demands, even if it results in a ban, to set a wider precedent about fighting censorship.\n\u201cThere have been times when the big tech companies have been leaders in terms of not only technology but also in civil liberties and freedom of expression and privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they behave more like big transnational corporations securing their business interests.\u201d\nAnton TroianovskiandOleg Matsnevcontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple says it will make AirTags easier to find after complaints of stalking.",
        "fulltext": "Apple said on Thursday that it would make improvements to its AirTag devices to make it more difficult for people to use them to track others without their knowledge.\nAirTags, tiny discs that Apple started selling for $29 last year to help people keep track of items like keys, wallets and phones, have become a headache for the company. People have said on social media andin interviewsthat they have found the devices hidden on their cars and belongings, leading them to fear they were being stalked.\nAirTags use Bluetooth technology to ping nearby Apple devices, which then report the last known location of the AirTag to whatever device is using it to track something. Apple said some built-in features, like beeping automatically and notifying iPhones that an AirTag is nearby, could help prevent abuse, but privacy experts and those who feared they had been stalked said the features were not enough because they do not easily help people who carry phones that use Google\u2019s Android software.\nLaw enforcement officials have warned that the devices could be used in attempts to steal cars. And women have said they have found AirTags hidden on their cars and in their possessions, and sometimes have called the police. One woman, Ashley Estrada,told The New York Timesthat she had recently received a notification that an AirTag had been tracking her for four hours across Los Angeles, and that she had eventually found the device lodged behind her car\u2019s license plate. \u201cI felt so violated,\u201d Ms. Estrada said.\nApple\u2019schanges, which will be introduced this year, include the ability for someone who receives an alert that an AirTag is nearby to use his or her iPhone to find the AirTag through a \u201ccombination of sound, haptics and visual feedback.\u201d\nUsers\u2019 devices will display an alert when a nearby AirTag emits a sound, in case the sound cannot be heard, and people will have the option to make AirTag beeps louder so they can more easily find the tracking device. Apple said it would also improve its alert system so that iPhones tell people sooner that unknown AirTags may be traveling with them.\nEva Galperin, a cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who studies so-calledstalkerware, said that the changes were \u201cimprovements\u201d but that Apple needed to take more steps to prevent abuse, such as working with Google to extend protection to Android phones.\nCurrent fixes, such as an Android app that allows users to scan for AirTags, require people to proactively check rather than passively monitor whether they are being tracked.\n\u201cAirTag was designed to help people locate their personal belongings, not to track people or another person\u2019s property, and we condemn in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products,\u201d Apple said in a news release.\nApple added that it was aware of \u201creports of bad actors attempting to misuse AirTag for malicious or criminal purposes.\u201d The company said it had worked with safety groups and law enforcement officials to identify needed changes, but declined to comment beyond its statement."

        "title": "I Used Apple AirTags, Tiles and a GPS Tracker to Watch My Husband\u2019s Every Move",
        "fulltext": "In mid-January, my husband and I were having an argument. Our 1-year-old had just tested positive for Covid-19 and was occasionally grunting between breaths. I called urgent care and was told we should take her to the emergency room. But, because I had been up all night with her, I was too exhausted to drive.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d I told my husband. \u201cI want you to take her to the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cDoctors always tell us to take the baby to the E.R. whenever we call about anything,\u201d he replied, exasperated. (This was true.) \u201cShe is fine. She is eating and playing and happy. This is not an emergency.\u201d\nHe eventually caved and set out for the hospital a half-hour away. Knowing he was already annoyed by me, I did not want to pepper him with questions about how it was going.\nInstead, I turned to the location-monitoring devices that I had secretly stashed in our car a week earlier.\nI put a quarter-sized Apple AirTag in a seat pocket; a flat, credit card-shaped Bluetooth tracker made by Tile in a dashboard pocket; and a hockey-puck-like GPS tracker from a company called LandAirSea in the glove compartment.\nI realize I sound like the worst wife ever, so let me explain. It was for journalism.\nApple released chic, sleek AirTags early last year as a way to keep track of keys and purses. Given the company\u2019s history of introducing products \u2014 such as the original iPhone \u2014 that lead to mass adoption, AirTags could well lead consumers to location trackeverythingall the time, so that nothing is ever lost again, ushering in a surveillance state with the cleanest of aesthetics.\nBut every new convenience comes with a price: In recent months, people have freaked out after finding AirTags hiddenin their bags and on their cars. They were scared about being stalked or followed by someone wanting to steal their vehicles. A Sports Illustrated model, Brooks Nader, said shefound onein her coat pocket after visiting a Manhattan bar. All these people received warnings on their iPhones, a feature Apple had built into the AirTag system to help prevent unwanted tracking.\nWhen my colleague and Ireported on this, experts we spoke with were of two minds about Apple\u2019s attempts to prevent nefarious use, with some saying the alerts were inadequate and others praising the company for unearthing a larger problem: widespread surreptitious tracking, usually done with devices that don\u2019t notify a person of their presence.\nI decided to examine both claims by planting three AirTags, three Tiles, and a GPS tracker on my husband and his belongings to see how precisely they revealed his movements and which ones he discovered.\nSome states, including New York, where we live, havelawscriminalizing this sort of thing. Not wanting to break the law, or my husband\u2019s trust, I had asked him for permission.\nIt was not the first time I had subjected him to my brand of experimental reporting. I\u2019ve been covering privacy for more than a decade, and have found that the best way to concretely explain the dystopian implications of new technologies is to immerse myself in them, guinea pig-style.\nMy husband haslived on Bitcoinwith me, been spied on byour \u201csmart home,\u201d and watched megive up the tech giants. (He would not give them up himself, saying, \u201cI have a job,\u201d but he agreed to unplug our Amazon Echo.) He also happens to be a professional press freedom advocate, so I was fairly certain he\u2019d be game.\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be boring. We\u2019re in a pandemic. I never go anywhere.\u201d\nOur lives are certainly less exciting these days. We see practically no one but each other or my in-laws. On top of a pandemic, it\u2019s winter here in the Northeast, so we\u2019re home most of the time. But my husband does occasionally leave the house, and I wanted to track him when he did.\nWhen an editor proposed sending a photographer to surreptitiously follow him in person one day \u2014 to show visually the movements I was tracking digitally \u2014 a small part of me worried I might discover something I didn\u2019t want to know. A little privacy is good for any marriage.\nThirty minutes after my husband and youngest departed for the hospital, I opened an app linked to the most precise tracker in my arsenal, the $30 LandAirSea device. To activate it costs extra, because it needs a cellular plan to relay where global positioning satellites have placed it. I chose the cheapest plan, $19.95 monthly, to get location updates every three minutes; the most expensive plan, for updates every three seconds, was $49.95.\nThe app has an \u201cInstaFence\u201d feature that can alert me when the car moves, and a \u201cPlayback\u201d option to show where the car has been, so I could see the exact route on windy roads my husband had taken. I saw that he parked at 4:55 p.m., so I wasn\u2019t surprised when I got a text from him 12 minutes later reporting that they were in the waiting room.\nThe other trackers in the car \u2014 the $34.99 Tile and $29 AirTag \u2014 didn\u2019t work as well in real time out in the sparsely populated area where we live. The AirTag, designed to find keys left behind \u201cat the beach,\u201d took an hour or so to reveal that the car was in the hospital parking lot. The Tile, intended to \u201cfind misplaced things nearby and far away,\u201d never realized it had moved from our garage. That\u2019s because these devices rely on Bluetooth technology.\nRather than communing with satellites circling the planet, they ping devices within 30 or so feet of them, such as the smartphone held by another person standing in line at the pharmacy. To help track down AirTags, Apple enlisted, per itsown description, \u201chundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac devices all over the world.\u201d That meant the AirTag\u2019s effectiveness skyrocketed the day my husband traveled to New York City, because he was surrounded by people carrying iPhones.\nYes, the internet of things \u2014ourthings \u2014 is coming alive around us, digitally frisking us as we walk by to see if we\u2019re carrying anything of interest.\nThe day before his trip, when I knew he was far from the house, thanks to the car trackers, I sneaked into his office and hid an AirTag, a Tile and the GPS tracker in various pockets of his backpack. This felt incredibly invasive, and was the moment I felt most conflicted about the experiment.\nIt was a good thing I did, though, because he wound up switching coats that day, and not wearing the one I had originally loaded up with devices. When he got into Manhattan, the AirTag became my most powerful tracker, outperforming the GPS device, and allowing me to tell a photographer exactly where he was at all times.\nThe Tile tracker was not quite as well-informed. Its system is similar to Apple\u2019s but far fewer people have the Tile app on their phones than own Apple devices. Forty million Tiles have been sold, the companysaidlast year.\nAnother key difference between Tile and AirTag is that if an iPhone detects an unknown AirTag continuously moving with it, the iPhone owner gets a notification, along with a map showing where the tracking started. (Android owners, meanwhile, have to download aspecial appto look for AirTags. Tile said it planned to releasea similar appfor people worried about unwanted tracking.)\nWithin two hours of my putting all the trackers in our car, my husband, who has an iPhone, got an alert about the AirTag, after running an errand.\nThe problem was that he couldn\u2019t find it. The alert said he could make the AirTag play a sound, but when he attempted to do so, his phone wouldn\u2019t connect to the device. This happened multiple times, and he started to get frustrated. \u201cIs it in my shoe?\u201d he asked me at one point, taking his blue Nike off and peering at it. \u201cYou have to tell me. I don\u2019t want to destroy my shoe looking for it.\u201d\nThe one time his iPhone connected to the AirTag in the car, so he could play the noise, it was so hard to tell where it was coming from that he gave up looking for it after five minutes.\nThe critics were right: Apple\u2019s safeguards against nefarious use weren\u2019t foolproof.\nApple itself has realized the inadequacy of its safeguards andannounced improvementsthis week, including making the devices louder and telling AirTag users that tracking someone without consent is a crime.\nMy husband, of course, had agreed to this in principle, but didn\u2019t realize just how many devices I had planted on him. Of the seven trackers, he found only two: a Tile he felt in the breast pocket of his coat and an AirTag in his backpack when he was looking for something else. \u201cIt is impossible to find a device that makes no noise and gives no warning,\u201d he said, when I showed him the ones he missed.\nAlyson Messenger, a lawyer in Los Angeles who works with survivors of domestic violence, said she knew of two women stalked by former partners with AirTags. She thinks other cases are \u201cflying under the radar.\u201d\nAn abuser could also put spyware on a person\u2019s phone to track them, but that requires time, access and knowing their passcode. With these location-tracking devices, a person \u201cjust needs to get close enough to a victim or their property to place them,\u201d Ms. Messenger said. \u201cIt\u2019s insidious because the devices are so discreet and unnoticeable. We suspect it is happening and victims don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe AirTag and Tile are marketed to find lost things, but LandAirSea describes the purpose of its GPS tracker somewhat differently. \u201cThe ultimate in discreet tracking,\u201dits Amazon pagebrags, where it is ranked asthe best sellingGPS tracker. \u201cKeep track of movement in real-time with your very own private eye.\u201d\nThe first time I ordered a LandAirSea tracker on Amazon, the device for finding things, incredibly, got lost in the mail. I got a refund and reordered. When it did arrive, I opened its plain white box to find instructions for setting it up, but no information on the legal implications of using the device.\nOn the inside bottom of the box, there was a message designed to look handwritten: \u201cWe are a small family business so your review would mean the world to us!\u201d Many of those online reviews explicitly discuss users\u2019 secretly tracking loved ones.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using this to find out if your spouse is cheating on you. Please have a mental health plan for the aftermath,\u201d someone named Jason wrote in a five-star Amazon review posted on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI bought this with the intent to find out where my wife was going after work every night and random \u2018me\u2019 days she was having. Turns out it was another guy.\u201d\nA one-star review posted on the company\u2019s site a few months ago, by someone claiming to be 16, declared a GPS tracker secretly placed on his car by his father \u201ctoo easy to find.\u201d \u201cYour parents didn\u2019t track you, don\u2019t track us,\u201d the teen admonished.\nWith my LandAirSea tracker updating me on my husband\u2019s every trip to the grocery store and detour to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for a coffee, I wanted to talk to someone at the company about the product. Jared Zientz, the director of analytics there since 2020, told me that the Illinois-based LandAirSea was founded 26 years ago, originally to track airplanes.\nI asked Mr. Zientz about how LandAirSea dealt with people using its devices for unwanted spying.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that comes up,\u201d Mr. Zientz said. \u201cPeople call in, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I found this on my car. What are you going to do about it?\u2019\u201d\nThe company, which sells about 15,000 devices per month, according to Mr. Zientz, tells these callers they should go to the police, because they will need a subpoena to determine who owns the device they discovered. He estimated that the company received approximately 30 subpoenas per year.\nMr. Zientz said many people arrive at these products after searching online for \u201cspouse tracker,\u201d but that the company was trying to discourage this by marketing the device for \u201casset protection\u201d and \u201cfleet management.\u201d I asked Mr. Zientz why the company didn\u2019t have any messaging about the legality of its devices on its website or in its packaging.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our terms somewhere,\u201d he said. (He was referring to boilerplate language on the LandAirSeawebsiteforbidding using it for \u201cany unlawful purpose.\u201d) \u201cEach state has different laws so we can\u2019t even broadly say, \u2018this is illegal,\u2019 or whatever,\u201d he added.\nMr. Zientz said he had tried out Apple\u2019s AirTags, in part to see whether they might encroach on LandAirSea\u2019s business. \u201cMe and my girlfriend both had them in our luggage,\u201d he said. Because they worked only with iPhones, he didn\u2019t see them as a threat. Since AirTags have come out, LandAirSea has actually sold more trackers, according to Mr. Zientz, a bump he attributed to anuptick in car theft.\nAsked for comment about my experiment, a Tile spokesman, Scott Coriell said, \u201cTile is designed to help people find their things, not for tracking people.\u201d He said using a Tile like this violates the terms of use and \u201ccan result in a permanent ban from Tile.\u201d\nThe day after I asked Apple for comment, the company released \u201can update on AirTag and unwanted tracking.\u201d \u201cUnwanted tracking has long been a societal problem, and we took this concern seriously in the design of AirTag,\u201d Apple said in the statement.\nThere are certainly plenty of legitimate uses for this technology. Having a tracker in a teen\u2019s car,withtheir knowledge and consent, can provide peace of mind to a parent. Bluetooth trackers helped a familykeep a moving company honestand locateda stolen car. But Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, thinks the devices are \u201ctoo ripe for abuse\u201d to exist.\n\u201cNo one should be able to buy a tool to track their loved ones this easily and this cheaply,\u201d Mr. Cahn said. There are already state laws against this, but Mr. Cahn said that prohibitions won\u2019t stop bad actors.\n\u201cAny time you build a product and use threat of prosecution to prevent misuse, that\u2019s a fig leaf, not a real deterrent,\u201d he said. Mr. Cahn thinks the devices shouldn\u2019t be available at all.\nWithin an hour of our daughter getting to the hospital, a nurse had checked her oxygen levels and declared them \u201creally good.\u201d\nThe reason I was allowed to share this tale of marital strife is that my husband was correct: We did not need to take our toddler to the hospital. The doctor even said so after reviewing an X-ray of her lungs and declaring her fine. At 7:17 p.m., my husband texted that they were heading home. I watched their progress on my app.\nHe was also right about the tracking overall being pretty boring. There were no surprises about where he went. The biggest surprise to me was how nerve-racking it felt to surveil him, and how guilty I felt about what he didn\u2019t know, such as the photographer tailing him. It was a relief when it was over, and I let my husband read a draft of this article.\n\u201cFor all the bad press the AirTags have gotten, and as flaky as the detection mechanisms were, at least I was consistently getting notifications they were following me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe privacy dangers of the other trackers were way worse.\u201d\nNow that the article is done, I will stop paying $20 a month for the LandAirSea tracker to report the car\u2019s minute-by-minute movements, but I think I\u2019ll leave the AirTag in it. It will make it easier to find the car in a vast parking lot.\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d my husband said, reading this. \u201cWe are NOT keeping an AirTag in the car.\u201d\nAudio produced byKate Winslett."

        "title": "Is the Metaverse Just Marketing?",
        "fulltext": "From \u201cThe Daily\u201d newsletter:One big idea on the news, from the team that brings you \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast.You can sign up for the newsletter here.\nGoogle the word metaverse.\nAbout 51 million results appear. Headlines announcingstate-backed metaverse investmentsworth billions of dollars pop up, too. And next to all that, in Google\u2019s description for the search term? \u201cFictional world.\u201d\nThe algorithm is right. The metaverse doesn\u2019t yet exist, beyond rudimentary versions in games. But that hasn\u2019t stopped platform companies,including Google itself, frombetting bigthat it will exist soon. These investments are dealing in speculation, banking on the prospect of an enormous, functional and interoperable virtual world wheretech C.E.O.s promisewe will soon work, shop and socialize as digital avatars. The pitch is essentially a technologically improved, personalized version of The Sims.\nThe problem is, the metaverse can\u2019t be manifested with just wishful Silicon Valley thinking. While much of our lives have already shifted online during the pandemic, making those experiences truly immersive at scale is a knotty challenge. The metaverse is currently stalled by a lack of infrastructure (thehardware and software aren\u2019t ready yet), a monopolistic approach to platform development (the metaverse is likely to require moreopenness and collaboration) and a lack of clear governance standards (some experts want to avoid reinscribing thepitfalls of social media).\nSo without a functional product, we wanted to know, what\u2019s with all the hype and the headlines? Is the metaverse just marketing,as our tech columnist Kevin Roose asked?\nIf this moment feels familiar, that\u2019s because it is: A fictive metaverse future has beenfloated since the early 1990sby authors and technologists dreaming of an era when our virtual lives would be as important as our physical realities.\nFor the last few decades, the idea has remained fringe. But slowly, it has seeped into the collective consciousness.\nThe growing popularity of gaming helped introduce the idea of a digital second life to the general public, allowing people to have immersive social experiences in digital worlds. New technology, includingvirtual realityheadsets, facilitated these experiences, and movies like \u201cReady Player One\u201d helped viewers imagine the possibility of a metaverse.\nWhen \u201cReady Player One\u201d came out in 2018, the metaverse still felt like a distant, potentially dystopian possibility. Then the pandemic accelerated the digitization of nearly everything, including schooling, working, socializing and exercising. Now, one poll estimates that at the current level of technological consumption, the average American will spend up to44 years of his or her life staring at a screen.\n\u201cThese things that were very fringe and dismissed as kind of a crazy thing or ridiculed or ignored \u2014 now suddenly, at some point, they just start to seem like common sense,\u201d said Nick Bostrom, the Oxford University philosopher best known for developingsimulation theory.\nAs the prospect of the metaverse has been dawning, slowly, on the general public, technology companies have been competing behind the scenes to realize it for years. Platform companies have been quietly racing to develop their own version of the metaverse, specifically by acquiring companies with useful hardware assets.\nFacebook first bought Oculus, the VR gaming company, in 2014. Five years later, the company acquiredCTRL-Labs, which developed a wristband capable of transmitting electrical signals from the brain to a computer. Then, amid a public relations crisis late last year, Facebook announced it would rebrand itself, renaming its parent company Meta, with some critics wondering whether the name change was just astrategic marketing move.\nMatthew Ball, an expert on the metaverse, is less cynical about the name change. \u201cI think it is significant, less as a marketing term and more as a signal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s marketing because marketing is primarily oriented toward a product that\u2019s available for sale,\u201d which he argues the metaverse isn\u2019t \u2014 yet.\nIf the brand shift was a signal intended to set trends, establish ambitions and allocate resources, it worked. Soon after the Meta announcement, Microsoft placed a major bet that people would be spending more and more time in the digital world, with its $70 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, a social gaming company. Apple is reportedlydeveloping its own consumer VR headset.\nNow, founders, investors, futurists and executives are all trying to stake their claim in the metaverse, expounding on its potential for social connection, experimentation, entertainment and, crucially, profit.\nEven if the metaverse envisioned by Mark Zuckerbergdoes not come to fruition by 2026, some argue a more immersive digital future is inevitable.\nMr. Bostrom expects that technological developments, such as \u201cmore realistic computer graphics\u201d and advances in artificial intelligence, will continue to incentivize user engagement with immersive digital realities.\u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s ultimately going to normalize it,\u201d he said.\nAnd while the metaverse is largely hypothetical, experts argue that now is the moment for the public to focus on another speculative prospect: what standards they might want to govern the next digital transition. According to Mr. Bostrom, this moment presents an opportunity for the public to consider \u201cthefuture of humanity and existential risks and how new technologies might change the human condition.\u201d\nThis is a question few were asking in the early 2000s. \u201cWe\u2019re 15 years into the social media era,\u201d Mr. Ball, the metaverse expert, said, \u201cand there are a lot of problems from exactly that transition which remain unsolved. Data rights, data security, data understanding, radicalization, disinformation, platform power, platform regulation, unhappiness.\u201d Without strategic reforms, he added, \u201cthose problems will become harder\u201d in the future.\nSpecifically, many experts are concerned about the heightened prospect that misinformation will appear real in the metaverse, the omnipotence of companies controlling this new reality and the bias and surveillance concerns of asuperintelligent A.I. tracking users every move.\nBut Mr. Ball believes any moment of transition also creates an opening for reform. \u201cEvery single time that we have these platform shifts, the dominant companies tend to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that the companies can change means that we, as consumers, as voters and users, have an opportunity to affect that shift.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you were around 16, what was the song that taught you about love?\u201d Anna Martin, the new host of the \u201cModern Love\u201d podcast, asks on the season premiere this week.\nThe episode is all about teenage love. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a teenager, you have a lot of feelings \u2014 it comes with the territory,\u201d Anna explains. \u201cYou put on your headphones, and you sink into a song about heartbreak and loneliness and longing and love.\u201d\nForLisa Selin Davis, author of the essay \u201cWhat Lou Reed Taught Me About Love,\u201d the song \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d became the soundtrack to her summer romance in the \u201980s with a floppy-haired \u201crocker kid\u201d who inadvertently helped her find healing.\nIsabelia Herrera, an arts critic fellow at The Times, recalls how \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9 came out right before her quincea\u00f1era \u2014 a milestone in her womanhood. \u201cI knew that I was going to go onto the dance floor and scream the lyrics by myself, and I just hoped that people would follow me,\u201d Isabelia said.

        "title": "A Change by Apple Is Tormenting Internet Companies, Especially Meta",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s vision of a more private web is not necessarily a more profitable one for internet companies that depend on advertising revenue.\nThat lesson was clear on Wednesday in anearnings report from Meta,the company that Mark Zuckerberg founded as Facebook. Meta said that privacy features introduced by Apple last year could cost Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s company $10 billion in lost sales this year.\nThe news, along with increased spending as Meta tries to focus on the new idea of a metaverse, dropped Meta\u2019s stock price more than 26 percent on Thursday morning. Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday that Apple\u2019s changes and new privacy regulations in Europe represented \u201ca clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalized ads.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s warning and its cratering stock price were reminders that even among tech giants, Apple holds extraordinary sway because of its control of the iPhone. And the tech industry received a clear notice that a long-planned shift inhow people\u2019s information may be used onlinewas having a dramatic impact on Madison Avenue and internet companies that have spent years building businesses around selling ads.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t really be targeted the way they were before,\u201d said Eric Seufert, a media strategist and author ofMobile Dev Memo, a blog about mobile advertising. \u201cThat breaks the model. It\u2019s not just an inconvenience that can be fixed with a couple of tweaks. It requires rebuilding the foundation of the business.\u201d\nOther internet companies that depend on ads felt the tremors, too. But smaller outfits appear to have been more nimble than Meta in their response to Apple\u2019s changes.\nShares in Snap, which reported its fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, fell about 17 percent earlier in the day. But prices bounced back in after-hours trading after the company said it made its first profit. The share prices of Twitter and Pinterest also dropped after Meta\u2019s earnings report, but recovered in after-hours trading Thursday after Pinterest also reported better-than-expected earnings.\nApple\u2019s changes have far-reaching repercussions that may hurt consumers\u2019 wallets, Mr. Seufert said, though consumers are overwhelmingly choosing not to be tracked. While Meta and other big media companies have developed new methods to target people with ads, some smaller brands, whose ads can no longer reach new customers, have found a different solution to the problem: raise prices.\nApple made significant changes to the privacy settings of its mobile operating system last year, allowing iPhone users tochoose whether advertisers could track them. Since Apple introduced the feature, a vast majority of iPhone users have opted to block tracking.\nOnly 24 percent of iPhone users around the world have consented to being tracked by advertisers, according todatapublished in December by the analytics company Flurry. That means that a broad swath of iPhone users are evading the personal tracking preferred by advertisers.\nIt has been a dismaying shift for advertisers, which have for years tracked people online in order to determine how many sales their clients were making. Advertisers also rely on tracking to resurface products that consumers have viewed but not yet purchased, reminding them that it might be time to buy. But for privacy activists, the change is a welcome check against surveillance that puts power back into the hands of everyday technology users.\n\u201cWe believe the impact of iOS overall is a headwind on our business in 2022,\u201d said Dave Wehner, Meta\u2019s chief financial officer, during a call with analysts on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s on the order of $10 billion, so it\u2019s a pretty significant headwind for our business.\u201d\nGoogle has also made moves that disrupt the advertising industry. Last month, it announced a proposal for how Chrome, the world\u2019s most widely used web browser, might eventuallyeliminate traditional tracking mechanismsfor serving ads. It introduced a new system, Topics, which would inform advertisers of a user\u2019s areas of interest \u2014 such as \u201cfitness\u201d or \u201cautos and vehicles\u201d \u2014 based on the last three weeks of the user\u2019s web browsing history.\nMeta\u2019s estimated loss because of these limits is comparable to what the company is losing on the metaverse. Meta said its pivot to themetaverse\u2014 which could in theory help it step away from Apple\u2019s influence \u2014 was eating into its profit. The company views the metaverse as the next generation of the internet, in which people will share virtual experiences. It lost more than$10 billionin 2021 as it built the virtual reality goggles and smart glasses that will make it possible for users to access the metaverse.\nAlthough Meta said revenue rose 20 percent in the three months ending in December, to $33.7 billion, compared with the same period a year earlier, the company\u2019s quarterly profits fell 8 percent, to $10.3 billion.\nMr. Wehner added that Apple\u2019s iOS changes buoyed the ad business of Google, which is not dependent on Apple for advertising data.\nSnap, the maker of the Snapchat app and the augmented reality glasses Spectacles, said during its third-quarter earnings report in October that Apple\u2019s privacy changes were having an unexpected impact on its business. But the company is adapting, Snap said in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday, and the biggest impacts from Apple\u2019s change may be behind it.\n\u201cWe are making solid progress,\u201d said Jeremi Gorman, Snap\u2019s chief business officer. The company offers its own measurement tools to advertisers to gauge the impact of their ads, and those tools are now used by more than 75 percent of its direct-response advertisers, Ms. Gorman said.\nIn its earnings report, Snap said that it had exceeded analyst expectations for revenue and user growth. In the last three months of 2021, Snap\u2019s revenue was $1.3 billion, a 42 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Daily active users grew to 319 million, a 20 percent increase. The company profit was $22.5 million.\nSnap\u2019s share price rebounded after the news, shooting up more than 50 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nIn the last three months of the year, Pinterest\u2019s revenue increased to $847 million, up 20 percent from the same period a year ago, the company said on Thursday. Its profit was $175 million, a 16 percent drop from 2020. Pinterest\u2019s share price was up 29 percent in after-hours trading.\nIn the past, Twitter has said that Apple\u2019s privacy push caused minimal disruptions to its business because much of its advertising came from brand awareness campaigns and large events, like the Olympics, rather than targeted advertising. Twitter is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 10.\nBut Apple, which reported itsfourth-quarter earningslast week, indicated that privacy was profitable. Despite supply chain disruptions, Apple said that sales of iPhones totaled $71.6 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier. The smartphone maker reported an 11 percent increase in revenue and a 20 percent jump in profit.\nApple has made privacy a key part of its marketing for the iPhone and other products, giving customers the ability to opt out of tracking and providing steps to make tracking more difficult in its browser, Safari. But Apple has continued to allow apps like Facebook totrack users in aggregate, as long as they do not seek to personally identify users.\nLast year, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, making his company\u2019s message clear, said that the advertising industry had become an ecosystem of \u201ctrackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.\u201d\nErin Griffithcontributed reporting."

        "title": "Google Plans Privacy Changes, but Promises to Not Be Disruptive",
        "fulltext": "Google said on Wednesday that it was working on privacy measures meant to limit the sharing of data on smartphones running its Android software. But the company promised those changes would not be as disruptive as a similar move by Apple last year.\nApple\u2019s changes to its iOS software on iPhones asked users for permission before allowing advertisers to track them. Apple\u2019s permission controls \u2014 and, ultimately, the decision by users to block tracking \u2014 have hada profound impacton internet companies that built businesses on so-called targeted advertising.\nGoogle did not provide an exact timeline for its changes, but said it would support existing technologies for at least two more years.\nThis month, Meta, the company founded as Facebook, said Apple\u2019s privacy changes would cost it$10 billion this yearin lost advertising revenue. The revelation weighed on Meta\u2019s stock price and led to concerns about other companies reliant on digital advertising.\nAnthony Chavez, a vice president at Google\u2019s Android division, said in an interview before the announcement that it was too early to gauge the potential impact from Google\u2019s changes, which are meant to limit the sharing of data across apps and with third parties. But he emphasized that the company\u2019s goal was to find a more private option for users while also allowing developers to continue to make advertising revenue.\nAs the world\u2019s two biggest smartphone software providers, Google and Apple hold significant sway over what mobile apps can do on billions of devices. Changes to increase privacy or provide users with greater control over their data \u2014 a growing demand from customers, regulators and politicians \u2014 come at a cost for companies collecting data to sell ads personalized to a user\u2019s interests and demographics.\nMr. Chavez said that if Google and Apple did not offer a privacy-minded alternative, advertisers might turn to more surreptitious options that could lead to fewer protections for users. He also argued that Apple\u2019s \u201cblunt approach\u201d was proving \u201cineffective,\u201d citinga studythat said the changes in iOS had not had a meaningful impact in stopping third-party tracking.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nThe changes from Google and Apple are significant because digital advertising based on the accumulation of data about users has underpinned the internet for the last 20 years. But that business model is facing more challenges as users have grown more suspicious about far-reaching data collection amid a general distrust of technology giants.\nThe difference in approaches between Apple and Google also speaks to how each company makes the bulk of its money. Apple generates most of its revenue from selling devices, while Google makes its money largely from selling digital advertising and may be more open to considering the needs of advertisers.\nWayne Coburn, a product director at Iterable, a marketing software company, said it was not surprising that Google was taking these steps when Apple was aggressively pitching privacy as a selling point over products running Android. Still, he said Google\u2019s approach felt like a \u201cweak gesture\u201d by providing a two-year timeline. He expects the company will be pressured to \u201cdo more, faster.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a reaction to what Apple has done,\u201d Mr. Coburn said. \u201cGoogle wouldn\u2019t be doing this on their own.\u201d\nGoogle said it planned to bring its privacy initiative, Privacy Sandbox, which had been limited mainly to reducing tracking on the company\u2019s Chrome browser, to Android \u2014 the world\u2019s most widely used software for mobile devices. Google has been forced torevamp its approach to eliminating so-called cookies, a tracking tool, on Chrome while facing resistance from privacy groups and advertisers.\nGoogle said it was proposing some new privacy-minded approaches in Android to allow advertisers to gauge the performance of ad campaigns and show personalized ads based on past behavior or recent interests \u2014 as well as new tools to limit covert tracking through apps. Google did not offer much in terms of detail about how these new alternatives would work.\nAs part of the changes, Google said, it plans to phase out Advertising ID, a tracking feature within Android that helps advertisers know whether users clicked on an ad or bought a product as well as keep tabs on their interests and activities. Google said it already allowed users to opt out of personalized ads by removing the tracking identifier.\nThe company said it planned to eliminate identifiers used in advertising on Android for everyone \u2014 including Google. Mr. Chavez said Google\u2019s own apps would not have special or privileged access to Android data or features without specifying how that would work. This echoes a pledge Google made to regulators in Britain that it would not give preferential treatment to its own products.\nThe company did not offer a definitive timeline for eliminating Advertising ID, but it committed to keeping the existing system in place for two years. Google said it would offer preview versions of its new proposals to advertisers, before releasing a more complete test version this year.\nMr. Chavez said Google\u2019s move had not been prompted by Apple\u2019s actions, adding that the company is always looking to \u201craise the bar\u201d on privacy."

        "fulltext": "Googleannounced on Wednesdaythat it planned to change its Android smartphone software to limit the sharing of data across apps and with third parties. The other major smartphone software provider, Apple, which has made privacy a selling point, announced new measures last year. But the two companies have taken different approaches. Apple allows customers to choose whether to block tracking, which has had a significant impact on companies that rely on customer data to target ads. Meta said this month that the changes wouldcost it $10 billionin ad revenue this year. Google, which unlike Apple makes most of its money from selling digital ads rather than devices, promised that its changes would not be as disruptive. It plans to support its existing technologies for at least two more years to give advertisers a chance to prepare.\nDespite shortages of some products and droves of workers calling in sick because of Omicron, Americanskept shopping last month. Retail sales in January rose 3.8 percent from a month earlier, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. That\u2019s a rebound from a sharp decline in December, whenspending dipped 2.5 percent. The new numbers do not account forrapidly rising prices, and there are some data quirks to consider (gift cards received in December are often spent in January, for instance), but economists said the rebound was still a good sign for the economy. In another sign of resilient consumer spending,Walmartsaid on Thursday that it beat earnings expectations last quarter, even though, as the nation\u2019s largest grocery chain, it is especially sensitive to inflation and rising wages. Macy\u2019s, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s report earnings this coming week.\nThe Winter Olympics, which end on Sunday, looked rosier on social media than they did in person. China used bots, fake accounts, genuineinfluencersand other tools to push its narrative of the Games (a feel-good success of an event) and to play down other aspects (like calls toboycott the Gamesover the country\u2019s human rights abuses). Some of these efforts were directed at foreign viewers. Inside China, the state has more power to curate. The men\u2019s hockey game between the United States and China, which the U.S. team won 8-0, was not shown, for instance, on the main state television sports channel. Brown, snowless mountains were cropped out of view on state media. And an appearance byPeng Shuai, the professional tennis player who disappeared after she accused a senior Communist Party leader of sexually assaulting her, wasn\u2019t mentioned.\nPresident Biden said Thursday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine remained a \u201cvery high\u201d possibility. And that\u2019s not good news for energy markets. An invasion coulddrive up oil and natural gas prices, prolonging high inflation andaffecting global financial markets. Countries reliant on Russia for energy could be especially susceptible to economic reverberations. In 2021, 38 percent of the natural gas used by the European Unioncame from Russia, according to the research organization Bruegel. If the flow of natural gas is interrupted, businesses could be forced to close and household utility bills, already higher than usual, could continue to rise.\nResults ofa unionization vote at three Starbucks stores in the Buffalo areaare expected this week. Since employees at three other nearby Starbucks locations beganunion campaigns last year, employees of at least 15 more stores around the country have filed petitions for union elections. The company has about 9,000 stores in the United States.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the agency wouldsoon issue new guidelines for coronavirus safety precautions, including on face coverings. The updated guidelines could provide more clarity for businesses as they deal with sometimes conflicting rules from state and city governments. Disney said last week that itwould not require fully vaccinated visitors to wear masks at its theme parks, andTyson Foodssaid fully vaccinated workers in some locations could go without masks.\nThe United States temporarily banned avocados from Mexico because ofa verbal threat made to U.S. safety inspectorsthere.

        "title": "6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble",
        "fulltext": "Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, suffered its biggest one-day wipeout ever on Thursday as its stock plummeted 26 percent and its market value plunged by more than $230 billion.\nIts crash followeda dismal earnings reporton Wednesday, when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, laid out how the company was navigatinga tricky transitionfrom social networking toward the so-called virtual world of the metaverse. On Thursday, a company spokesman reiterated statements from its earnings announcement and declined to comment further.\nHere are six reasons that Meta is in a difficult spot.\nThe salad days of Facebook\u2019s wild user growth are over.\nEven though the company on Wednesday recorded modest gains in new users across its so-called family of apps \u2014 which includes Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp \u2014 its core Facebook social networking app lost about half a million users over the fourth quarter from the previous quarter.\nThat\u2019s the first such decline for the company in its 18-year history, during which time it had practically been defined by its ability to bring in more new users. The dip signaled that the core app may have reached its peak. Meta\u2019s quarterly user growth rate was also the slowest it has been in at least three years.\nMeta\u2019s executives have pointed to other growth opportunities, like turning on the money faucet at WhatsApp, the messaging service that has yet to generate substantial revenue. But those efforts are nascent. Investors are likely to next scrutinize whether Meta\u2019s other apps, such as Instagram, might begin to hit their top on user growth.\nLast spring, Apple introduced an \u201cApp Tracking Transparency\u201d update to its mobile operating system, essentially giving iPhone owners the choice as to whether they would let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities. Those privacy moves have now hurtMeta\u2019s businessand are likely to continue doing so.\nNow that Facebook and other apps must explicitly ask people for permission to track their behavior, many users have opted out. That means less user data for Facebook, which makes targeting ads \u2014 one of the company\u2019s main ways of making money \u2014 more difficult.\nDoubly painful is that iPhone users are a far more lucrative market to Facebook\u2019s advertisers than, say, Android app users. People who use iPhones to access the internet typically spend more money on products and apps served up to them from mobile ads.\nMeta said on Wednesday that Apple\u2019s changes would cost it $10 billion in revenue over the next year. The company has railed against Apple\u2019s shifts and said they are bad for small businesses that rely on advertising on the social network to reach customers. But Apple is unlikely to reverse its privacy changes and Meta\u2019s shareholders know it.\nMeta\u2019s troubles have been its competitors\u2019 good fortune.\nOn Wednesday, David Wehner, Meta\u2019s chief financial officer, noted that as Apple\u2019s changes have given advertisers less visibility into user behaviors, many have started shifting their ad budgets to other platforms. Namely Google.\nInGoogle\u2019s earnings callthis week, the company reported record sales, particularly in its e-commerce search advertising. That was the very same category that tripped up Meta in the last three months of 2021.\nUnlike Meta, Google is not heavily dependent on Apple for user data. Mr. Wehner said it was likely that Google had \u201cfar more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes\u201d than Meta\u2019s ad platform.\nMr. Wehner also pointed to Google\u2019s deal with Apple to be the default search engine for Apple\u2019s Safari browser. That means Google\u2019s search ads tend to appear in more places, taking in more data that can be useful for advertisers. That\u2019s a huge problem for Meta in the long term, especially if more advertisers switch to Google search ads.\nFor more than a year, Mr. Zuckerberg has pointed to how formidable TikTok has been as a foe. The Chinese-backed app has grown to more than a billion users on the back of its highly shareable and strangely addictive short video posts. And it is fiercely competing with Meta\u2019s Instagram for eyeballs and attention.\nMeta has cloned TikTok with a video product feature called Instagram Reels. Mr. Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Reels, which is prominently placed in people\u2019s Instagram feeds, was currently the No. 1 driver of engagement across the app.\nThe problem is that while Reels may be attracting users, it doesn\u2019t make money as effectively as Instagram\u2019s other features, like Stories and the main feed. That\u2019s because it\u2019s slower to make money off video ads, since people tend to skip past them. That means the more that Instagram pushes people toward using Reels, the less money it may make on those users.\nMr. Zuckerberg compared the situation to a similar time several years ago whenInstagram introduced its Storiesfeature, which was a clone of Snapchat. That product also did not make as much money for the company when it debuted, though the ad dollars eventually followed. Still, there\u2019s no guarantee Instagram Reels can repeat that magic.\nMr. Zuckerberg believes so much that the internet\u2019s next generation is the metaverse \u2014 a still fuzzy and theoretical concept that involves people moving across different virtual- and augmented-reality worlds \u2014 that he is willing to spend big on it.\nSo big that the spending amounted to more than $10 billion last year. Mr. Zuckerberg expects to spend even more in the future.\nYet there is no evidence the bet will pay off. Unlike Facebook\u2019s shift to mobile devices in 2012, virtual reality use is still the province of niche hobbyists and has yet to really break into the mainstream. Widespread augmented-reality headsets are also months \u2014 if not years \u2014 away.\nIn essence, Mr. Zuckerberg is asking employees, users and investors to have faith in him and his metaverse vision. That\u2019s a big ask for something that will cost the company billions in the coming years and that may never come to fruition.\nThe threat of regulators in Washington coming for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s company is a headache that just won\u2019t go away.\nMeta faces multiple investigations, including from a newly aggressive Federal Trade Commission and multiple state attorneys general, into whether it acted in an anti-competitive manner. Lawmakers have also coalesced around congressional efforts to pass antitrust bills.\nMr. Zuckerberg has argued that Meta is not a social networking monopoly. He has pointed furiously to what he calls \u201cunprecedented levels of competition,\u201d including from TikTok, Apple, Google and other future opponents.\nBut the threat of antitrust action has made it more difficult for Meta to buy its way into new social networking trends. In the past, Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp with little scrutiny as those services gained billions of users. Now even some of Meta\u2019s seemingly less contentious acquisitions invirtual realityand GIFs have beenchallengedby regulators globally.\nWith deal-making less likely, the onus is on Meta to innovate its way out of any challenges.\nIn the past, Mr. Zuckerberg might have been given the benefit of the doubt that he would be able to do so. But on Thursday at least, faith was in short supply on Wall Street."

Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nWho wins when governments go head-to-head with technology giants \u2014 and whom should we root for?\nWe\u2019re getting a small test of that question in the Netherlands. Last year, the Dutch equivalent of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission became one of the first regulators in the worldto requireApple to give people multiple payment options for using dating apps on their phones. It was a tiny crack in the absolute control Apple has asserted over iPhone apps since 2008.\nThis has now become a standoff between the world\u2019s most valuable company and Dutch bureaucrats. Apple has proposed a workaround, but the regulator calls Apple\u2019s attitude \u201cregrettable\u201d and has issued weekly fines totaling 25 million euros (about $28 million). Apple says that iPhone owners\u2019 security and convenience would be compromised if it allowed this, but also says that the company is complying with its legal obligations.\nI wouldn\u2019t normally pay attention to a relatively minor regulatory beef, but the company is fighting as if it\u2019s a big deal. Apple\u2019s response is also revealing about how tech superpowers react to governments\u2019 efforts to alter the role of technologies.\nMore authorities everywhere in the world \u2014 in both democratic and authoritarian countries \u2014 want to make tech companies change what they\u2019re doing. The tech giants tend to say that they follow the laws wherever they operate. But they also push back against governments and deflect or shape laws and regulations. And it\u2019s not always easy to tell the difference between righteous defiance and corporate impunity.\nFor example, democracy advocates have criticized Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Google for not doing more to push back against government efforts to censor political speech in countries likeVietnam,IndiaandRussia. After mass shootings inSan Bernardino, Calif., in 2015and inPensacola, Fla.,in 2019, internet evangelists praised Apple for refusing to help the F.B.I. break into the killers\u2019 iPhones.\nThe Netherlands became an unlikely high-stakes tech battlegroundstarting in 2019, when the Authority for Consumers and Markets began investigating whether Apple\u2019s app storefront broke the country\u2019s laws against abuses of power.\nThe broad issue is the same one that Apple is facing everywhere fromFargo, N.D., toSeouland manyworld capitalsandcourtroomsinbetween. Some authorities and developers say that Apple unfairly controls our smartphones and digital economy by requiring that iPhone apps be downloaded through its app store. There, the company sets the rules about what content is appropriate and collects a commission of up to 30 percent on some purchases.\nApp developers including Match Group, the U.S. company that owns Tinder, Match.com and other dating services, used the Dutch investigation toair their grievances about Apple. Match wanted more options that go around Apple\u2019s store to direct people to pay for dating services.\nIn August, the A.C.M. issued an order that prohibited Apple from requiring dating apps to use only the company\u2019s payment system, which enables Apple to collect a fee. It might not look like much, but the Netherlands could be one of the first dominoes in loosening Apple\u2019s grip on the app economy.\nIn response, Apple last month proposed a set of conditions that someapp developers saidwas ahostile defianceof the Dutch regulator. Apple essentially said that dating apps in the country could use any payment system they wanted, but that Apple would collect a fee of 27 cents on each dollar of purchases that people made in the app, and require the dating companies to hand over information and audit it.\nTry to imagine if Walmart said that shoppers could pay any way they wanted, but that it might cost more if you used a non-Walmart credit card and you had to give Walmart your card\u2019s monthly statement.\nPeople who keep close tabs on Apple havesaidthat its approach in the Netherlands is probably a blueprint for other cases in which judges or regulators try to force the company to do things it doesn\u2019t want to do with its app store.\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, addressed Apple\u2019s behavior in a speech on Tuesday. \u201cSome gatekeepers may be tempted to play for time or try to circumvent the rules,\u201dshe said. \u201cApple\u2019s conduct in the Netherlands these days may be an example.\u201d\nThe regulator says that Apple\u2019s new conditions don\u2019t comply with the A.C.M. order. \u201cApple\u2019s so-called \u2018solutions\u2019 continue to create too many barriers for dating-app providers that wish to use their own payment systems,\u201d a spokesman for the A.C.M. said in a statement Monday.\nA court in the Netherlands will most likely have to resolve the dispute with Apple. All regulation is slow and complicated, but this dispute shows that those involving tech companies with deep pockets might be even more so. The question now is whether Apple will fight current and future attempts to change its app store with the vigor it has in the Netherlands \u2014 and whether we\u2019ll be better or worse off if it does.\nThe future of work in physical offices is up in the air, buttech companies are on an office-expansion binge,my colleague Kellen Browning writes. One reason: Tech superpowers have so much money. What\u2019s a few more gleaming glass office towers?\nA new twist in financial scams combines the\u201cage-old allure of romance with the newer temptation of overnight cryptocurrency riches,\u201dKevin Roose explains.\nWhy are we still getting robocalls?!?! (insert SCREAMS):The technologies and laws that made phone calls and text messages cheap in the U.S. also made it extremely difficult to end those unwanted automated phone calls and spam texts,Vox\u2019s Recode publicationreports.

        "title": "What Big Tech\u2019s Riches Mean for Our Future",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nEvery few months, I concoctnew waysto say that tech giantsmake a lot of money. Today, I give up.\nI\u2019ll just say that Big Tech companies are really, really, really, really big and really, really, really, really, REALLY rich.\nThat\u2019s even true of the company that we know as Facebook, whichran into a financial brick wallon Wednesday. This might be the end of Facebook as we know it \u2014 maybe! \u2014 but the company is likely to keep churning out fat profits for years.\nAmerica\u2019s five technology superpowers \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are titanic, and still growing. They have nearly infinite resources to help them stay on top. And their products are so in demand that even obscure pieces of their kingdoms are insanely popular.\nHere are some numbers.\nApple\u2019s profit for the past year ($101 billion) was more than the combined yearly profits of \u2014 take a deep breath \u2014 Walmart, General Motors, Exxon, Pfizer, Verizon, Disney, Coke and McDonald\u2019s.\nDo you know what YouTube Shorts are? No? They are YouTube\u2019s answer to TikTok\u2019s bite-size videos, and Google said this week that people watched 15 billion of themeach day.This number was so nuts that I kept asking people if I had misunderstood.\nFacebook \u2026 OK, Facebook is not in a good place. The number of daily users of Facebook and its Messenger app shrank a little. The company warned that TikTok\u2019s popularity was hurting it and that its advertising sales were sputtering, partly because ofrestrictions that Apple recently imposedon personal data collections on iPhone apps.\nI\u2019m not sure I believe Facebook is in as much trouble as it\u2019s suggesting. Yet. Facebook executiveshave a habit of warning of doom, but the company keeps chugging along.\nThis time might be different. But even the suddenly frowny-face Facebook generated, on average, $214 for each user in the U.S. and Canada last year. For a free product. Facebook is one of the best money-making machines in internet history, and if it dies, that will happen slowly. I think.\nMicrosoft owns the (not popular) Bing search engine. It sells ads there and elsewhere online, including on LinkedIn. And yet the company\u2019s annual advertising sales of more than $10 billion are about 20 times the 2021 ad sales of The New York Times.\nAmazon\u2019s stock price \u2014 like that of many tech companies \u2014 has fallen this year so far, by about 18 percent. But Amazon is so mammoth that just the wiped-out value ($267 billion) is about the total value of Disney. Jeff Bezos\u2019 new yacht is so big that abridge in the Netherlands will be dismantledto accommodate the boat\u2019s height. THAT is rich.\nOutside of tech, large U.S. corporations are mostlydoing dandy, too. But the tech superpowers are on acompletely different planetfrom the merely big and rich.\nThe continued financial bonkers-ness of Big Tech rubs at essential questions for this newsletter: Is Big Tech\u2019s success good for us? And are those five superpowers big and dominant because they make good stuff, or does their size and power virtually guarantee further dominance?\nWe know that people and businessesneedthe products from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. And those companies tend to say that they could die at any minute. The history of technology supports that. Dominant companies don\u2019t tend to stay that way for very long.\nBut this handful of technology companies have become so enmeshed in our lives, economies, world affairs and brains that they\u2019ve had a grip for years. Microsoft and Apple are each more than 45 years old. Google and Amazon started about a quarter-century ago. Those companies have had hard times, but they\u2019ve been mostly rich and successful for big chunks of their histories. We can\u2019t imagine anything different.\nFacebook is the youngest and most vulnerable of the bunch right now, but it has reinvented itself for a decade and outlasted (so far) every doubt.\nThe angst over Big Tech \u2014 questions of illegal monopolies and how they control speech and digital economies \u2014 boils down to a debate about whether our digital lives are defined by dynamism, or permanent dynasties. We\u2019ll see.\nTip of the Week\nBrian X. Chen, the personal tech columnist for The Times, responded to our On Tech editor, Hanna Ingber, who posed a question she thought readers would have, too. Hanna wrote:\n\u201cI find choosing between cloud storage options endlessly anxiety-provoking (so I basically just pay everyone). What to do?\u201d (Hanna pays for three cloud storage services!)\nGoogle Drive. Dropbox. Box. iCloud. Microsoft OneDrive. These are all cloud services, which are servers for storing our data online.\nThey\u2019re convenient to use because you no longer need to worry about losing your data when copies of your files live in the cloud. They all cost a few dollars a month to store a sizable amount of data. So how do you choose just one?\nI explored this question in apast columnabout the best way to manage your smartphone photos. Based on my conversations with techies, the wisest approach is to choose a service that is \u201cdevice-agnostic.\u201d That means a cloud service that is not exclusive to a specific brand. That leaves out iCloud, which works mostly for Apple products like iPhones.\nIt\u2019s important to choose a cloud storage service that leaves you the freedom and flexibility to take your files elsewhere if you want to switch to a different device.\nThat\u2019s why I often suggest that people stow their data in Google\u2019s cloud. Google\u2019s cloud-based apps for word processing, photo management, spreadsheets and file storage work on Apple and Android phones. And in general, its tools are usable via a web browser on any computer or smartphone.\nI mostly write in a web browser using Google Docs on my Mac. And if I wanted to edit documents on a PC, I could use the same tool in a browser in Windows.\nA solo hacker says that he took North Korea offline:A U.S. security researcher who uses the name P4x online told Wired that North Korean spies targeted him in a cyberattack last year. Frustrated by what he felt was a lack of visible response from U.S. officials, P4x says thathe hacked North Korea\u2019s internet from his living room, and he claimed responsibility for ongoing online blackouts in the country.\nThe cleanup services for bad reputations:Rest of World investigated firms that specialize in helping wealthy business people and politiciansscrub the internet of information that they don\u2019t like. The tech publication reports that the reputation-management firms often use bogus copyright claims and fake legal notices to try to pull down online news articles that contain allegations of their clients\u2019 tax dodges, corruption or drug trafficking.\nYou buy everything online.How about cremation services?\nI asked on Twitter for videos of sloths, and theSloth Institute parked these long-limbed charmers in my feed.\nWe want to hear from you.
