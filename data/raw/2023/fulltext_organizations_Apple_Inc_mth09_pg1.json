        "title": "Apple Unveils iPhone 15 and Switches to USB-C Charger",
        "fulltext": "Every September for the past decade, Apple has convened media from around the world for a marketing event that celebrates the creative feats behind its newest iPhone. It has hyped the shine of the phone\u2019s exterior, the sculpting around its cameras and the power of its processors.\nBut this year, Apple\u2019s elite designers and engineers have bent their creative process and marketing extravaganza to the design demands of European regulators, who passed a rulemandating USB-C charging across electronic devices.\nOn Tuesday, Apple revealed that its newest product line, the iPhone 15, will drop the company\u2019s proprietary Lightning port in favor of European-mandated USB-C ports. The company\u2019s newest iPhones feature a charging plug that is slightly bigger and rounder than its predecessor but capable of delivering a faster charge.\nThe rule was aimed at reducing electronic waste and saving customers money by making one port compatible across an array of devices. Though Apple resisted the change, warning that government mandates could stifle innovation, it will make it possible to use the same USB-C cord that powers a Mac to charge an iPhone.\nIn addition to the iPhone, the company unveiled its wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, with a USB-C charging case.\nThe change speaks to how regulators are altering Apple\u2019s business. Apple has positioned itself as the primary gatekeeper for more than one billion iPhone users worldwide by building proprietary hardware and services. To reach those customers, app developers have given the company as much as a 30 percent cut of their sales, and accessory companies have paid fees to make cords with Lightning ports.\nBut amid rising concerns about tech companies\u2019 power over the global economy, governments have passed rules and issued warnings that are forcing Apple to open up. In Europe, a new antitrust law will require that Apple allows the sale of iPhone apps outside its App Store. In the United States, regulators are investigating the company\u2019s practice of blocking others fromusing the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-payability. And in China, thereis a government crackdown on employees\u2019use of iPhones at work.\nThe government challenges are buffeting Apple at the same time it is trying to reignite its business. Tumbling sales of iPads and Macs have sparked its most prolonged slump since 2016. IPhone purchases, which account for more than half of total revenue, are slowing. And the sale of apps and services could be clipped by government regulations.\n\u201cApple is a victim of its own success, and everyone is going after the big targets in tech,\u201d said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, an investment firm in Walnut Creek, Calif.\nIn addition to the USB-C port, Apple touted other improvements with the iPhone 15, including better cameras and smaller borders around the screen. Its two high-end Pro models, which start at $999, feature a lighter titanium body and processors made with a cutting-edge manufacturing process that the company said significantly increases performance. It replaces the mute switch on previous models with a new button that can be pressed to use the phone\u2019s camera or start an audio recording.\nThe high-end phones also have the ability to record three-dimensional video, which can be viewed in the augmented reality headset that Apple will release next year.\nApple raised the price on the iPhone Pro Max, the company\u2019s top model, by 9 percent to $1,199. The larger phone features the lineup\u2019s most sophisticated camera with a fivefold optical zoom, which contributed to the first price increase for the iPhone lineup in five years.\nThe iPhone 15 base models, which cost $799 and $899, adopt many of the features available on last year\u2019s iPhone Pro models, including last year\u2019s processor and the Dynamic Island, a tool bar at the top of the screen. The entire iPhone lineup offers wireless charging.\n\u201cThis is underwhelming,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, an investment and research firm based in Minneapolis. \u201cBut for the average person with a three- to four-year-old phone, this is enough to upgrade.\u201d\nApple complemented the new iPhone lineup with updates to its Apple Watch offerings. An updated processor and software developments allow people who wear its latest watch, the Series 9, to answer phone calls by tapping their thumb and index finger together twice. It billed the watch as its first carbon-neutral product, saying it is made with 100 percent clean energy, carbon offsets and smaller packaging to cut the emissions associated with shipping the product.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra, which is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts, features a brighter screen and a greater altitude range. It also offers new capabilities for cyclists who want to connect it to other devices that measure performance.\nApple unveiled the products in Cupertino, Calif., at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat underground auditorium on the company\u2019s campus. The venue was packed with journalists and employees. Millions more tuned in online to watch the infomercial that Apple made for its new products.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, used the iPhone event to remind customers about its new augmented reality headset, which it unveiled in June ahead of a release next year.\nBut even after the headset\u2019s release next year, the iPhone will still drive Apple\u2019s business. The company sells more than 200 million iPhones annually, collecting about $200 billion.\nThough sales of its marquee device are down slightly this year, theiPhone has expanded its dominanceof the smartphone market. It has increased its percentage of the total smartphones sold around the world. In the United States, the device now accounts for more than 50 percent of smartphones sold, up from 41 percent in 2018, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm."

Many were without power and phone service, fueling criticism on social media of the government\u2019s response.\nIn the town of Amizmiz, at the foot of the High Atlas Mountains in Al Haouz province, more ambulances and uniformed emergency personnel were on the streets than on Sunday, and more survivors appeared to be sheltering in disaster relief tents than in makeshift structures.\nIn some villages where the homes are made of mud bricks, as many as half of the houses were flattened.

        "title": "Police Say \u2018Opportunists\u2019 Stole From Philadelphia Stores After Protest",
        "fulltext": "In the shadow of Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall this week, about 100 people gathered to protest a judge\u2019s decisionto dismiss all chargesagainst a former police officer who shot and killed a man in his car during a traffic stop last month. Around dinnertime, the demonstrators packed up their posters and signs and cleared out.\nThen, not long after, the police say a separate group of people broke into a series of stores, stealing shoes, alcohol, iPhones and other wares \u2014 looting that in some cases was streamed live and that ultimately led to charges against more than 60 people. A handful of additional stores were broken into Wednesday night, the police said.\nThe proximity of the first wave of thefts to the site of protest led to speculation that those stealing might have been trying to send a message over the dismissal of charges, but the police said that the culprits had seized on the moment to benefit themselves.\n\u201cThis had nothing to do with the protest,\u201d John Stanford, the interim police commissioner, said. \u201cWhat we had tonight was a bunch of criminal opportunists take advantage of a situation and make an attempt to destroy our city.\u201d\nAt a liquor store in Northeast Philadelphia on Thursday, metal shutters lay on the sidewalk after being torn down. Windows were shattered and louvered blinds hung in pieces over the entrance.\nInside, liquor bottles, cardboard boxes and containers were scattered across the floor. Many shelves sat empty. Police officers climbed through the wreckage, as a crew of workers waited to board up the store.\nEZ Guyton, who works as a security guard for the shopping mall where the liquor store is, said he saw about eight or nine people taking bottles from the shelves Tuesday night after staff members left.\n\u201cPeople were just carrying stuff out of the door in boxes and in shopping carts,\u201d Mr. Guyton, 72, said on Thursday, as he swept broken glass from the sidewalk.\nA spokesman for the state liquor board said that 10 stores had sustained substantial damage and would be closed for some time; several others that were looted sustained less damage.\nA family member of the man killed last month, Eddie Irizarry, condemned the stealing.\nZoraida Garcia, Mr. Irizarry\u2019s aunt,told The Philadelphia Inquirerthat the destruction was \u201cnot going to bring justice to my family or bring my nephew back,\u201d and she urged those upset about his killing to protest peacefully with signs in front of the courthouse instead.\nThe demonstration in front of City Hall on Tuesday came shortly after a judge dismissed all charges \u2014 including a murder charge \u2014 against the former officer, Mark Dial. Mr. Dial, who is white, shot Mr. Irizarry, who was Puerto Rican, while the man was sitting in his car during a traffic stop on Aug. 14.\nBody camera footage showed that Mr. Irizarry was holding what appeared to be a knife, as officers approached his car. Mr. Dial is heard saying, \u201cI will shoot you,\u201d and adding an expletive before firing, less than a second later, six shots at Mr. Irizarry through his closed driver\u2019s side window and the windshield.\nThe judge said that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to overcome Mr. Dial\u2019s argument of self-defense. Prosecutors quickly refiled the charges.\n\nA police spokeswoman initially told reporters that Mr. Irizarry had gotten out of his car and \u201clunged\u201d at the officers with a knife, butbody camera videoslater proved those statements to be false. Those videos showed that Mr. Irizarry, 27, had remained in the car. The police said they had found a folding knife and a \u201ckitchen-style\u201d knife in the car.\nAfter the peaceful protest on Tuesday, videos circulating on social media showed a group of younger people forcing open the door of an Apple store, running off with iPhones and other devices until the items started blaring, a warning that the devices were being tracked.\nStores in the city were looted in 2020, during protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and some residents said they feared that businesses like Apple, Footlocker and others that were targeted this week might close their stores for good.\nMeanwhile, Asghar Ansari, who owns a dollar store in Center City next door to a Foot Locker that was looted on Tuesday night, said he feared that the city would deteriorate if the perpetrators did not face consequences.\n\u201cRight now, as a businessman, I feel very unsafe,\u201d said Mr. Ansari, 52, whose business had closed before the thefts began and was unscathed.\nGiovanni Calvert, 20, works as a restaurant host a few blocks from the looted Apple Store and offered another perspective.\nHe said that although he did not think the looting was right, he understood the anger that followed the dismissal of charges against the former police officer.\n\u201cI do know what the reality of being young, Black and scared is in this country and feeling powerless,\u201d he said. \u201cThe anger and the aggression is going to go towards the system that\u2019s causing it.\u201d\nSeveral videos that showed the chaos Tuesday night were taken by a locally famous 21-year-old comedian, Dayjia Blackwell, who is known as \u201cMeatball\u201d on social media. They showed people running into closed stores and, later, the police pulling over the car she was in, presumably moments before she was arrested.\nMs. Blackwell, who was charged with several crimes, including burglary and rioting, went live on Instagram on Thursday after she was released on bail. In her video, she vacillated between defiance and sadness and said that she was struggling with how to deal with the news cameras outside her home as well as with her newfound notoriety. Should she embrace the attention, she wondered, or step away from her internet persona until her case was complete?\nShe solicited advice in the comments of her stream \u2014 even Amber Rose, the famous model, chimed in \u2014 but still seemed unsure.\n\u201cI\u2019m losing my head,\u201d Ms. Blackwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m supposed to be funny or serious with this.\u201d\nA few minutes later, she turned the livestream off."

        "title": "A report of a Pegasus attack on one Russian journalist sets off a flurry of concern among others.",
        "fulltext": "A day after the publication ofan investigation by two cybersecurity watchdogsshowing that a cellphone belonging to the chief executive of an exiled, independent Russian news website had been infected by Pegasus surveillance spyware, several other journalists and media workers for Russian news outlets were reported to have, like her, received earlier notifications from Apple that their iPhones may have been targeted by \u201cstate-sponsored attackers.\u201d\nPegasus, which is made by the Israeli firm NSO Group, is a \u201czero-click\u201d software that can, without needing any triggering action by a recipient, remotely extract messages, contacts, photos and videos from the target\u2019s mobile phone. Released in 2011 and sold under Israeli Defense Ministry license to law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world \u2014including the F.B.I.\u2014 it has been used to help capture drug lords, thwart terrorist plots and fight organized crime.\nBut New York Timesinvestigationshave revealed that the spyware has also been used by some governments, includingMexico, theUnited Arab EmiratesandSaudi Arabia, to spy on journalists and human rights activists. The United StatesblacklistedNSO Group in November 2021.\nAccording to the two cybersecurity watchdogs whose report was published on Wednesday, the investigation was set off after an Apple notification of a possible state-sponsored attack was sent in June to the iPhone of Galina Timchenko, the co-founder, chief executive, and publisher of Meduza, a prominent Russian independent media outlet operating in exile in Europe.\nMeduza reached out to one of the watchdogs, Access Now, which in collaboration with Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, determined that Ms. Timchenko\u2019s phone had been infected while she was in Germany two weeks after Russia deemed Meduza an \u201cundesirable organization\u201d in January. The watchdogs said it was the first documented case of Pegasus being used on a Russian journalist.\nOn Thursday, Yevgeny Erlich, the former editor in chief of the Baltic-based news program for the Russian independent media outlet, Current Time,posted on Facebookthat he had received the Apple notification and warned his readers that their prior communications with him might have been breached. Mr. Erlich\u2019s phone had a Latvian SIM card, as did Ms. Timchenko\u2019s, according to his Facebook post. He wrote that his phone would sometimes heat up or start messaging groups on its own.\nNovaya Gazeta Europe, an independent Russian news outlet, alsoreportedon Thursday that its general director, Maria Epifanova, and a Baltic correspondent, Evgeniy Pavlov, received similar notifications from Apple.\nThe notifications are designed to inform users who may have been targeted by state-sponsored attacks, which are \u201chighly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop, and often have a short shelf life,\u201d according to anApple support page. Such attacks \u201capply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices, which makes these attacks much harder to detect and prevent.\u201d"

        "title": "ChatGPT Can Now Respond With Spoken Words",
        "fulltext": "ChatGPT has learned to talk.\nOpenAI, the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up, released a version of its popular chatbot on Monday that can interact with people using spoken words. As with Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, and other digital assistants, users can talk to ChatGPT and it will talk back.\nFor the first time, ChatGPT can also respond to images. People can, for example, upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they could cook with the ingredients they have.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to make ChatGPT easier to use \u2014 and more helpful,\u201d said Peter Deng, OpenAI\u2019s vice president of consumer and enterprise product.\nOpenAI has accelerated the release of its A.I tools in recent weeks. This month, itunveiled a version of its DALL-E image generatorand folded the tool into ChatGPT.\nChatGPTattracted hundreds of millions of usersafter it was introduced in November, and several other companies soon released similar services. With the new version of the bot, OpenAI is pushing beyond rival chatbots like Google Bard, while also competing with older technologies like Alexa and Siri.\nAlexa and Siri have long provided ways of interacting with smartphones, laptops and other devices through spoken words. But chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard havemore powerful language skillsand are able to instantly write emails, poetry and term papers, and riff on almost any topic tossed their way.\nOpenAI has essentially combined the two communication methods.\nThe company sees talking as a more natural way of interacting with its chatbot. It argues that ChatGPT\u2019s synthetic voices \u2014 people can choose from five different options, including male and females voices \u2014 are more convincing than others used with popular digital assistants.\nOver the next two weeks, the company said, the new version of the chatbot would start rolling out to everyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus, a service that costs $20 a month. But the bot can respond with voice only when used on iPhones, iPads and Android devices.\nThe bot\u2019s synthetic voices are more natural than many others on the market, though they still can sound robotic. Like other digital assistants, it can struggle with homonyms. When The New York Times asked the new ChatGPT how to spell \u201cgym,\u201d it said: \u201cJ-I-M.\u201d\nBut one of the advantages of a chatbot like ChatGPT is that it can correct itself. When told \u201cNo, the other kind of gym,\u201d the bot replied: \u201cAh, I see what you\u2019re referring to now. The place where people exercise and work out is spelled G-Y-M.\u201d\nThough ChatGPT\u2019s voice interface is reminiscent of earlier assistants, the underlying technology is fundamentally different. ChatGPT is driven primarily by alarge language model, or L.L.M., which has learned to generate language on the fly by analyzing huge amounts of text culled from across the internet.\nOlder digital assistants, like Alexa and Siri, acted like command-and-control centers that could perform a set number of tasks or give answers to a finite list of questions programmed into their databases, such as \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in Cupertino?\u201d Adding new commands to the older assistants could take weeks. ChatGPT can respond authoritatively to virtually any question thrown at it in seconds \u2014though it is not always correct.\nAs OpenAI is transforming ChatGPT into something more like Alexa or Siri, companies like Amazon and Apple are transforming their digital assistants into something more like ChatGPT.\nLast week, Amazon previewed anupdated systemfor Alexa that aims for more fluid conversation about \u201cany topic.\u201d It is driven in a part by a new L.L.M. and has other upgrades to pacing and intonation to make it sound more natural, the company said.\nApple, which has not publicly shared its plans for how it will compete with ChatGPT,has been testing a prototypeof its large language model for future products, according to two people briefed on the project.\nWhen used via the web as well as on iPhone, iPad and Android devices, the new ChatGPT can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, it can provide a detailed description of the image and answer questions about its contents. This could be a useful tool for people who are visually impaired.\nOpenAI firstdemonstrated the image toolin the spring, but the company said it would not be shared with the public until researchers better understood how the technology could be misused. Among other concerns, they worried the tool could become a de facto face recognition service used to quickly identify people in photos.\nMicrosoftintroducedthis kind of visual search tool, based on OpenAI\u2019s technology, in its Bing chatbot over the summer.\nSandhini Agarwal, an OpenAI researcher who focuses on safety and policy, said the new version of the bot would now refuse efforts to identify faces. But it is designed to provide enormously detailed descriptions of other photos. Given an image from the Hubble Space Telescope, for example, it can respond with paragraphs detailing the contents in the photo.\nThe bot can also be a tool for students. Given an image of a high school math problem that includes words, numbers and diagrams, the bot can instantly read the problem and solve it. It could be an effective way to learn \u2014 or cheat."

        "title": "The Google Trial Is Going to Rewrite Our Future",
        "fulltext": "The Google antitrust trial, whichbegan last week, is ostensibly focused on the past \u2014 on a series of deals that Google made with other companies over the past two decades. The prosecution in the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, contends that Google illegally spent billions of dollars paying off Samsung and Apple to prevent anyone else from gaining a foothold in the market for online search.\nBut the true focus of the trial, like that of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s coming trial of Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, on monopolization charges, is on the future. For the verdict will effectively establish the rules governing tech competition for the next decade, including the battle over commercialized artificial intelligence, as well as newer technologies we cannot yet envision.\nThe history of antitrust prosecutions shows this again and again: Loosening the grip of a controlling monopolist may not always solve the problem at hand (here, an online search monopoly). But it can open up closed markets, shake up the industry and spark innovation in unexpected areas. If Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, decides this case correctly, he\u2019ll be helping the entire tech world and the American economy more broadly.\nConsider the antitrust lawsuit that led to the breakup of AT&T\u2019s telephone monopoly in 1984. At the time, prosecutors were focused on lowering the pricing of long-distance telephone calls and giving consumers greater choice. But more important and less anticipated, the breakup helped to jump-start the internet revolution of the 1990s, in part by making it easier for companies to conduct business over phone lines and for customers to connect modems to them.\nOr consider IBM\u2019s monopoly on mainframe computing, which was challenged by private and public antitrust suits in the 1960s and \u201970s. At the time, a chief concern was the use of \u201cvaporware\u201d tactics in the mainframe market, which affected a now-long-dead company called the Control Data Corporation. But what matters today is that IBM, out of fear that it would be broken up, unbundled its software from its hardware, which created a market for software sold as a separate product \u2014 spawning, over time, what is now a multi-trillion-dollar industry. The suit also weakened IBM at the very time that personal computers were emerging, benefiting tiny upstarts like Apple and Microsoft.\nAs this history suggests, it\u2019s unlikely that we know exactly what new forms of computing a verdict against Google would make room for. The path of technological evolution is not predictable. But we do know that monopolies tend to stifle innovation and keep too much for themselves, and that forcing a monopolist to back off yields fruit.\nThe story of Google\u2019s own creation is another good example. Google began as a small start-up with a great product, but it was also a beneficiary of federal government intervention. Google began its operations reliant on Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, which had a roughly 95 percent market share in the early 2000s. And Microsoft was running its own search engine on Internet Explorer, then called MSN Search (later renamed Bing). Fortunately for Google, Microsoft had just been put through the wringer by the Justice Department, whose antitrust lawsuit nearly led to a breakup of the company. In the end, Google beat Bing in part because it had a better product \u2014 but also because it wasn\u2019t facing the nasty Microsoft of the 1990s, but rather a weakened and chastened Microsoft operating under federal oversight.\nToday Google is both interested in and threatened by the large language model technology of companies like OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT. Google has spent many billions of dollars on A.I. research, including developing its own chatbot, Bard, and recently rushed to incorporate dozens of A.I. features into its products. But as a giant, entrenched company, Google has the disadvantage of needing to protect its existing revenue streams and keep its investors, customers and advertisers happy. It has a strong incentive to make sure that A.I. doesn\u2019t turn into something that disrupts or destroys its current business.\nAt the trial in Washington last week, the prosecution (which includes the federal as well as state governments) made clear that Google leveraged its money and power over the past decade to stifle competition, paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars to make Google the default search setting for their phones. Apple also agreed to stay out of Google\u2019s business: handling search queries.\nThat\u2019s why Judge Mehta should force Google to sell off its Chrome browser (which has a roughly 63 percent market share) and ban the company\u2019s \u201cpay for default\u201d deals with the operating systems for Apple and Android phones. Otherwise, Google will surely be tempted to use its money and control over Chrome to ensure that any rivals in the field of A.I. aren\u2019t as successful with their products as Google is with its own.\nThe cases against Google and Meta are, in effect, a distinctively American form of industrial policy. Many countries choose to subsidize their tech monopolists, but the United States has shown that undermining a monopolist\u2019s dominance can be a better alternative. Doing so also serves to check what is perhaps the least accountable form of power in the United States, a power that at times feels like a threat to the idea of rule by the people. These are some of the reasons that the Biden administration, for which I worked for two years on tech competition policy, has made a robust effort to rein in the power of big tech.\nUltimately, antitrust law\u2019s most important function is to rebalance economic power, taming the excesses that are the inevitable consequences of a capitalist economy. The tech industries are prone to monopoly, yet as history suggests, they can be extraordinarily generative when given the right nudge. The point of the Google prosecution is not to hurt Google but to force it to make way for the next generation of technologists and their dreams.\nTim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "fulltext": "China on Wednesday made its first public comments about reports that the government is restricting the use ofApple\u2019s iPhonesby some state employees, saying that Beijing had noted what it claimed were security concerns about the device.\nThe comments by Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, were short on details. She pointed to what she described as \u201cmedia reports\u201d about security flaws in the iPhone, without elaborating.\nShe also said China had not published \u201cany law, regulation or policy document\u201d banning the purchase or use of foreign cellphones, including those made by Apple.\nThe comments came after some employees of government agencies said they had been told not to use iPhones for work. Notices issued to government employees and state-owned businesses, calling for usage of domestic brands of cellphones, have also been circulating online. China\u2019s usually strict internet censors have yet to delete claims about the restrictions.\nThe company\u2019s stock price initially fell following the reports, which had suggested that Apple could lose ground in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market.\nCalling for curbs on the use of foreign technology by government employees isn\u2019t new. China has discouraged officials from adopting foreign cellphones for at least a decade and told government agencies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones.\nThe United States has also placed restrictions on China\u2019s telecommunications giant, Huawei, and issued controls on exports of advanced U.S. semiconductor technology to China. Some U.S. states have moved torestrict the use of TikTok, the social media app, by government employees.\nThe White House national security spokesman, John F. Kirby, said on Wednesday that the U.S. government was \u201cwatching\u201d the issue and called on China \u201cto be more transparent about what they\u2019re seeing and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nAny major problems for Apple in China would signal an escalation in the tensions between Beijing and Washington. The American technology giant counts on China for roughly 20 percent of its revenue and much of its manufacturing, which supports hundreds of thousands of local jobs.\nSmartphones represent the latest salvo in the U.S.-China tech war after the launch last week of Huawei\u2019s Mate 60 Pro. Chinese nationalists celebrated the cellphone\u2019s advanced features as a sign that China had developed its own chips, but the device is now the target of aU.S. reviewinto whether it violates the embargo on U.S. semiconductor technology imposed by the Biden administration.\nApple has not said anything publicly about the recent reports. At an event in California on Tuesday, the company unveiled theiPhone 15, its newest model.\nOlivia WangandZach Montaguecontributed reporting."

The iPhone 15 Pro Max, which became available on Friday, is Apple\u2019s most expensive yet,at $1,199.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the new model \u2192\nOne of the biggest changes \u2014 along with better cameras, smaller borders around the screen and the ability to record 3-D video \u2014 isthephone\u2019s new charging ports. Gone are the company\u2019s signature Lightning versions.\nIn their place are USB-C ports, which are nearly ubiquitous in non-Apple devices and are now required by European regulators with the aim of reducing electronic waste and saving customers money.\nApple gained dominance in part by building proprietary hardware and services, and its concession to the rule shows how regulators are affecting its business.\nIt\u2019s just one example of how governments are passing rules and regulations to deal withrising concerns about big tech companies\u2019 outsize influence.\nThe release of Apple\u2019s new products has also coincided with escalatingtensions between the United States and Chinaover technology.\nGovernment employees in China have long been warned against using foreign-made electronic devices, but this month, they said they had received directives singling out iPhones.\nBeijing hasdenied issuing restrictionson the phones but noted unspecified security flaws.\nAny curbs could heighten the diplomatic strain between China and the United States, which has itself imposed limits on China\u2019s access to advanced computer chips and raised red flags about the popular app TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership.\nRead more about Apple\u2019s latest releases:"
