        "title": "Apple\u2019s New App Aims to Make Classical Music More Accessible",
        "fulltext": "In the streaming era, fans of classical music have hadreason to grumble.\nIt can be hard for veteran listeners to find what they want on platforms like Spotify, Tidal, Amazon and YouTube, which are optimized for pop music fans searching for the latest by Taylor Swift or Beyonc\u00e9. And for curious newcomers, it can be difficult to get beyond algorithmic loops of Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cCanon in D Major\u201d and Mozart\u2019s \u201cRondo Alla Turca.\u201d\nApple last week released a stand-alone app meant to address these problems. The app, known asApple Music Classical, features a refined search engine, a sleek interface and a host of features aimed at making classical music more accessible, including beginners\u2019 guides to different musical eras and commentary from marquee artists like the violinist Hilary Hahn and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\nApple hopes that the app, which has been in development since 2021, when the company acquired Primephonic, a classical streaming start-up in Amsterdam, will attract die-hard classical fans and new listeners alike. But it remains unclear how much traction the app can get in a crowded streaming market, in which Apple competes with behemoths like Spotify as well as dedicated classical services likeIdagio.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple, said in an interview, adding that Apple would continue to improve and build the app\u2019s database. \u201cWe\u2019re really serious about this.\u201d\nI spent a few days putting Apple Music Classical to the test, trying out its search, playlists and guides to classical music. (The app is currently available only on iPhone, though an Android version is in the works; at the moment, there is no desktop version.) Here are my impressions.\nFor pop music, a listing of artist, track and album is generally sufficient. But in classical, there are more nuances in the metadata: composer, work, soloist, ensemble, instrument, conductor, movement and nickname (like Beethoven\u2019s \u201cEmperor\u201d concerto or Mahler\u2019s \u201cResurrection\u201d symphony).\nApple has amassed 50 million such data points, the company says, in the app \u2014 encompassing some 20,000 composers, 117,000 works, 350,000 movements and five million tracks \u2014 and its search function generally feels more intuitive than its rivals.\nOn many streaming platforms, I have struggled to find Rachmaninoff\u2019s recordings of his compositions. A search for his name on Spotify, for example, returns a disorderly display of his most popular works, such as \u201cRhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,\u201d performed by a wide variety of artists.\nBut on Apple Music Classical, it is easier to quickly locate his recordings because the app can distinguish between Rachmaninoff the composer and Rachmaninoff the pianist or conductor. The search function is not perfect; a Rachmaninoff track by the Chinese pianist Niu Niu also shows up in the mix of recordings by Rachmaninoff. But the app makes it much easier to hunt down specific pieces of music.\nApple Music Classical has a clean and inviting interface that mimics the main Apple Music app. But it still struggles with a problem that has long vexed classical streaming: the sheer volume of the catalog.\nA search for Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida,\u201d for example, turns up an eye-popping 1,330 recordings. Apple has tried to make it easier to navigate a sprawling list like that. A page for \u201cAida,\u201d for example, has a brief description of the opera, an \u201ceditor\u2019s choice\u201d recording (Antonio Pappano and the Orchestra dell\u2019Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia) and five of the most frequently played versions.\nBut it can still feel overwhelming. It helps to know exactly what you\u2019re looking for: the list can be searched, scrolled or sorted by popularity, name, release date or duration. If you\u2019re interested in recordings of \u201cAida\u201d featuring Leontyne Price in the title role, for example, you can type in \u201cLeontyne\u201d and find her performances under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf, Georg Solti, Thomas Schippers and others.\nOpera can be especially difficult to navigate on streaming platforms because of long lists of cast members. While Apple comprehensively lists singers on each track, it can be hard to figure out quickly who the stars are when perusing albums. This could be fixed through more consistent album descriptions, or an option to enlarge album covers to make the words more legible. And while Apple has introduced the ability to search by lyrics for pop songs, no such feature exists in classical yet.\nApple makes the vastness of the classical repertoire more manageable through inventive playlists, which help resurface celebrated recordings. These playlists cover a variety of genres, including opera, Renaissance music, art song and minimalism. There are also lists for composers, including the usual suspects \u2014 Bach, Mozart, Beethoven \u2014 as well as contemporary artists like Kaija Saariaho and Steve Reich. \u201cHidden Gems\u201d highlights overlooked albums (\u201cBreaking Waves,\u201d a compilation of flute music by Swedish women, for instance, or \u201cConsolation: Forgotten Treasures of the Ukrainian Soul\u201d). \u201cComposers Undiscovered\u201d showcases lesser-known works by prominent composers, like Beethoven\u2019s Scottish songs.\nApple hopes the app will help draw new listeners to classical music, and many features are aimed at shedding its elitist image.\nOn the home screen, the app offers a nine-part introduction called \u201cThe Story of Classical,\u201d described as a guide to the \u201cweird and wonderful world of classical music.\u201d The series takes listeners from the Baroque to the 21st century, with forays further back, into medieval and Renaissance music.\nA series called \u201cTrack by Track\u201d features commentary by renowned artists, including Hahn and Ma. The cellist Abel Selaocoe, introducing an album of pieces by Bach and South African and Tanzanian folk songs, describes how hymnal music from England and the Netherlands mixed with African culture. The pianist V\u00edkingur Olafsson talks about feeling naked onstage when he plays Mozart\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 16, \u201ca piece we all have to face as pianists.\u201d\nPart of Apple\u2019s mission appears to be to help elevate overlooked artists, particularly women and people of color. For example, a tab of composers begins with Beethoven, Bach and Mozart but then expands to Clara Schumann, Caroline Shaw and Errollyn Wallen, as well as William Grant Still.\nThe pianist Alice Sara Ott and the conductor Karina Canellakis are featured on an exclusive recording of Beethoven\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic.\nWhile using the app on a recent morning, I encountered the music of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century Benedictine nun and composer of Gregorian chants. Hildegard, I soon discovered, is something of a star on the app, where she is described as a scientist, mystic, writer and philosopher and sits adjacent to Tchaikovsky on a composer roster. (Many of the great composers have been given enhanced digital portraits as part of Apple\u2019s efforts to make them more realistic; Hildegard is shown in a habit, with a piercing stare.)\nHildegard\u2019s music could easily be lost in the chaos of streaming. But in the Apple universe, it gets fresh life."

        "title": "How Mexico Became the Biggest User of the World\u2019s Most Notorious Spy Tool",
        "fulltext": "The Israelis had come to Mexico to clinch a major sale: The Mexican military was about to become the first client ever to buy their product, the world\u2019s most advanced spyware.\nBut before they could close the deal, an argument erupted over price and how quickly the spy tool could be delivered. A Mexican general overseeing the negotiations called for a pause until later that evening, according to two people present and a third with knowledge of the talks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up at your hotel and make sure to arrange a better atmosphere,\u201d they recalled the general saying.\nThat night, a convoy of cars arrived at the Israeli executives\u2019 hotel and took them to a new spot for the fateful negotiations: a strip club in the heart of Mexico City.\nThe general\u2019s security team ordered all the other clientele to leave the club, the three people said, and the talks resumed.\nIt was in that dark cabaret in March 2011, among women dancing onstage and shots of tequila, that the most powerful cyberweapon in existence got its start.\nThe spyware, known as Pegasus, has since become a global byword for the chilling reach of state surveillance, a tool used by governments from Europe to the Middle East to hack into thousands of cellphones.\nNo place has had more experience with the promise and the peril of the technology than Mexico, the country thatinaugurated its spread around the globe.\nA New York Times investigation based on interviews, documents and forensic tests of hacked phones shows the secret dealings that led Mexico to become Pegasus\u2019 first client, and reveals that the country grew into the most prolific user of the world\u2019s most infamous spyware.\nMexico went on towield the surveillance tool against civilianswho stand up to the state \u2014 abuses the country insists it has stopped. But The Times found that Mexico hascontinued to use Pegasusto spy on people who defend human rights, even in recent months.\nMany tools can infiltrate your digital life, but Pegasus is exceptionally potent. It can infect your phone without any sign of intrusion and extract everything on it \u2014 every email, text message, photo, calendar appointment \u2014 while monitoring everything you do with it, in real time.\nIt can record every keystroke, even when you\u2019re using encrypted applications, and watch through your phone\u2019s camera or listen through its microphone, even if your phone appears to be turned off.\nIt has been used to fight crime, helping to break up child-abuse rings and arrest notorious figures like Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo.\nBut it has also been deployed illegally, again and again, with governments using Pegasus to spy on and stifle human rights defenders, democracy advocates, journalists and other citizens who challenge corruption and abuse.\nAlarmed at how Pegasus has been used to \u201cmaliciously target\u201d dissidents across the globe, the Biden administration in 2021blacklisted NSO Group, the Israeli company that manufactures the spyware.\nSoon after, Israel\u2019s defense ministry \u2014 which must approve the export of Pegasus to other nations \u2014 said it would ban sales to countries where there was a risk of human rights violations.\nYet, despite ample evidence of Pegasusabuses in Mexico, the Israeli government has not ordered an end to its use in Mexico, according to four people with knowledge of the contracts for the technology.\nIn fact, Mexico\u2019s military is not only Pegasus\u2019 longest-running client, the four people say, but it has also targeted more cellphones with the spyware than any other government agency in the world.\nAnd the spy toolcontinues to be deployedin the country, not just to combat crime.\nAfter the revelations thatPegasus had been wielded against government criticstarred his predecessor, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who came to office in 2018, promised to stop what he called the \u201cillegal\u201d spying of the past.\nHe did not. Previously undisclosed tests show that, as recently as the second half of 2022, Pegasus infiltrated the cellphones of two of the country\u2019s leading human rights defenders, who provide legal representation to the victims of one of the most notorious mass disappearances in Mexican history.\nThe military has a history ofhuman rights abuses, and its role in the mass disappearance has been a focus of the investigation for years. As new allegations against the military surfaced in the case last year, the two advocates were targeted by Pegasus repeatedly, according to forensic testingconducted by Citizen Lab, a watchdog group based at the University of Toronto.\nThe Mexican military is the only entity in the country currently operating Pegasus, the four people familiar with the contracts said.\nThe Israeli defense ministry declined requests for comment. The Mexican defense ministry would not discuss the recent hack but said it followed the government\u2019s position, whichassertsthat intelligence gathering is \u201cin no way aimed\u201d at invading the private life of political, civic and media figures.\nThis was the second wave of attacks on the phone of Santiago Aguirre, one of the human rights defenders. He had been targeted with Pegasus during the previous administration, too, Citizen Lab found.\n\u201cThis government made so many promises that things would be different,\u201d Mr. Aguirre said. \u201cOur first reaction was to say, \u2018This can\u2019t be happeningagain.\u2019\u201d\nA spokesman for the Mexican president declined to comment. In a statement, NSO Group said it \u201cadheres to strict regulation and cannot disclose the identity of its customers.\u201d The company challenged the conclusiveness of Citizen Lab\u2019s forensic analyses, while Citizen Lab said it had no doubts about its findings.\nTo verify whether Pegasus hacked the two Mexican human rights advocates in recent months, NSO Group said it would need to be \u201cgiven access to the data.\u201d But the advocates said they were not willing to give the government\u2019s spying partner any more of their private information.\nPegasus\u2019 beginnings in Mexico have long been shrouded in secrecy. After the night at the strip club, the Israeli executives of NSO Group, then a fledgling start-up, returned to Tel Aviv with the outlines of their first sale. The next step was an actual contract.\nSo, a few months later, a team of NSO representatives returned to Mexico to show off the spyware to some of the most powerful people in the country.\nOn May 25, 2011, Eran Reshef, an Israeli defense industry executive who helped broker the deal, said in an email to NSO\u2019s chairman and its two founders that \u201cthe demo to the Secretary of Defense and President will take place next Friday,\u201d referring to the president at the time, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and his secretary of defense, Guillermo Galv\u00e1n Galv\u00e1n. A copy of the email surfaced in an Israeli lawsuit over commissions from the sale of Pegasus to Mexico.\nTwo of the people at the demonstration said it had taken place on a sprawling military base on the outskirts of Mexico City, where the first Pegasus machine would be installed.\nFearing leaks, the Mexican Army made the Israeli executives wait in a tiny room where cleaning supplies were kept so no one would see them before they made their presentation. An armed soldier was stationed outside the door.\nWhen Mr. Calder\u00f3n and Mr. Galv\u00e1n Galv\u00e1n arrived, they sat in front of large screens on the wall \u2014 and watched a phone get hacked, the attendees said.\nUdi Doenyas, the chief technology officer of NSO Group who invented the Pegasus architecture and led the team that wrote the code behind the first version of the spyware, confirmed that he had connected the Pegasus system to a screen and handed a BlackBerry phone to senior Mexican officials. He asked them to use it.\nAs they did, the phone showed no signs of being compromised, but the Pegasus system methodically began extracting every piece of data, beaming it onto the screen for all to see.\nThis was the spyware\u2019s superpower: the sneak attack.\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Sosa, a spokesman for Mr. Calder\u00f3n, acknowledged that the former president had paid a visit to a military facility, where he was \u201cgiven various presentations about the tasks\u201d being carried out, \u201cincluding the gathering of information and intelligence.\u201d\nBut he said Mr. Calder\u00f3n was never informed whether the spyware was eventually purchased, and that the former president was never told \u2014 \u201cnor did he inquire\u201d \u2014 what tools were used to capture criminals.\nAt the time, Mexico desperately needed a way to reliably crack into BlackBerry phones, a device of choice for the nation\u2019s fearsome drug cartels. From the start of his term in 2006, Mr. Calder\u00f3n had pushed a so-called kingpin strategy for confronting organized crime, focusing on the groups\u2019 top leaders.\nPinpointing the drug lords required technology that allowed spies to follow their location constantly. The criminals were careful, former law enforcement officials said, moving around and shutting down their phones to avoid being captured.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t give you enough time to launch an operation,\u201d said Guillermo Vald\u00e9s, the former director of CISEN, which was the country\u2019s equivalent of the C.I.A., from 2007 to 2011. \u201cIf someone turned off his phone, we no longer knew where he was.\u201d\nUp to that point, Mexico had relied heavily on the United States.\n\u201cThe pressure on the military to raise its game in terms of intelligence capabilities was intense,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a former intelligence officer during the Calder\u00f3n administration. A potential draw of Pegasus, he said, is that it would give Mexico its own capabilities.\n\u201cThey no longer wanted to be dependent on the Americans,\u201d Mr. Hope said.\nThe military signed the contract to buy the spyware soon after the demonstration.\nIn September 2011, about 30 NSO employees, most of the company\u2019s staff, flew to Mexico to set up Pegasus, test it and instruct a team of about 30 Mexican soldiers and officers how to operate the technology, according to three people familiar with the installation. The Mexican unit chosen to operate it was called the Military Intelligence Center, a secretive arm of the army about which little has been made public.\nOnce the Mexicans were ready to run Pegasus on their own, a short ceremony took place that December as a way of \u201chanding over the keys,\u201d two of the people said.\nA document from 2019, unearthed in anenormous hackof Mexican military emails last year, indicates that the Mexican intelligence center is housed in a horseshoe-shape complex. Three people familiar with it say commanders can watch through internal glass walls as information unspools on huge screens.\nIn a 2021 document, also made public by the hack, the army says that one of the main risks facing the center is \u201cthat the activities carried out by this center are revealed to the public.\u201d\nPegasus was quickly embraced by the Mexican authorities, and after Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office as president in 2012, two more government agencies bought it: the attorney general\u2019s office and CISEN, according to Mexican officials and three people with knowledge of the contracts.\nWithin a few years, the spywarebegan infiltrating the phonesof some of Mexico\u2019s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists \u2014 surveillance that strayed far from the agreement with the Israelis to target serious crime and terrorism.\nCondemnation came swiftly from at home and abroad, and the scandal clung to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto for the rest of his presidency. In all, Mexico has spent more than $60 million on Pegasus, according to Mexican officials, citing spending by past administrations.\nThe Mexican military has acknowledged having Pegasus only from 2011 to 2013. But a group of independent experts investigating the disappearance of 43 students who were planning to attend a protestsaid the military had Pegasuswhen they were abducted in 2014, and was spying on the phones of people involved in the crime on the night the events unfolded.\nIt is not clear why the military was spying, but the intelligence was not used to help find the students, the experts said.\nAfter Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador took office in 2018, he dissolved the federal police and replaced the Mexican spy agency with a new entity.\nFrom 2019 through today, only the military has had Pegasus, four people with knowledge of the contracts say. And during that time, the spyware has continued to be deployed against journalists, human rights defenders and an opposition politician, according to Citizen Lab\u2019s analyses.\nUnder Mexican law, government entities need ajudge\u2019s authorization to spy on private communications. But in public disclosures, the military has said it has not made any request to do that kind of surveillance in recent years.\nOn a Thursday afternoon last December, Mr. Aguirre got an email that read like something out of a spy novel.\n\u201cApple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID,\u201d said the message, which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cThese attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do.\u201d\nIn 2021, Apple announced it would begin sending warnings like this to users whose cellphones had been hacked by sophisticated spyware. The email went on to say that \u201csensitive data\u201d on Mr. Aguirre\u2019s phone may be compromised, \u201ceven the camera and microphone.\u201d\nMr. Aguirre, the executive director of theMiguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez Human Rights Center, had been targeted years earlier with Pegasus.\nHis stomach sank thinking of government spies poring over his entire digital life, from messages with torture survivors to family photos with his young daughter.\nThen it hit him: Others might be compromised, too.\nHe ran down the hall to the office of Mar\u00eda Luisa Aguilar, the lead advocate handling the group\u2019s international work. She had gotten the same email.\nThe two advocates contacted the Mexican digital rights group known asR3D, which had their phone data analyzed by Citizen Lab. It confirmed that both were hacked multiple times by Pegasus from June through September 2022.\n\u201cIn the eyes of the armed forces, we represent a risk,\u201d Ms. Aguilar said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose the power they have accumulated.\u201d\nNatalie Kitroeffreported from Mexico City, andRonen Bergmanfrom Tel Aviv."

        "title": "Apple Largely Prevails in Appeal of Epic Games\u2019 App Store Suit",
        "fulltext": "A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that Apple does not have a monopoly in the mobile games market, siding with alower court\u2019s 2021 rulingthat largely gave the tech giant a victory in a lawsuit brought by Epic Games.\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that Apple\u2019s tight control of its App Store did not violate federal antitrust law. Some app developers have said the multibillion-dollar business\u2019s strict policies stifle competition and eat into their profits.\n\u201cThere is a lively and important debate about the role played in our economy and democracy by online transaction platforms with market power,\u201d the judges wrote in their 91-page decision, which largely maintained the status quo. \u201cOur job as a federal Court of Appeals, however, is not to resolve that debate \u2014 nor could we even attempt to do so.\u201d\nWhile siding with Apple on a majority of Epic\u2019s claims, the judges also agreed with the lower court that Apple was violating California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law by prohibiting app developers from directing their customers to payment methods outside the App Store, which charges a 30 percent fee. Apple suggested that it could further appeal that ruling.\nIf the decision remains in place, app developers that sell subscriptions or digital services on an iPhone app could be allowed to steer their customers to outside websites to complete their purchases and avoid Apple\u2019s fee.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision reaffirms Apple\u2019s resounding victory in this case, with nine of 10 claims having been decided in Apple\u2019s favor,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nTim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive,wrote on Twitter: \u201cFortunately, the court\u2019s positive decision rejecting Apple\u2019s anti-steering provisions frees iOS developers to send consumers to the web to do business with them directly there. We\u2019re working on next steps.\u201d\nEpic, which produces the popular game Fortnite,initiated the conflict with Apple in 2020when it began offering Fortnite players discounts if they used Epic\u2019s payment system instead of going through Apple or Google, a violation of both companies\u2019 app store policies. Apple and Google removed Fortnite from their app stores, and Epic sued both companies.\nThe three-week trial in U.S. District Court in Oakland, Calif.,offered a rare glimpseinto the economics of Apple\u2019s App Store, and Tim Cook took the stand for the first time as the company\u2019s chief executive. Apple and Epic both appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, setting off an extended legal process."

        "title": "Apple Opens First Store in India, a Promising Frontier for the Tech Giant",
        "fulltext": "Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company\u2019s first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world\u2019s most populous country.\nRoaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital\u2019s biggest mall.\nThe Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years \u2014 marked this week, in fact \u2014 Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.\nAnd in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren\u2019t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself \u2014 and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.\n\u201cI felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly \u2014 who does that?\u201d Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.\u201d\nIndia is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India\u2019s, has two.\nBut those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India\u2019s.\nIn a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company\u2019s market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.\nThe Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.\nBut Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald\u2019s, for example, Apple\u2019s signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.\nPrice hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $304, per month \u2014 well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple: For me, it\u2019s a status symbol,\u201d said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. \u201cThe message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class,\u201d he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.\nMr. Sharma\u2019s partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is \u201cnot worth it,\u201d she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse.\u201d She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)\nApple\u2019s formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone \u2014 but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.\n\u201cMost people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone,\u201d Mr. Dua said. \u201cSo sharing media and files becomes difficult.\u201d\nThe relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India\u2019s consumers than with the country\u2019s growing role as a production hub.\nLast week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway \u201csince late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head.\u201d They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple\u2019s products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, \u201cwith Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice.\u201d\nThat migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that \u201cgiven Apple\u2019s size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions,\u201d noting that the company has catalyzed China\u2019s growth. \u201cWe see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops.\u201d\nUltimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.\nDuring the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city\u2019s \u201cincredible energy, creativity, and passion.\u201d\nHis fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead."

        "fulltext": "Have you ever tried planning a big event with friends or family \u2014 like a vacation, a home renovation or a reunion \u2014 and wished you could get everyone on the metaphorical same page?\nThanks to apps that support collaboration, youcanget all parties together in the same online whiteboard, calendar, document or other file. And you can get started with free software that may already be on your phone, tablet and computer. Here\u2019s an overview.\nApple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android systems include free apps that support group participation. These typically work best if you and your cohorts are all on the most recent version of the same platform, using a freeApple IDorGoogle Account. But beyond apps, you can collaborate on projects in a web browser with the files stored and synchronized on Apple\u2019siCloudservers orGoogle Drive.\nStarting a collaboration is easy. Just pick your app, create a file and choose the people to share it with.\nSome projects benefit from having one place to stash everything, everywhere, all at once \u2014 like photos, sticky notes, web links, documents and doodles contributed by multiple people. In this case, consider an interactive digital whiteboard app. Like whiteboards in an office, these digital ones allow people to add, erase and edit content, but participants using them can contribute and see real-time updates to the board on just about any device.\nApple\u2019sFreeformapp provides a canvas for big ideas, and the company\u2019s site has detailed instructions for using it on aniPhone, aniPadand aMac. After someonestarts a Freeform boardandshares it with othersby Apple Mail, Messages or AirDrop, the group work begins; boards can also be exported as PDF files for those without the app. Apple\u2019sFaceTimeservice is integrated for real-time video calls during a collaboration session.\nGoogle\u2019sJamboardis another online whiteboard app. It works onAndroidandiOSdevices, as wellas in Google Chromeandother web browsers(not to mention on Google\u2019s expensivecloud-powered whiteboard hardware). The person who starts the \u201cjam\u201d file must have aGoogle Account, but it isn\u2019t required of other collaborators. Files are stored onGoogle Drive, and Jamboard allowscollaboration over a Google Meet session. Google\u2019s support sitehas instructions for using Jamboard anywhere.\nSome projects may not need a whiteboard, like the schedule for a local softball league. For more straightforward projects, working together over a shared document, spreadsheet or presentation might be more efficient.\nApple\u2019s iCloud-based office software suite ofPages, Numbers and Keynote allows collaboration, as does the Google Docs, Sheets and Slides software thatstores your files on Google Drive. As with whiteboard apps, participants must be invited, and the person who started the file can set permissions for who can do what to it.\nYou can also share online notes and lists from your phone\u2019s free utility apps. In Apple\u2019sNotesandRemindersapps, just tap the \u201caction\u201d icon (the square with the up arrow) to get to the menu for sharing the files with others. Through theGoogle Keepapp forAndroidandiOS, you canshare lists, drawings and notes; just open the item you want to share, tap the three-dot action menu and select Collaborator.\nApple\u2019s and Google\u2019s calendar appslet you create and share calendars, which can be used for things like coordinating summer camp schedules, contractor work and other complex events beyond the default family calendar you may already be using.\nToset up a new calendarin the iOS Calendar app, select Calendars at the bottom of the screen. Choose the Add Calendars option, name the new calendar and tap Done. Toshare it with others, select Calendars at the bottom of the screen again and tap the encircled \u201ci\u201d icon next to the one you want to share. Select the Add Person option, enter the email addresses of the people who will share the calendar and tap Add.\nAlthough Google Calendar forAndroidandiOSlets you view and edit shared calendars from the apps or a browser, for now creating and sharing calendars can be done only from the browser, not the apps. Tocreate a new calendaron the web, openGoogle Calendaron the web and, in the Other Calendars area on the left side of the screen, click the \u201c+\u201d icon and then Create New Calendar. Name it and click Create Calendar.\nTo share it, go to the My Calendars area on the browser\u2019s left side, hover the cursor over the desired calendar and click the three-dot menu icon. Choose Settings and Sharing, and then scroll to the \u201cShare with specific people or groups\u201d section to add your people.\nIt may take a few steps to get everyone connected to your calendar or project, but after you do, you will all literally be on the same page."

        "title": "What Good Are Wearable Computers if the Data Is Wrong?",
        "fulltext": "Smartwatches from tech companies likeAppleandGarminmake it easy to see a number that could reflect how old you are more accurately than your age: theVO2max, the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can use during intense exercise.\nThe higher your VO2max, exercise experts say, the better your cardiovascular fitness and, potentially, the longer your life. In the past, only serious athletes sought a traditional VO2max test, which involved wearing cumbersome sensors while exercising inside a lab, but now anyone can get an estimate by wearing a smartwatch and moving around.\nIs it good to have access to this kind of information? And how accurate could a wearable be? In the last five months, when I fell down a VO2max rabbit hole, I learned some uncomfortable truths about my health and the limits of smartwatches.\nFirst, let me tell you about my fitness journey. In November, while I was out celebrating my birthday, my Apple Watch delivered the most unwanted gift: a notification of a high heart rate. That led me to look at my VO2max, which the Apple Watch said was 32, well below average for a man in his late 30s.\nIn search of a quick solution, I bought a membership at a high-intensity interval gym, a type of training that specializes in boosting cardio fitness. Five months and many kettlebell swings and jump squats later, I felt progress. I burned fat, gained muscle and felt more energetic. The Apple Watch gave me a VO2max estimate of 40, just shy of average, and a Garmin watch that I also wore rated me at 45.\nAll that was left to do was to take a real VO2max test, so I found one. This is where the good news ends. A few hours after pedaling on an exercise bike with an oxygen mask strapped to my face, I got my lab results: 25, a rating of poor, far below the flattering results from the Apple Watch and Garmin. Devastating.\nDr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist in San Francisco who has studied wearable technology for many years, said my experiment underscored the pros and cons of using smartwatch data to explore health.\n\u201cOn the one hand, you can give it credit for kicking you in the butt to tell you to go work out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, now you\u2019re sort of burned with this real test and like, \u2018What do I do with this number?\u2019\u201d\nFortunately, after studying all the data, learning how the wearable algorithms work and talking with health experts, I arrived at a positive conclusion: Even if the smartwatch numbers were wrong, they were correct in broad strokes, and I was probably better off wearing one than not.\nMy experience can serve as a template for anyone trying to have a healthy relationship with technology tracking many types of health data, from sleep patterns to body fat.\nLast month, my gym in Oakland, Calif., called Sweat, announced that it had teamed up with PNO\u0112, a metabolic health lab, to offer clinical-grade VO2max testing, so I signed up with gusto.\nThe purpose of a clinical VO2max test is to measure your maximum oxygen intake at the point that you reach exhaustion. This metric \u2014 the ability for a person to breathe in oxygen and produce carbon dioxide during exercise \u2014 is a strong indicator of cardiovascular fitness.\nAt Sweat, the gym\u2019s owner, Cassie Hecker, strapped an oxygen mask over my face and a heart monitor to my chest. She instructed me to pedal on an exercise bike for about 12 minutes, increasing the intensity each minute while her equipment gathered data. After I reached my maximum heart rate of 182 beats per minute and began to struggle from exhaustion, the test was done.\nThe test was very different from the way the wearables estimated my VO2max. TheApple WatchandGarminstudy your heart rate and movement while you\u2019re walking or running for at least 10 minutes and tally a score.\nSpokespeople for Apple and Garmin referred to documents describing their methods. To inform their algorithms on how to make these estimates, Apple andGarminran studies involving people who were doing a real VO2max test as well as other exercises and studied their heart rates and various metrics.\nThe key word is \u201cestimate.\u201d The watches aren\u2019t actually measuring your oxygen intake and, therefore, aren\u2019t actually measuring your VO2max.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at best an imputed VO2max,\u201d Dr. Weiss said. \u201cNot only do you not have an oxygen mask, you\u2019re not actually exerting yourself to exhaustion.\u201d\nA simple reason that my wearable estimates were so far off from my real VO2max result is that the way my body works doesn\u2019t match the heart-rate and oxygen-intake patterns of participants in the Apple and Garmin studies. Such is the danger of putting too much trust in algorithms.\nThat left me with no choice but to embrace the hard truth: My VO2max result in the lab test was very low. But that statistic was only one data point. The report also showed many positives, including a very high metabolic rate and fat-burning efficiency and healthy breathing patterns.\nTaking all this information together, Ms. Hecker said she rated my fitness level \u201caverage,\u201d higher than the Apple Watch\u2019s cardio fitness rating of \u201cbelow average.\u201d She instructed me to focus on my cardio training. (Admittedly, in the gym classes I pushed myself harder in exercises I enjoyed, like weight lifting, and tended to take it easy on the cardio exercises I found torturous, like burpees.) Not doom and gloom.\nIn the end, all the health experts I interviewed agreed that even though the wearable data \u2014 much of it flawed \u2014 had given me anxiety, I had reached a net positive. The Apple Watch nudged me to pay closer attention to my health, and as a result I\u2019m healthier now.\nThe broad trends shown by the wearables were accurate: Months ago, after the pandemic had taken a toll on my body and mind, I was in my worst shape in years, and the watch numbers were low. Now, even though the watch numbers are too high, I do look and feel better, and that\u2019s all that really matters.\nThat may be the best way to approach wearables \u2014 view them as a directional arrow rather than a precise measuring tool, said Steven Adams, a sports medicine doctor and personal trainer in Danville, Calif.\nWhether you\u2019re using devices to measure your progress inlosing weight,getting more sleepor taking more footsteps, what you need to know is whether the numbers are going up or down. But don\u2019t take them too seriously, because all sorts of factors could be throwing them off \u2014 a loose wrist strap, a faulty sensor or, as in my case, imperfect algorithms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the trend that\u2019s important, not the absolute number, because this stuff\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Dr. Adams said."

        "fulltext": "Bank of America reported on Tuesday that deposits fell less than analysts had expected last quarter, and BNY Mellon reported a slight increase in deposits, pushing their shares up in premarket trading as investors see more evidence that the country\u2019s biggest lenders grew stronger after Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s demise last month.\nA major outlier: Goldman Sachs, which reported revenues that came in below Wall Street\u2019s forecasts, booked a $470 million loss on efforts to sell loans connected with its struggling Marcus consumer banking unit. Its stock fell nearly 4 percent lower in premarket.\nThe outlook is far cloudier for smaller banks.State Street, M&T Bank and Charles Schwab on Monday reported nearly$60 billion in deposit outflowslast quarter. State Street\u2019s shares fell more than 9 percent on Monday, its worst single-day performance in three years. Schwab halted its stock buyback plans, citing market uncertainty.\nBanks are under pressure to raise interest rates to stem the deposit exodus.About $12 billion in deposits left State Street last quarter as customers sought higher rates elsewhere, according to Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\nPer the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the average savings deposit account at a U.S. bank pays out0.37 percent in interest. That looks miserly, especially after the Fed raised up the federal funds rate to nearly 5 percent over the past year: The gap between the Fed\u2019s prime lending rate and the average deposit rate has reacheda multidecade high.\nLook for rivals to exploit that gap.Apple and Goldman Sachs on Monday announced a savings account thatpays 4.15 percentin interest. Goldman\u2019s Marcus offers a savings account with a 3.9 percent interest rate.\nDespite banking uncertainty, stocks broadly continue to rise.The S&P 500 is up 7.5 percent since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But concerns are growing about a recession in the second half of the year, a weak earnings season and the turmoil surrounding lenders prompting a credit crunch.\nMike Wilson, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief investment officer,warned investors on Tuesdayabout consumers having drawn more than $1 trillion worth of deposits out of American banks, suggesting that \u201ca credit crunch has started.\u201d\nThe defamation trial of Fox News is expected to begin on Tuesday.Sources told The New York Times that Dominion Voting Systems and Fox areunlikely to reach a settlementdespite a one-day delay in proceedings as they discussed a potential truce. The companies argued over the size of the potential damages that Fox faces, with Dominion sticking with its claim that it should get over $1.6 billion.\nHouse Republicans will meet to hash out next steps in the debt-ceiling fight.G.O.P. members areset to gather on Tuesdayto discuss Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s proposal, made at the New York Stock Exchange, for a one-year increase in the nation\u2019s borrowing limit in exchange for steep government spending cuts. McCarthy has a tough task: He has a slim majority to pass his plan, and the Democratic-led Senate won\u2019t entertain his offer.\nConsulting giants delay start dates for some business-school recruits.According to The Wall Street Journal, Bain & Company hasoffered M.B.A. recruits up to $40,000if they start next year and take on other projects like working at a nonprofit group or becoming a yoga instructor until then; as of Monday, McKinsey & Company hadn\u2019t given many recruits start dates. (It has since done so, the company said.) The moves come as both consulting firms and their clients embark on job cuts.\nHollywood writers authorize a strike.Unions representing thousands of movie and television writersoverwhelmingly supported a walkoutwhen their contract with major studios expires on May 1. If a strike happens, it would be the first in 15 years; the unions and studios are at an impasse on economic issues, including the use of so-called minirooms to produce shows.\nManchester United\u2019s stock slumps on a report that a sale may be off.Shares in the English soccer club fell over 10 percent on Monday after ESPN said that the team\u2019s co-chairmen, Joel and Avram Glazer, believed they couldsecure a sizable minority investmentand keep control. Several multibillion-pound bids to buy all of United have been made, but the Glazers reportedly believe the club\u2019s valuation could surge over the next decade.\nChina on Tuesday publishedsolid economic datafor the first full quarter since Beijing lifted strict Covid-19 restrictions. The numbers will give hope that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy has turned a corner. But the recovery was uneven and bolstered by a low base effect after last year\u2019s rolling lockdowns, and big questions persist about the country\u2019s management of the economy and private enterprise.\nG.D.P. expanded 4.5 percent in the first quarter year-on-year,beating analysts\u2019 forecastsand up from 2.9 percent in the last three months of 2022. The figures are close to the government\u2019s full-year growth target of 5 percent; analysts expect the recovery to accelerate over the coming months as pent-up demand is unleashed.\nBig drivers included retail sales, which rose 5.8 percent year-on-year, and were up 10.6 percent in March alone; outbound trade, which climbed 8.4 percent; and government spending on infrastructure, which jumped 8.8 percent.\nBut big worries persist.The property sector, which has accounted for about a quarter of gross domestic product over the past decade, is still a drag, with the construction of new homes, offices and stores falling 5.8 percent year on year.\nCompanies are trying to diversify supply chains away from China.Michael Delltold The Financial Times that customers were demanding that his computer company source products from outside China to avoid any supply disruptions. JPMorgan Chaseforecaststhat Apple will make a quarter of its products outside China by 2025, up from less than 5 percent.\nAnd private sector confidence remains low.One leading indicator:Youth unemployment hit 19.6 percent in March, its second-highest on record. Companies are holding back from hiring because of economic uncertainty and Beijing\u2019s role in the private sector, said Yu Jie, a China expert at Chatham House, a think tank. \u201cRestoring confidence will take time,\u201d she told DealBook.\nIn a long-awaited interview with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that aired on Monday, Elon Musk discussed a wide range of topics, including a claim \u2014 made without evidence \u2014 that theU.S. government had \u201cfull access\u201dto Twitter users\u2019 direct messages and an admission that thesocial network\u2019s valuation had plungedsince he bought it.\nMusk also opened up about another preoccupation: creating an alternative artificial intelligence start-up to OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT that he had once backed. But the billionaire said he had different goals than tech giants racing to introduce A.I.-infused products.\nMusk wants a \u201cmaximum truth-seeking A.I.,\u201dwhich he calls TruthGPT. (Last month, he filed to start a new company, X.AI, in Nevada.) Musk offered no concrete details about the proposed start-up, but said it would focus on creating software that \u201ctries tounderstand the nature of the universe.\u201d\nThat approach contrasts with what he called the \u201ctwo heavyweights\u201d of the A.I. race, Microsoft and Google, which he said were too focused on profits andnot enough on safety.\nMusk has been fixated on the dangers of A.I. for some time.Last month, he and others wrote an open letter calling for a pause in the development of artificial intelligence, citing fears that developers were creating giant experiments that they could not \u201cunderstand, predict or reliably control.\u201d\nIn other Musk news:\nMusk suggested that Twitter\u2019s steep valuation drop was attributed to buying the company just before a cyclical drop in digital advertising spending, not toany actions he had taken. He\u2019s scheduled to be interviewed onstage on Tuesday at the Possible digital marketing conference.\nTwitter labeled the account of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as\u201c69% Government-funded Media\u201dafter the broadcaster said that less than 70 percent of its funding came from the government.\n\u2014 Andi Owen, the C.E.O. of the office furniture giant MillerKnoll. In a video from a March town hall event that has circulated widely online,Owen criticized employeesfor asking about bonuses as the company struggled with declining sales.\nThe S.E.C. chairman, Gary Gensler, will face questions from the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday for the first time since Republicans took over leadership of the chamber. Based on recent statements from its chairman, Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, the exchanges could get explosive.\nMcHenry has accused Gensler of stonewalling his investigation into FTX, the crypto exchange that collapsed in November. He alsothreatened the use of \u201ccompulsory process\u201dif the agency didn\u2019t hand over documents about its charges in December against Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder.\nAlso high on the agenda are S.E.C. proposals to amend the definition of an \u201cexchange\u201d to potentially include digital asset trading platforms, which would introduce more agency oversight over operations and add more rigorous custody requirements for investment advisers looking to expand into crypto assets.\nClimate disclosure rules could get heated, too.Last year, the S.E.C. proposed adding requirements for companies to publish details about climate risk management and emissions data, which for some large companies would include \u201cScope 3\u201d emissions that stem downstream to suppliers.\nMcHenry has created a Republican working group focused on vetting environmental, social and governance policies. Its leader, Bill Huizenga of Michigan, has called the proposed climate disclosure rules \u201cdisastrous\u201d and a \u201cprime example\u201d of regulatory overreach.\nProposed market structure changes are also on the agenda.The meme stock trading frenzy of 2021 shined a spotlight on the practice of payment for order flow in which market makers like Citadel Securities pay brokerage firms like Robinhood and Schwab for their flow of trades.\nThe S.E.C. has proposed changes to the practice that aim to give investors more transparency about the execution price for a particular trade. Wall Street has come outagainst the moves.\nDeals\nThe commodities giant Glencore has reportedlypitched some 120 shareholdersof Teck Resources on rejecting the Canadian miner\u2019s plan to break itself up and instead support its $22.5 billion takeover bid of the company.
