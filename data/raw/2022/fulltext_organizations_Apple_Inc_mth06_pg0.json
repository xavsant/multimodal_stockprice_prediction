        "title": "How Updates in iOS 16 and Android 13 Will Change Your Phone",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Around this timeevery year, our smartphones become a reminder to always be ready for change.\nThat\u2019s because Apple and Google announce updates to the operating systems that power our iPhones and Android phones. Soon, the software that makes the devices tick will have design tweaks and new features \u2014 in other words, new things to learn.\nOn Monday, Apple unveilediOS 16, the next version of its iPhone operating system. It will include new features like a redesigned lock screen and the ability to edit text messages. Last month, Google introducedAndroid 13, which features a streamlined wallet app for storing credit cards and important documents likevaccine records. Both companies also said they were improving their apps for sending text messages.\nThe new iPhone and Android operating systems will arrive on our phones as free updates this fall.\nApple and Google often accompany these software updates with highfalutin language and promises. \u201cToday we\u2019re going to push our platforms further than ever,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a prerecorded video for the event announcing the new software.\nBut in reality, lots of the changes \u2014 especially the ability to retroactively edit a text \u2014 are incremental improvements that feel as if they should have happened a long time ago. Here are the most noteworthy updates to look for.\nApple said it was making a change to the first thing anyone sees when using an iPhone: the lock screen.\nIn the past, people could modify only the wallpaper on their lock screens. But with iOS 16, iPhone users can customize the lock screen by choosing from different fonts and colors for the clock. People will also be able to pin \u201cwidgets,\u201d which are essentially shortcuts to apps like the phone\u2019s calendar and fitness data tracker, to the lock screen.\nThese customizations could help us tailor our phones to our lifestyles. Consider that the new software will let an iPhone user create a number of custom lock screens for different scenarios.\nFor example, a lock screen dedicated to work could show a wallpaper of your office building and contain a calendar widget with your next meeting appointment. A lock screen for personal time could show a wallpaper of your dog and an exercise widget. The idea is that people will be able to switch among lock screens to better accommodate their needs throughout the day.\nThe pandemic accelerated the use of mobile purchases as many people shifted toward contactless digital payments to avoid touching cash. Apple has had a robust offering for electronic payments for more than five years with its Wallet software for iPhones, which lets people make credit card purchases and carry important documents like boarding passes and health data.\nGoogle, which has struggled to market its mobile payments technology, took the opportunity last month to delve itself further into payments with Android 13. For years, its Google Pay system severelylagged Apple\u2019s payment systembecause few Android users understood how to use the technology.\nLast month, Google renamed its digital payments appGoogle Wallet. The company simplified the technology by embedding a shortcut to the wallet into the Android lock screen. It also plans to expand the software beyond credit cards, to include documents like boarding passes, movie tickets and Covid-19 vaccination proof.\nAnyone who has sent text messages with a phone is familiar with the digital divide between the so-called green bubble and blue bubble.\nWhen a text message is sent from an Android phone, it shows up as a green bubble on the recipient\u2019s screen, with pictures and videos often pixelated and distorted. That\u2019s because a green bubble message is sent through the phone carrier\u2019s network, which automatically degrades the quality of the image.\nIn contrast, blue bubble messages sent between iPhone users go through iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary messaging service, which maintains a high-quality look for photos and videos.\nWith Android 13, Google is trying to create a blue bubble experience of its own. The company is building into its messaging app a technology calledRich Communication Services, which can send high-resolution images and large files. It will also let people create group conversations, like most modern messaging apps.\nApple, meanwhile, is making changes to iMessage so that iPhone users can edit or recall messages after they are sent. Retroactive message editing, which would spare us the embarrassment of bizarre autocorrect typos or the accidental pocket text, has been a feature people have wanted for years.\nThese days, no software update would be complete without a Big Tech company\u2019s proclaiming that it cares about our privacy. That\u2019s because the tech companies want users to feel safe sharing personal data, especially asEuropean regulators and others have cracked downon them over the issue.\nSo naturally, Apple and Google said they were offering more protections to user data in their next operating systems.\nApple, which has long allowed iPhone users to give family members and romantic partnerspermanent access to their location data, said it would provide deeper controls for such data sharing should an intimate relationship go awry. Its new software feature, Safety Check, will let people quickly review and revoke access to such data so that they can protect their information from abusers.\nGoogle said it would give users more control over what data was shared with third-party apps. In the next version of Android, people will also be able to give apps access to just certain photos instead of their entire camera roll \u2014 a measure of protection against malicious apps that disguise themselves as photo-editing software.\nIf many of these tweaks feel long overdue, that\u2019s because they are. Just as smartphone hardware upgrades have becomemore and more incremental, the software is also inching toward becoming better \u2014 but unremarkably so."

        "title": "Apple Starts Connecting the Dots for Its Next Big Thing",
        "fulltext": "Nearly 15 years after the iPhone set off the smartphone revolution, Apple is assembling the pieces for what it hopes will become its next business-altering device: a headset that blends the digital world with the real one.\nThe company has enlisted Hollywood directors such as Jon Favreau to develop video content for a headset that it is expected to ship next year, according to three people familiar with that work. Mr. Favreau, an executive producer of \u201cPrehistoric Planet\u201d on Apple TV+, is working to bring that show\u2019s dinosaurs to life on the headset, whichlooks like a pair of ski gogglesand aims to offer virtual- and augmented-reality experiences, these people said.\nSeparately, at its annual conference for developers on Monday, Apple plans to unveil software tools that would allow apps to add new camera and voice functionality, laying the groundwork for a hands-free interface that customers will eventually be able to navigate on the headset, according to two people familiar with the project and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\nAn Apple spokeswoman, Trudy Muller, declined to comment on future projects. A spokeswoman for Mr. Favreau could not comment.\nThe planned headset will thrust Apple into an emerging competition to define the future of mixed reality. Microsoft, Google and Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, are in various stages of developing software and hardware to create environments where three-dimensional digital images and the physical world coexist.\nLast year, Meta\u2019s chief executive,Mark Zuckerberg, dropped Facebook as his company\u2019s nameand committed it to building a concept known as the metaverse, where the online, virtual and real worlds coalesce in a new universe. He and others believe it could become the next wave of computing, succeeding the smartphone age dominated by Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android software, much as those platforms followed the decades of Windows and Macintosh.\n\u201cThis is the next frontier,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, a technology research firm. \u201cFor Apple, this is about a new computing experience and opportunity to engage consumers with a device and new experiences that build on what they\u2019ve done with content.\u201d\nThe mixed-reality work is expected to be overshadowed during the keynote of Apple\u2019s conference on Monday, which will largely be devoted to the company\u2019s existing software systems. Apple may also announce a redesigned MacBook Air with slimmer borders around its display than current models and updated processors, analysts said.\nApple\u2019s development of virtual-reality content and software tools is central to creating experiences that give its future headset purpose. Its last major new product, the Apple Watch, was launched with about 3,000 apps but struggled to take off becausetech reviewers said few of those apps were useful. Similar shortcomings have doggedMeta\u2019s Quest virtual-reality headset, which surpassed 10 million sales last year, because many view it as a gaming device.\nFrom its original Macintosh to its iPad, Apple has pursued products that attract a broad swath of potential customers and have an array of uses. It sold an estimated 240 million iPhones last year, accounting for about half of its $366 billion in total sales. To make the headset worthwhile, analysts said, it will need to have utilities that transcend the niche world of video games.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has been talking about the potential of augmented reality for years. In 2016, he told investors that the company was investing heavily in it and considered it a \u201cgreat commercial opportunity.\u201d Around that time, many employees on Apple\u2019s campus were reading \u201cReady Player One,\u201d a futuristic novel about virtual reality, and talking about the possibilities of creating Apple\u2019s own mixed-reality world.\nApple hired an engineer from Dolby Technologies, Mike Rockwell, and tasked him with leading the effort. His early efforts to create an augmented-reality product were hobbled by weak computing power, two people familiar with the project said. Continuing challenges with its battery power have forced Apple to postpone its release until next year, those people said.\nThe augmented-reality initiative has been divisive inside Apple. At least two members of its industrial design team said they had left the company, in part, because they had some concerns about developing a product that might change the way people interact with one another. Such sensitivities have increased inside the company amidrising public concern about children\u2019s screen time.\nWith Mr. Rockwell at the helm, the product would be one of the first to come out of Apple led by its engineering team rather than its co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011, and its former design chief,Jony Ive, who left the company in 2019. The Apple Watch project was led by Mr. Ive and his designers, who defined how it looked, operated and was marketed.\nMr. Favreau's programming shows how Apple is trying to differentiate its product from Meta\u2019s. It also illustrates how the company is tapping into the relationships it has cultivated in Hollywood since starting Apple TV+ in 2019.\n\u201cAn amazing headset could give you a better experience than 80-inch TV,\u201d said Matt Miesnieks, chief executive at LivingCities.xyz, a start-up working on metaverse technology.\nThe software tools from Apple extend a multiyear push to encourage developers to build augmented-reality apps. The company kicked off that effort in2017 with ARKit, which allowed developers to use the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors to place digital objects in the real world and let people interact with them.\nHowever, about 70 percent of Apple\u2019s developers said they did not use that tool, according to a survey of more than 500 developers by Creative Strategies.\nA tool kit that Apple is expected to introduce at the conference offers software developers new abilities to trigger shortcuts inside their apps using Siri andQR codes, interactions that will be leveraged in future headsets, a person familiar with the project said.\nBrooks BarnesandBenjamin Mullincontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "It\u2019s clear more than ever that governments will no longer leave technology alone.\nEuropemandated standard phone chargersfor portable electronics while Texas passed acontested lawto restrain social media companies\u2019 policing of online speech. Tech companies can count on more changes like those as government minders wade into how they do business and how we use their products.\nThat most likely means new technologies likedriverless carsandfacial recognition systemswill take longer to spread into the world than they might have. For many tech proponents, more deliberation and oversight will slow invention. For others, that\u2019s exactly the point.\nI wanted to hash this over in today\u2019s newsletter because it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by (or tune out) all the attempted government regulation. In just the past few weeks, journalists have written about pending congressional bills involvingdata privacyandtech antitrust;the employment classification ofdrivers for companies like Uber;multiple countries setting standards abouthow data can and cannot move around the globe; the Netherlandsforcing Appleto revise payment options for dating apps; and twostatelawson social media speech.\nThose are all the result of a still-evolving rethinking of what had been a relatively laissez-faire approach to tech since the 1990s. With exceptions, the prevailing attitude was that new internet technologies, including digital advertising, e-commerce, social media and \u201cgig\u201d employment through apps, were too novel, fringe and useful for governments to constrain them with many rules.\nAs television and radio did when those mediums were new, many tech companies encouraged light regulation by saying that they were bringing change for the better, elected officials were too plodding and clueless to effectively oversee them, and government intervention would muck up progress.\nJust one example: A decade ago, Facebook said U.S. rules that require TV and radio to disclose who is paying for election-related adsshouldn\u2019t apply to that company. The U.S. election agency \u201cshould not stand in the way of innovation,\u201d a Facebook lawyer said at the time.\nThose ad disclosures aren\u2019t always effective, but after Russia-backed propagandists spread social mediaadsand free posts toinflame American political divisionsin 2016, Facebook voluntarily started to provide more transparency about political ads.\nBetter laws or ad disclosures probably wouldn\u2019t have prevented hostile foreign actors from abusing Facebook to wage information wars in the U.S. or other countries. But the hands-off conventional wisdom most likely contributed to a sense that people in charge of tech should be left alone to do what they wished.\nThat made it harder for governments to wade in once it was clear that social media was being abused to hurt democracy, thatunproven driver-assistance technologiesmight be dangerous, and that Americans haveno control in the land grab for our digital information.\n\u201cWe realized that we unleashed these powerful forces and failed to create appropriate safeguards,\u201d said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. \u201cWe simply could have said in the beginning, every technology needs to be regulated in a common-sense way.\u201d\nNow regulators are feeling empowered. Lawmakers have waded in to make rulesfor law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition technology.There will be more laws like those in Texas to take power away from the handful of tech executives whoset rules of free expression for billionsof people. More countries will force Apple and Google toremake the app economy. More regulation is alreadychanging the ways that children use technology.\nAgain, not all of this will be good government intervention. But there are more signs that people who create technologieswant more government oversight, too\u2014 or at least pay lip service to it. Any discussion about emerging technology, including the artificial intelligenceillustration software Dall-Eandcryptocurrency, regularly includes deliberation about the potential harms and how regulation might minimize them.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that people agree on what government oversight should look like. But the answer is almost never no government intervention at all. And that\u2019s different.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nOver 10 months, nearly 400 car crashes in the U.S. involved advanced driver-assistance technologies, according to federal datareportedby my colleagues Neal Boudette and Cade Metz.

        "title": "What Europe\u2019s Universal Charger Mandate Means for You",
        "fulltext": "Most of us own multiple types of chargers to replenish our devices. That\u2019s because many products, like Apple phones and Microsoft Surface computers, are plugged in with wires that use unique connectors.\nSoon, that may no longer be the case.\nThis month, theEuropean Union announced a mandatethat will require all new portable devices like smartphones, earbuds and wireless keyboards to use a common charger by 2024. Two years later, the same rules will apply to new laptops.\nAlthough the law will be enforced throughout Europe, it may affect consumers worldwide. That\u2019s because it will most likely be costly for tech companies to make products with different charging technology only for European countries.\nThe legislation, which regulators say will reduce e-waste, appears targeted at Apple, whose iPhones, iPads and Macs use an array of charging technologies. Apple, which declined to comment, sent a letter to the European Commission in November expressing itsopposition to the mandate, arguing it would stifle introductions of new charging technologies. Terence Zakka, a spokesman for the commission, said the legislation could be swiftly updated to ensure it kept up with new technology.\nThe long story short is that, no matter where you live, most devices you buy in the coming years will probably include a charging port known asUSB-C. The shift may be a frustrating transition for many, and perhaps most acutely for iPhone customers who have collected wires and accessories using Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning connector since itsintroduction a decade ago. Those products will become impractical to use once the mandate takes effect and people begin to buy new products that lack Lightning connections.\nSo it will help to prepare for this transition to avoid waste. Here\u2019s what you can do.\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about USB-C. It\u2019s that oval connector that works with many modern Android phones and laptops. It\u2019s not the same as Apple\u2019s flat rectangular Lightning connector or the bulky USB rectangular connector, which is an older technology called USB-A.\nThe European law requires all devices to use USB-C by 2026. So we will need to plan accordingly to incorporate that connector into the products we use to recharge our devices, including power bricks and wires.\nWhen buying apower brickthat hooks up to your computer or phone via a wire, make sure to get one with the oval USB-C port. That will allow it to accept a USB-C power cable, which will plug into your future phone or computer.\nMany Android phones and computers already use USB-C power cables \u2014 so continue to buy those if you need to. But let\u2019s say you use Apple phones, which use the Lightning connector. If your wired Lightning charger for your iPhone breaks, it will still make sense to buy a replacement cable because those wires are relatively inexpensive. High-quality,third-party Lightning cables cost as little as $15. The safest bet is to buy a Lightning cable with a USB-C connector on the other end, to ensure that it will plug in to your next laptop or power brick.\nAnother option is to go wireless, said John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Incorporated, a company that sells refurbished Apple hardware. Most modern smartphones, including iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones, work with a newer wireless charging technology known as magnetic induction, which uses an electrical current to generate a magnetic field and create voltage that powers your device without plugging a wire into it.\nWireless chargers come in many shapes and forms, including mats and docks. Because they do not need to be plugged into a port on your phone, now is an opportune time to considerwireless chargers.\nA trickier conundrum concerns buying accessories like keyboards and mice, Mr. Bumstead said. Some new products like Apple\u2019s $200 Magic Keyboard or its $150 Magic Trackpad include Lightning ports.\nIt would be wise to wait a couple of years for future versions of those products, Mr. Bumstead said. That\u2019s because once the USB-C mandate takes effect, it will be a hassle to carry a USB-C cable for your phone and computer and a Lightning cable for your keyboard or mouse. It will be more convenient to carry one cable that charges everything. That\u2019s the entire point of the European law.\nStill, when everything uses the same type of connector in a few years, that won\u2019t mean you will have to discard your devices that use proprietary connections. One option for making them more convenient to use is to buy an adapter, like a dongle that allows a Lightning connector to accept a USB-C connection, Mr. Bumstead said. That way, if you have just one device that uses a Lightning connector, you can use the dongle to continue to plug in that device with a USB-C cable.\nDongles are an inelegant solution, however, because they are tiny and easy to lose, so you\u2019re better off not buying accessories with proprietary connections. Instead, opt for those that come with USB-C ports.\nWith some forethought, this transition won\u2019t be so bad. USB-C is a solid technology allowing devices to be replenished quickly. And because so many products already use a USB-C connector, most of us already own plenty of these cables, said Jeff Ravencraft, the president of the USB Implementers Forum, a standards organization working with companies including Apple, HP and Microsoft to develop USB technology.\n\u201cThis train has already left the station,\u201d Mr. Ravencraft said. He added that USB-C was designed to have an extended life span, meaning it should still be a useful technology in 2026, when the law fully kicks in."

        "title": "Apple Workers at Maryland Store Vote to Unionize, a First in the U.S.",
        "fulltext": "Apple employees at a Baltimore-area store have voted to unionize, making it the first of the company\u2019s 270-plus stores in the United States to join a trend in labor organizing sweeping through retailers, restaurants and tech companies.\nThe result, announced on Saturday by the National Labor Relations Board, provides a foothold for a budding movement among Apple retail employees who want a greater voice over wages and Covid-19 policies. Employees of more than two dozen Apple stores have expressed interest in unionizing in recent months, union leaders say.\nIn the election, 65 employees at Apple\u2019s store in Towson, Md., voted in favor of being represented by the union, known as the Apple Coalition of Organized Retail Employees, while 33 voted against. It will be part of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, an industrial trade union that represents over 300,000 employees.\n\u201cI applaud the courage displayed by CORE members at the Apple store in Towson for achieving this historic victory,\u201d Robert Martinez Jr., president of IAM International, said in a statement.\u201cThey made a huge sacrifice for thousands of Apple employees across the nation who had all eyes on this election.\u201d\nTyra Reeder, a technical specialist who has worked at the Towson store a little over six months, said that she was \u201celated\u201d with the outcome and that she hoped a union would help increase workers\u2019 compensation; stabilize the store's scheduling, which has been strained by recent Covid-19 cases; and make it easier for workers to advance within the company.\n\u201cWe love our jobs. We just want to see them do better,\u201d Ms. Reeder said.\nThe outcome is a blow to Apple\u2019s campaign to blunt union drives by arguing that it pays more than many retailers and provides an array of benefits, including health care and stock grants. Last month, it increased starting wages for retail employees to $22 an hour, from $20, and released a video of Deirdre O\u2019Brien, who leads Apple retail, cautioning employees that joining a union could hurt the company\u2019s business.\nApple declined to comment.\nEmployees in Towson said in a videoproduced by the website More Perfect Unionahead of the union vote that Apple\u2019s anti-union campaign there was \u201cnasty\u201d and included management telling workers that unions once prohibited Black employees from joining their ranks. In the weeks ahead of the vote, Ms. O\u2019Brien visited the store and thanked everyone for their hard work.\nSoon after, employees said their managers began encouraging staff to air their concerns in meetings and help come up with solutions to their grievances. They also started to pull employees into one-on-one meetings where managers highlighted the cost of union dues, said Eric Brown, a Towson employee active in the union effort.\nEarlier this month, employees at a store in Atlanta abandoned a planned election when support for the union fizzled after Apple\u2019s moves to increase wages and highlight the benefits it offered. The union organizers in Atlanta have filed a formal charge with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing Apple of requiring workers to listen to anti-union messages during mandatory meetings. The board has not yet determined if the charge has merit.\nMs. Reeder said that workers in Atlanta had helped prepare union supporters at the Towson store to defuse the company\u2019s talking points. \u201cWe kind of got some insight from the Atlanta store on things that were coming,\u201d she said, citing thecompany\u2019s suggestions that employees could lose certain benefitsduring a contract negotiation if they unionized.\n\u201cFor that to happen, a majority of us have to agree,\u201d Ms. Reeder added. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us would agree to lose something we love dearly, that benefits us.\u201d\nAt Starbucks, one of the companies where organizers have gained the most momentum, employeescredited a vote to organize at a store in Buffalowith helping to spur other stores to file for union elections. Since that vote in December, more than 150 of the company\u2019s roughly 9,000 corporate-owned stores in the U.S. have voted to unionize, according to the N.L.R.B.\nWorkers at stores that later unionized reached out to employees in Buffalo for advice on how to navigate the process.\n\u201cWorkers gain interest and courage if workers elsewhere prevail,\u201d said William Gould, a law professor at Stanford University and author of \u201cFor Labor to Build Upon: Wars, Depression and Pandemic.\u201d \u201cMany watch to see: Can workers succeed? Will they band together? If the answer is affirmative, it will encourage other workers to take a step toward collective bargaining.\u201d\nThe ability of workers to win a contractmay hingeon whether the campaign spreads to other stores. Union supporters at Starbucks have said that one of their largest sources of leverage over the company is the fact that they continue to win elections around the country.\nAmazon workers who helpedunionize a Staten Island warehousein April have also said they would benefit if more warehouses followed suit. The company ischallengingthe outcome of that vote before the labor board. With only one U.S. location that has formally unionized, the company can focus resources on opposing the union there.\nApple employees are also organizing at the Grand Central Terminal store in New York and a store in Louisville, Ky. Those stores are building support before they ask for an election. Organizers in Atlanta have said that they plan to revive their election in the future."

        "title": "A Short History of Tech Predictions",
        "fulltext": "In 2013, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook,saidthat gadgets we wear on our wrists \u201ccould be a profound area of technology.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t. Maybe you own a Fitbit or an Apple Watch, but that category of digital devices hasn\u2019t been as momentous as Cook and many other tech optimists hoped.\nA half-decade ago, Pok\u00e9mon Go persuaded people to roam their neighborhoods tochase animated charactersthat they could see by pointing a smartphone camera at their surroundings. Cook was among the corporate executives who said that the game might be the beginning of a transformative melding of digital and real life, sometimes called augmented reality or A.R.\n\u201cI think A.R. can be huge,\u201d Cook told Apple investors in 2016.\nIt wasn\u2019t. Augmented reality,virtual realityand similar technologies remain promising and occasionally useful, but they haven\u2019t been huge yet.\nToday, Cook and a zillion other people are betting that a combination of those two technologies willbecome the next major phase of the internet.Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Snap are steering toward a future in which we\u2019ll wear computers on our heads forinteractions that fuse physical and digital life. (You and Mark Zuckerberg can call this themetaverse. I won\u2019t.)\nGiven technologists\u2019 spotty record of predicting digital revolutions, it\u2019s worth examining why their pronouncements haven\u2019t come true yet \u2014 and if this time, they\u2019re right.\nThere are two ways of looking at predictions of wearable computers and immersive digital worlds over the past decade. The first is that all the past inventions were necessary steps on the path to something grand.\nPeoplemockedGoogle Glass after the company released a test version of the computer headset in 2013, but the glasses might have been a building block. Computer chips, software, cameras and microphones have since improved so much that digital headgear might soon be less obtrusive and more useful.\nLikewise, Pok\u00e9mon Go, virtual reality video games and apps tocheck out a new lipstick through augmented realitymight not have been for everyone, but they helped techies refine the ideas and made some people excited about the possibilities of more engrossing digital experiences.\nMy colleagues have reported that next year Apple may ship a ski-goggle-like computer headset and aims to offer virtual- and augmented-reality experiences. Apple gave only hints about that work during anevent on Monday to unveil iPhone software tweaks, but the company has beenlaying the groundworkfor such technologies to be its potential next big product category.\nThe second possibility is that technologists might be wrong again about the potential of the next iterations of Google Glass plus Pok\u00e9mon Go. Maybe more refined features, longer battery life, less dorky eyewear and more entertaining things to do on face computers are not the most essential ingredients for the next big thing in technology.\nOne issue is that technologists haven\u2019t yet given us good reasons for why we would want to live in the digital-plus-real world that they imagine for us.\nI have written before that any new technologyinevitably competes with the smartphone, which is at the center of our digital lives.Everything that comes next must answer the question: What does this thing do that my phone can\u2019t?\nThat challenge doesn\u2019t mean that technology is frozen where it is today. I have been excited by workouts that make it seem as ifa trainer is coaching me along a virtual mountain lake,and I can imagine new ways of connecting with people far away that feel more intimate than Zoom. Apple in particular has a track record of taking existing technology concepts like smartphones and streaming music and making them appealing for the masses.\nBut the more rich our current digital lives have become, the more difficult it will be for us to embrace something new. That\u2019s something that those past and current predictions of a more immersive computing future haven\u2019t really reckoned with.\nJust one of the cruel and formulaic hoaxes after violent tragedies:After mass shootings or other deadly events, online posts often claim that Jordie Jordan was one of the victims.

        "title": "Apple unveils new software to make the iPhone and other products feel new.",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 More than two years into the coronavirus pandemic, Apple made a big push on Monday to return to normalcy by inviting hundreds of software developers and journalists to its campus for an unveiling of a range of new software features that expand the iPhone\u2019s utility.\nOver a two-hour presentation, Apple revealed a buy-now-pay-later program that splits a purchase over several months, much like programs offered by PayPal and others. It also said it was expanding the ability to use an iPhone to unlock doors to apartments, hotel rooms and rental cars. And it introduced a version of CarPlay that would take over a vehicle\u2019s entire dashboard, providing speed and fuel information as well as maps and music.\nCollectively, the new features show how Tim Cook, the chief executive, is still finding ways to expand the usefulness and longevity of Apple\u2019s most important product while wringing more sales out of it through features that thrust the company deeper into adjacent industries such as finance, real estate and autos.\n\u201cThey are the digital control center, and they are extending their reach as more and more devices are digitized,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. \u201cMuch of this is not going to change the world, but they are enhancements that give a little freshness that people appreciate.\u201d\nThe software updates continue a yearslong lull in the introduction of a new product category from a company that its co-founder Steve Jobs made synonymous with revolutionary new devices. Apple last unveiled a new product category, wearables, in 2014 when it introduced the Apple Watch.\nThe pandemic has helped increase sales of Apple\u2019s legacy products. Students and employees forced to work from home found value in upgrading to the latest versions of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Many turned to video games and subscriptions for Apple TV+, helping increase the company\u2019s sales last year by 33 percent to $366 billion.\nOn Monday, Apple looked to further the momentum of its Macs by updating its most popular computer, the MacBook Air. The new version sheds a decade-old wedge-shaped case in favor of a slender, rectangular laptop. The computer comes in a multitude of colors, including silver, space gray, gold and dark blue. The new model is 20 percent smaller than its predecessor and weighs 2.7 pounds, the company said.\nThe MacBook Air features Apple\u2019s newest processor, the M2, which the company said offered increased performance even as it required less battery power.\nThe company said it was bringing more personalization to the iPhone, with the ability to customize the lock screen with colors, widgets and live activities. The new software will let iPhone users create custom lock screens for different purposes \u2014 like a screen for work that shows a preview of a calendar, or a personal screen that shows exercise activity data.\nThe new software features, part of Apple\u2019s new iOS 16 operating system for iPhones, mirrored those that Google introduced for its Android system in 2021. Google created Material You, an offering that allows users to change the look of their lock screens by pulling from colors in their home screen wallpapers.\nIn addition to those updates, Apple said it was overhauling its messaging system, allowing people to recall and edit texts after sending them. There also is a new ability to compose messages by fluidly switching between typing text and dictating voice memos.\nThe company\u2019s efforts to push beyond its existing businesses extended to new software for the iPad. It showcased new tools for workplace collaboration called Freeform, which allows colleagues to brainstorm across devices at the same time. The feature, similar to offerings from Microsoft and Google, has the potential to increase the iPad\u2019s value to businesses.\nApple also unveiled software updates to its smartwatch that will allow runners to monitor their gait \u2014 potentially forgoing work with trainers \u2014 and help people track the stages of their sleep cycle.\nThe presentation was the first major event Apple has hosted on its campus in Cupertino since 2019. In light of rising coronavirus cases in the Bay Area, the company set up screens and chairs outside the cafeteria at the heart of its $5 billion campus, Apple Park. Attendees included developers, journalists and retail employees, a group that Apple is eager to improve relations with amida rise in union organizing.\nThough the event focused on existing products, it sprinkled hints of a virtual reality product thatthe company hopes will be its next business-altering device. Apple said it was making it easier for apps to use Siri, creating a shortcut that will make it possible to interact with apps through voice in future headsets, a person familiar with the project said. It also showed a demonstration of a new Resident Evil video game with the kind of sophisticated graphics customary in virtual reality games.\nThe headset, whichlooks like a pair of ski goggles, is not expected to ship until next year because of challenges with battery power and performance, two people familiar with the project said.\nIts success is far from guaranteed. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has struggled to broaden the appeal of its Quest virtual reality headset beyond avid video game players. Last year, it surpassed about 10 million unit sales, a small fraction of the 240 million iPhones that analysts estimate Apple shipped.\nApple has struggled to persuade developers to embrace its vision of a mixed reality world. In 2017, it introduced ARKit to allow developers to use the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensor to begin blending the digital and real worlds. But about 70 percent of Apple\u2019s developers said they did not use the tool, according to a survey of more than 500 developers by Creative Strategies, a technology research firm."

        "title": "Europe wants to help clear out your drawer full of chargers.",
        "fulltext": "The European Union on Tuesday reached an agreement that will require all new smartphones, tablets and laptops to use a common charger by 2026.\nThe policy is an attempt to address the well-known consumer frustration of having adrawer full of chargers\u2014 some for Apple devices, others for portable speakers or hand-held gaming systems. It brings an unusual level of involvement by a government regulator into product design decisions.\nPolicymakers said the move would cut down on electronic waste. But the new law had been opposed by companies including Apple, which said it would prevent new charging technologies from developing. Under the law, a European standards body will be in charge of considering future charger designs for all devices.\nBy 2024, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, hand-held video game devices, headphones, portable speakers, keyboards, mice, earbuds and other portable devices will need USB-C charging ports,the European Commission announced. By 2026, the law will apply to laptops.\nCompanies will also be required to sell devices without a charger to reduce the number of chargers in circulation. The European Commission, the executive body of the 27-nation bloc, said discarded and unused chargers produced 11,000 tons of waste each year.\n\u201cA common charger is common sense for the many electronic devices on our daily lives,\u201d Thierry Breton, the European commissioner who helped negotiate the deal, said in a statement.\nAny move by tech companies to comply with the law may have broader implications. After Europe passed theGeneral Data Protection Regulation, a privacy law that took effect in 2018, many companies applied the standard to their products globally. Other nations also often follow Europe\u2019s lead in tech legislation, potentially resulting in similar laws elsewhere."

        "title": "Should You Buy Now, Pay Later? Tread Carefully.",
        "fulltext": "In the summer of 2020, amid fear and uncertainty over the pandemic, Amber Cole of Colorado Springs turned to retail therapy. She browsed Lululemon\u2019s website for trendy athletic apparel like T-shirts and leggings for $50 to $130.\nMs. Cole, 33, saw an enticing option to pay for her purchases. After entering a few pieces of information, she could buy the clothing in four installments spread over six weeks. That way, a $50 T-shirt shrank to a $12.50 payment; a $130 pair of leggings was a mere $32.50. The best part: She could get the items before finishing the payments, and she was not on the hook for paying interest.\nThis friction-free option to pay off items in chunks \u2014 called \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d \u2014 was popularized by Afterpay, a financial tech firm based in Australia and founded in 2014. Throughout the pandemic, as people hunkered down at home and sought to fill voids with material possessions, installment payment plans gained traction. Afterpay, which Square acquired for$29 billionin 2020, spawned copycats, including Affirm, Klarna and Fingerhut. This month, Appleannouncedthat it would offer a similar program.\nWhile the financing programs offer upsides like interest-free payments, there are potential dangers. The rule of thumb for financial security is to be aware of your budget and in control of your spending, personal finance experts said. But buy now, pay later programs seem intended to make people perceive a product to be cheaper than it truly is and lose control of their spending, critics said.\nIn December, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauopened an inquiryinto these programs, expressing concern that people could accumulate debt with multiple purchases.\n\u201cThey can be helpful to consumers in the sense that they don\u2019t carry interest if paid on time, but consumers can end up buying more than they planned,\u201d said Laura Udis, a program manager at the bureau.\nMs. Cole fell into that trap. Using the installment payment plans, she said, she increased her average purchases from $200 to $400 an order over time. Packages appeared at her door every day. Her biggest regret was a $600 rug from Anthropologie (spread into four $150 payments).\nMs. Cole soon fell behind on payments for her regular bills. She eventually came clean to her husband and, to catch up on payments, got a job at a bakery and sold some of her impulse purchases on eBay. A few months ago, she closed her Afterpay account.\n\u201cI had a beautiful closet full of lovely clothes, purses and shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is also filled with shame, guilt and regret.\u201d\nBuy now, pay later has become impossible to ignore. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nIn general, buy now, pay later programs from companies like Afterpay, Affirm, Klarna and Zip look identical, but they have important differences.\nThey are typically short-term loans that let you pay for an item in four installments (or fewer) over a period of about six weeks. After a consumer provides some information, like a name and Social Security number, the companies typically do a light credit pull. From there, you make a down payment, which is 25 percent of the product\u2019s total cost, and the bills for the remaining three payments arrive every two weeks.\nThe loans are interest-free for people largely because the retailer pays a higher transaction fee \u2014 4 percent, roughly double that of a typical transaction fee incurred by a credit card company. The benefit for the retailer is that the installment plans can persuade people to buy things they otherwise wouldn\u2019t, said Jared Wiesel, an executive at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm.\nWhat happens when you miss a payment? Here\u2019s where the differences come up. Afterpay charges a flat $8 late fee about 10 days after a missed payment. Affirm doesn\u2019t charge a fee, but it says late paymentsmay ding your credit score, which could hurt your chances of getting another loan.\nThat was a major downside highlighted by John Cabell, a director of banking and payments research at J.D. Power, which recentlypublished a studyabout problems with the payment programs.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help you build your credit like a credit card does, but it can certainly hurt your credit if you\u2019re not making payments in a timely fashion,\u201d he said.\nReturns have also been a source of confusion among consumers who have used buy now, pay later financing, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For some retailers, consumers have to first contact the creditor, which then freezes the payment schedule and informs the retailer of the return. For others, the customer contacts the retailer, which contacts the creditor.\nThis is all to say that these are still early days for buy now, pay later programs, which have many variations and unknowns. As is always the case with taking out any kind of loan, people would benefit from reading the fine print.\nBuying now and paying later can be beneficial in some situations. Mr. Cabell came up with one where an installment plan could be used to make a single emergency purchase, like a replacement for a kitchen appliance, so that the money doesn\u2019t leave a bank account all at once.\nYet that\u2019s not how most people use these loans, according to Mr. Cabell\u2019s research. Most buy now, pay later purchases involve clothing and home furnishings, and 21 percent of younger consumers say they are using multiple buy now, pay later accounts.\n\u201cSuddenly you have eight payments that are hitting your card, and it can get complicated,\u201d he said.\nAbove all, the key to reaping the benefits of these interest-free loans is knowing you can truly afford what you\u2019re buying, said Jully-Alma Taveras, a personal finance adviser. Just as important, she said, is avoiding the use of installments as an excuse to buy more things than you need.\nElisa Salinas, 34, a teacher assistant in Chicago, believes she has kept the installment plans under control. She said she regularly used the programs to finance purchases like shoes and eyeglasses. Her payments are on time because they hit her bank account when she receives her paycheck every two weeks.\n\u201cIt just feels more convenient than seeing a big amount taken out of your bank account all at once,\u201d she said. But she admitted it was probably a bad thing that she was unaware of how the loans would affect her credit score."

        "title": "How Much Can the Fed Do?",
        "fulltext": "Ever since the government reported last week thatinflation had sped up in May, economists and investors have been on high alert to see how the Federal Reserve would respond to the threat of surging prices.\nToday, we find out.The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting and announcewhat it will dowith the short-term interest rate it sets. Before the higher-than-anticipated report on price increases, economists had been predicting that the Fed would raise its benchmark rate by a half-percentage point. Now, many Wall Streeters are saying that an increase of three-quarters of a percentage point is the most likely outcome. If that happens, it would be the first time in decades that the Fed raised interest rates by that much.\nThe causes of inflation have become a bit clearer.Earlier this year, some economists argued that the central bank should think twice about raising interest rates to slow inflation. Rising prices, they argued, were a result of supply chains that had been snarled up by the pandemic, something interest rates can\u2019t fix. But now that supply chain problems have eased, and prices have nonetheless continued to rise, economists are instead pointing to continued intense demand for goods and services \u2014 something the Fed has the tools to tackle.\nSo far, the Fed\u2019s moves have not had much effect.The central bank began raising interest rates in March from near zero to, most recently, 0.75 percent. But prices have continued to rise. That being said, the rate increases have quickly been felt in certain parts of the economy. Mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed loanreached about 6.3 percentthis week, about double what they were at the beginning of the year.\nInflation might actually be even higher than economists think.Last week, the National Bureau of Economic Researchpublished a paperthat argued we may be underestimating inflation. Larry Summers, a Harvard professor and former top Obama economic adviser, was one of its authors. Some economists have taken comfort in the idea that inflation is running at an 8.6 percent annual level, still considerably lower than the peak of just under 15 percent in 1980. But the paper\u2019s authors point to changes that the government made to the way it tracks consumer prices in 1983. If you apply the current methodology to economic data from 1980, it shows that prices were rising at about 9 percent annually, they argue. And if you apply the 1980 method to today\u2019s data, you will get a rate that is pretty close to the 1980 peak. Just when it seemed we had finished recycling trends from the \u201980s\u2026\nPresident Biden weighs rolling back tariffs on some Chinese goods to ease inflation.Whilelifting some levies on Chinais unlikely to make a big difference, officials have conceded that they have few other options to address surging prices. Separately, Biden,in a letter today, urged major U.S. oil companies to increase refining capacity to ease record-high gasoline prices.\nThe European Central Bank is holding an emergency meeting to address market turmoil.The urgency of the meetinghighlights the concern about borrowing costs for some European countries, as the spread between German bonds and Italian bonds hit its widest level since 2020.\nThe crypto lender Celsius reportedly hires restructuring lawyers.Celsius, one of the largest crypto lenders, is turning to the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld for help with its deepening financial problems,The Wall Street Journal reported, days after the company told users that it was pausing all withdrawals because of \u201cextreme market conditions.\u201d Bitcoinfell to an 18-month low today, and other cryptocurrencies also dropped.\nJPMorgan wins a trial in London in which Nigeria sought $1.7 billion.An effort by the Nigerian government to force JPMorgan Chase to restore funds that it claimed former officials had looted from a government bank account failed aftera judge ruled in favor of the bank. Nigeria had argued that JPMorgan had not done enough to safeguard the country\u2019s money.\nThe real estate brokerages Compass and Redfin are laying off staff members.The two companies said in regulatory filings that they were cutting about 10 percent and about 6 percent of their employees, respectively. The moves comeas rising mortgage rates have begun to dampen the U.S. housing market.\nBanking executives gathered in Manhattan this week at a conference hosted by Morgan Stanley. While they talked up the strength of the U.S. economy, they also spent plenty of time discussing inflation, recession and the plunging stock market.\nLananh Nguyen, who covers finance for The Times, highlighted some of the most noteworthy comments for DealBook:\nThebear marketfor stocks and the threat of recession were top of mind.\u201cThis correction, this environment \u2014 this is what we\u2019re paid to do. I am totally relaxed about it,\u201d said James Gorman, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re falling into some massive hole over the next few years,\u201d he said. \u201cI think eventually the Fed will get a hold of inflation.\u201d But Gorman warned that things would be \u201cbumpy.\u201d\nWeaker equity markets are a bad sign. \u201cThe I.P.O. market\u2019s completely shut down,\u201d said Navid Mahmoodzadegan, co-president of Moelis & Company, a boutique investment bank, and so is the market for special purpose acquisition companies.\nDespite the gloomy outlook, consumers are still in good financial shape.Bank of America\u2019s clients are still spending \u201cpretty robustly,\u201d and sitting on more money than they had before the coronavirus pandemic, said Alastair Borthwick, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer. Gorman said corporate balance sheets were also healthy.\nLower fees will eat into revenue.Bank of America expects to take a $750 million hit this year after itcut overdraft fees, which have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators. Wells Fargo anticipates that scrapping fees for insufficient funds will cost it $700 million, according to its finance chief, Michael P. Santomassimo.\nMortgage businesses are facing pressure.Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage banking income is projected to drop 50 percent this quarter compared with the first three months of the year, Santomassimo said. Given the economic uncertainty, the bank is unlikely to release any money from its rainy-day fund, he said. Terry Dolan, U.S. Bank\u2019s chief financial officer, said he also expected revenue from mortgage banking to slide.\n\u2014 Lee Reiners, a former Fed official who teaches at Duke University\u2019s law school. The pullback in crypto is exposingthe precariousness of the structurebuilt around digital assets.\nGig companies like Uber and Lyft suffered a setback yesterday when a court in Massachusetts rejected aproposed ballot measurethat would have classified drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.\nThe unanimous ruling by a seven-judge panel halted the companies\u2019 $17.8 million campaign to put the issue to voters. The measure would have given drivers some limited benefits but absolved the companies of the need to pay for full health care coverage, time off or other benefits that employees enjoy. The fight in Massachusetts came after a similar initiative in California in 2020 in which gig companies spent more than $200 million on a state ballot proposition. In that case, voters passed the measure, but a judge later found it unconstitutional. Still, the decision in Massachusetts is another sign that gig companies\u2019 business models may not remain viable.\nThe ballot initiative might have succeeded had it not overreached.It contained a provision buried in obscure language that seemed to try to shield businesses from liability for accidents or crimes involving their drivers. This section was unrelated to the rest of the proposal, the court said, violating a state requirement that all sections of a ballot measure be related. \u201cPolicymakers should pay attention to the reality that gig companies\u2019 march toward a future with degraded worker protections is not inevitable,\u201d Terri Gerstein, a workers\u2019 rights lawyer at Harvard Law School\u2019s Labor and Worklife Program,told The Times\u2019s Kellen Browning.\nGig companies are taking their worker classification fight state by state.They tried to strike alabor bargain in New Yorkin 2021 and recentlysucceeded in Washington State. In May, Seattlepassed protectionsfor gig workers, whichUber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart opposed. Federal lawmakers have yet to successfully address the issues.\nLabor matters aside, gig companies may find their businesses beinghit hardby rising gas prices. Inflation is also pushing more workersinto the gig economyas they try to make ends meet.\nDeals\nApple won the rights tostream Major League Soccer matchesin a 10-year agreement that is reportedly worth $2.5 billion.
