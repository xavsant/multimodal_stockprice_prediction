        "fulltext": "Remember the iPad?\nApple\u2019s earnings report on Tuesday brought a lot of uncommon news for the company. The typical double-digit growth slowed to more of a trickle, with revenue up 1.7 percent from a year ago. Sales growth for the\n                                        iPhone, by far the company\u2019s most important product, slowed to its lowest year-over-year rate of growth since the device was introduced in 2007.\nOne trend continued again, on cue \u2014struggling salesof the iPad.

        "title": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Investors have long relied onAppleto deliver one crucial attribute: growth. Now they are beginning to wonder whether Apple\u2019s days as a growth stock are coming to an end.\nWith sales increases of theiPhoneprojected to decelerate, and no clear new blockbuster device on the horizon, the era of the company\u2019s producing 50 or 60 percent annual revenue growth may be on the wane. When Apple reportsearnings on Tuesday, investors will be scouring the results for signs of how fast that downshift is happening.\nAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\n\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201d\nMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.\nThe change has important implications for Apple. While a company like Netflix is regarded as a growth stock because its revenuegrew 22.8 percentin the most recent quarter from the previous year, value stocks include aging tech giants like Cisco, Oracle and Intel. Being lumped in with those behemoths would be a perception shift for Apple.\nSwitching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\n\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.\nA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.\nAny change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.\nThe Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.\nThe effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.\nInvestors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.\nMr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201d\nApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\nIn total, Apple shares fell 4.7 percent in 2015. So far this year, they are down 3.7 percent, while the S.&P. 500 is down 6.7 percent. Alphabet is now withinspitting distance of overtaking Appleas the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalization.\n\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.\nInvestors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.\nAnd Apple may have some product aces up its sleeve. The company entered wearable computing last year withthe Apple Watch. Apple is also trying to become adominant software platformin the auto industry and is working ona car. (An executive who was overseeing the car project, Steve Zadesky, is leaving the company for personal reasons, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are private. The Wall Street Journalearlier reportedon the departure.)\nApple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.\nTom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.\nBut until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\n\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?",
        "fulltext": "There is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.\nTake, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.\nThis strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.\nSo what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.\nAnother reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)\nBut even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.\nAlong with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.\nHis findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.\nFor other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.\nWhich leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)\nSurely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us."

        "fulltext": "There\u2019s a little parlor game that people in Silicon Valley like to play. Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?\nThere are currently four undisputed rulers of the consumer technology industry:Amazon,Apple,FacebookandGoogle, nowa unit of a parent company called Alphabet. And there\u2019s one more,Microsoft, whose influence once looked on the wane, but which is now rebounding.\nSo which of these five is losing? A year ago, it wasGoogle that looked to be in a tough spotas its ad business appeared more vulnerable to Facebook\u2019s rise. Now, Google is looking up, and it\u2019s Apple,hit by rising worries about a slowdown in iPhone sales, that may be headed for some pain. Over the next couple of weeks, as these companies issue earnings that show how they finished 2015, the state of play may shift once more.\nBut don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.\nWho\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.\nTech people like to picture their industry as a roiling sea of disruption, in which every winner is vulnerable to surprise attack from some novel, as-yet-unimagined foe. \u201cSomeone, somewhere in a garage is gunning for us,\u201d Eric Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman,is fond of saying.\nBut for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.\nIt\u2019s not just because I\u2019m aTarantino fan. By just about every measure worth collecting, these five American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.\nThough competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.\n\u201cThe Big Five came along at a perfect time to roll up the user base,\u201d said Geoffrey G. Parker, a business professor at Tulane University and the co-author of \u201cPlatform Revolution,\u201d a forthcoming book that explains some of the reasons these businesses may continue their dominance. \u201cThese five rode that perfect wave of technological change \u2014 an incredible decrease in the cost of I.T., much more network connectivity and the rise of mobile phones. Those three things came together, and there they were, perfectly poised to grow and take advantage of the change.\u201d\nMr. Parker notes the Big Five\u2019s power does not necessarily prevent newer tech companies from becoming huge. Uber might upend the transportation industry, Airbnb could rule hospitality and, as I argued last week,Netflix is bent on consuming the entertainment business. But if such new giants do come along, they\u2019re likely to stand alongside today\u2019s Big Five, not replace them.\nIndeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.\nConsider thatNetflixhosts its movies on Amazon\u2019s cloud, and Google\u2019s venture capital arm has a huge investment in Uber. Or consider all the in-app payments that Apple and Google get from their app stores, and all the marketing dollars that Google and Facebook reap from start-ups looking to get you to download their stuff.\nThis gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.\nThese platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.\nThe Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.\nAmazon has a shopping and shipping infrastructure that isbecoming central toretailing, while Facebook keeps amassing greater power in that most fundamental of platforms: human social relationships.\nMany of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.\nTheir platforms also give each of the five an enormous advantage when pursuing new markets. Look how Apple\u2019s late-to-market subscription streaming music servicemanaged to attract 10 million subscribersin its first six months of operation, or how Facebook leveraged the popularity of its main app to push users to download its stand-alone Messenger app.\nThen there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\n\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\nThis explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.\nAnd a skeptic might come up with significant threats to the five giants. One possibility might be growing competition from abroad, especially Chinese hardware and software companies that are amassing equally important platforms. Then there\u2019s the threat of regulation or other forms of government intervention. European regulators arealready pursuing several of the Frightful Fiveon antitrust and privacy grounds.\nEven with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.\nGovernment intervention often limits one giant in favor of another: If the European Commission decides to fight Android on antitrust grounds, Apple and Microsoft could be the beneficiaries. Whenthe Justice Department charged Applewith orchestrating a conspiracy to raise e-book prices, who won? Amazon.\nSo get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.\nSo who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon."
