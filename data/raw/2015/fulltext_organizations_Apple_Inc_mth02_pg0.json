        "fulltext": "Apple sold more iPhones last year than anyone could have imagined. But the company found that a lower percentage of factories assembling its products complied with a policy preventing excessive work hours.\nThe company\u2019s policy limits factory workers to a 60-hour workweek. Apple said it had found that 92 percent of the more than 1.1 million workers in its supply chain worked no more than 60 hours a week last year,\n                                        compared with 95 percent in 2013.\nApple sold an enormous number of iPhones last year \u2014 last quarter alone, it sold 74.5 million smartphones \u2014 so it is not surprising that factories pushed more of their workers over the limits.\nThings also do not appear as grim as they did six years ago, when Apple said that41 percentof audited factories were compliant with the 60-hour maximum workweek in 2008.\nApple declined to comment on the decrease in compliance with its 60-hour maximum workweek. Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s head of operations, argued in aletter published onlinethat every violation discovered by the company could lead to improvements.\n\u201cPeople sometimes point to the discovery of problems as evidence that our process isn\u2019t working. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote.\nOn the same day that Apple published the audit results, China Labor Watch, a workers\u2019 rights group based in New York, publisheda reporton conditions at some factories that make Apple products. It noted that pay stubs for workers at Pegatron, a supplier that works on iPhones and iPads, revealed that they worked an average of 60 hours or more a week,\n                                        and 52 percent of workers worked 90 hours of overtime each month. However, its sample size was small \u2014 the audit was an inspection of 96 pay stubs of Pegatron workers last month.\nApple said it had made significant progress eliminating the use of conflict minerals, a term used to describe minerals that come from areas engaged in warfare.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s New Job: Selling a Smartwatch to an Uninterested Public",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For Apple, the hard part \u2014 making a smartwatch \u2014 is nearly over.\nSoon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipatedApple Watchto consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies.\nThe first batch of smartwatches from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the Google Glass eyewear that got mainstream attention \u2014 if not sales \u2014 were greeted with considerable skepticism.\nBut Apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didn\u2019t care about computer tablets before Apple released the iPad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iPhone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism.\nThe Apple Watch, which Apple introduced last September and is expected to be in stores in April, is a miniature computer worn around the wrist, with a touch screen and a crown for navigating the device. There are three different models sold at different prices and the bands are interchangeable.\nApple has marketed it as a device that can appeal to a range of customers like fitness buffs and luxury watch collectors. But it has limited its functions, making it more like a watch, more easily relatable than a tech doodad that happens to look like a watch, said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies.\n\u201cThis is a brand-new category. Most people have no frame of reference with a smartwatch,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin.\nIn late February, Apple sent out invitations to the media for an event to remind people about the best features of the watch and share some new details about the product, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is expected to be the host.\nApple is expected to say more about price. The starting price for a basic Apple Watch is $350. Apple has not yet said how much people will have to pay for higher-end models, like the Apple Watch Edition, which is made of 18-karat gold, though watch enthusiasts estimate that it will cost upward of $10,000.\nThe watch requires a connection to an iPhone to fully operate.\nInside Apple, members of the team that worked on the watch product, code-named Gizmo, say it was a difficult engineering challenge. Three employees briefed on the project agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity.\nIn an effort to maintain secrecy, engineers testing the watch outside the office even created fake casing that made the Apple device resemble a Samsung watch, one person said.\nThe people who created the watch have been described by Apple employees as an \u201call-star team.\u201d Apple\u2019s top designers and engineers who worked on its iPhone, iPad and Macs are all part of it, several Apple employees said. Top executives include Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s head of design; Jeff Williams, the head of operations; and Kevin Lynch, a former Adobe executive, who leads the watch\u2019s software development.\nEmployees said it was challenging to cram powerful chips and sensors onto the watch\u2019s circuit board, which is as tiny as a postage stamp.\nNearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.\nApple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. It also has a chip that helps it make wireless payments.\nBattery life was also a concern on a device so small, and engineers mulled over how the watch\u2019s power should be replenished. The company in the past experimented with multiple methods to recharge the watch, including solar charging. Eventually it settled on induction, a method in which an electrical current creates a magnetic field, which creates voltage that powers the watch.\nApple has said the watch battery is estimated to last a full day, requiring a user to charge it at night, similar to a smartphone. The company also developed a yet-to-be-announced feature called Power Reserve, a mode that will run the watch on low energy but display only the time, according to one employee.\nApple will release the watch a bit later than it had hoped because of technology challenges. It probably didn\u2019t help that several important employees jumped ship. Nest Labs, the smart appliance maker that was acquired by Google last year, poached a few engineers who were the very best on the watch team, according to two people. Among them was Bryan James, Apple\u2019s former director of iPod software, who became a vice president for engineering at Nest in early 2014, these people said.\nStill, when Apple releases its watch in April, it will enter a market already flooded with smartwatches running Android Wear, a version of Google\u2019s Android software system tailored for wearable computers.\nThe results so far for Android smartwatches have been disappointing. About 720,000 smartwatches with Android Wear were shipped in 2014, according to Canalys, the research firm.\nDaniel Matte, an analyst for Canalys, said based on those numbers, it would be premature to call smartwatches a flop. He also predicts Apple\u2019s watch will become the top-selling smartwatch next year.\nBut it is unlikely to be a game-changer for Apple, at least anytime soon. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein research, thinks the watch will make only a modest contribution to Apple\u2019s bottom line this year. He predicts that Apple will ship 7.5 million watches in the second half of Apple\u2019s fiscal year.\nThat is peanuts compared with the tens of millions of iPhones that fly off the shelves every quarter.\nCompanies that make watch apps will probably play an important role in defining the purpose of the Apple Watch, similar to the app developers for the iPhone and the iPad.\nTero Kuittinen, a director for Frank N. Magid Associates who does consulting for app developers, said he had talked to about 20 app developers about the Apple Watch. Most of them, he said, were \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d But they worry that apps for watches won\u2019t be as lucrative as apps for phones because the tiny screen can limit features or \u2014 even worse \u2014 ads.\nDavid Barnard, an independent app developer, said he was expanding one of his iPhone apps to work with the Apple Watch. The app, called Launch Center Pro, can be customized to initiate different actions like setting the temperature of an Internet-connected thermostat or unlocking a door.\nHe said he was both \u201cbullish\u201d on the long-term potential of the smartwatch and \u201cskeptical\u201d about what exactly people would do with it.\n\u201cI really wonder exactly how I\u2019m going to use it and how often I\u2019m going to use it,\u201d Mr. Barnard said."

        "title": "Samsung Buys LoopPay, a Competitor to Apple\u2019s Mobile Wallet",
        "fulltext": "Samsung, the South Korean technology giant, announced Wednesday it had acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments company, signaling its interest in controlling smartphone-based purchases.\nThe move comes just months after therelease of Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments product, which\n                                        allows consumers to buy things with little more than a wave of a smartphone.\nThough it has been available for only a handful of months, Apple Pay has gained significant traction with retailers and consumers. Whole Foods, the high-end grocery store, said it hadprocessed thousandsof Apple Pay transactions. Apple has also persuaded dozens of credit card issuers tosign up to support Apple Pay.\nLoopPay, however, believes its reach will extend far beyond that of Apple Pay. LoopPay\u2019s underlying technology relies on a magnetic transmission sent from a user\u2019s phone to a merchant\u2019s payment\n                                        terminal, mimicking a credit card swipe. The technology, according to LoopPay, can be accepted in more than 90 percent of existing point-of-sale terminals. It is unclear if LoopPay will work on chip-and-pin terminals,\n                                        which use a more secure form of credit card technology and are being widely phased in this year.\nApple Pay relies on near-field communication technology, which Apple says is available at approximately 220,000 American locations.\n\u201cWe are excited to take our relationship with LoopPay to the next level, by bringing consumers a mobile wallet solution that is not just safe and reliable, but also widely accepted at more locations than any\n                                        competing service,\u201d David Eun, executive vice president of Samsung\u2019s Global Innovation Center, said in a statement.\nLoopPay will work across many Android smartphones, of which Samsung is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers. That is in contrast to Apple Pay, which works only on iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones, and will\n                                        soon work on the coming Apple Watch.\nBoth companies are fiercely vying to capture a slice of the United States mobile proximity payments market, which eMarketer estimated at $3.5 billion in 2014. Analysts expect that figure will rise to $36.2 billion by\n                                        the end of 2016.\nTerms of the Samsung-LoopPay deal were not disclosed.\nA version of this article appears in print on 02/19/2015, on pageB2of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Samsung Acquires LoopPay, a Mobile Payments Company."

        "title": "New Data Shows Apple\u2019s Explosive Growth in China",
        "fulltext": "WhenApple reported a record-shattering profitof $18 billion last month, the company said its growth\n                                        came largely from sales in greater China. This week, some research firms gave a clearer picture of just how big Apple has become in China.\nBoth Kantar Worldpanel and Canalys, firms that track global smartphone sales, said Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system gained market share in China at the expense of Google\u2019s Android.\nChris Jones, an analyst for Canalys, said that in the fourth quarter of last year, iOS was in 12.3 percent of the smartphones sold in China, a sharp increase from 5 percent in the previous quarter. Android was in 86.3\n                                        percent of smartphones in the fourth quarter, compared with 93.7 percent in the third quarter, according to Mr. Jones.\nCanalys estimates that Apple is now the top smartphone vendor in China. But Mr. Jones said Canalys would explain how it reached this conclusion only to clients, not with the news media or competitors.\nKantar Worldpanel found slightly different results. It focused its research on so-called urban China \u2014 a portion of mainland China where smartphones are more commonplace. Kantar also found that Apple\u2019s\n                                        iOS gained at the expense of Android. But the firm found that Apple was the No. 2 vendor in the region, with about 21.5 percent of the market, behind the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi (29.2 percent) and ahead\n                                        of Huawei and Samsung (about 12 percent each).\nWhether Apple is No. 1 or No. 2, its growth in China has been remarkable. Just last October, the company was the No. 6 smartphone maker in China, behind Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Xiaomi and Yulong, according to Canalys.\nKantar Worldpanel also noted that about a quarter of the Chinese consumers who bought iPhones in the last three months were buying smartphones for the first time.\nCarolina Milanesi, a Kantar analyst, said Apple\u2019s introduction of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which both have larger screens than previous iPhones, clearly drove the growth.\n\u201cThe success that Apple is seeing is certainly coming from the larger screen,\u201d she said. She added that sales there of the larger iPhone 6 Plus surpassed sales of the iPhone 6 in December.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said recently that it was only a matter of time until the majority of the company\u2019s sales would come from China. The company plans to open 25 retail stores in\n                                        greater China over the next two years, adding to the 15 stores it now operates in the area.\nA version of this article appears in print on 02/09/2015, on pageB6of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Apple Growth in China."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.What\u2019s the difference between the Amazon Fire TV and the Fire TV Stick \u2014 besides the size and about $60?\nA.Amazon\u2019s two main pieces of hardware for streaming video to your connected television set have a lot of similarities \u2014 and some differences. As for what is the same, both devices have eight gigabytes of storage. All your music, Prime Music, Amazon Instant Video and Prime Instant Video purchases work on the Fire TV box and Fire TV Stick. Each also comes with a remote control and can connect to the Internet over a wireless connection. (The Fire TV\u2019s remote also includes a voice-search feature, but the same remote must be purchased separately for the Fire TV Stick.)\nThe Amazon Fire TV box, however, has a bit more under the hood than its Stick sibling. The Fire TV is a set-top box with twice as much memory installed as the Stick and can connect to your home network through a wired Ethernet connection as well. Both devices have Dolby Digital Plus, but the Fire TV can output audio in 5.1 surround sound.\nThe cheaper and smaller Fire TV Stick may not work with as many apps and games as the Fire TV does. And for those in need of parental controls, Amazon\u2019sFreeTimeandFreeTime Unlimitedtools for managing content for children are available only on the Fire TV box.\nTransferring a Boarding Pass Between iPhones\nQ.Is there an easy way to get a mobile boarding pass from one iPhone to another from my airline\u2019s app?\nA.If you have downloaded boarding passes for two people with your airline\u2019s own app and want to send the appropriate pass to your travel companion, you should be able to transfer it in a couple of ways.\nIf your airline\u2019s app does not offer an option to send the boarding pass directly by email or message, you can probably share it through Apple\u2019sPassbookwallet \u2014 as long as the airline app allows you to add the boarding pass to Passbook. (Most apps from major airlines do; open the boarding pass in the app and look for an Add to Passbook button in the top corner.)\nOnce you have added the boarding passes to Passbook, select the boarding pass with your fellow traveler\u2019s name on it and tap the Share icon in the bottom-left corner. You should see the icons to send the pass by Mail or Message on screen. If you choose one of these, the other person should get an Add to Passbook option after opening the message with the boarding pass attached.\nIf both iPhones are running at least iOS 7 (and are at least iPhone 5 models), you should also be able to use Apple\u2019sAirDropfeature to beam the boarding pass between phones. You can turn on AirDrop by swiping up from the bottom of the screen to open theControl Center; tap AirDrop to turn the feature on if it is not active already. When you tap the Share icon on the boarding pass, select AirDrop and choose the icon for the other phone. Once you do, the file is sent over \u2014 where it can then be added to that phone\u2019s Passbook wallet."

        "fulltext": "Q.If I archive a Gmail message in my browser, what does that do and where does the message go?\nA.Unless you are downloading and moving the mail elsewhere with a third-party mail app, messages stay in your Gmail inbox on the web until you decide to do something with them. If you like a tidy inbox, you canarchive messages.\nArchiving a message moves it out of your inbox but still keeps it in your account. You can find the message again by searching or looking in the All Mail view listed on the left side of the Gmail window. If you do not see All Mail listed, click the triangle under the More menu there.\nYou can archive a message when you have it open on screen by clicking the Archive button at the top of the Gmail window; the button looks like a folder with an arrow on it. If you do not have a single message open, you can archive multiple missives in the inbox by turning on the checkbox next to each message listed and clicking the Archive button.\nWhen a Laptop Battery Wanes\nQ.My laptop battery is nonremovable \u2014 and it is not holding a charge for very long anymore. What are my options if I don\u2019t want to stay plugged into a power outlet all the time?\nA.Many ultrabooks and smaller laptops now seal the battery inside the case to keep the computer as lightweight as possible, but this does make it harder to replace the power cell when it begins to fade. Unless you are in do-it-yourself mode and have found a reliable upgrade guide for your model, check with your laptop\u2019s manufacturer about available repair services. Most should offer battery replacement by mail or through an authorized service provider.\nAn external battery may be another solution.Lenmarmakes a few models for laptops, and there are other portable power packs around, like theEnergizer XP8000Aand theBatteryBox.\nTIP OF THE WEEKIf you do not want to keep a credit card on file to buy apps for your phone or tablet, you can purchase gift cards from major retailers for theGoogle Play store,Microsoft\u2019s Windows and Xbox StoreandApple\u2019s App Store. You can then redeem the cards for credit in the online store.\nConverting a gift card to online cash typically requires entering the code from the back of the card on the Redeem page for your selected app store, but if you have iOS 7 or later on your Apple device, you do not even have to type the 16-digit code.\nJust remove the label covering the card\u2019s number on the back and then open the iTunes Store or App Store icon from the Home screen. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap the Redeem button. After you sign into your Apple ID account, tapthe Use Camera optionon the Redeem page. Hold the camera so it can focus on the code inside the black box on the card\u2019s back. When the camera successfully captures the code, your store balance updates on the screen.\nYou can also capture gift card codes on a Mac desktop or laptop with a FaceTime camera, iTunes 11 or later, or OS X 10.8 or later. When you have removed the label covering the code on the back of the gift card, open iTunes (or the App Store) on the Mac and in the Quick Links area, click Redeem. Log into your account and click the Use Camera button. Hold the card up so the Mac\u2019s FaceTime camera can capture the code, and click Done after you see that your account balance has been updated."

        "fulltext": "Securing\nA Hotmail Account\nQ.I\u2019m trying to set up the extra verification to protect my Hotmail account from getting hacked, but it says I need an identity verification app. How does this work?\nA.Microsoft, likeGoogle,Appleand other companies that offer password-based accounts, offerstwo-step verificationwhen you log in. The first step is your regular password, and the second step is typically a four- or six-digit security code sent immediately by the site or service to your mobile phone or a separate email address.\nOnce you enter the code and your credentials are verified, your login succeeds. This security setup assumes that even if someone has obtained your password, he or she will not have your phone or second email address and the unique security code to complete the login process.\nIf you supply a mobile phone number in your account settings, the security code can be sent as a text message. If you do not add your phone number, you can use an authenticator app that works directly on the phone to generate a code.\nSeveral authenticator apps work with Hotmail andOutlook.com, andMicrosoft has recommendationsfor each based on the type of phone you use. For Windows Phone models, you can download Microsoft\u2019s own freeAuthenticator appfrom the Windows Phone Store. If you have an Android phone, look for theMicrosoft Accountapp in the Google Play store. For iPhones and other iOS devices, you can use theGoogle Authenticatorapp in the Apple App Store. Other authenticator apps designed for your phone platform may work as well.\nPreserving\nAn iPod Classic\nQ.I still love my now discontinued iPod Classic, but how long can I expect the rechargeable battery to last?\nA.Apple has a help page on its sitestatingthat the \u201cbattery is designed to retain up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 400 complete charge cycles.\u201d One charge cycle is completed when you use 100 percent of yourlithium-ion battery\u2019scapacity, but this does not have to be all at once. If you use half the battery\u2019s power one day, charge it fully overnight and then use half the power again the next day, you have completed one charge cycle.\nSo you could get 18 months of good battery life if you are a heavy user, or several years if you use the iPod less frequently. But even when the battery starts to conk out, you can get it replaced. Apple\u2019siPod battery replacement servicefor the Classic is now limited mostly to California residents, but you can find independent companies likeiResQor evendo-it-yourself kitsonline.\nTIP OF THE WEEKLock-screen notifications are alerts about new mail, messages and other urgent bits of data that appear on your phone\u2019s display without your having to unlock it with a password. While the notifications are a great way to keep informed, you may want to control which apps are allowed to pester you in front of other people.\nFor devices running Google\u2019sAndroid 5.0 Lollipop, open the Settings icon and in the Device area, tap Sound & Notification. On the next screen, tap App Notifications to get a list of apps, then tap each app to adjust its notification abilities.\nIn Apple\u2019siOS 8 softwarefor iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and select Notifications on the next screen. In the list of apps that can provide alerts, select an app to adjust its allowed behavior \u2014 like appearing on the device\u2019s lock screen or in the Notifications Center.\nInWindows Phone 8.1, open the Settings and select Notifications + Actions. Select an app from the list to block it from your lock screen or to make other changes for how it gets your attention.J. D. BIERSDORFER"

        "fulltext": "\nQ.I recently scanned a bunch of old pictures and have them in a folder. How do I get them into iPhoto?\nA.You can import a batch of pictures into the Mac\u2019siPhotolibrary from a folder on the hard disk (or other locations) inseveral ways. For one, open iPhoto, go to the File menu and choose Import to Library. When the Import Photos box opens, navigate to the location of the folder, select it and click the Import button.\nFor a more direct approach, you can also add the scanned pictures to your image library by dragging the folder from the desktop (or wherever you have it) into the open iPhoto window. Dragging the folder and dropping it on the iPhoto icon on the Mac\u2019s Dock is another method for importing the pictures.\nAccording to statements Apple madeto several technology publications, iPhoto will be replaced this year with a new Photos for OS X program. Thecompany has saidthat iPhoto users can update their image libraries to the new Photos program and preserve the existing albums, keywords and captions used to organize pictures in iPhoto.\nSurfing Securely on a Smartphone\nQ.I get nervous when using public Wi-Fi hot spots on my phone. What\u2019s involved with using a virtual private network on a mobile device?\nA.Most major smartphone platforms, includingAndroid,iOSandWindows Phone, support virtual private network connections that create an encrypted tunnel between your device and a private network when you are using a public hot spot or other open network. If you are doing work on your phone while traveling, your company may have its own V.P.N. that you can use on the road. If so, check with the technical support department to see if it can set you up.\nIf you do not have a corporate V.P.N., you can use one of the many commercial V.P.N. services available; check your app store for options.TunnelBearandHotSpot Shieldare two popular services with Android and iOS apps, as isF-Secure\u2019s Freedome app.\nYou typically need to download the app, let it configure the proper V.P.N. settings on your phone and turn it on when you need it. Some services charge a monthly or annual fee for use, while some offer a free amount of data along with advertisements.\nTIP OF THE WEEKRunning out of battery juice is a nagging fear of many a smartphone user, but your gadget may have built-in tools to help you squeeze out some extra time. Google recently added a new Battery Saver mode inAndroid 5.0Lollipop that claims to add an additional 90 minutes of life between charges by temporarily putting a stop to mail and message syncing, vibrating alerts and other power-draining activities.\nTo use it, open the Settings icon from the apps screen, select Battery and then tap the three-dot icon in the upper-right corner to get to Battery Saver in the menu; swiping down on the home screen to summon the Quick Settings box also gets you to the Battery preferences. In the settings, you can turn Battery Saver on or off manually, or have it automatically kick in when the battery is down to 5 or 15 percent of its power.\nSeveral Android phones fromHTC,SamsungandLGinclude a power-saving mode in their settings. Microsoft has a similarBattery Saverfeature in the settings for its Windows Phone software.

        "fulltext": "When you\u2019re as rich as Apple and life gives you lemons, you make data centers.\nOn Monday, the State of Arizona announced that Apple would invest $2 billion in the creation of a data center at a facility in Mesa after its original plans to produce sapphire, a material tougher than glass, there\n                                        were abandoned.\nApple had contracted GT Advanced Technologies, a sapphire producer, to make sapphire screens for iPhones, among other things. But to Apple\u2019s surprise, GTAT declared bankruptcy last October after failing to meet\n                                        some of Apple\u2019s demands. As a result, Apple released its latest iPhones without sapphire.\nWhile Apple may have abandoned sapphire production at the Arizona facility, the company has not given up on the facility itself, which measures 1.3 million square feet. Apple on Monday said that the multibillion-dollar\n                                        investment in the data center was one of its most significant investments ever, creating 600 engineering and construction jobs. The center will be partly used as a central command center for monitoring Apple\u2019s\n                                        other data centers around the world, the company said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to continue investing in the U.S. with a new data center in Arizona, which will serve as a command center for our global networks,\u201d said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. She said\n                                        the facility would be powered entirely by renewable energy, much of which will come from a solar farm.\nGov. Doug Ducey of Arizona said that Apple\u2019s decision to create the data center in Mesa was \u201ca huge win for Arizona and a high testament to our business-friendly climate and talented work force.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Loses Patent Case to Small Texas Company",
        "fulltext": "A federal jury decided this week that Apple should pay $532.9 million in damages for violating patents held by Smartflash, a business based in Texas.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Smartflash before, you wouldn\u2019t be alone. The company does not make any products and its sole business is licensing seven patents. Smartflash filed its original complaint against\n                                        Apple in 2013 in the Eastern District of Texas.\nIn the trial, which was held in a courthouse in Tyler, down the street from Smartflash\u2019s office, the patent holder accused Apple of violating three patents covering digital copyright management, payment systems\n                                        and data storage.\nThe jury said on Tuesday that Apple had violated all three patents. It also said that Apple failed to demonstrate that the patents were invalid.\nApple said it planned to appeal the decision. It said the case was an example of why Congress needed to embrace reform of the patent system.\n\u201cSmartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no U.S. presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,\u201d said Kristin Huguet, an Apple\n                                        spokeswoman. \u201cWe refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.\u201d\nSmartflash\u2019s lead lawyer, Johnny Ward, said the company was satisfied with the verdict.\n\u201cSmartflash is very pleased with the jury\u2019s verdict in this case, confirming that Apple devices designed to use the Apple iTunes Store and App Store infringe Smartflash\u2019s patents,\u201d Mr. Ward\n                                        said in a statement. \u201cUltimately, the jury saw through Apple\u2019s arguments and reached the right result.\u201d\nThe outcome was a surprising turn for Apple, which has mostly won its patent fights in the United States. Most notably, the company in 2012 won a decisive victory in itshigh-profile patent lawsuitagainst Samsung Electronics, after a jury unanimously decided that Samsung had violated a series of Apple\u2019s mobile patents. A separate jury in a damages\n                                        trial later determined that Samsungowed Apple $930 millionfor infringing the\n                                        patents.\nSmartflash is expected to pursue similar litigation against Samsung and Google. Both cases are set to go to trial. Smartflash also sued Amazon late last year."
