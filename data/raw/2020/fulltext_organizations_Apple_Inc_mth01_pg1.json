        "title": "A Common Charger for All Phones? The E.U. Is on the Case",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 The European Union wants to make it easier to charge your cellphone and other devices.\nThis week, members of the European Parliament held a hearing on a measure to require smartphone makers to produce a common charger for all mobile and portable devices sold in the region, including tablets, e-readers and digital cameras.\nThe goal: no more frustration at borrowing a friend\u2019s charger only to find it has a Lightning connector when you need a USB-C.\nThe proposal has been promoted not only as a matter of convenience, but also as a way to reduce electronic waste. Chargers have been estimated to produce more than51,000 metric tonsof waste annually in the European Union.\n\u201cWe are drowning in an ocean of electronic waste,\u201d said Roza Thun, a member of the European Parliament from Poland. \u201cDemand grows and with it waste and exploitation of natural resources.\u201d\nOfficials also say that a common kind of charger would reduce consumers\u2019 cost because devices could be sold without a dedicated charger.\nThis is not the first time the European Union has tackled this topic. This week\u2019s effort was the third attempt to untangle charging devices in more than a decade.\nIn 2009, when there were more than 30 different chargers on the market, the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, reached a voluntary agreement with industry giants likeApple, Samsung and Nokiato introduce a smartphone charger that fit all models.\nBut the agreement expired in 2014, and the device makers went their separate ways.\nLawmakers then introduceda similar effortto re-establish a voluntary standard for a single charging port for all smartphones. But that initiative was never adopted, in part because it failed to guarantee interoperability between devices such as speakers and keyboards with smartphones.\nThere are now three major types of charging plugs, according to theEuropean Consumer Organization, which backs the effort to standardize chargers: USB 2.0 Micro B, USB-C and Apple\u2019s Lightning.\nApple previously objectedto the European Union\u2019s proposal. A year ago, the company argued that a single standard would \u201cfreeze innovation rather than encourage it.\u201d A new charger standard would make current chargers obsolete, it added, which is \u201cbad for the environment and unnecessarily disruptive for customers.\u201d\nAt the hearing on Monday, members of the European Parliament lamented the failure to legislate a universal charger, raising environmental concerns and blaming industry for thwarting measures.\nOthers pointed to the potential cost benefits of a common charger standard.\n\u201cThis would allow consumers to get a better deal and to cut waste at the same time,\u201d said Dita Charanzova of the Czech Republic.\nThe European Commission is scheduled to publish a study in the coming weeks to deliberate the next legislative steps.\nBut device makers may eventually decide the issue before the legislators do. Each year, an increasing number of phones arrive on the market with another option:wireless charging."

        "title": "The Week in Business: Hot Topic at Davos",
        "fulltext": "In a week dominated by impeachment headlines, big money kept moving. The stock market hummed along, Googlehit the $1 trillion valuation markand banksreported fat quarterly earnings. Next, the who\u2019s who of global politics and finance will fly to the snow-capped ski town of Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. To catch up and prep for the week ahead, read on.\nThe stock market didn\u2019t react much to President Trump\u2019s signing ofthe Phase 1 trade dealwith China on Wednesday, in part because it may not change a whole lot. Sure, the agreement marks a welcome break in the two-year trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, and lifts some (though not all) of the tariffs Mr. Trump had imposed on Chinese goods. But it\u2019s mostly a preamble toharder negotiations down the lineand vague on how many of its key points \u2014 like China\u2019s promise to spend some $200 billion on American products andcrack down on intellectual property theft from American corporations\u2014 will be implemented and enforced.\nA new report found that popular online dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder aresharing their users\u2019 personal informationwith advertising and marketing companies. Which shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise to anyone familiar with how the internet works, right? But some of the data these sites peddled isreallypersonal, including users\u2019 sexual orientation, drug use habits, dating preferences and precise locations \u2014 and that could violate privacy laws. Grindr is already defending its practices by claiming that users \u201care directing us to disclose\u201d the information provided. (Just a wild guess, but those users probably wanted their profiles shared with potential dates, not online databanks.)\nTens of thousands of Americansgot a big tax break this week\u2014 on student loans that they shouldn\u2019t have to pay to begin with. Every year, students get scammed into borrowing money to pay tuition at fraudulent for-profit schools that mischaracterize their academic offerings, close abruptly or issue worthless credits. Victims of these schools are entitled to have those loans forgiven, but until this past Wednesday, they still had to pay taxes on them while the paperwork was processed. (Which could take over a year, especially under the current administration, which has been slow to review such cases.) Now the Internal Revenue Service will waive these taxes and issue credits for those who paid them dating back to 2016.\nApple is gearing up for a legal fight with the Justice Department todefend the privacy of its customers\u2019 iPhones\u2014 or more specifically, two phones used by the gunman behind a deadly shooting last month at anaval base in Florida. Federal authorities are demanding that Apple unlock the man\u2019s phones for the sake of public safety. But the tech giant says it is committed to protecting its users\u2019 information, stating that Americans \u201cdo not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations.\u201d The conflict puts Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, in a tricky spot if he wants to stay in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces. Their alliance has kept Apple relatively unscathed by trade tensions with China \u2014 so far.\nBlackRock, the giant money management corporation that oversees nearly $7 trillion in investments,announced that it \u201cwill make investment decisions with environmental sustainability as a core goal\u201dmoving forward. Which is a little rich, considering it\u2019s also a major investor in fossil fuel companies like Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil firm. But BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, Larry Fink, said that pressuring companies to be greener could still have a major effect on the market, and hopes other money managers will follow suit. He also said that the decision wasn\u2019t a political one, but rather a response to investor demand.\nLarry Fink will also give a talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Following the release ofnew datashowing that 2019 was the second-hottest year in recorded history, the global warming crisiswill be one of the summit\u2019s central topics. Which could lead to quite the standoff, especially as Mr. Trump \u2014 who has openly scorned climate change science \u2014 is among the attendees, along with the 17-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg. Also on the speaking docket: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, whichpledged this past Thursdayto erase its carbon footprint and invest $1 billion in carbon removal technology.\nThe Senatepassed Mr. Trump\u2019s United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement, more widely known as \u201cthe new NAFTA,\u201d by a huge margin, delivering a victory to the president just in time for his impeachment trial to begin. In other news,a new study foundthat rich people don\u2019t just live longer \u2014 they also get eight to nine more healthy years, on average, than poor people do. And finally, the 1,758-carat Sewelo diamond, the second-largest in history,was purchased this weekby Louis Vuitton for an undisclosed sum in \u201cthe millions.\u201d\nWas this newsletter forwarded to you?Sign up here."

        "title": "Pressured by Simmons Over Expos\u00e9, Oprah Winfrey Faced a Big Decision",
        "fulltext": "For months, the filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering had a pair of dream partners: Oprah Winfrey and Apple, who had committed to back their documentary about women who have accused the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons of sexual misconduct. Booked for the Sundance Film Festival and Apple\u2019s new streaming platform, the film was primed to be the next high-profile media moment of the #MeToo era.\nThen the film\u2019s future was abruptly cast into doubt last week afterMs. Winfrey withdrew as executive producerand pulled it from Apple, citing creative differences with the directors and suggesting that the picture was being rushed to Sundance \u201cbefore I believe it is complete.\u201d\nBut what preceded Ms. Winfrey\u2019s announcement was more than just a dispute over filmmaking. It involved an intense campaign by Mr. Simmons and his supporters to get Ms. Winfrey to pull the plug. That campaign also targeted some of the women in the film on social media and, in at least one case, through direct contact with a family member, in what the women viewed as attempts to threaten and intimidate them ahead of the film\u2019s premiere at Sundance, still scheduled for Jan. 25.\nMs. Winfrey acknowledged to The New York Times that Mr. Simmons had tried to get her to abandon the project. \u201cHe did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said.\nShe said he told her that the woman at the center of the film, Drew Dixon, was lying about their interactions. In addition, Ms. Winfrey said, she received phone calls from other people, whom she would not identify, who also questioned Ms. Dixon\u2019s credibility.\nMs. Winfrey said that she still believed Ms. Dixon, though she also thought there were inconsistencies in her account that the film had not adequately addressed, in addition to other issues she had with the film. (The filmmakers say they have voluminous research files corroborating all the women\u2019s accounts.)\nMs. Winfrey said it was those reasons, and not Mr. Simmons\u2019s protestations, that led her to pull support.\n\u201cI told him directly in a phone call that I will not be pressured either into, or out of, backing this film,\u201d she said. \u201cI am only going to do what I believe to be the right thing.\u201d\nBut it was clear that Ms. Winfrey, according to people involved in internal conversations around the film, was struggling over what to do, especially since she had appeared supportive of the movie before Mr. Simmons began pushing back against it. She was aware of the message she might send by backing out, given her reputation as a role model for African-American women and as one of America\u2019s most trusted voices of moral authority. Ms. Winfrey has spoken openly over the years of being a sexual abuse survivor herself.\nHer enormous following had made her appealing to Apple as it competed with other streaming services in attracting big names to deliver original content; Netflix had already enlisted the new production company started by Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as a series of accomplished producers. The film about Mr. Simmons\u2019s accusers, titled \u201cOn the Record,\u201d was to be Ms. Winfrey\u2019s debut project with Apple.\nWhen Ms. Winfrey announced her departure from the project on Jan. 10, she took pains to say that she believed and supported the women in the film. Just hours after her announcement, the Time\u2019s Up campaign \u2014 of which Ms. Winfrey was an inaugural member \u2014 affirmed its own support of the women in a similarly worded statement.\nBut that has not prevented shock waves from reaching the circle of Mr. Simmons\u2019s accusers. Ms. Dixon,who has accused Mr. Simmons of raping herwhen she was a young executive at his record label, Def Jam, in 1995, said she felt abandoned.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m experiencing a second crime,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cI am being silenced. The broader community is being intimidated. The most powerful black woman in the world is being intimidated.\u201d\nThomasina Perkins-Washington, a representative for Mr. Simmons, said in a statement to The Times that Mr. Simmons did not do anything unjustified in trying to counter the film. Mr. Simmons has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex and has not been charged with a crime.\n\u201cIf defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation then there would be no justice,\u201d Ms. Perkins-Washington said. She added that \u201cwritten accounts and sworn testimony\u201d showed that Mr. Simmons was \u201cincapable\u201d of being violent toward women, but when asked for that material did not provide it.\nUntil Ms. Winfrey pulled out, the dispute over the film had pitted two titans of media and entertainment against each other. Mr. Simmons helped establish the big business of hip-hop, and branched out early into film and fashion. The two had a decades-long relationship, before a split when more than a dozen women began to come forward to accuse him of misconduct including rape and assault.\nTheir clash also highlighted the fissures among African-Americans over their place in the #MeToo movement. In the film, Ms. Dixon and other women say that when the floodgates opened after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein in 2017, they still were unsure whether American society at large would listen to the testimonies of black women.\nWhen documentaries aboutR. KellyandMichael Jacksonlast year led to re-examinations of the accusations against them \u2014 and, in Mr. Kelly\u2019s case, criminal charges \u2014 an angry debate roiled on Twitter about whether those men were being singled out for attention because of their race.\nOne result, according toDream Hampton, the activist and filmmaker behind \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d is that black women remain afraid to speak up.\n\u201cThis is a way of shutting down black women,\u201d Ms. Hampton said, \u201cthat the victimhood of black men in the criminal justice system supersedes all other harm.\u201d\nAs Ms. Dixon put it: \u201cThis is the ultimate double bind that black women face, where there is nowhere for us to go. There is no one to protect us. There is no one to help us. And our own community turns against us when you dare to speak out.\u201d\nMs. Winfrey said she also began to have concerns that the film needed to say more about the broader cultural context, in particular the \u201cdebauchery\u201d of the music business at the time. Women throughout the industry were contending with misogyny and worse.\nMs. Winfrey sent the documentary to a friend, the filmmaker Ava DuVernay, seeking advice. She asked Ms. DuVernay to watch it with an eye toward how well the two filmmakers, who are white, captured the nuances of hip-hop culture and the struggles of black women.\nMs. DuVernay, who directed \u201cSelma\u201d and the Netflix series \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d about the so-called Central Park Five who were wrongly imprisoned for rape, gave a harsh critique, which was later echoed in a letter Ms. Winfrey sent to the filmmakers informing them of her withdrawal.\nIn an interview, Ms. DuVernay said that Ms. Winfrey faced public fallout no matter what she did.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got Simmons on one side pressuring her, and then she\u2019s got a film on the other side that she doesn\u2019t agree with,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said. \u201cSo if she walks away from the film she seems like she\u2019s caving to Simmons, and if she stays with the film then she\u2019s putting her name on something that she feels doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark.\u201d\nThe filmmakers described Ms. Winfrey\u2019s change of heart as \u201csudden\u201d and say they \u201cwere completely caught off guard\u201d by her decision to exit the film.\n\u201cWe had a really great working relationship with Ms. Winfrey, Harpo, and Apple throughout the many stages of crafting the film,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe feel we more than delivered a finished film that is in keeping with the qualities of excellence, integrity and veracity that we hold dear.\u201d\nThe film\u2019s primary character is Ms. Dixon, whose account details a wrenching accusation of how Mr. Simmons violently raped her after luring Ms. Dixon \u2014 then a young executive at his label \u2014 into his apartment one night under the pretext of hearing a CD.\nMs. Dixon firsttold her story publicly to The Times in 2017, and the film, which tracks her over two years, recounts her struggle over whether to go on the record with the paper. Some scenes capture parts of her phone calls with Times reporters during that period.\nDan Cogan of Impact Partners, the financial backer of the Oscar-winning documentaries \u201cIcarus\u201d and \u201cThe Cove,\u201d introduced Ms. Winfrey to Mr. Dick and Ms. Ziering, whose work over the last decade has centered on sexual abuse, first in the military with \u201cThe Invisible War\u201d and then on college campuses with \u201cThe Hunting Ground.\u201d\nAccording to Mr. Cogan, a partnership was formed in February between Ms. Winfrey and the filmmakers to create a series of projects about sexual assault and harassment in the workplace. Ms. Dixon\u2019s story was set to be the inaugural piece that would lead into a series focused on different industries. All were eager for Ms. Winfrey\u2019s involvement, both because of her access to the new streaming service and her ability to infuse the films with her unique point of view. \u201cFor a very long time, she was an extraordinary partner,\u201d said Mr. Cogan.\nIn the filmmakers\u2019 retelling, the two teams worked closely on the production, sharing notes and viewing each cut of the film. In October, with Ms. Winfrey\u2019s approval, Apple submitted the movie for inclusion in the Sundance Film Festival, the country\u2019s premier exhibition for independent films.\nA month later executives at Harpo responded to the final cut of the film with an email that read in part: \u201cWe absolutely loved watching the latest cut \u2014 it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nAfter learning that the film had been accepted to Sundance, Apple and Harpo touted the collaboration in a joint news release on Dec. 3, and called the film \u201ca profound examination of race, gender, class and intersectionality, and the toll assaults take on their victims and society at large.\u201d\nTrouble began the next day, once Sundance officially announced its lineup. It was the first time any public mention of the film had made clear that Mr. Simmons was the accused person at the center of it.\nMs. Winfrey, while in South Africa, received a call from someone she said she knew and trusted who cast doubts on Ms. Dixon\u2019s story. Those doubts, Ms. Winfrey said, \u201cgave me pause.\u201d Later on, Ms. Winfrey said, Mr. Simmons called her directly.\nMs. Winfrey said that over various calls and text messages to her, Mr. Simmons seemed \u201cfrightened.\u201d She said she often did not respond.\nOnce, she said, he implored her, \u201cLook what you\u2019re doing to my daughters.\u201d\n\u201cI said, \u2018I take deep offense to you thinking I\u2019m doing anything to your daughters,\u2019\u201d Ms. Winfrey recalled.\nMs. Winfrey\u2019s team immediately asked the filmmakers to provide detailed timelines of the accusations against Mr. Simmons and what the filmmakers had done to corroborate the accounts. The filmmakers provided the information the next day.\nWithin days, Mr. Simmons took to Instagram to mount a public defense, and the rapper 50 Cent accused Ms. Winfrey of \u201conly going after her own\u201d \u2014 alleging that by supporting accusers of Mr. Simmons and Michael Jackson, she was turning her back on the black community.\nIn an online video, Mr. Simmons discussed how to challenge the credibility of women by asking \u201chow many times they went to jail, to a mental institution, have they accused five or more people, what does their father say.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cQuestions that were not asked before may now be asked, and our sister may be embarrassed.\u201d\nSil Lai Abrams, who accused Mr. Simmons of raping her in 1994, said she immediately felt that the \u201cmental institution\u201d line referred to her; the day after the alleged attack, she said, she attempted suicide. \u201cHe is using very dark tactics to intimidate and terrorize me and the others,\u201d Ms. Abrams, who also is featured in the film, said in an interview.\nMs. Dixon felt targeted by the line about fathers. A few weeks ago, she said, her father was approached by an old acquaintance, Yolanda Caraway, who asked him whether Ms. Dixon had ever falsely accused any man of sexual misconduct. The meeting rattled Ms. Dixon, who said she immediately suspected that Mr. Simmons was behind it.\n\u201cHe is trying to muzzle our voices again,\u201d she said.\nMs. Caraway, alongtime political operative in Washington, acknowledged that she had met with Ms. Dixon\u2019s father, Arrington Dixon, a former City Council member. She added: \u201cThe conversation I had with anybody is none of your business.\u201d Ms. Dixon\u2019s representative at the time, Ann Walker Marchant, said that she called Ms. Caraway to ask whether she was working for Mr. Simmons, and that Ms. Caraway responded: \u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d\nMs. Winfrey said she took her concerns to the filmmakers with an ultimatum.\n\u201cWe need to pull from Sundance until we can give ourselves a chance to retool this film,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said she told them, \u201cor I am going to have to take my name off.\u201d\nThe filmmakers reassured Ms. Winfrey that they could address the issues she raised, and she remained on board.\n\u201cWe know from working in the sexual assault field that changing any distribution plan after there has been an announcement is not a good idea,\u201d said Ms. Ziering. \u201cIf we were to say we are not going to Sundance, people will infer that there is an issue with the credibility of the women in the film.\u201d\nOn Dec. 18, the day after Ms. DuVernay viewed the film, Harpo sent the filmmakers a new set of requests.\nAccording to people familiar with the chain of events, the two filmmakers addressed Ms. Winfrey\u2019s concerns by conducting additional interviews with experts to contextualize the issue of misogyny in hip-hop. They also included a three-minute montage that introduced five more Simmons accusers with a technique that featured one woman\u2019s line bleeding into the next woman\u2019s story. The effect leaves viewers with a sense that Mr. Simmons is a serial predator who used specific, repetitive behaviors to lure women.\nThe new cut of the movie was delivered to Harpo on Jan. 8. Two days later, Ms. Winfrey sent the filmmakers a letter explaining her dissatisfaction and telling them she was withdrawing. The letter says in part: \u201cI think it is a disservice to the women and this film to have their gut-wrenching disclosures reduced to a montage of sound bites and not give them the stature of elevating their stories.\u201d\nThe film is still scheduled to show at Sundance, and the filmmakers have hired United Talent Agency to serve as its sales agents. It\u2019s unclear whether the high-profile fallout between Ms. Winfrey and the filmmakers will harm its commercial prospects or make it an intriguing purchase for an eager distributor.\nMs. Dixon said she still looked up to Ms. Winfrey \u201cas a business woman, as a fearless creative professional, and as a fellow survivor.\u201d\nBut, she added, \u201cOprah Winfrey shouldn\u2019t get to decide for any of the silence breakers in the film whether or not this movie is worth seeing and Oprah Winfrey shouldn\u2019t get to decide for the whole rest of the world.\u201d\n\u201cSo all I hope,\u201d she added, \u201cis that somebody else will champion this film.\u201d"

        "title": "The Tech That Will Invade Our Lives in 2020",
        "fulltext": "The 2010s made one thing clear: Tech is everywhere in life.\nTech is in our homes withthermostatsthat heat up our residences before we walk through the door. It\u2019s in our cars withsafety featuresthat warn us about vehicles in adjacent lanes. It\u2019s on ourtelevision sets, where many of us are streaming shows and movies through apps. We even wear it on ourselves in the form ofwristwatches that monitor our health.\nIn 2020 and the coming decade, these trends are likely to gather momentum. They will also be on display next week atCES, an enormous consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas that typically serves as a window into the year\u2019s hottest tech developments.\nAt the show, next-generation cellular technology known as 5G, which delivers data at mind-boggling speeds, is expected to take center stage as one of the most important topics. We are also likely to see the evolution of smart homes, with internet-connected appliances such as refrigerators, televisions and vacuum cleaners working more seamlessly together \u2014 and with less human interaction required.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is connected everything,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cAnything in the home \u2014 we\u2019ll have more cameras, more mics, more sensors.\u201d\nIf some of this sounds the same aslast year,it is \u2014 but that\u2019s because new technologies often take time to mature.\nHere\u2019s what to watch in tech this year.\nIn the last few years, Amazon, Apple and Google have battled to become the center of our homes.\nTheir virtual assistants \u2014 Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri \u2014 respond to voice commands to play music from speakers, control light bulbs and activate robot vacuums. Smart home products work well, but they are complicated to set up, so most people use virtual assistants just for basic tasks like setting a kitchen timer and checking the weather.\nThen in December, Amazon, Apple and Google came to what appeared to be a truce: They announced that they were working together on a standard to helpmake smart home products compatiblewith one another.\nIn other words, when you buy an internet-connected light bulb down the line that works with Alexa, it should also work with Siri and Google Assistant. This should help reduce confusion when shopping for home products and improve the ease with which connected gadgets work with one another.\nMs. Milanesi said that eliminating complexity was a necessary step for the tech giants to achieve their ultimate goal: seamless home automation without the need for people to tell the assistants what to do.\n\u201cYou want the devices to talk to each other instead of me being the translator between these device interactions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I open my door, then the door can say to the lights that the door is open and therefore the lights need to turn on.\u201d\nIf and when that happens, your home will truly \u2014 and finally \u2014 be smart.\nIn 2019, thewireless industry began shifting to 5G, a technology that can deliver data at such incredibly fast speeds that people will be able to download entire movies in a few seconds.\nYet the rollout of 5G was anticlimactic and uneven. Across the United States, carriers deployed 5G in just a few dozen cities. And only a handful of new smartphones last year worked with the new cellular technology.\nIn 2020, 5G will gain some momentum. Verizon said it expected half the nation to have access to 5G this year. AT&T, which offers two types of 5G \u2014 5G Evolution, which is incrementally faster than 4G, and 5G Plus, which is the ultrafast version \u2014 said it expected 5G Plus to reach parts of30 cities by early 2020.\nAnother sign that 5G is really taking hold? A broader set of devices will support the new wireless standard.\nSamsung, for one, has begun including 5G support on some of its newer Galaxy devices. Apple, which declined to comment, is also expected to release its first 5G-compatible iPhones this year.\nAnd 5G will be going to work behind the scenes, in ways that will emerge over time. One important benefit of the technology is its ability to greatly reduce latency, or the time it takes for devices to communicate with one another. That will be important for the compatibility of next-generation devices like robots, self-driving cars and drones.\nFor example, if your car has 5G and another car has 5G, the two cars can talk to each other, signaling to each other when they are braking and changing lanes. The elimination of the communications delay is crucial for cars to become autonomous.\nIt\u2019s a time of intense competition in wearable computers, which is set to lead to more creativity and innovation.\nFor a long while, Apple has dominated wearables. In 2015, it released Apple Watch, a smart watch with a focus on health monitoring. In 2016, the company introduced AirPods, wireless earbuds that can be controlled with Siri.\nSince then, many others have jumped in, including Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei.Google recently acquired Fitbit,the fitness gadget maker, for $2.1 billion, in the hope of playing catch-up with Apple.\nComputer chips are making their way into other electronic products like earphones, which means that companies are likely to introduce innovations in wearable accessories, said Frank Gillett, a technology analyst for Forrester. Two possibilities: earphones that monitor your health by pulling pulses from your ears, or earbuds that double as inexpensive hearing aids.\n\u201cThat whole area of improving our hearing and hearing the way other people hear us is really interesting,\u201d he said.\nWe have rushed headlong into the streaming era, and that will only continue.\nIn 2019, Netflix was the most-watched video service in the United States, with people spending an average of 23 minutes a day streaming its content, according to eMarketer, the research firm. In all, digital video made up about a quarter of the daily time spent on digital devices last year, which included time spent on apps and web browsers.\nNetflix\u2019s share of the overall time we spend watching video on devices will probably decline in 2020, according to eMarketer, because of the arrival of competing streaming services like Disney Plus, HBO Max and Apple TV Plus.\n\u201cEven though Americans are spending more time watching Netflix, people\u2019s attention will become more divided as new streamers emerge,\u201d Ross Benes, an analyst at eMarketer, said in ablog post.\nSo if you don\u2019t like \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d or \u201cWatchmen,\u201d you won\u2019t change the channel. You will just switch to a different app."

        "title": "Why You Should Take a Close Look at What Tracks You",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of a limited-run newsletter. You cansign up here. Charlie Warzel is off this week, so he\u2019s turning the newsletter over to his colleague Thorin Klosowski.\nIn case you missed it last week: check out a new package of fiction and poetry about surveillancehere.\nWhen we read stories \u2014like the recent Times Opinion investigation of location tracking\u2014 about how much data gets collected about us, we are first indignant, then frustrated, and finally we throw our hands in the air and forget about the whole thing. But, like logging calories on a diet, logging ad trackers is a way to self-impose a constant reminder of corporate surveillance.\nMost companiestrack your web browsing. All of these trackers create a profile \u2014often inaccurate\u2014 to serve up ads, personalized recommendations and more. To understand the scope of these types of trackers, last year Times Opinionmapped out the data collectedacross 47 sites.Gizmodo left the web browserand logged every bit of information transferred by every device on a home network to see where those devices stored data and how often they transferred information. If you\u2019re curious about the technical details, the Electronic Frontier Foundation recentlylaid out how it all works.\nAfter we read these types of stories, we might take a step back and nod thoughtfully about how bad it all seems. Maybe we install an ad blocker. Many people shrug it off as an inevitability of modern life. The tools that monitor ad trackers are growing increasingly available and (sometimes) user-friendly. It\u2019s worth installing them.\nThe most accessible way to monitor trackers is with theFirefox web browser. A recent update added a weekly report card page that shows how many trackers Firefox blocks. You can click a shield icon in Firefox\u2019s URL bar when visiting any site to see what type of tracking content a site uses. A running ticker is nice, but the data can still be hard to parse, because Firefox doesn\u2019t explain what each tracker means. For example, on the home page of Wirecutter, a New York Times-owned website, Firefox shows a tracker from something calledOptimizely. Digging around and talking to Wirecutter\u2019s data team, I learned it\u2019s an innocuous and common tool used to test different versions of a page (like A/B testing).\nStill, as dense as the data may be, it\u2019s fascinating to see just how many trackers you can collect every day. Firefox isn\u2019t the only option for seeing this type of data, but it\u2019s the easiest to understand. If Firefox isn\u2019t for you, a browser extension likePrivacy BadgerorDisconnectdisplays trackers on each site, while the privacy-focused web browserBravekeeps a running total of the ads and trackers it blocks.\nOur desktop and laptop computers are only a small portion of what we connect to the internet. We also have phones, televisions, video game consoles, smart speakers and more. If you\u2019re mildly technically inclined, you can track all of this too.\nIf you want to see what all of your connected devices are doing online, check out thePrinceton IoT Inspector. You can run the software on a Mac, but it\u2019s better suited to the Raspberry Pi, a $35 tiny computer that runs a variation of the open-source Linux operating system. Once installed, IoT Inspector constantly monitors the traffic into and out of your network, then displays it on a dashboard. Using IoT Inspector, I found that my older-generation Samsung TV, which can barely pull itself together long enough to launch Netflix, frequently pings a site I assume isSamsung\u2019s Automatic Content Recognition software, which can track what you\u2019re watching byreading pixels to identify shows.\nIoT Inspector shows you where your data goes but doesn\u2019t allow you to block anything. A Raspberry Pi can help you there, too.Pi HoleandAdguardare free programs that block ads across your networkandlog statistics while doing so. They can be a bit tricky to set up, but once they\u2019re running, you\u2019ll see exactly how much tracking is happening on your computer, phone, TV and any other smart device you hook into the system.\nNone of these programs tell you exactly what data is collected or how it\u2019s used. But, like knowing exactlyhow your phone collects and shares location data, being aware of how many ad trackers you encounter and how much data gets collected can help turn the most privacy-carefree into partial believers. It is one thing to read a story about the thousands of online trackers encountered by a stranger online; it\u2019s another to see it in your own home.\nLike many other fun-loving Californians, I\u2019ve spent the first few days of the year reading the dozens of updated privacy policies following the start of theCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act. These new rules require most large companies that operate in California to disclose how they collect and use data. As Californians, we have the right to know what data gets collected and if the data is sold to third parties. If it is sold, we can opt out of those sales. We can also request to see any data that has already been collected and ask companies to delete it, though doing so often means deleting your entire account. That\u2019s assuming companies follow the law and do so in a way a layperson can understand (spoiler: they don\u2019t).\nI\u2019ve already spent over six hours filling out forms, sending emails and clicking random verification links. Companies seem to interpret the law in various ways, with some providing simple tools to exercise your new rights, while others obfuscate the process and make it difficult to figure out what you can and can\u2019t do. Some companies automate the process, delivering any data you request within a few days, while others need to do it manually.\nFacebook\u2019spolicy is the most unclear to me. When you request data from any Facebook-operated service, including Instagram or WhatsApp, you get a form email withbasics about downloading data, but that\u2019s just for data you\u2019ve knowingly provided them, like pictures or videos. It\u2019s not possible to delete collected data without deleting your entire account, there\u2019s no clear way to opt out of the sale of personal data, and you have to make each data request individually for each Facebook service.\nAppleis an interesting contrast to Facebook. Apple makes it clear how torequest dataandopt out of interest-based ads, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to ask Apple to delete the data, which can range from previous addresses to podcast playback positions.Amazonsits somewhere in the middle, makingrequesting dataclear but everything else complicated.\nMedia and gaming services were consistently the clearest and easiest to use.Nintendo,SpotifyandHuluare all very straightforward, though Spotify throws a little shade at the new law in its \u201cSale of Personal Information\u201d section. The game developerBlizzardgoes a step further, allowing you to opt out of any future data sharing, even though the company doesn\u2019t share data right now. It\u2019s not all great on the media side, asNetflixmakes you send an email to exercise any of your rights, which is tedious.\nIf you\u2019re looking to request and delete your data and don\u2019t want to wade through your inbox,this listof new California-compliant privacy policies is the most comprehensive I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ve requested my data from every company mentioned above, but only Apple has delivered anything so far (it can take up to 45 days to get your data after you request it).\nMy Apple data came packed inside dozens of spreadsheets, and honestly, it\u2019s all pretty bland. The most surprising data I found was from a free trial of Apple Music in 2015. It included every song I listed to, when (and if) I paused or skipped the track and what time of day I listened to it.\nBased on that data, I was able to conclude that (probably after a few drinks) one night around midnight I listened to the odd combination of two Taylor Swift songs, a Jesus Lizard song and two Replacements songs. The next morning I played M83, probably in a regretful mood. A list of songs alone paints a clear picture, and I shudder at the thought of how clear that image could be if combined with my web browsing or location data (Apple notably doesn\u2019t sell this data, but it\u2019s an interesting thought experiment).\nFacebook separates security tool from friend suggestions, citing privacy overhaul\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be pretty\u201d: How the decade\u2019s technological tsunami will change life as we know it\nJust got a new TV or streamer?

        "title": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Newest Rival: The Banks of the Hudson",
        "fulltext": "When Facebook was searching for another New York office, one big enough to fit as many as 6,000 workers, more than double the number it currently employs in the city, it had one major demand: It needed the space urgently.\nSo after the company settled on Hudson Yards, the vast mini-city taking shape on Manhattan\u2019s Far West Side, existing tenants were told to move and a small army of construction workers quickly began to revamp the building even before a lease had been signed.\nFacebook\u2019s push to accommodate its booming operations is part of a rush by the West Coast technology giants to expand in New York City. The rapid growth is turning a broad swath of Manhattan into one of the world\u2019s most vibrant tech corridors.\nFour companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u2014 already have big offices along the Hudson River, from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, or have been hunting for new ones in recent months, often competing with one another for the same space.\nIn all, the companies are expected to have roughly 20,000 workers in New York by 2022.\nCities across the United States and around the world have long vied to establish themselves as worthy rivals to Silicon Valley. New York City is certainly not anywhere close to overtaking the Bay Area as the nation\u2019s tech leader, but it is increasingly competing for tech companies and talent.\nNew York\u2019s rise as a tech hub comes as industries that have long dominated the city\u2019s economic landscape are transformed by technology, and are themselves increasingly reliant on software engineers and other highly skilled workers.\nThe growth in New York is occurring largely without major economic incentives from the city and state governments. Officials are mindful of the outcry last year over at least $3 billion in public subsidies that Amazon was offered to build a corporate campus in Queens.\nThe retail behemoth, stung by the backlash,canceled its plans abruptly in February. It is continuing to add jobs in the city, although at a slower pace.\nStill,Amazon\u2019s announcement last month that it would lease space in Midtownfor 1,500 workers renewed a debate over whether incentives should be used to woo huge tech companies to New York.\nOpponents of the earlier deal, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of Queens, said Amazon\u2019s decision to expand in Manhattan showed that New York was so attractive that tax breaks were unnecessary.\nOthers responded that the Hudson Yards space the company was leasing paled next to the campus proposed for Long Island City, Queens, and to the 25,000 people Amazon had pledged to employ there.\nTech companies are choosing New York to tap into its deep and skilled talent pool and to attract employees who prefer the city\u2019s diverse economy over technology-dominated hubs on the West Coast. New York is also closer to Europe, an important market.\n\u201cFor a long time, if you lived in the broader tech sector, there was inertia that brought you to Silicon Valley,\u201d said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group. \u201cSo many people wanted to live here and move here, but felt the jobs weren\u2019t here. Now the jobs are here.\u201d\nGoogle has grown so quickly and is so squeezed for space that it is temporarily leasing two buildings until a much larger development in Manhattan near the Holland Tunnel, St. John\u2019s Terminal, is ready in 2022.\nThe big tech firms started in New York with small outposts. Google\u2019s first New York employee, a sales worker, arrived in 2000, and worked out of a Starbucks in Manhattan. It was the company\u2019s first office outside California.\nTech industry offices were once mostly filled with sales and marketing employees who needed to be closer to their customers and to industries like fashion, finance, media and real estate that power the city\u2019s economy.\nOver the past five years, though, the makeup of the companies\u2019 combined New York work force has come to resemble the West Coast version: a mix of engineers and others involved in software development.\nFour big technology companies will have a combined 20,000 workers in the city by 2022, mostly concentrated along Manhattan's West Side.Squares on the map show where Facebook, Google and Amazon have leased space, or are planning to.\nThe New York Times\nAt Google\u2019s New York office, highly skilled workers now outnumber their colleagues in sales and marketing. Of thenearly 800 job openings that Amazon hasin the city, more than half are for developers, engineers and data scientists.\n\u201cEvery line of business and every platform is represented quite healthfully,\u201d said William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York, the company\u2019s largest office except for its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. \u201cNot everyone wants to be in California.\u2019\u2019\nOren Michels, a tech adviser and investor who sold Mashery, a company based in San Francisco, to Intel in 2013, said that New York City had become a refuge for tech workers who did not want to be surrounded solely by those working in the same industry.\n\u201cYou have younger engineers and those sorts of people who frankly want to live in New York City because it\u2019s a more interesting and fun place to live,\u201d he said. \u201cSan Francisco is turning into a company town and the company is tech, both professionally and personally.\u201d\nMr. Michels said that his family had bought a home in Manhattan in 2014 with a plan to split their time between San Francisco and New York. They soon decided to live full time in New York, where Mr. Michels is on the boards of four tech firms.\nThe number of tech jobs in New York City has surged 80 percent in the past decade, to 142,600, from 79,400 in 2009,according to the New York State Comptroller\u2019s office. (The business services industry, which includes accountants and lawyers and is the largest private sector, employed 762,000 people in 2018, according to the comptroller\u2019s office.)\nSince 2016, the number of job openings in the city\u2019s tech sector has jumped 38 percent, an analysis for The Times bythe jobs website Glassdoorfound. In November, New York had the third-highest number of tech openings among United States cities, 26,843, behind just San Francisco and Seattle.\nIt is not only the biggest tech firms that are growing in New York. From 2018 through the third quarter of 2019, investors pumped more than $27 billion into start-ups in the New York City region, the second most in that time for any area outside San Francisco, according to theMoneyTree Report by PwC-CB Insights. (Nearly $100 billion was invested in start-ups in the Silicon Valley area in that period.)\nIndustries like finance, retail and health care provide more jobs, but the tech sector, with an average salary of $153,000, has become one of New York City\u2019s main economic drivers.\nThat has raised concerns about whether the industry is intensifying income inequality and making New York unaffordable for more people.\nThe four big tech companies \u201cattract thousands of out-of-state employees with advanced degrees and work experience, and drive unprecedented influxes in luxury rentals, rent hikes, and the flipping of buildings and private homes,\u201d said\u00a0Kiana\u00a0Davis,\u00a0a policy analyst at the Urban Justice Center.\n\u201cIt should go without saying,\u2019\u2019 she added, \u201cthat middle-income, low-wage, poor and unemployed residents in these cities cannot access the luxury housing market nor the rising rents and have been driven out of their communities as a result.\u201d\nJonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal firm, said that the residential market in Manhattan had been strong in areas where the tech firms had grown.\n\u201cI speak to brokerage groups twice a week, and the conversation is always peppered with questions about the tech sector,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIf you have 20,000 employees coming in who are high-wage earners, that can have a pronounced impact.\u201d\nThe major tech firms are expected to grow to the point that they are among the largest private tenants in New York in the coming years, rivaling longtime leaders like JPMorgan Chase.\nAmong companies in the technology, advertising, media and information industries, Google and Facebook are now the largest tenants, beating out legacy companies like Cond\u00e9 Nast, News Corp. and Warner Media, according to an analysis performed for The Times by the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield.\nFacebook employs 2,900 people in New York, and recently signed the lease at Hudson Yards for 1.5 million square feet in three buildings. In addition to providing space for 6,000 workers, the deal gives the company an option to take over another several hundred thousand square feet in the development.\nFacebook executives initially set their sights on a marquee building on Madison Avenue in the Flatiron district, not far from the company\u2019s existing offices, according to a person familiar with Facebook\u2019s plans.\nBut then Facebook executives toured Hudson Yards and were impressed with the amenities, including shops and restaurants, and with the short walk to major subway lines.\nA deal was struck in November, but with a requirement on Facebook\u2019s part that about 300,000 square feet in two buildings, 30 and 55 Hudson Yards, be ready very soon.\nWorkers were immediately brought in to begin preparing the space and to move out existing tenants.\nTwo blocks east, Facebook is close to signing a lease for about 700,000 square feet in the107-year-old James A. Farley Buildingacross from Pennsylvania Station, according to three people familiar with the deal. The property, also known as the Farley Post Office, is being renovated by the Related Companies and another developer,Vornado Realty Trust.\nMore than 2,500 employees could eventually work there. (The Wall Street Journal reportedearlier on the potential lease.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict future growth, but we believe New York is a vibrant market with a tremendous pool of talent,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman, Jamila Reeves, said. She declined to comment on the company\u2019s specific plans.\nJust north of the Farley building, Amazonsaid recentlythat it had signed a lease for 350,000 square feet in a building on 10th Avenue near Hudson Yards, enough space for 1,500 employees. The social media company LinkedIn, whose New York offices are not far away, in the Empire State Building, recently said it would expand to four additional floors in the landmark property.\nThe tech titan whose intentions in New York are probably least known is Apple.\nExecutives at the company, which has had an office in the Flatiron area, have toured buildings in that neighborhood and in the Hudson Yards area but a deal has not yet been signed. Apple has inquired about leasing much less space than other big tech companies, roughly 50,000 square feet.\nApple declined to comment.\nFor every West Coast company with a household name that has expanded in New York, there are many large but lesser-known firms with headquarters in the city.\nOne, Datadog, which provides cloud-based software for businesses, went public in September and is valued at $10.5 billion. The company has 480 employees in its New York offices, up from 125 three years ago."

        "fulltext": "In 2006, Google bought YouTube for more than $1 billion, Apple was preparing to announce the first iPhone, and the American housing bubble began to deflate. Claire Stapleton, then a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, faced the same question over and over: What did she plan to do with that English degree? She flirted, noncommittally, with Teach for America.\nThen, a Google recruiter came to campus and, Ms. Stapleton said, she \u201cwon \u2018American Idol.\u2019\u201d The company flew her out to Mountain View, Calif., which felt to her \u201clike the promised land\u201d \u2014 15 cafeterias, beach volleyball courts, Zumba classes, haircuts and laundry on-site.\nBut for Ms. Stapleton, now 34, the real appeal in a job at Google was what seemed to be a perfect balance of working for income and according to one\u2019s conscience. Naturally, she said yes to an offer in the corporate communications department.\n\u201cThere was this ambient glow of being part of a company that was changing the world,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cI was totally googly-eyed about it.\u201d\nMore than a decade later, college seniors and recent graduates looking for jobs that are both principled and high-paying are doing so in a world that has soured on Big Tech. The positive perceptions of Google, Facebook and other large tech firms are crumbling.\nMany students still see employment in tech as a ticket to prosperity, but for job seekers who can afford to be choosy, there is agrowing sentimentthat Silicon Valley\u2019s most lucrative positions aren\u2019t worth the ethical quandaries.\n\u201cWorking at Google or Facebook seemed like the coolest thing ever my freshman year, because you\u2019d get paid a ton of money but it was socially responsible,\u201d said Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci, 21, a senior at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt was like a utopian workplace.\u201d\nNow, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s more hesitation about the moral qualities of these jobs. It\u2019s like how people look at Wall Street.\u201d\nThe growing skepticism of Silicon Valley, sometimes referred to as the \u201ctechlash,\u201d has spared few of technology\u2019s major players.\nIn 2019, Facebook wasfinednearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for mishandling user data. Amazoncanceledits plans for a New York City headquarters after residents, union leaders and local legislators contested the idea that the behemoth should receive $3 billion from the state to set up shop. Google, in 2018, facedinternal protestsover itsplans for a censored search enginein China and handling ofsexual harassment. (High-ranking Google employees have stated thatthe company never planned to expand search into China,but also that plans for a China project had been\u201cterminated.\u201d)\nThe share of Americans who believe that technology companies have a positive impact on society has dropped from 71 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2019, according to a 2019Pew Research Centersurvey.\nAt this year\u2019s Golden Globes, Sacha Baron Cohen compared Mark Zuckerberg to the main character in \u201cJoJo Rabbit\u201d: a \u201cna\u00efve, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends.\u201d\nThat these attitudes are shared by undergraduates and graduate students \u2014 who are supposed to be imbued with high-minded idealism \u2014 is no surprise. In August, the reporter April Glaserwrote aboutcampus techlash for Slate. She found that at Stanford, known for its competitive computer science program, some students said they had no interest in working for a major tech company, while others sought \u201cto push for change from within.\u201d\nBelce Dogru, who graduated from Stanford with a degree in computer science last year and is completing a master\u2019s program at the university, said: \u201cThere has definitely been a shift in conversation on campus.\u201d\nStanford is the second-biggest feeder school for jobs in Silicon Valley,according to data from HiringSolved, a software company focused on recruiting. Some companies pay as much as$12,000to advertise at the university\u2019s computer science job fairs; recruiters at those events didn\u2019t always have to make a hard sell.\n\u201cIt felt like in my freshman year Google, Palantir and Facebook were these shiny places everyone wanted to be. It was like, \u2018Wow, you work at Facebook. You must be really smart,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Dogru, 23. \u201cNow if a classmate tells me they\u2019re joining Palantir or Facebook, there\u2019s an awkward gap where they feel like they have to justify themselves.\u201d\nPalantir, in particular, has drawn the ire of students at Stanford for providing services to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE).\nLast summer, a campus activist group, Students for the Liberation of All People,visitedthe company\u2019s office, a 15-minute walk from campus, and hung a banner nearby that read: \u201cOur software is so powerful it separates families.\u201d Similar protests took place at the University of California, Berkeley, Brown and Yale,according to Recode. The protests, and the attitudes they reflected, were also covered inThe Los Angeles Times.\nAudrey Steinkamp, a 19-year-old sophomore at Yale, which sends about10 percentof each graduating class into tech, said that taking a job in Silicon Valley is seen as \u201cselling out,\u201d no different from the economics majors going into consulting who are \u201clovingly and not-so-lovingly called \u2018snakes.\u2019\u201d\nThat is especially true, some of the students said, when a classmate chooses to work for Facebook, whose products havespread disinformationandhelped influence a presidential election.\n\u201cThe work you do at a place like Facebook could be harmful at a much larger scale than an investment bank,\u201d Ms. Dogru said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the pockets of millions of people, and it\u2019s a source of news for millions of people. It\u2019s working at a scary scale.\u201d\nMany students still believe that technology can help change the world for good. As Ms. Glaserput it for Slate, some of them are opting out of the Big Tech pipeline and trying, instead, \u201cto use technical skills as an insurance policy against dystopia.\u201d\n\u201cStudents have an opportunity to look at where they can have the most impact that\u2019s in line with their values,\u201d said Leslie Miley, a former director of engineering at Google and Slack. \u201cThe fact of the matter is Google, Facebook, Twitter are not in line with those values because they\u2019re huge companies beholden to a lot of different masters.\u201d\nAnna Geiduschek, a software engineer who graduated from Stanford in 2014, was working at Dropbox last year when she received an email from an Amazon Web Services recruiter. She replied that she wouldn\u2019t consider a job with the company unless Amazon cut its contract with Palantir.\n\u201cThese companies go out of their way to try and woo software engineers, and I realized it would send a powerful message for me as a potential employee to tell them no,\u201d Ms. Geiduschek, 27, said, noting that top tech companies sometimesspendroughly $20,000 to recruit a single engineer. \u201cYou could basically cut them off at their supply.\u201d\nHer recruiter responded: \u201cWow I honestly had no idea. I will run this up to leadership.\u201d Days later, Ms. Geiduschek received another template email from an Amazon hiring manager, so she scheduled a call and aired her grievances by phone.\nSome engineers are sharing screenshots of their protest emails on Twitter with the hashtag #TechWontBuildIt. Jackie Luo, an engineer,sent an email to Googlesaying that she wouldn\u2019t consider a job there given its plans to re-enter China with a censored search engine.\nKelly Carter, a web developer,emaileda Tesla recruiter with her concerns about the company\u2019s anti-union tactics. Craig Chasseur, a software engineer, emailed the H.R. department atSalesforceto critique the company\u2019s contract with ICE.\nThese protests echo mounting public concerns about the power of these corporations. But it\u2019s not clear whether they have moved the needle for prospective hires.\nFormer recruiters for Facebook toldCNBCin May that the acceptance rate for full-time engineering job offers at the company had dropped precipitously, as much as 40 percent.\nAfter the article\u2019s publication, Facebook disputed the figure; the company \u201cregularly ranks high on industry lists of most attractive employers,\u201d a spokesman said. Data published the same month byLinkedInshowed that tech firms continued to hire at high rates, especially for entry-level employees.\nBut at campus career centers, students are struggling with the dual, and sometimes dueling, desires for prestige and purpose.\n\u201cIt started with millennials, but now Gen Z-ers are getting educated because they want to do good in the world,\u201d said Sue Harbour, the senior associate director of the career center at the University of California, Berkeley, which is Silicon Valley\u2019s top feeder, according to HiringSolved. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve seen tech companies grow, we\u2019ve also seen the need for more tech oriented to social responsibility.\u201d\nSome recent graduates are taking their technical skills to smaller social impact groups instead of the biggest firms. Ms. Dogru said that some of her peers are pursuing jobs at start-ups focused on health, education and privacy. Ms. Harbour said Berkeley offers a networking event called Tech for Good, where alumni from purpose-driven groups like Code for America and Khan Academy share career opportunities.\nMs. Geiduschek said she recently left Dropbox for Recidiviz, a nonprofit that builds technological tools for criminal justice reform.\nBut those so-called passion jobs are more challenging to come by, according to Amy Binder, a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego, and the lead author of a 2015paperabout elite colleges \u201cfunneling\u201d graduates into certain kinds of \u201cprestigious\u201d careers.\n\u201cFor other sectors like tech it\u2019s easier to get on the conveyor belt and fill these positions,\u201d Dr. Binder said. \u201cI graduated from Stanford in the \u201980s, and even back then there was talk on campus about people selling out and going to investment banks, but those jobs are still getting filled. The self-incrimination hasn\u2019t stopped the juggernaut.\u201d\nDr. Binder said elite schools have long steered students toward certain \u201chigh-status\u201d industries \u2014 the C.I.A. in the 1950s, finance and consulting in the aughts and tech today. It\u2019s a \u201cprestige system,\u201d she said, that universities enable.\n\u201cAs tech firms get more negative reviews in the media and it becomes clear what their political toll can be, students may have more circumspection about taking these jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019ll continue taking these jobs because of the security and reputation that comes with them. And universities will keep sponsoring all this recruitment.\u201d\nFor years, students were told they could tackle ethical concerns about technology from the inside, working within the mammoth structures of companies like Google. Ms. Stapleton said that was part of the company\u2019s allure: its ostensible commitment to empowering even its youngest employees to weigh in on critical problems.\nShe spent 12 years at Google and YouTube on various teams, including internal communications, where she wrote company talking points. Her weekly emails to staff, she said, were the stuff of corporate legend. At a 2012 all-hands, Larry Page, one of the company\u2019s founders, called her onstage to celebrate her work as colleagues presented her with a wooden plaque that read: \u201cThe Bard of Google.\u201d\nThen, in 2018, Ms. Stapleton helped organize a Google walkout, after reporting in The New York Timesrevealedthat the company gave a $90 million severance package to the Android creator Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct.\nTwenty-thousand workers left their desks in protest. Within six months, Ms. Stapleton said, she was demoted and pushed to resign. In December, she wrote about her experience in an essay forElle.\nGoogle maintained that Ms. Stapleton was not sidelined for her role in the walkout. \u201cWe thank Claire for her work at Google and wish her all the best,\u201d a Google spokespersonresponded. \u201cTo reiterate, we don\u2019t tolerate retaliation. Our employee relations team did a thorough investigation of her claims and found no evidence of retaliation. They found that Claire\u2019s management team supported her contributions to our workplace, including awarding her their team Culture Award for her role in the Walkout.\u201d\nBut Ms. Stapleton said her story should give bright-eyed students pause about whether Big Tech and altruism are aligned.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if Google can credibly sell young people on the promise of doing good in the world anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t wonderful people there and interesting things to work on. But if you care about a company\u2019s values, ethics and contributions to society, you should take your talents elsewhere.\u201d\nMr. Miley, who left Google in 2019, echoed her sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change a system from within when the system doesn\u2019t think it needs to be changed.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Google said the company continues to see job application numbers grow annually, and noted that the practice of having employees raise concerns about policies, whether on data privacy or human rights reviews, is part of the corporate culture.\nThe outside attention those concerns may draw is a reflection of Google\u2019s growth and evolution from a search company to a larger entity with many products and services, the spokeswoman said.\nBut even companies with a market cap of over $970 billion (Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet) or over $614 billion (Facebook) aren\u2019t immune to the punches of potential talent. John Sullivan, a professor of management at San Francisco State University who also advises companies on recruitment,estimatedthat criticisms of Uber\u2019s sexual harassment and discrimination policies cost the company roughly $100 million, largely because of talent lost to competitors.\nSarah Soule, a professor and senior associate dean at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said in an email that there is a long history of students protesting questionable corporate ethics, with several cases of protest directed toward recruiters, yielding powerful effects.\nTake the case of Dow Chemical Company, which in 1965 accepted a $5 million Department of Defense contract to manufacture the flammable gel napalm during the Vietnam War. When recruiters turned up at New York University, they were met with hundreds of angry student demonstrators,The Timesreported.\nBrendon Sexton, the student government president at N.Y.U. at the time, demanded a moratorium on Dow\u2019s campus recruitment efforts in 1968. \u201cThey don\u2019t care that a sin is being committed here,\u201d he told protesters near the job interview site.\nPublic pressure continued to mount, fueled largely by young activists. The company halted its production of napalm a year later.\nMs. Geiduschek said the behavior of tech companies is especially difficult to challenge because their products are ubiquitous.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid spending your money at Amazon. I sometimes do it, especially in that Christmas-season binge,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to sway this company to do the right thing, you have to attack it at places that are higher leverage, where it hurts.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Takes a (Cautious) Stand Against Opening a Killer\u2019s iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is privately preparing for a legal fight with the Justice Department to defend encryption on its iPhones while publicly trying to defuse the dispute, as the technology giant navigates an increasingly tricky line between its customers and the Trump administration.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has marshaled a handful of top advisers, whileAttorney General William P. Barr has taken aim at the companyand asked it to help penetrate two phones used by a gunman in a deadly shooting last month at anaval air station in Pensacola, Fla.\nExecutives at Apple have been surprised by the case\u2019s quick escalation, said people familiar with the company who were not authorized to speak publicly. And there is frustration and skepticism among some on the Apple team working on the issue that the Justice Department hasn\u2019t spent enough time trying to get into the iPhones with third-party tools, said one person with knowledge of the matter.\nThe situation has become a sudden crisis at Apple that pits Mr. Cook\u2019s longstanding commitment to protecting people\u2019s privacy against accusations from the United States government that it is putting the public at risk. The case resemblesApple\u2019s clash with the F.B.I. in 2016over another dead gunman\u2019s phone, which dragged on for months.\nThis time, Apple is facing off against the Trump administration, which has been unpredictable. The stakes are high for Mr. Cook, who has built an unusual alliance with President Trump that has helped Apple largely avoid damaging tariffs in thetrade war with China. That relationship will now be tested as Mr. Cook confronts Mr. Barr, one of the president\u2019s closest allies.\n\u201cWe are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements,\u201d Mr. Trump said Tuesdayin a post on Twitter. \u201cThey will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country.\u201d\nApple declined to comment on the issue on Tuesday. Late Monday, after Mr. Barr had complained that the company had provided no \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d in gaining access to the phones used in the Pensacola shooting, Apple said it rejected that characterization. It added that \u201cencryption is vital to protecting our country and our users\u2019 data.\u201d\nBut Apple also offered conciliatory language, in a sign that it did not want the showdown to intensify. The company said it was working with the F.B.I. on the Pensacola case, with its engineers recently holding a call to provide technical assistance.\n\u201cWe will work tirelessly to help them investigate this tragic attack on our nation,\u201d Apple said.\nAt the heart of the tussle is a debate between Apple and the government over whether security or privacy trumps the other. Apple has said it chooses not to build a \u201cbackdoor\u201d way for governments to get into iPhones and to bypass encryption because that would create a slippery slope that could damage people\u2019s privacy.\nThe government has argued it is not up to Apple to choose whether to provide help, as the Fourth Amendment allows the government to violate individual privacy in the interest of public safety. Privacy has never been an absolute right under the Constitution, Mr. Barr saidin a speech in October.\nMr. Cook publicly took a stand on privacy in 2016 when Apple fought a court order from the F.B.I. to open the iPhone of a gunman involved in a San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting. The company said it could open the phone in a month, using a team of six to 10 engineers. But in a blistering,1,100-word letter to Apple customersat the time, Mr. Cook warned that creating a way for the authorities to gain access to someone\u2019s iPhone \u201cwould undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201d\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s former general counsel who helped lead the company\u2019s response in the San Bernardino case, said in an interview last year that Mr. Cook had staked his reputation on the stance. Had Apple\u2019s board not agreed with the position, Mr. Cook was prepared to resign, Mr. Sewell said.\nThe San Bernardino case was bitterly contested by the government and Apple untila private company came forwardwith a way to break into the phone. Since then, Mr. Cook has made privacy one of Apple\u2019s core values. That has set Apple apart from tech giants like Facebook and Google, which have faced scrutiny for vacuuming up people\u2019s data to sell ads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant marketing,\u201d Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor who has written a book on the tech giants, said of Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re so concerned with your privacy that they\u2019re willing to wave the finger at the F.B.I.\u201d\nMr. Cook\u2019s small team at Apple is now aiming to steer the current situation toward an outside resolution that doesn\u2019t involve the company breaking its own security, even as it prepares for a potential legal battle over the issue, said the people with knowledge of the thinking.\nSome of the frustration within Apple over the Justice Department is rooted in how police have previously exploited software flaws to break into iPhones. The Pensacola gunman\u2019s phones were an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7 Plus, according to a person familiar with the investigation who declined to be named because the detail was confidential.\nThose phones, released in 2012 and 2016, lack Apple\u2019s most sophisticated encryption. The iPhone 5 is even older than the device in the San Bernardino case, which was an iPhone 5C.\nSecurity researchers and a former senior Apple executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity said tools from at least two companies, Cellebrite and Grayshift, have long been able to bypass the encryption on those iPhone models.\nCellebrite said in an email that it helps \u201cthousands of organizations globally to lawfully access and analyze\u201d digital information; it declined to comment on an active investigation. Grayshift declined to comment.\nCellebrite\u2019s and Grayshift\u2019s tools exploit flaws in iPhone software that let them remove limits on how many passwords can be tried before the device erases its data, the researchers said. Typically, iPhones allow 10 password attempts. The tools then use a so-called brute-force attack, or repeated automated attempts of thousands of passcodes, until one works.\n\u201cThe iPhone 5 is so old, you are guaranteed that Grayshift and Cellebrite can break into those every bit as easily as Apple could,\u201d said Nicholas Weaver, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, who has taught iPhone security.\nChuck Cohen, who recently retired as head of the Indiana State Police\u2019s efforts to break into encrypted devices, said his team used a $15,000 device from Grayshift that enabled it to regularly get into iPhones, particularly older ones, though the tool didn\u2019t always work.\nIn the San Bernardino case, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector Generallater foundthe F.B.I.had not tried all possible solutionsbefore trying to force Apple to unlock the phone. In the current case, Mr. Barr and other Justice Department officials have said they have exhausted all options, though they declined to detail exactly why third-party tools have failed on these phones as the authorities seek to learn if the gunman acted alone or coordinated with others.\n\u201cThe F.B.I.\u2019s technical experts \u2014 as well as those consulted outside of the organization \u2014 have played an integral role in this investigation,\u201d an F.B.I. spokeswoman said. \u201cThe consensus was reached, after all efforts to access the shooter\u2019s phones had been unsuccessful, that the next step was to reach out to start a conversation with Apple.\u201d\nSecurity researchers speculated that in the Pensacola case, the F.B.I. might still be trying a brute-force attack to get into the phones. They said major physical damage may have impeded any third-party tools from opening the devices. The Pensacola gunman had shot the iPhone 7 Plus once and tried destroying the iPhone 5, according to F.B.I. photos.\nThe F.B.I. said it fixed the iPhones in a lab so that they would turn on, but the authorities still couldn\u2019t bypass their encryption. Security researchers and the former Apple executive said any damage that prevented third-party tools from working would also preclude a solution from Apple.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said in an email: \u201cApple designed these phones and implemented their encryption. It\u2019s a simple, \u2018front-door\u2019 request: Will Apple help us get into the shooter\u2019s phones or not?\u201d\nWhile Apple hasclosed loopholesthat police have used to break into its devices and resisted some law enforcement requests for access, it has also routinely helped police get information from phones in cases that don\u2019t require it to break its encryption. Apple has held seminars for police departments on how to quickly get into a suspect\u2019s phone, and it has a hotline and dedicated team to aid police in time-sensitive cases.\nIn the past seven years, Apple has also complied with roughly 127,000 requests from American law enforcement agencies for data stored on its computer servers. Such data is unencrypted and access is possible without a customer\u2019s passcode.\nIn 2016, when the standoff between Apple and the government was at its most acrimonious, Mr. Cook said Congress should pass a law to decide the boundaries between public safety and technological security. In court filings, Apple even identified an applicable law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.\nOn Monday, Mr. Barr said the Trump administration had revived talks with Congress to come up with such a law.\nJack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington."

        "fulltext": "The buoyant American stock market may be blinding investors to better opportunities abroad.\nSure, the decade-old bull market at home has been a boon to investors, driven by technology giants like Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. The S&P 500 has beaten theMSCI All Country World Indexin total annualized returns, by 13.5 percent to 8.8 percent, since 2010 to the end of 2019.\nBut that\u2019s not to say overseas markets have been doing poorly.\nIn several years over the last decade, stock markets in other developed economies, including Denmark, New Zealand and Austria, have turned in better performances.\nInvestors whose portfolios are heavily weighted to giant American companies may think they\u2019re getting overseas exposure because those companies earn revenue abroad, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as investing internationally. The United States stock market makes up about half of the world\u2019s market value, so there are plenty of opportunities to shop elsewhere.\nThose who would like to add some international flavor to their portfolios need to be aware of a downside. Overseas markets may underperform American stocks, hurting portfolios.\nBut if the outlook is for less favorable conditions at home, having some international exposure is a good way to balance things, according to Daniel Sotiroff, a Morningstar analyst. And funds that track international indexes make it possible to dabble in foreign markets relatively inexpensively, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge win for investors.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth starting out by examining some of the major international indexes. They are similar, but they have some crucial differences. For example, the index makers, MSCI and FTSE, don\u2019t agree on how to classify South Korea. TheMSCI EAFE Index(for Europe, Australasia and Far East) excludes Korea, along with the United States and Canada. In contrast, theFTSE Developed All Cap ex-U.S. Indexincludes Korea and Canada, but, as its name suggests, excludes the United States.\nFTSE\u2019s Developed All Cap ex-U.S. Index also holds many more stocks than the MSCI EAFE Index (3,873 versus 918), meaning it has smaller stakes in a bigger pool of stocks, magnifying the diversification effect.\nApart from that, both indexes have a bigger weighting to Japan and Britain than anywhere else, and the biggest sector representations are finance, industry and health care. The biggest individual holdings also tend to be similar, including Nestl\u00e9, Novartis, Toyota Motor and HSBC Holdings.\nThe sector weighting is notable because American stock indexes tilt more to technology, Mr. Sotiroff said. And since technology stocks have high valuations and financial stocks have lower valuations, the overseas indexes look relatively attractive, by this measure.\nThere are a few ways investors can use these indexes to add international exposure to their portfolios. The first is by embracing the whole market.\nTheVanguard Total International Stock Index Mutual Fundtracks the FTSE Global All Cap ex-U.S., with top holdings including Nestl\u00e9, Alibaba Group Holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Tencent Holdings, Roche Holding and Samsung. Its one-year return was 21.5 percent as of the end of 2019.\nTheFidelity International Index Fund, on the other hand, tracks the MSCI EAFE Index, with top holdings Nestl\u00e9, Roche, Novartis, Toyota Motor, HSBC Holdings and SAP. Its 1-year return is 22 percent.\nFor exchange-traded fund investors, theVanguard Total International Stock E.T.F.tracks the FTSE Global All Cap ex U.S. Index. It was up 21.6 percent for 2019 and has expenses of 0.09 percent.\nThen there is theiShares Core MSCI Total Internationalfund, which also tracks the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. index. With an expense ratio of 0.09 percent, it was up 21.8 percent for 2019.\nMuch the same thing can be done with actively managed mutual funds.T. Rowe Price\u2019s International Stock Fund, for example, focuses on large companies in developed markets and some emerging markets. Top holdings include Thales, Essify, Taiwan Semiconductor, Takeda Pharmaceutical and Alibaba. It was up 27.9 for 2019.\nInvestors who don\u2019t want to combine investments in developed markets with those of emerging markets can split their portfolio into funds that focus on one or the other.\nEmerging markets, which contribute about 15 percent of global market value, have higher risks because they often are in smaller economies with less infrastructure and legal and regulatory oversight. They also tend to have a lot of state-controlled companies, in countries like Russia and China.\nTheiShares MSCI Emerging Markets E.T.F.gained 17.7 for 2019, with top holdings including Alibaba, Taiwan Semiconductor, Tencent, Samsung, and China Construction Bank. Its expenses are 0.67 percent.\nInvesco\u2019s FTSE RAFI Emerging Markets E.T.F.was up 16.2 percent for 2019, with top holdings including Taiwan Semiconductor, China Construction Bank, Lukoil and Gazprom. Expenses are 0.5 percent.\nIf you\u2019d prefer an actively managed fund,Fidelity\u2019s Total Emerging Markets Fundhas expenses of 1.14 percent and was up 21.7 percent for 2019, with top holdings Tencent, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Alibaba and Meituan Dianping.\nPeople who want to stick to developed economies could look at theVanguard FTSE Developed Markets E.T.F., which focuses on large companies in the consumer cyclical, financial and industrial sectors. It was up 22 percent for 2019 with a 0.05 percent expenses.\nTheSPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-US E.T.F., tracking the S&P Developed ex-U.S. BMI Index, is slightly more weighted to financials and industrials. It was up 22.3 percent for the year with expenses of 0.04 percent. And the Schwab International Equity E.T.F., which also focuses on bigger companies, gained 20.9 percent for 2019 with expenses of 0.06 percent.\nA final strategy involves E.T.F.s that focus on stable companies that pay dividends. But there are many possible approaches, including funds that focus on developed markets versus those tilted toward emerging markets. Turnover in these various portfolios can be high, Mr. Sotiroff of Morningstar warns, so trading costs are higher.\nTheCambria Emerging Shareholder Yield E.T.F.tracks a Cambria index that follows stocks with big payouts. It was up 21.8 percent for 2019, with top holdings Iteq, TransContainer and Zhen Ding Technology Holding. Vanguard has theInternational High Dividend Yield E.T.F., which gained 18.3 percent for 2019, with top holdings Taiwan Semiconductor, Toyota, HSBC and Royal Dutch Shell."

        "title": "Barr Asks Apple to Unlock Pensacola Killer\u2019s Phones, Setting Up Clash",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr declared on Monday that a deadly shooting last month at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., was an act of terrorism, and he asked Apple in an unusually high-profile request to provide access to two phones used by the gunman.\nMr. Barr\u2019s appeal was an escalation of acontinuing fightbetween the Justice Department and Apple pitting personal privacy against public safety.\n\u201cThis situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that the public be able to get access to digital evidence,\u201d Mr. Barr said. He called on technology companies to find a solution and complained that Apple had provided no \u201csubstantive assistance,\u201d a charge that the company strongly denied on Monday night, saying it had been working with the F.B.I. since the day of the shooting.\nDetailing the results of the investigation into theDec. 6 shooting that killed three sailorsand wounded eight others, Mr. Barr said the gunman, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani \u2014 a Saudi Air Force cadet training with the American military \u2014 had displayed extremist leanings.\nMr. Alshamrani warned on last year\u2019s anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that \u201cthe countdown has begun\u201d and posted other anti-American, anti-Israeli and jihadist social media messages, some within hours of attacking the base, Mr. Barr said. \u201cThe evidence shows that the shooter was motivated by jihadist ideology,\u201d the attorney general said.\nThe government has alsoremoved from the countrysome21 Saudi studentswho trained with the American military, Mr. Barr said. He stressed that investigators found no connection to the shooting among the cadets, but said that some had links to extremist movements or possessed child pornography. Mr. Barr said the cases were too weak to prosecute but that Saudi Arabia kicked the trainees out of the program.\nThe battle between the government and technology companies over advanced encryption and other digital security measures has simmered for years. Apple, which stopped routinely helping the government unlock phones in late 2014 as it adopteda more combative stanceand unveiled a more secure operating system, has argued that data privacy is a human rights issue. If Apple developed a way to allow the American government into its phones, its executives argued, hackers or foreign governments like China would exploit the tool.\nBut frustrated law enforcement officials accuse Apple of providing a haven for criminals. They have longpushed for a legislative solutionto the problem of \u201cgoing dark,\u201d their term for how increasingly secure phones have made it harder to solve crimes, and the Pensacola investigation gives them a prominent chance to make their case.\nIn a statement Monday night, Apple said the substantive aid it had provided law enforcement agencies included giving investigators access to the gunman\u2019s iCloud account and transaction data for multiple accounts.\nThe company\u2019s statement did not say whether Apple engineers would help the government get into the phones themselves. It said that \u201cAmericans do not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations\u201d because there are now so many ways for the government to obtain data from Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 many of which Apple routinely helps the government execute.\nIt will not back down from its unequivocal support of encryption that is impossible to crack, people close to the company said.\nJustice Department officials said that they needed access to Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s phones to see data and messages from encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp to determine whether he had discussed his plans with others at the base and whether he was acting alone or with help.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a world where we have to spend months and even years exhausting efforts when lives are in the balance,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cWe should be able to get in when we have a warrant that establishes that criminal activity is underway.\u201d\nThe confrontation echoed thelegal standoff over an iPhoneused by a gunman who killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. Appledefied a court orderto assist the F.B.I. in its efforts to search his device, setting off a fight over whether privacy enabled by impossible-to-crack encryption harmed public safety.\nThe San Bernardino dispute was resolved when the F.B.I.found a private companyto bypass the iPhone\u2019s encryption. Tensions between the two sides, however, remained, and Apple worked toensure thatneither the government nor private contractors could open its phones.\nMr. Barr said that Trump administration officials have again begun discussing a legislative fix.\nBut the F.B.I. has been bruised by Mr. Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated complaints that former officials plotted to undercut his presidency and by a major inspector general\u2019s report last monththat revealedserious errors with aspects of the Russia investigation. A broad bipartisan consensus among lawmakers allowing the bureau to broaden its surveillance authorities is most likely elusive, though some lawmakers singled out Apple for its refusal to change its stance.\n\u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to shield criminals and terrorists from lawful efforts to solve crimes and protect our citizens,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. \u201cApple has a notorious history of siding with terrorists over law enforcement. I hope in this case they\u2019ll change course and actually work with the F.B.I.\u201d\nApple typically complies with court orders to turn over information on its servers. But said that it would turn over only the data it had, implying that it would not work to unlock the phones.\nInvestigators secured a court order within a day of the shooting, allowing them to search the phones, Mr. Barr said. He turned up the pressure on Apple a week after the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer, Dana Boente,asked the company for helpsearching Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s iPhones.\nOfficials said that the F.B.I. was still trying to gain access to the phones on its own and approached Apple only after asking other government agencies, foreign governments and third-party technology vendors for help, to no avail.\nThe devices were older models: an iPhone 7 with a fingerprint reader and an iPhone 5, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\nJustice Department officials said that investigators have yet to make a final determination about whether Mr. Alshamrani conspired with others. They said that the Saudi government was offering \u201cunprecedented\u201d cooperation but that \u201cwe need to get into those phones.\u201d\nMr. Barr and other law enforcement officials described a 15-minute shootout before security officers shot and killed Mr. Alshamrani. During the firefight, Mr. Alshamrani paused at one point to shoot one of his phones once, Mr. Barr said, adding that his other phone was also damaged but that the F.B.I. was able to repair them well enough to be searched.\nMr. Alshamrani also shot at photographs of President Trump and one of his predecessors, said David Bowdich, the deputy director of the F.B.I. A person familiar with the investigation identified the unnamed president as George W. Bush.\nMr. Alshamrani\u2019s weapon was lawfully purchased in Florida under an exemption that allows nonimmigrant visa holders to buy firearms if they have a valid hunting license or permit, officials said.\nLaw enforcement officials have continued to discuss Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s phones with Apple, they said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to weaken encryption, to be clear,\u201d Mr. Bowdich said at a news conference, noting that the issue has come up with thousands of devices that investigators want to see in other cases.\n\u201cWe talk about this on a daily basis,\u201d he said. Mr. Bowdich was the bureau\u2019s top agent overseeing the San Bernardino investigation and was part of the effort to push Apple to crack into the phone in that case.\nBut much has also changed for Apple in the years since Tim Cook, its chief executive, excoriated the Obama administration publicly and privately in 2014 for attacking strong encryption. Obama officials who were upset by Apple\u2019s stance on privacy, along with its decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and make its products almost exclusively in China,aired those grievances quietly.\nNow Apple is fighting the Trump administration, and Mr. Trump has shown far more willingness to publicly criticize companies and public figures. When he recentlyclaimed falselythat Apple had opened a manufacturing plant in Texas at his behest, the company remained silent rather than correct him.\nAt the same time, Apple has financially benefited more under Mr. Trump than under President Barack Obama. Itreaped a windfallfrom the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, and Mr. Trump said he mightshield Apple from the country\u2019s tariff war with China.\nHe had said last month that finding a way for law enforcement to gain access to encrypted technology was one of the Justice Department\u2019s \u201chighest priorities.\u201d\nMr. Alshamrani, who was killed at the scene of the attack, came to the United States in 2017 and soon started strike-fighter training in Florida. Investigators believe he may have been influenced by extremists as early as 2015.\nMr. Barr rejected reports that other Saudi trainees had known of and recorded video of the shooting. Mr. Alshamrani arrived at the scene by himself, and others in the area began recording the commotion only after he had opened fire, Mr. Barr said. They and other Saudi cadets cooperated with the inquiry, he added.\nJack Nicas contributed reporting from San Francisco."
