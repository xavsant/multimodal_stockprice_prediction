        "title": "Should Tech Stay or Go in Russia?",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nThe international business community is getting out of Russia. But tech companies including Google, Facebook and Apple have mostly been trying to stay open for business there.\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, energy giantsannouncedthey wereditching projectsto dig up oil and gas in the country. Automakerssaidthat they wouldstopmaking or sellingvehiclesin Russia. Banks have largelyshut Russia outof the global financial system. Formula 1 racecarswill not be zooming around Sochias planned, nor will British satellites hitch a rideon Russian rockets.\nGlobal tech companies have chosen to continue letting Russians download iPhone apps, surf YouTube and message on WhatsApp and Telegram. Russia\u2019s government, however, is tightening access to news, information and technologies in an effort to deny to its citizens the realities of its invasion of Ukraine. On Friday, Russia declared it wouldblock accessto Facebook, and late in the day reports circulated that Twitter and YouTube might also be blocked.\nThat is the choice global tech powers face 10 daysinto this war. Try to stay? Leave on principle, like others did? And what does it mean about their place in the world if it\u2019s not their choice at all?\nUkrainian leaders have pleaded with major digital services to treat Russia as a pariah and cut it off from 21st-century digital life. The companies, for the most part, had decided that Ukraine and global democracy were better served if they stayed on.\nNow, Vladimir V. Putin appears to have made the choice for some of them.\nThe fact that digital access is a tool of aggression in conflict shows that whether the tech companies, governments and the public like it or not, a handful of corporate digital powers are geopolitical players. When tanks begin to roll, it\u2019s a call to action for the United Nations, the heads of central banks \u2014 and the chief executives of Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft.\nOne of the earliest inklings of this power was the Arab Spring movements in the early 2010s. Activists in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya relied on U.S. social media sites and smartphones to share images of brutality by their governments against anti-regime protesters and to organize the logistics of street campaigns.\nAn Egyptian-born tech worker, Wael Ghonim, created a Facebook page to memorialize a man who had been beaten to death by Egyptian police. It bubbled into massive rallies in Tahrir Square in Cairo. One Tunisian man broadcast his location in the app Foursquare when he was held by government forces and feared that he would disappear.\nIt was the collective might of citizens, not Mark Zuckerberg, that was the instrument of political change. But the Arab Spring was a high point of tech optimism when it seemed as though the internet handed power to the people to disrupt corrupt institutions, and tech companies were on their side.\nIn the years since those citizen uprisings, tech companies have sometimesfailed to devote the resources and careto decisively stand up for people caught in conflict zones or trapped at the mercy of autocratic governments.\nIn 2018, the United Nationsconcludedthat Myanmar\u2019s military had turned Facebook into a propaganda tool for genocide. The company, now called Meta, acknowledged that it didn\u2019t do enough to prevent its site from being abused to incite violence. Authorities in Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Somalia have used Twitter and Facebook to smear or harass critics of their governments. \u201cFacebook broke democracy in many countries around the world,\u201d Maria Ressa, the Filipino journalist who wasawarded the Nobel Peace Prizelast year, has said.\nIn Russia, two-thirds or more of internet-connected people use YouTube, which is owned by Google, and WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Meta. Instagram and Telegram are common, too, according to the research firm Insider Intelligence.\nFacebook, Twitter and particularly YouTube have been important outlets for Russian government critics, including the jailed opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny. But last year, allies of Mr. Navalny criticized Apple and Google for complying with government demands totake down an appmeant to coordinate protest voting in Russian elections.\nAt the time, people close to those companies said that they had little choice but to comply with Russian authorities who claimed the app was illegal.\nLast month\u2019s invasion of Ukraine seemed to make it easier for tech companies to take sides. The international community has almost universally treated Russia as a hostile aggressor.\nAnd while in other conflict zones the internet companies have sometimes been caught with few staff who speak the language, most do have teams who are able to work in Ukrainian and Russian.\nFacebook and Twitter posted instructions in Ukrainian coaching locals to secure or deactivate their accounts to protect themselves from Russian threats. Google Maps stopped showing traffic information inside Ukraine out of concerns that it could create safety risks by showing where people were gathering.\nStill, some Ukrainian officials are urging foreign tech companies to do far more than that. They want companies to go dark in Russia. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s minister of digital transformation, has been using his Twitter account to shame Facebook, Google, Apple, Netflix and video game companiesto stop or limit their tech services in Russia. Doing so, Mr. Fedorov has said, might shake up Russians to rebel against their government\u2019s invasion.\n\u201cIn 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks\u201d and other weapons, he wrote in a letter to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\nApple and Microsoft in recent days said they would pause sales of their products in Russia. Cogent Communications, a U.S. company that provides essential plumbing for the internet, planned to sever relations with Russian customers, The Washington Postreportedon Friday. The decision could make it more difficult for Russians to go online without interruption.\nGoogle alsosuspended all advertisingin Russia after the country\u2019s internet regulator demanded that the company stop what it said were commercial messages that misinformed citizens about the invasion. Nick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs,tweetedon Friday that the company would try to restore its services from the Russian government\u2019s blockade so that Russians could \u201csafely and securely express themselves and organize for action.\u201d\nDavid Kaye, a law professor and a former United Nations special rapporteur on free expression, said that, at the moment, it would be a mistake for tech companies to completely quit Russia.\nMr. Kaye said that the harm ofpro-Kremlin propagandathat is circulating online in Russia was relatively minor compared with the productive ways that Russian citizens, activists andjournalistswere using YouTube, Telegram, Signal, Instagram and smartphones from Google and Apple.\nThese technologies help expose Russians to informationbeyond government propagandaand contradict the state narrative of the war. Ukrainians are also using social media toridicule Russian troops, rally foreigners to their cause and share safety information. Ukrainian volunteers have organized to flood Russian government websites with spam. For a time, Russians looking up Moscow landmarks in Google Maps were bombardedwith photos of bombed homes and injured civiliansin Ukraine.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m totally sympathetic with the idea that U.S. and international companies should be resisting engagement with Russia right now, there are some companies that are providing communications to people who really need it,\u201d Mr. Kaye said.\nNothing is simple in war, and Mr. Kaye quickly added, \u201cI realize there may be downsides to this and we need to think it through.\u201d\nIn backing U.S. or European governments against Russia, there\u2019s a risk that companies appear to be a puppet of the West. That might be counterproductive for Russian dissidents and journalists, and hurt tech companies\u2019 relationships in other countries.\nWhereas staying could put tech companies\u2019 employees in harm\u2019s way. Russia isamong the countriesthat are establishing so-called landing laws that make local employees of foreign companies more vulnerable to fines, arrests or other punishments if their companies don\u2019t comply with government demands. Ultimately it may be the Kremlin\u2019s choice, not Silicon Valley executives, whether digital service stay or go.\nFor decades, the U.S. technology industry has often described what it does as a more efficient and enlightened form of American capitalism \u2014 capped by Google\u2019s former informal mantra, \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d \u2014 said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of technology. And executives have used those qualities as a cudgel to argue for more hands off government regulation and taxation.\nTech companies secured special tax breaks for their research and development spending and for venture capital investments in start-ups. In the 1990s, an influential manifesto by John Perry Barlow declared that governments have no sovereignty over the internet. More recently, Zuckerberg has testified in Congress that putting guardrails on U.S. tech titans would provide an opening for Chinese technology to take over the world. How exactly that might happen was never explained.\nIn other words, the normal rules shouldn\u2019t apply to them. It\u2019s grating for tech companies to be treated as a special species of corporation. But as this invasion is showing, global information and communication services really aren\u2019t like cars or barrels of oil. War is making the argument better than any imperious C.E.O. ever could.\nCoders to the world:Bloomberg NewsandThe Wall Street Journalwrite that the Russian invasion threatens the lives and jobs of Ukraine\u2019s large technology work force whose software is used globally by popular video games, big banks and car manufacturers.(Subscriptions may be required.)\nThe good and bad of TikTok in war:The stream of war footage in the short video app has been an important way for outsiders to see and understand what is happening in Ukraine.

That will be an option if NBCUniversal completes a deal with the league to carry 18 games on its Peacock streaming service, some starting as early as 11:30 a.m. Eastern time and others just after noon, a person with knowledge of the deal said on Friday.\nThe games would be available exclusively to subscribers to Peacock, which costs up to $9.99 a month. The news wasreported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\nUnder the proposal, the games \u2014 likely to be played on the East Coast, given the early start time \u2014 would start airing on the streaming service in May. NBCUniversal and M.L.B. declined to comment.\nM.L.B. reached adeal with Apple this weekto stream Friday night games on Apple TV+ \u2014 another exclusive deal that is likely to buoy interest in a streaming service but could prove a challenge to baseball fans used to having access to games as part of their TV package.\nThe number of streaming services has exploded, and many are turning to live sports to attract subscribers. Peacock already has exclusive deals with WWE and for some Premier League soccer games. Even a small number of exclusive baseball games \u2014 the regular season has a total of 2,430 \u2014 would give Peacock a foothold and could help boost subscriptions. At the end of 2021, Peacock, which also has a free tier, had nine million paid subscribers and 24.5 million monthly active accounts.\nCurrently, major-league baseball games air on cable channels including ESPN, which is owned by Disney, and Turner Sports, which is owned by WarnerMedia.\nMajor League Baseball is just now recovering from a drawn-out labor battle that delayed the start of the 2022 season.On Thursday, the league and the players\u2019 union agreed to a new contract.

        "title": "Apps and Oranges: Behind Apple\u2019s \u2018Bullying\u2019 on Trademarks",
        "fulltext": "The company has opposed singer-songwriters, school districts and food blogs for trying to trademark names or logos featuring an apple \u2014 or a pear or pineapple.\nByRyan MacandKellen Browning\nRyan Mac reported from Los Angeles and Kellen Browning from San Francisco.\nWhen Genevieve St. John started a sex-and-life coaching blog in 2019, she designed a logo for the business of a neon green and pink apple, which was cut open to resemble female genitalia.\nNot long after applying to registerthe logowith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that year, Ms. St. John received an unpleasant surprise. Her request had been challenged \u2014 by Apple.\nIn a 246-pageopposition filing, lawyers for the iPhone maker wrote that Ms. St. John\u2019s logo was \u201clikely to tarnish Apple\u2019s reputation, which Apple has cultivated in part by endeavoring not to associate itself with overtly sexual or pornographic material.\u201d\nMs. St. John, 41, a human resources professional in Chandler, Ariz., was crestfallen. Without the money to hire a lawyer and take on the tech behemoth, she decided not to respond to Apple\u2019s challenge. That paved the way for a default judgment in favor of the electronics giant.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even making money off it,\u201d Ms. St. John said of her blog, which she has put on hiatus. \u201cBut it\u2019s Apple, and I\u2019m not going to argue with them because I don\u2019t have a million dollars.\u201d\nMs. St. John is one of dozens of entrepreneurs, small businesses and corporations that Apple has gone after in recent years for applying to trademark names with the word \u201capple\u201d or logos of stemmed fruit. Between 2019 and last year, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, worth$2.6 trillion, filed 215 trademark oppositions to defend its logo, name or product titles, according to theTech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog. That\u2019s more than the estimated 136 trademark oppositions that Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google collectively filed in the same period, the group said.\nApple is a more common word than corporate names like Microsoft or Google, and the high rate stems partly from that. Many copycats, particularly in China, have also tried drafting off Apple\u2019s name or logo in the tech and entertainment industries to make a buck.\nBut Apple has frequently targeted entities that have nothing to do with tech or that are infinitesimal in size. It has even set its sights on logos that involve other fruits, like oranges and pears.\nIts quarries have included an Indian food blog, the Energy Department, a Wisconsin public school district and Mattel, which makes the hit card game Apples to Apples. Apple also objected to anorange logoused by a curbside pickup start-up named Citrus. Last year, it settled a dispute with ameal planning app called Prepearafter the app\u2019s creator agreed to change a leaf onits pear logoto make it look less like Apple\u2019s.\nThe scale of the company\u2019s campaign amounts to \u201cbullying tactics, and they are unnecessary for Apple to protect the public from confusion,\u201d said Christine Farley, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law.\nCitrus; the Energy Department; Super Healthy Kids, the company behind Prepear; and the Patent and Trademark Office declined to comment. Mattel did not respond to requests for comment.\nJosh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, said the law \u201crequires\u201d that the company protect its trademarks by filing oppositions with the Patent and Trademark Office if there are concerns with new trademark applications.\n\u201cWhen we see applications that are overly broad or could be confusing to our customers, our first step is always to reach out and try to resolve these quickly and amicably,\u201d he said. \u201cLegal action is always our last resort.\u201d\nApple files trademark oppositions against entities that have already received logo or name approval from the Patent and Trademark Office. In those oppositions, the company hasarguedthat \u201cApple marks are so famous and instantly recognizable\u201d that other trademarks will weaken the strength of its brand or cause the \u201cordinary consumer to believe that applicant is related to, affiliated with or endorsed by Apple.\u201d\nSome of those targeted said that while they were convinced their trademarks did not infringe upon Apple\u2019s domain, they could not show the challenges were frivolous because they did not have the resources to fight the company in front of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Between 2019 and 2021, 37 entities, or about 17 percent of those that Apple or its subsidiary Beats Electronics opposed, withdrew their trademark applications. Another 127 individuals or organizations, or 59 percent, did not reply to challenges and defaulted, according to data from the Tech Transparency Project.\nStephanie Carlisi, an independent singer-songwriter, said she was shocked when Apple took issue withthe trademarkof her stage name, Franki Pineapple, in 2020. Infilings, Apple acknowledged that an apple and pineapple were different, but said they were \u201cboth the names of fruits, and thus convey a similar commercial impression.\u201d The company also considered objecting to Ms. Carlisi\u2019s logo, an exploding pineapple grenade, according to documents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even an apple,\u201d said Ms. Carlisi, 46, who had just begun releasing music and has seven monthly listeners on Spotify. \u201cYou\u2019re telling people that they cannot appropriate fruit or anything that has this connection to Apple, which is this juggernaut company.\u201d\nFounded in 1974, the company known originally as Apple Computer was not always so litigious. Before 2000, it filed just a handful of trademark oppositions each year, peaking at nine in 1989, according to the Tech Transparency Project. At leastone of those oppositionswas to an electronics retailer that sold computer parts under the name \u201cPineapple.\u201d\nIn those years, Apple Computer was better known as a defendant in trademark cases. In 1978, Apple Corps, the holding company founded by the Beatles, sued Apple Computer for trademark infringement, the first salvo in a series of legal disputes between the two companies over the ensuingdecades. In 2007, thetwo Apples finally agreedto give the Silicon Valley company all of the trademarks related to \u201cApple.\u201d\nBy then, Apple, which had dropped \u201cComputer\u201d from its name, was filing dozens of trademark oppositions annually.\nAs Apple grew, its legal team most likely wanted to prevent the brand\u2019s dilution, said Barton Beebe, a New York University Law School professor. In intellectual property theory, the legal argument isn\u2019t that someone would be confused by two different trademarks, but rather that granting a new one would reduce the value of a household logo or name, he said.\n\u201cDilution is death by a thousand cuts, and you\u2019ve got to prevent the first cut,\u201d Mr. Beebe said. \u201cThat\u2019s the argument to judges.\u201d\nApple has since created a template for challenging trademark applications, said Ashley Dobbs, a University of Richmond law professor. That\u2019s evident in a comparison of its responses to two applicants, where it used cookie-cutter opposition language.\nOne response was to theAppleton Area School District, a 16,000-student public education system in Appleton, Wis., which has a logo of three interlocked apples. The other was toBig Apple Curry,a New York City Indian cooking blog, over its name. In Apple\u2019s filings against them, whole sections were copied word for word to establish the company\u2019s brand value \u2014 \u201can estimated valuation of $206 billion\u201d by Forbes in 2019 \u2014 and its \u201cextraordinary level of fame and consumer recognition.\u201d\nRepresentatives for the school district and Big Apple Curry, which both removed their applications, declined to comment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cost efficiency going after multiple people with the same argument,\u201d Ms. Dobbs said. She added that Apple had outpaced other companies \u2014 such as Disney and Warner Bros. \u2014 that have been litigious about intellectual property.\nSometimes Apple will ask the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board for extensions to file against a new trademark and then contact that entrepreneur or business so it alters its application. Lacye Brown, 38, an artist from Atlanta who created a cartoon of a fictional witch doctor named Dr. Apples, said it was \u201cdevastating\u201d when Apple submitted paperwork to ask for more time to potentially challenge her trademark application in 2020. She narrowed her trademark request after discussions with Apple\u2019s lawyers, who never filed an official opposition.\nBut last year, Apple took issue when Ms. Browntried to trademarkher podcast, \u201cTalk About Apples,\u201d which was based on her Dr. Apples character. In itsopposition, the company argued that people could confuse her podcast with its podcast service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an African American witch doctor talking about fictional fantasy and monsters and ghouls,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cNo way anyone has ever affiliated me with Apple.\u201d She nonetheless retracted her podcast\u2019s trademark application.\nIn 2019, Dr. Surya Reddy applied to trademark thelogo and nameof Apple Urgent Care, which runs clinics in California\u2019s Riverside County. Appleobjected, noting that his logo, like its own, included an apple with a piece missing and an \u201cangled-detached leaf.\u201d\nDr. Reddy said he thought Apple\u2019s case was ridiculous because it is not a medical care provider. But he did not have the money to test that theory and dropped his application.\n\u201cI\u2019m a small company,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they put in an objection, you feel so little.\u201d\nMs. Carlisi, though, responded to Apple in court and won a concession. The company agreed to stop pursuing its opposition if sheincluded a disclaimeron her trademark application noting that Franki Pineapple \u2014 a nod to her late father, Franki, and the fruit, sometimes thought of as a rebellious, feminist symbol \u2014 was not her real name.\nWhile the legal escalation cost her about $10,000, Ms. Carlisi got some inspiration out of it. She said herdebut single, which is about sticking it to the man and uses a well-known expletive, was inspired by her battle with Apple."

        "title": "E.U. Takes Aim at Big Tech\u2019s Power With Landmark Digital Act",
        "fulltext": "G\u00d6TTINGEN, Germany \u2014 The European Union agreed on Thursday to one of the world\u2019s most far-reaching laws to address the power of the biggest tech companies, potentially reshaping app stores, online advertising, e-commerce, messaging services and other everyday digital tools.\nThe law, called the Digital Markets Act, is the most sweeping piece of digital policy since thebloc puttheworld\u2019s toughest rules to protect people\u2019s online datainto effect in 2018. The legislation is aimed at stopping the largest tech platforms from using their interlocking services and considerable resources to box in users and squash emerging rivals, creating room for new entrants and fostering more competition.\nWhat that means practically is that companies like Google will no longer be able to collect data from different services to offer targeted ads without users\u2019 consent and that Apple may have to allow alternatives to its App Store on iPhones and iPads. Violators of the law, which will take effect as early as later this year, could face penalties of up to 20 percent of their global revenue \u2014 which could reach into the tens of billions of dollars \u2014 for repeat offenses.\nThe Digital Markets Act is part of a one-two punch by European regulators. As early as next month, the European Union is expected to reach an agreement on a law that would force social media companies such as Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to police their platforms more aggressively.\nWith these actions, Europe is cementing its leadership as the most assertive regulator of tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft. European standards are often adopted worldwide, and the latest legislation further raises the bar by potentially bringing the companies under anew era of oversight\u2014 just like health care, transportation and banking industries.\n\u201cFaced with big online platforms behaving like they were \u2018too big to care,\u2019 Europe has put its foot down,\u201d said Thierry Breton, one of the top digital officials in the European Commission. \u201cWe are putting an end to the so-called Wild West dominating our information space. A new framework that can become a reference for democracies worldwide.\u201d\nOn Thursday, representatives from the European Parliament and European Council hammered out the last specifics of the law in Brussels. The agreement followed about 16 months of talks \u2014 a speedy pace for the E.U. bureaucracy \u2014 and sets the stage for a final vote in Parliament and among representatives from the 27 countries in the union. That approval is viewed as a formality.\nEurope\u2019s moves contrast with the lack of activity in the United States. While Republicans and Democrats have held several high-profile congressional hearings toscrutinize Meta, Twitter and others in recent years, and U.S. regulators have filed antitrust cases againstGoogleandMeta, no new federal laws have been passed to address what many see as the tech companies\u2019 unchecked power.\nEurope\u2019s new rules could offer a preview of what\u2019s to come elsewhere in the world. The region\u2019s online privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts the online collection and sharing of personal data, has served as a model in countries from Japan to Brazil.\nThe path of the Digital Markets Act faced hurdles. Policymakers dealt with what watchdogs said was one of thefiercest lobbying effortsever seen in Brussels as industry groups tried to water down the new law. They also brushed aside concerns raised by the Biden administration that the rules unfairly targeted American companies.\nQuestions remain about how the new law will work in practice. Companies are expected to look for ways to diminish its impact through the courts. And regulators will need new funding to pay for their expanded oversight responsibilities, when budgets are under strain from the pandemic.\n\u201cThe pressure will be intense to show results, and fast,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a veteran antitrust lawyer in Brussels who has represented Amazon, Microsoft and Spotify.\nTech industry groups criticized the new law as biased against American companies and predicted it would harm innovation in Europe.\n\u201cThis bill was written to target U.S. tech companies, and its impact will fall on American workers,\u201d said Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of the Chamber of Progress, a trade group in Washington. \u201cEuropean regulations that single out our tech sector threaten American jobs \u2014 not just in Silicon Valley, but in cities from Pittsburgh to Birmingham.\u201d\nThe Digital Markets Act will apply to so-called gatekeeper platforms, which are defined by factors including a market value of more than 75 billion euros, or about $83 billion. The group includes Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube; Amazon; Apple; Microsoft; and Meta.\nSpecifics of the law read like a wish list for rivals of the biggest companies.\nApple and Google, which make the operating systems that run on nearly every smartphone, would be required to loosen their grip. Apple will have to allow alternatives to its App Store for downloading apps, a change the company has warned could harm security. The law will also let companies such as Spotify and Epic Games use payment methods other than Apple\u2019s in the App Store, which charges a 30 percent commission.\nAmazon will be barred from using data collected from outside sellers on its services so that it could offer competing products, a practice that is the subject of aseparate E.U. antitrust investigation.\nThe law will result in major changes for messaging apps. WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, could be required to offer a way for users of rival services like Signal or Telegram to send and receive messages to somebody using WhatsApp. Those rival services would have the option to make their products interoperable with WhatsApp.\nThe largest sellers of online advertising, Meta and Google, will see new limits for offering targeted ads without consent.

It is unclear whether the measures have enough support to pass the full House and Senate.\nEuropean regulators are now faced with enforcing the new law. G.D.P.R. has been criticized for lack of enforcement.\nThe European Commission, the executive branch of the bloc, will also have to hire scores of new employees to investigate the tech companies.

        "title": "Brazil Blocks Telegram Over Disinformation Concerns",
        "fulltext": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court banned the fast-growing messaging app Telegram in the country on Friday, taking a drastic measure that showed the court plans to aggressively fight disinformation ahead of this year\u2019s presidential elections.\nAlexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court judge, said he was blocking Telegram because the app had not fully responded to previous orders to remove the accounts of a prominent supporter of President Jair Bolsonaro. That supporter is being investigated for spreading disinformation and threatening Supreme Court judges.\nMr. de Moraes ordered internet and cell-service providers to make Telegram unusable in the country and directed Apple and Google to remove the app from their mobile app stores. He gave the companies five days to comply.\nMr. de Moraes has emerged as one of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s biggest political opponents, overseeing a number of investigations and issuing court orders that target the president, his allies and his political strategy. Mr. Bolsonaro has struck back with sharp criticism of the judge, even vowing at a major political rally last year that he would not comply with his rulings.\nWhile authoritarian countries like China regularly clamp down on internet platforms, blocking such a popular app across an entire country is highly unusual in a democracy like Brazil\u2019s. But some authorities in Brazil, most notably the Supreme Court, have vowed to hold internet companies responsible for disinformation over concerns that they could influence October\u2019s presidential elections.\nIn a statement late Friday, Pavel Durov, Telegram\u2019s chief executive, said his company didn\u2019t always respond to the Brazilian Supreme Court because Telegram missed the court\u2019s emails.\n\u201cI apologize to the Brazilian Supreme Court for our negligence. We definitely could have done a better job,\u201d he said.\nMr. Durov asked the court to delay the ban \u201cto allow us to remedy the situation by appointing a representative in Brazil and setting up a framework to react to future pressing issues like this in an expedited manner.\u201d\nIn the order on Friday, Mr. de Moraes said he sent emails directly to Mr. Durov.\nTelegram has become a hotbed of misinformation across the world, in part because it removes less content on its app than other social networks and includes features that make it easy to spread information far and fast.\nWhile WhatsApp, a main Telegram competitor, has made changes to limit the spread of misinformation \u2014 like limiting the size of group chats and the number of times a message can be forwarded \u2014 Telegram allows users to broadcast messages to thousands of people at once.\n\u201cIf Facebook is the heroin of disinformation, Telegram is the fentanyl,\u201d said Sarah Oates, a University of Maryland professor who studies internet platforms.\nTelegram\u2019s hands-off approach has made the app particularly popular with right-wing users across the world who complain that the more mainstream social networks censor their views. In Brazil, Mr. Bolsonaro has urged his supporters to use Telegram instead of other social networks, and he has amassed nearly 1.1 million followers on the app. His top competitor in the 2020 presidential race, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has less than 50,000.\nTelegram\u2019s popularity on Brazil\u2019s right has made it one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing messaging apps. Since 2014, Telegram has been downloaded nearly 85 million times in Brazil, with 29 percent of those installations coming last year, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. By comparison, WhatsApp, the dominant app in Brazil, has been downloaded 677 million times in the country.\nAmid growing concern over the spread of disinformation on social media, governments are increasingly grappling with how to regulate platforms, particularly in democracies where politicians are also eager to protect freedom of expression. The United States has taken a mostly hands-off approach. While former President Donald J. Trump tried to ban the Chinese apps WeChat and TikTok over national security concerns, the Biden administration later reversed the policy. China and Russia, meanwhile, have blocked apps like Facebook and Instagram.\nBanning an app across an entire country is not technologically simple. Removing it from the Apple and Google app stores prevents additional people from downloading it, but the millions of people who already have the app \u2014 or who access it from a web browser \u2014 can continue to use the service.\nBrazil\u2019s approach is notable for how it seeks to force companies that provide the backbone of the internet to block Telegram\u2019s web traffic. The policy even covers people who try to use software to get around the ban by routing their web traffic through other countries. Mr. de Moraes said anyone caught doing so would face a $20,000 fine.\nThe policy \u201cis trying to attack from several fronts, so maybe it will be feasible,\u201d said Lucas Lago, a Brazilian software researcher.\nWhile misinformation is a tremendous concern on the platform, many major news outlets use Telegram to deliver content, including The New York Times.\nSupporters of Mr. Bolsonaro immediately criticized the ban. Carla Zambelli, a Brazilian congresswoman and a longtime supporter of the president, said on Twitter that Telegram was \u201cthe only current tool in which we have freedom of expression\u201d and called Mr. de Moraes a \u201ctyrant.\u201d\nSenator Humberto Costa, a left-wing critic of Mr. Bolsonaro, said that \u201cthe Fake News Stock Market has plummeted. The Bolsonaros lost part of their heritage of lies.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. de Moraes did not respond to requests for comment. Apple and Google declined to comment.\nMs. Oates, the University of Maryland professor, said that Telegram had become well-known for ignoring government orders and requests for data. Yet she added that because Telegram was so overwhelmingly popular with the right wing in Brazil, the order could be perceived as a partisan move.\n\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s understandable to want to regulate your media space, and platforms like this exacerbate existing problems,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, it can be perceived as unfair because this targets a particular group of people.\u201d\nAndr\u00e9 Spigariolcontributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, and Leonardo Coelho from Rio de Janeiro."

        "fulltext": "Googlesaid on Wednesdaythat it would allow some apps, such as Spotify, to offer their own billing system within the Google Play store as part of a pilot program.\nThe move would allow those apps to bypass Google\u2019s own payment system and the main commissions that it charges. The change comes as Google and Apple, the two biggest app store operators, face complaints from regulators and developers that they are abusing their dominance in mobile software to force companies to use their proprietary billing methods.\nThe test program will start with music streaming service Spotify, a vocal critic of the hefty commissions charged by Google and Apple. Spotify will present its own billing options on devices running Google\u2019s Android software alongside the payment system offered by the Google Play store.\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone and the first on any major app store,\u201d Sameer Samat, a Google vice president who oversees the Google Play store, wrote in the blog post.\nIn itsown blog postannouncing a \u201cmultiyear agreement,\u201d Spotify said it had long supported \u201cplatform fairness and expanded payment options\u201d and that it expected the billing choice to become available later this year. In 2019, the companyfiled a complaintwith European regulators against Apple, arguing that the company used its dominance in the app store to charge a \u201ctax\u201d to hurt companies that compete against its services, including Apple Music.\nGoogle said it would build on its experience of offering users choice in billing systems in South Korea, whichpassed a law last yearbanning app stores from forcing developers to use their proprietary billing systems.\nThe test program is likely to whittle away at the lucrative commissions that Google has charged app developers for money made on its platform. For years, Google and Apple took a 30 percent commission for digital goods or subscriptions sold on their app stores. As that has led more recently to an uproar from developers and scrutiny from regulators, Google and Apple have lowered their commissions for subscriptions and smaller developers.\nDan Jackson, a Google spokesman, said the company would receive a \u201cservice fee\u201d even if users do not use its billing system, as it already doesin South Korea, though he later clarified that there was a possibility of a deal that did not include such fees. He noted that the pilot had just begun and that Google planned to work with Spotify and other partners to hash out the specifics.\nLast year, as part of a legal settlement,Apple saidit would allow a set of apps, which provide digital media like books, newspapers, music and video, to steer customers to their own websites to pay for subscriptions."

        "fulltext": "A film from Apple, \u201cCODA,\u201d this week became the first movie from a streaming service towin the Oscar for best picture. The milestone means that theHollywood establishment isfinally accepting movies and TV series that we watch over internet connections as legitimate entertainment.\nBut wait: Why does Apple have a streaming video service at all? And what are the effects on us when oodles of corporate money warp the market for conveniences that we love? (I posed similar questions last yearabout Amazon.)\nAn Oscar is lovely, but success for Apple is largely defined by making more profits each year. Sorry, those are the rules of capitalism. It\u2019s difficult to say if streaming video contributes to that goal, or if it\u2019s an expensive distraction for Apple.\nSpending gobs of money in sometimes reckless ways in pursuit of potential future profits is an age-old business strategy. Sometimes it works. Other times it leads to MoviePass, which burned through billions of dollars selling nearly unlimited movie theater passes for $10 a month,and then went bust.\nEither way, companies throwing money aroundcan be awesome for us, at least for awhile. It has most likely brought us cheaper and better streaming video services than we might have otherwise, low-cost Uber rides and cheap gasoline. Yes, I will make a connection between cheap gas and streaming video. Stick with me.\nProducts that result from sometimes irrational spending in the short term can be both glorious for us, and a dangerous mirage if and when the money dries up.\nSome background: Apple in 2019 started a streaming video service called Apple TV+. Some people who buy a new Apple device get the service freefor three months; otherwise Apple charges a $4.99 monthly fee in the U.S. That\u2019s about one-third of the cost of streaming subscriptions from Netflix and HBO Max, whichhave more stuffto watch.\nApple rarely explains why it does anything, and the company hasn\u2019t been clear about its goals for TV+. But the conventional wisdom is that streaming video is part of its strategy to keep Apple device owners loyaland entice them to spend a bit moremoney.\nHas this justified the expense and energy that Apple devotes to streaming video? Shrug. It\u2019s also unclear if Amazon\u2019s streaming video service has been a successful way to lure and keep Prime members.\nMaybe running a Hollywood entertainment empire is just fun. Apple and Amazon are so successful that they can squander some money to figure out if they\u2019ll become even richer someday by offering streaming video. But it\u2019s worth keeping in mind the potential disruption to products and services that we like when companies decide that their lavish spending is no longer a smart bet.\nUber rides were mostly cheap until about 2020, because the company had investor money to go after lots of riders even if trips didn\u2019t turn a profit. Similar financial recklessness is now subsidizing city dwellers who order Doritos and milkdelivered to their doors within 15 minutes. In the 2010s, streams of investor cashenabled U.S. energy companiesto use new fracking methods to dig oil and gas out of the ground.\nIn all those cases, money that didn\u2019t need to be spent entirely sensibly reshaped our world. We got cheaper gas and Uber rides and convenience services that couldn\u2019t have existed without investors throwing money around and hoping it would pay off in the future. Irrational money also built Netflix into an entertainment titan, and now Amazon and Apple are throwing their cash around, too.\nWe probably get better and less expensive streaming services than we would if there were fewer companies selling entertainment subscriptions. People involved in making entertainment have more potential buyers for their work. Nice.\nBut what happens if the money must suddenly be tied more directly to earning profits? Netflix needed investors to subsidize its service for a long time, and now the company is on healthy financial footing. But Uber remains unprofitable and rides aren\u2019t cheap anymore. Frackers burned so much of their investors\u2019 money recklessly that they\u2019re nowwary of digging for more oil and gaseven in an energy crisis, because their investors don\u2019t trust them anymore.\nMaybe Apple and Amazon make it big in streaming video. But what if one of those companies decides it\u2019s no longer willing to drop billions of dollars on entertainment that doesn\u2019t help its bottom line? Would Netflix cost $40 a month because there\u2019s less competition? Would script writers wind up like Pennsylvania homeowners who relied on royalties from shale drilling thathave dried up?\nWe could simply enjoy the money being spent to entertain us while it lasts. But know that it\u2019s possible the oodles of money will end, and it might be painful for the people who make entertainment and those of us who watch it.\nUber and taxis unite!Imagine if Duke and University of North Carolina basketball fans held hands and watched the Final Four together. (For non-sports people: No. Those fans hate one another.) That\u2019s something like what\u2019s happening now as Uber and taxi agencies in multiple cities start to let people order Uber or taxi rides from the Uber app. My colleague Kellen Browning reports onone such agreement that\u2019s coming in San Francisco.\nThis company\u2019s technology enabled Russian surveillance:Internal documents reviewed by my colleagues detail the work by the telecom equipment company Nokia thatplayed a key role in Russia\u2019s system for spying on its citizens and dissidents. It\u2019s a fascinating article that made me reflect on the role of technology that can be used in invasive ways and the responsibility of the companies that make it.\nFake LinkedIn people:Disinformation researchers identifiedmore than 1,000 LinkedIn accountsusing profile photos that were not real people but instead images generated by computers. NPR found that this was, essentially, an aggressive tactic by sales people.\nThis octopus is so beautiful.\nWe want to hear from you.
