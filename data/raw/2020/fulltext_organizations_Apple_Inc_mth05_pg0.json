        "title": "F.B.I. Finds Links Between Pensacola Gunman and Al Qaeda",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The gunman in last year\u2019s deadly shooting at a military base in Florida was regularly in touch with Al Qaeda for years, including the night before the attack, the country\u2019s top law enforcement officials said on Monday. They also accused Apple of costing them valuable time by refusing to help unlock the gunman\u2019s phone.\nThe F.B.I. found that the gunman, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, a Saudi Air Force cadet training with the American military in Pensacola, had communicated with leaders of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and had joined the Saudi military to carry out a \u201cspecial operation,\u201d Attorney General William P. Barr said at a news conference.\nThe F.B.I. recently bypassed the security features on at least one of Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s two iPhones to discover his Qaeda links. Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said the bureau had \u201ceffectively no help from Apple,\u201d but he would not say how investigators obtained access to the phone.\nThe evidence found on Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s phone showed that the Pensacola attack was \u201cthe brutal culmination of years of planning and preparation,\u201d Mr. Wray said.\nThe investigation has served as the latest skirmish ina fightbetween the Justice Department and Apple pitting personal privacy against public safety. Apple stopped routinely allowing law enforcement officials into phones in 2014 as it beefed up encryption. It has argued that data privacy is a human rights issue and that if it were to develop a way to allow the American government into its phones, hackers or foreign governments like China could exploit the same tool.\nBut law enforcement officials have said that Apple is creating a haven for criminals. The company\u2019s defiance in the Pensacola shooting allowed any possible co-conspirators to fabricate and compare stories, destroy evidence and disappear, Mr. Wray said.\n\u201cIt was clear at the time that the phones were likely to contain very important information,\u201d Mr. Barr said, adding that President Trump had also asked Apple for help.\nApple pushed back on Monday, saying that it complied with investigators immediately after the shooting by giving the F.B.I. access to Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s online storage accounts and providing continuing support to investigators.\n\u201cThe false claims made about our company are an excuse to weaken encryption and other security measures that protect millions of users and our national security,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nLaw enforcement officials would not say that Al Qaeda directed Mr. Alshamrani to carry out the shooting, which killed three sailors. But they emphasized his communications with Qaeda leaders, saying they proved that his relationship with the group went beyond simply being inspired to act based on watching YouTube videos or reading extremist propaganda.\nMr. Alshamrani\u2019s radicalization path began as far back as 2015, and he had associated with Qaeda operatives since, Mr. Wray said. He called the gunman \u201cmeticulous\u201d in planning his attack. Mr. Alshamrani took videos of a classroom building and wrote a final will and saved it in his phone, Mr. Wray said.\nThree weeks after the shooting, Qassim al-Rimi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,said that his group directed Mr. Alshamranito commit the murders in Pensacola. Mr. al-Rimi had a copy of Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s will and messages that seemed to show the gunman had been in contact with the Yemen-based group.\nSoon after the recorded message was released, the United States confirmed that it hadkilled Mr. al-Rimi in a drone attack, a major blow to one of Al Qaeda\u2019s last, vibrant branches.\nMr. Wray said that after the bureau gained access to the phone, it provided valuable information to the intelligence community about Abdullah al-Maliki, a Qaeda operative, who was one of the associates of Mr. Alshamrani. The two apparently had contact while Mr. Alshamrani was in the United States.\nA senior U.S. official said Mr. al-Maliki was killed in a C.I.A. drone strike in Yemen in the past week or so. He was in the command structure for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and was an important, emerging communications specialist, pushing out Al Qaeda\u2019s message not just in Yemen but globally, the official said.\nMr. Barr said the counterterrorism operation had degraded the capabilities of Al Qaeda in Yemen.\nMr. Alshamrani paused to fire at his iPhone during a firefight with security officers and he was found with a second, badly damaged phone that he had destroyed, leading investigators to conclude that the devices held important data and to seek court orders authorizing them to search the phones.\nIn January, when Mr. Barr designated the shooting an act of terrorism, Apple refused a Justice Department requestto help open the iPhones, prompting speculation that the government would seek another court order to force the company to comply.\nThe department said that it sought Apple\u2019s help in opening the phones only after other agencies and third-party technology vendors had failed, and it accused the company of slowing the investigation and allowing leads to go cold.\n\u201cFinally getting our hands on the evidence Alshamrani tried to keep from us is great,\u201d Mr. Wray said. \u201cBut we really needed it months ago, back in December, when the court issued its warrants.\u201d\nThe standoff between federal law enforcement officials and Apple last came to a head over the 2015 mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people. Eventually, investigatorsfound a wayto unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers without Apple\u2019s help.\nThe debate centers on when a technology company should be expected to help the government obtain information from encrypted messaging apps that is accessible only through bypassing the password and other security features. Apple routinely gives law enforcement lawful access to information that its users store in their iCloud accounts.\nInvestigators have long used software to break into the devices by guessing their passcodes. Security researchers say that the technology to do so is well established but thatthe process takes time. A six-number passcode takes on average about 11 hours to guess.\nBoth sides were likely to hold up the Pensacola case as evidence of their arguments. Apple has said law enforcement does not need its help to build cases, and the company could argue that the F.B.I.\u2019s entry into one of Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s phones shows that. Law enforcement has said that Apple\u2019s refusal to help has hamstrung countless investigations, and Mr. Barr emphasized that the F.B.I.\u2019s unlocking of Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s phone was not a \u201cscalable solution.\u201d\nIndications have emerged that Apple\u2019s security has grown more vulnerable. Last week, Zerodium, a company that acquires and sells weaknesses in smartphone encryption to American agencies to hack into the devices, announced that it had a surplus of such exploits for Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system.\nThe firm\u2019s claims undermine the Justice Department\u2019s and the F.B.I.\u2019s assertions that Apple\u2019s security is preventing lawful interception of data collection, especially on older-model phones. Mr. Alshamrani had an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 5.\nMr. Barr has maintained one of the department\u2019s \u201chighest priorities\u201d is to find a way to get technology companies to help law enforcement gain lawful access to encrypted technology.\n\u201cPrivacy and public safety are not mutually exclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are confident that technology companies are capable of building secure products that protect user information and, at the same time, allow for law enforcement access when permitted by a judge.\u201d\nMr. Wray and Mr. Barr appeared in lock step during the news conference. For Mr. Barr, it provided a platform to publicly support Mr. Wray, whom Mr. Trumphas complained about privatelyover the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation.\nWhile the F.B.I. has spent the past few years primarily trying to thwart international terrorism inspired by the Islamic State, Mr. Wraytold lawmakers last yearthat Al Qaeda still wants to conduct \u201clarge-scale, spectacular attacks,\u201d but is \u201clikely to focus on building its international affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks.\u201d\nAmerican counterterrorism efforts have diminished the capabilities of Al Qaeda in Yemen and the Pakistan-Afghanistan region, but the Pensacola shooting still shows the group\u2019s ideology can inspire attacks. In 2016, authoritieswarned of a vague Qaeda threat.\nEven though the casualty count in Pensacola was relatively low by Qaeda standards, simply \u201cpulling off a successful attack on U.S. soil can provide Al Qaeda and its affiliates with a momentum boost and allow the group bragging rights over the Islamic State, which is important in terms of recruitment, prestige and propaganda,\u201d Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, a New York-based research organization, said in an email on Monday.\n\u201cThis illustrates just how dangerous one operative can be,\u201d Mr. Wray said.\nEven though Mr. Alshamrani was thought to have operated alone, the government expelled 21 other Saudi students who were training with the American military, some of whom had links to extremist movements. After announcing the expulsions, Mr. Barr said that the Saudi government had cooperated with the investigation.\nSaudi Arabia has a complicated relationship with Yemen, where it has been embroiled in a lethal, yearslong military battle to end Iranian influence there. Amid the airstrikes, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have seized territory and carried out their own deadly attacks.\nMr. Alshamrani\u2019s ability to train on the base as part of the U.S. military raises a host of thorny issues, including how the Defense Department screens potential recruits from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Barr said the screening and vetting process in this case was insufficient, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper pledged in a statement to keep up additional safeguards that the Pentagon had already installed.\nAfter the shooting, the Defense Department ordered a stop to all international military student training at American installations. In January, Mr. Esper imposed tighter restrictions on the use of firearms and access to government facilities for international military students. He approved the continuous monitoring of international students while they are enrolled in U.S.-based training programs.\nBetween tighter security measures after the shooting and then the coronavirus pandemic, the base in Pensacola has felt different since the shooting, said Jeff Bergosh, a commissioner in Escambia County, where Pensacola is. He said he was heartened to hear investigators had managed to unlock Mr. Alshamrani\u2019s cellphone.\nMr. Bergosh said he hoped policymakers would continue to evaluate foreign military training programs. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the one thing that comes of this, the one silver lining,\u201d he said.\nReporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei from Miami, Nicole Perlroth and Jack Nicas from San Francisco, and Eric Schmitt from Washington."

        "title": "The Immunity of the Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "If power tends to corrupt, andabsolute power corrupts absolutely, how can we best describe the kind of power Big Tech will wield when the coronavirus crisis is over?\nHow about this: The tech giants could haveallthe power and absolutely none of the accountability \u2014 at least all the power that will truly matter.\nThis is the conclusion that many are coming to as the post-pandemic future begins to come into focus. Wall Street sure is signaling that the power lies with tech companies, vaulting the stock of Amazon to close to $2,400 a share earlier this week, from $1,838 at the end of January. While the price fell on Friday to $2,286 a share, after Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he would spend future profits on the coronavirus response, that still gives the company a value of $1.14 trillion.\nAnd all the other Big Tech stocks, which were hit in the first weeks of the pandemic, also are on an upward march to the top of the market-cap heap. Microsoft at $1.32 trillion. Apple at $1.26 trillion. Alphabet at $900 billion. And Facebook at $577 billion.This group now makes up just over 20 percent of the S.&P. 500, which is a flashing yellow signal of what is to come.\nThat is to say, we live in a country in which the very big tech firms will be the very big winners in the economy of the future, which still does not look like it will be so pretty for most people and many companies, too.\nIn a column about a month ago, Iwrote about a problematic trendthat would develop after the world had been turned upside down by the pandemic. \u201cThere will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,\u201d I wrote about tech\u2019s leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. \u201cThis is obviously not a good thing in the long run.\u201d\nBut even if it is good that companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple have become an essential part of making it easier to shelter in place or to track the virus \u2014 thanks a bunch for food delivery, contact-tracing apps and lots of funny memes \u2014 there\u2019s much that\u2019s not good.\nIt\u2019s not good that we have set up an epic system of have and have-nots that could become devastating for innovative ideas and start-ups trying to get off the ground. Not good because too much of our data is in the hands of fewer. Not good because these fewer are largely unaccountable to those they serve and hard to control by governments that are elected by the people.\nThese are themes that I have repeated over and over since I started this column two years ago \u2014 trying to drill down on what unlimited power, Midas-like financial might, minimal oversight and very few actual consequences might mean for the rest of us. Contrary to some of the pushback I get when I say what I consider the obvious, I neither hate tech nor think most people who work in tech are bad people.\nBut when this crisis is over, I can say that we most certainly should fear Big Tech more because these companies will be freer than ever, with many fewer strictures on them from regulators and politicians. The effort to rein in tech companies had been building decent momentum before coronavirus outbreak, but it will be harder when focus needs to be on building up rather than breaking apart.\nNow, as we turn to the healthy companies to help us revive the economy, it could be that the only ones with real immunity are the tech giants. In this way, Covid-19 has accelerated their rise and tightened their grip on our lives. And this consolidation of power, combined with Big Tech\u2019s control of data, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, media, advertising, retail and even autonomous tech, is daunting.\nWhich is why politicians like Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, have become very strange bedfellows in calling for more scrutiny of Big Tech of late. And House lawmakers on Friday were calling for Mr. Bezos to testify at a hearing on antitrust violations or face a subpoena. But the real actions the government takes are likely to feel ever limper.\nWitness the $5 billion settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook that was approved by a judge this week. When it was announced last year,I called it a \u201cparking ticket.\u201dToday, it is like losing a dime for Facebook.\nThe judge, Timothy J. Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, noted the government\u2019s complaints that Facebook flouted the terms of a previous consent decree with the F.T.C. and called such behavior \u201cunscrupulous,\u201d even as he let the company slide into home with its sharpest spikes out.\nThe complaints about Facebook \u201ccall into question the adequacy of laws governing how technology companies that collect and monetize Americans\u2019 personal information must treat that information,\u201d Judge Kelly wrote, adding that if it happened again, courts \u201cmay not apply quite the same deference to the terms of a proposed resolution.\u201d\nIf the courts ever get such a shot again, that is. They won\u2019t with the current trajectory of Facebook, which has deftly used the pandemic as a redemption moment by doing its job on keeping bad health information off its platform.\nThanks a lot for that, but it is the lowest bar in my humble estimation. All of tech should do its part to stop the spread of misinformation, especially as the industry\u2019s power continues to grow.\nThat\u2019s why power and its uses and abuses, and what it should and could be, as well as what it means to be without it, will be the central organizing principle of a new podcast I will start in the fall with The New York Times. For the past five years, in more than 500 episodes, I have been trying to do that at Vox Media with my podcast \u201cRecode Decode\u201d by holding tech\u2019s feet to the fire as best I could. I have also tried to illuminate for listeners what wonder the future could hold if power were used in more creative, inclusive and, most important, more unusual ways.\nPower doesn\u2019t necessarily have to corrupt, and this troubled time can show us what power can do when it is applied in different ways. Are giant corporations more powerful than the workers? Does money confer power, or does creativity? Do you need might to be powerful \u2014 or dexterity?\nThere are a lot of synonyms for power, including one that connotes dominance and one that points to potential. I hope to explore which way to go as we emerge from this virus prison.\nAs a 19th-century orator said about Abraham Lincoln, \u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201d\nTo my mind, there is no better time to find out.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple iPhone SE Review: A Superb Smartphone for a Humble Price",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019srecently introduced $399 iPhone SE marks a turning point in consumer technology. It\u2019s a smartphone that delivers all the tech that we care about, without making us pay through the nose for it.\nMany of us have been waiting for this moment. Long ago, the technologies driving TVs and personal computers became so commonplace that good television sets and PCs became affordable for the masses. The ubiquitous smartphone, we presumed, would follow.\nInstead, as the smartphone matured over the last decade and a bit, the opposite happened. Thepricetag for theiPhone, the most popular handset in the world, reached heights that were previously unimaginable. Last year\u2019snew iPhonespeaked at $1,449, compared with $599 in 2007. Yetbudget phonesranging from $200 to $400 had major shortcomings like lousy cameras and slow chips.\nThe new iPhone SE\u2019s lack of compromise is what makes it remarkable. Apple took all the best parts from its expensive iPhones \u2014 including a fast computing processor and an excellent camera \u2014 and squeezed them into the shell of an older iPhone with a home button and smaller screen. At the same time, it managed to include useful features that were previously exclusive to fancy new phones, like water resistance, wireless charging and so-called portrait photos.\nThat means state-of-the-art smartphone technology has finally come down to a modest price. It\u2019s about time.\nAfter testing the new SE for a few weeks, I can confidently say that this device is ideal for many people \u2014 especially for those who think about buying tech only when they feel they have to.\nJustin Adler, 33, is one of them. He owned the first SE, which debuted in 2016, for years, subjecting himself to mockery from his techie colleagues in San Francisco who had much nicer phones. He recently bought the latest SE.\n\u201cI just never wanted to shell out $1,000 to replace something that was working perfectly fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the exact core audience of, if you haven\u2019t upgraded your phone we\u2019re going to give you the cheapest bait as possible.\u201d\nThis new iPhone may suit you as well. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWith the SE, Apple took the computing processor ofthe $699 iPhone 11\u2014 the fastest on the market \u2014 and stuck it in a body that is practically the same as the iPhone 8 from 2017. In the process, the company also made significant improvements to the SE\u2019s camera, which has a single lens but now relies on software and artificial intelligence to make photos look much better.\nIn past iterations of high-end iPhones, the devices had two camera lenses that worked together to produce the popular effect known as portrait mode, which sharpens a subject while gently blurring the background.\nBut in theiPhone XR from 2018, Apple used machine learning, which involved computers analyzing images to recognize people and properly sharpen them while blurring the background, to produce portrait shots of people using a single lens.\nApple has applied a similar A.I.-assisted approach to the SE, making portrait photos of people possible with a single lens on the cheaper device. In my tests, portrait shots looked excellent \u2014 on a par with similar photos taken with the iPhone 11. This is significant for a device of this price. (Google\u2019s $399 Pixel 3A, my favorite Android phone, is also exceptional for its ability to take portrait photos, though that phone is much slower.)\nOf course, Apple had to cut costs somewhere, so the cheaper iPhone SE\u2019s camera lacks some frills seen in the iPhone 11 and $999 iPhone 11 Pro.\nSpecifically, Apple limited its machine-assisted image processing specifically to human subjects, meaning I couldn\u2019t take artsy photos of my dogs. The camera also lacks the so-called ultra-wide-angle lens for taking shots with a broader field of view, as well as night mode, a feature to take better photos in the dark.\nBut if you are a casual photographer, you could probably live without those whiz-bang features and be happy saving lots of money by choosing the SE.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the shots I took in daylight of my corgi, Max, on the SE looked just as good as similar shots with the iPhone 11 and other phones on the market, like Google\u2019s $399 Pixel 3A. They came out crisp with natural-looking colors and nice shadow detail.\nThe other feature that makes the SE cheaper is the first thing you will look at: the screen.\nAt 4.7 inches, the display is smaller than the jumbo 6.1-inch screen on the iPhone 11. But that may be a benefit. The 4.7-inch size is better suited to one-hand use, so it\u2019s easy to use your thumb to reach from the home button to each corner of the screen. Also important, the phone\u2019s smaller body fits more comfortably in a pocket.\nThe SE\u2019s second big cost saver is the use of a home button for unlocking the device, rather than the face scanners seen on modern smartphones. The iPhone fingerprint scanners have always worked quickly and reliably, and so does this one.\nIt might be nice to have a face scanner, but many of us will probably be happy without the feature if it means saving some money. For comparison, I have given big minus points to $1,000 phones, like theSamsung Galaxy S10, for a lousy fingerprint reader and a subpar face scanner.\nTo fully understand the SE\u2019s value, it\u2019s important to note that this isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first rodeo with a cheaper iPhone. Those past models were not as compelling when compared with their pricier counterparts. To wit:\nThe $549iPhone 5C, introduced in 2013, came in colorful plastic and felt cheaper and slower than the iPhone 5S, the model with a sleek aluminum body that cost $100 more.\nThe $399iPhone SE from 2016had the design of older iPhones, with the same computing power as newer ones at the time. Yet that SE had a notably inferior camera and dimmer screen than its $649, bigger-screen counterpart at the time, theiPhone 6S.\nThis time, the new SE\u2019s trade-offs seem trivial. No face scanner, shooting photos in the dark or humongous screen? Those are minor inconveniences when you are paying 40 percent less than for an iPhone 11.\nI will note one big downside: The SE has significantly shorter battery life than the iPhone 11.\nAfter a day of shooting photos and juggling work tasks, the SE battery needed to be replenished by dinnertime. With the more expensive phone, I had more than 25 percent battery by bedtime. So people who work long hours and rely on their phones would probably be happier with a high-end one.\nI\u2019m not the target demographic for the SE since I\u2019m willing to pay for fancier features. I splurged on the$999 iPhone XStwo years ago because I loved taking portrait photos of food and my dogs.\nBut there was something unique about the announcement of the SE that I found striking in a pandemic that has dampened most people\u2019s enthusiasm for buying nice things.\nWhen new iPhones are unveiled, I usually get questions from friends who work in tech and are giddy about shiny new gadgets. With the SE, I got text messages from people who hate talking about tech: a friend who is in her 60s and a self-proclaimed Luddite, and a family member who is an environmentalist. Both are using iPhones that are at least five years old, and both were relieved that their next phone won\u2019t cost more than a month\u2019s mortgage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slow burner that\u2019s going to help Apple upgrade their base,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies, said of the SE. That includes people who hold on to phones for three to five years and those with hand-me-downs, she said.\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s most people I know."

        "title": "Facebook Starts Planning for Permanent Remote Workers",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Facebook said on Thursday that it would allow many employees to work from home permanently. But there\u2019s a catch: They may not be able to keep their big Silicon Valley salaries in more affordable parts of the country.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, told workers during a staff meeting that was livestreamed on his Facebook page that within a decade as many as half of the company\u2019s more than 48,000 employees would work from home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Covid has changed a lot about our lives, and that certainly includes the way that most of us work,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cComing out of this period, I expect that remote work is going to be a growing trend as well.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s decision, the first among tech\u2019s biggest companies, is a stark change for a business culture built around getting workers into giant offices and keeping them there. Using free shuttle buses, free cafeterias and personal services like dry cleaning, tech companies have done as much as possible over the years to give employees little reason to go home, let alone avoid the office.\nIf other giant companies follow suit, tech employment could start to shift away from expensive hubs like Silicon Valley, Seattle and New York. The option to work from home could also provide more reason for tech workers who complain that their enviable salaries still aren\u2019t enough to buy a home in San Francisco or San Jose toconsider settling in other parts of the country.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement followed similardecisions at Twitter and the payments company Square, both led by Jack Dorsey. Mr. Dorsey said last week that employees at his companies would be allowed to work from home indefinitely. AtGoogle, employees have been told they can work from home through the end of the year, but the company has not made any indications about permanent plans.\nThere are signs that remote work is popular among technologists. After Mr. Dorsey\u2019s announcement, Google searches for \u201cTwitter jobs\u201d spiked, according to Google Trends.\nAaron Levie, the chief executive of the business technology company Box, wrote on Twitter that \u201cthe push happening around remote work is as game-changing for the future of tech as the launch of the iPhone\u201d more than a decade ago.\nTech executives have long believed that person-to-person communication was a big part of the creativity that went into generating popular products. They built giant campuses that reflected that belief, from the ornate offices of Apple, Google and Facebook in Silicon Valley to the new Amazon headquarters in Seattle.\nStill, the biggest tech companies were trying to expand beyond their main offices before the pandemic, as an older generation of companies like Intel had done. Amazon, for example, intends to open asecond headquartersin Virginia. The coronavirus pandemic could accelerate those plans.\n\u201cBefore the virus happened, a lot of the discussion about the tech sector was about how to bring people to work sites and create affordable housing,\u201d said Robert Silverman, a professor of urban and regional planning at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \u201cThis is kind of a natural progression.\u201d\nAn employee exodus from the biggest urban tech hubs, combined with layoffs, could have dramatic local impacts. Housing costs in the Bay Area, for example, have fallen since the pandemic began, according to the rental firm Zumper. Rents in San Francisco fell 7 percent in April, and were down 15 percent in Menlo Park, Facebook\u2019s home.\nMr. Zuckerberg long worried that employees who worked remotely would lose productivity. Facebook onceprovided cash bonusesto employees who lived within 10 miles of its headquarters. In 2018, Facebook expanded its main campus with elaborate new officesdesigned by the star architect Frank Gehry, including a 3.6-acre roof garden with more than 200 trees.\nJust last year, Facebook started moving into a 43-story office tower that it had leased in San Francisco, and the company is still reportedly in talks for asignificant office expansion in New York, as well.\nIn March, the coronavirus lockdown forced companies to send employees home. Many tech companies, including Facebook, emptied their offices before local shelter-in-place orders.\nNow, more than two months later, executives are discovering that their remote workers performed better than expected. Mr. Zuckerberg said employees remained focused even though they were working from home.\nFacebook will begin by allowing new hires who are senior engineers to work remotely, and then allow current employees to apply for permission to work from home if they have positive performance reviews.\nStarting in January, Facebook\u2019s employee compensation will be adjusted based on the cost of living in the locations where workers choose to live. Facebook will make sure employees are honest about their location by checking where they log in to internal systems from, he said.\nMr. Zuckerberg said the shift could offer more benefits than inconveniences for the company. Allowing remote work will allow Facebook to broaden its recruitment, retain valuable employees, reduce the climate impact caused by commutes and expand the diversity of its work force, Mr. Zuckerberg said.\nSo far, Facebook, Square and Twitter are being far more aggressive than their counterparts in the industry. Their work is mostly done in software code, which can be handled remotely.\nAt Apple, on the other hand, many employees are hardware engineers who need to be in the company\u2019s lab, particularly because of the company\u2019s secrecy around its products. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in April that the company\u2019s main office in Silicon Valley would be closed until at least June and has not updated that timeline.\nStart-ups could also find it difficult to manage a remote work force. Allowing workers to live in the Midwest could keep costs down, but Silicon Valley has a giant talent pool from which start-ups draw their workers. Also, many venture capitalists, mostly based in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, expect the companies they invest in to be based nearby.\nAt Los Angeles-based Snap, the maker of Snapchat, employees are allowed to work at home through September. Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in aninterviewthat he was reassessing the situation regularly and considering guidance from health authorities about when to reopen.\n\u201cPeople want certainty, and there\u2019s a huge amount of pressure as a leader to make definitive statements,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said on Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we remain flexible in a situation that is changing rapidly.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Want this in your inbox each morning?Sign up here.\n\u201cThe service we provide has never been more critical,\u201dJeff Bezossaid yesterday when announcing Amazon\u2019slatest financial results. Indeed, the e-commerce giant reported a whopping $75.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 26 percent from the same time a year ago.\nBut profit fell faster than expected, as costs spiked to meet increased demand from homebound consumers. Mr. Bezos said that pandemic-related expenses would consume all of the company\u2019s profit in the current quarter \u2014 and that it was part of a deliberate strategy:\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small. Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we\u2019d expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit. But these aren\u2019t normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on Covid-related expenses getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a return to form, in a way, to when Amazon spent all of its cash to build market share instead of generating big profits. In the 20 years through 2016, Amazon made a cumulative net profit of around $5 billion \u2014 less than what it made in the past two quarters.\n\u2022 With so much attention focused on Amazon during the pandemic, not least when it comes tothe safety of its warehouse workers, choosing not to turn a huge profit could be seen as a shrewd move.\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual shareholder meeting \u2014 known as \u201cWoodstock for capitalists\u201d \u2014 typically draws tens of thousands to an arena in Omaha to hear Warren Buffett\u2019s musings on business, markets and life in general. Not this year.\nMr. Buffett will answer investor questions via livestreamonYahoo Financetomorrow at 4:45 p.m. Eastern as part of an abbreviated, online-only shareholder meeting. (Andrew, CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick and the former Fortune editor Carol Loomis will choose which questions to ask \u2014 DealBook readers candrop Andrew a linewith suggestions.) Mr. Buffett and Greg Abel, one of his top deputies, will be on hand, though Charlie Munger, the company\u2019s 96-year-old vice chairman, will be absent.\nExpect a more subdued Q.&A. this year.Berkshire saidthat neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Abel would discuss \u201cpolitics or specific investment holdings,\u201d ruling out two popular topics at previous meetings. Mr. Buffett, who was more visible during the 2008 financial crisis, has been noticeably quiet about what the pandemic means for investment opportunities \u2014 Berkshire had more than $120 billion in idle cash at the end of last year. Mr. Munger recentlytold The Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe just want to get through the typhoon, and we\u2019d rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity.\u201d\nWhat Mr. Buffett might talk about:\n\u2022 Berkshire\u2019s latest quarterly results, which will be released in the morning. Analysts expect a potentially huge loss, since investments in energy companies and airlines lost value and the retailers and manufacturers that Berkshire owns outright are operating at limited capacity.\n\u2022 Economic inequality, a topic he has focused on in recent years.He told Yahoo Financelast month that \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that capitalism \u201cwill widen the gap between the people that have market skills, whatever that market demands, and others, unless government does something in between.\u201d He has supported a wealth tax in the past.\n\u2022 His belief in the resilience of Berkshire and the U.S. economy. \u201cHe\u2019s an optimist,\u201d Paul Lountzis, an asset manager,told Reuters.\nFacing aneconomic downturn\u201cof a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime,\u201d the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, made an intriguing offer to the region\u2019s banks yesterday.\nIf banks hit certain lending targets, they can borrow at minus 1 percent.That is, thanks to a tweak to an existing stimulus program, they will owe the E.C.B. less than what they borrow from it.\nThe E.C.B. could follow the Fed and start buying junk bonds, notes Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg. Ms. Lagarde\u2019s pointed repetition of the word flexibility during a press briefing, Mr. Hense adds, also suggests that the central bank is willing to do more to unfreeze the economy.\nThe eurozone\u2019s economy is in bad shape, according to the latest numbers. On an annualized basis, the way America reports its data, eurozone G.D.P. shrank more than 14 percent in the first quarter, versus just under 5 percent in the U.S.\nThe Times Opinion columnist and Nobel-winning economist was the featured guest on yesterday\u2019s DealBook Debrief conference call, sharing his views on the government\u2019s steps to help out Americans, what a recovery will look like and more. (Listen to the recording here.)\nGood job, Jay.\u201cThe Fed gets an A,\u201d he said, praising the array of bailout lending programs overseen by the central bank\u2019s chairman Jay Powell. \u201cWhat the Fed has done is incredible. If you looked at what was happening in the second half of March, we were right on the edge of a global financial meltdown.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect a quick recovery.\u201cVery few people I talk to now believe in a V-shaped recovery anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at something more like a Nike swoosh with a long gradual ascent.\u201d\nNew graduates are doomed.Asked when recent graduates would recover from the spike in unemployment, he responded bluntly: \u201cOh, that\u2019s easy: Never.\u201d He cited research showing that graduating during a recession permanently damages lifetime earnings. \u201cYou basically miss a rung on the ladder, and you never get to make that up.\u201d\nApple easily beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations yesterday by reporting asmall rise in revenue and modest dip in profit. Even so, its C.E.O., Tim Cook, said that a \u201clack of visibility and certainty\u201d made it impossible to estimate results for the current quarter, so the company couldn\u2019t offer any guidance to investors about the future.\nIt was bullish enough to increase buybacks and raise dividends.Apple authorized $50 billion in share repurchases, on top of $40 billion left over from its previous buyback program. It also raised its quarterly dividend 6 percent. In both cases, to borrow one of its old ad slogans, Apple chose to \u201cthink different\u201d: Most companies are desperately conserving cash, with analysts predicting that buybacks will fall by half and dividends by a quarter this year.\n\u2022 Apple spent around $19 billion on buybacks in its latest quarter, and still had $40 billion in cash to spare. Over the past five years, Apple has spent nearly $280 billion repurchasing its own shares.\nIt\u2019s not the only company going against the grain.Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, announced thelargest buyback in its historythis week. Although neither is immune to the effects of the pandemic \u2014 Apple\u2019s supply chain and Google\u2019s advertising business have been disrupted \u2014 the tech giants are confident enough to keep up generous shareholder payouts, despite economic uncertainty and rising public anger over companies\u2019 use of cash.\nSteven Davidoff Solomon, a.k.a. the \u201cDeal Professor,\u201d argued this week that the backlash against share buybacks hadgone too far. We asked for your thoughts on his take, and you responded in droves. (We read every email, even if we can\u2019t reply to each one.) A selection of comments from DealBook readers:\n\u2022 \u201cThat money should be going to making salaries and wages more equitable. No C.E.O. should earn more than 20 times the lowest salary in an organization.\u201d \u2014Andrea in Centennial, Colo.\n\u2022 \u201cYou want \u2018competition\u2019 (i.e. options) for a corporation to deploy its excess cash flow to ensure it is utilized as effectively as possible \u2014 dividends, buybacks, M.&A., human capital, R.&D., new equipment, etc. Taking away one of those mechanisms will lead to corporate decisions becoming less efficient.\u201d \u2014Cameron in Toronto\n\u2022 \u201cWhat is the point in saving cash for a rainy day when the government is going to bail you out anyway?\u201d \u2014Burak in Australia\n\u2022 \u201cPart of the problem with the buyback debate is that it is framed as companies \u2018spending\u2019 money on them.

        "title": "Eager to Corral the Coronavirus, U.K. Tests a Disputed Tracing App",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Not for the first time in the coronavirus era, the British government is going its own way.\nThis time, the National Health Service is moving forward with an app to track the spread of the virus despite questions about the technology\u2019s effectiveness, privacy safeguards and compatibility with key iPhone and Android features.\nOfficials are counting on the technology, which is designed to alert anyone who may have come into contact with an infected person, to help ease lockdown orders that have been in place since March. But a dispute over privacy \u2014 and over how much data the authorities can collect \u2014 has hampered the rollout and pitted the government against Apple and Google, which are pushinga competing designfor exposure tracing.\nIn this instance, the British government may be overmatched by the Silicon Valley titans, which control the software that runs on nearly every smartphone on the planet. Unless Britain changes course, the companies are refusing to provide access to a Bluetooth signal on iPhones and Android phones that is needed to measure proximity.\nThat has left Britain with a stark choice: either alter the design or risk releasing an app with major technical flaws.\nAt its heart, the debate is about balancing public health and individual privacy. In Britain, which has a history of robust government surveillance to fight terrorism, officials say that more can be learned about the virus by collecting lots of information in a centralized database. They argue this will provide more research capabilities to spot emerging hot spots and patterns of how the virus spreads.\nBy contrast, Apple and Google are promoting a decentralized approach that would protect against invasions of privacy. But the government says that privacy considerations are only part of a complex calculus it is trying to navigate.\n\u201cIf privacy was the only thing that we were optimizing for then it may be that a decentralized approach should be the default choice,\u201d Matthew Gould, the head of NHSx, the division of the National Health Service that is building the app, said ina House of Commons hearingthis week. \u201cBut actually we\u2019re balancing a number of things.\u201d\nThe British authorities said that the data would not include personally identifiable information, and that access would be limited to those working on the pandemic response. Acommittee in Parliamenthas called for legislation creating privacy protections around the app.\nIn opposing Britain\u2019s effort, Apple and Google are supported by academics, security researchers and privacy groups that want to restrict government data collection, saying that, whatever the safeguards, a centralized database creates too much potential for abuse. Britain\u2019s top privacy regulator, Elizabeth Denham, saidlast monththat a decentralized model should be a \u201cstarting point\u201d for contact tracing.\n\u201cIt is vital that, when we come out of the current crisis, we have not created a tool that enables data collection on the population, or on targeted sections of society, for surveillance,\u201d a group of more than 170 scientists wrote in anApril 29statement opposing the British app\u2019s design.\nTo enforce their view, the companies will provide important access to a phone\u2019s Bluetooth signal only to tracing apps that store health information on a person\u2019s smartphone. This prohibits data from being uploaded and stored on government servers.\nMany have raised additional concerns that the British app allows self-reporting, a feature that could easily be abused.\nThere are signs that Britain may be bending to the criticism. Mr. Gould told Parliament this week that the government was continuing to speak with Apple and Google, and that the country could change its approach.\nThe health service awarded a contract to a Swiss company, Zuhlke Engineering, to \u201cinvestigate\u201d building a tracing app using the Apple and Google specifications, according todocumentsobtained by the research firm Tussell and first reported by TheFinancial Times.\nIt would not be first time Britain had taken an alternative path in responding to the coronavirus, before changing course. In March, as many countries began to shut down,Britain kept schools and businesses open, before increasing deaths and infection rates eventually led to a lockdown. Britain now has one of the highest death tolls in Europe.\nWidespread testing and contact tracing are universally cited as critical steps to restarting economies without reigniting the epidemic.\nApps are designed to significantly speed up contact tracing by quickly identifying people who are most at risk of infection. The technology works by using a smartphone\u2019s Bluetooth signal to measure proximity to nearby devices.\nAfter an infected person shares the information on the app, anyone they have had close interactions with will receive an alert with instructions to self-isolate. A log is kept of the phones of people who have come within a certain distance of each other, like those sitting next to each other on a bus or subway.\nBritain began testing its app this week on theIsle of Wight, an island off the southern coast with about 140,000 people. As the country struggles to perform enough virus tests and provide protective gear for health workers, leaders are trumpeting the app as progress.\nIan Levy, of the National Cyber Security Center,likenedthe technology to John Snow, the scientist who in 1854 traced a cholera outbreak in London to a contaminated water pump. The British health minister, Matt Hancock, said citizens who downloaded the app would be doing their \u201cduty.\u201d\nAfter people report symptoms through the app, their information will be sent to the N.H.S. It will then perform an automated risk assessment to identify other app users who may have come into contact with the infected person.\nBut critics say the British app will not work effectively unless it uses code provided by Apple and Google. In Australia, an app with a similar design has been criticized for technical problems. Germany recently reversed to support the Apple-Google specifications. Austria, Italy and Switzerland are using it as well.\nBritain is moving forward with its app despite a lack of evidence that any tracing technology will help fight the virus without widespread testing, an area where the country haslagged behind others in Europe. An added challenge is that useful technology needs a huge portion of the population to participate. A recent study by epidemiologists atOxford Universityestimated that, to be effective, 60 percent of the population must use the app, a figure on par with omnipresent apps like WhatsApp. (Mr. Gould differed with that estimate, saying that even 20 percent would be useful.)\nCarly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, apolicy research groupfocused on technology, said prematurely releasing an ineffective app would undermine public trust. \u201cA bad app is definitely worse than no app,\u201d she said.\nLuciano Floridi, director of the Digital Ethics Lab at Oxford University, warned against \u201clooking at technology as the savior,\u201d when a pandemic requires broader public health and medical solutions. He said more testing and thousands of human contact-tracers were needed to track the disease.\n\u201cThis will be a small component in a much larger approach,\u201d said Mr. Floridi, who is on a government advisory board related to the app. \u201cHopefully, it will not do any harm.\u201d"

        "title": "Stocks Surge as Oil Prices Rally",
        "fulltext": "Many of the world\u2019s economies have begun to loosen restrictions on commerce, the Federal Reserve chair on Sunday signaled that the central bank has more firepower to lend to recovery efforts, and a drugmaker reported positive developments in an early trial of a coronavirus vaccine.\nTaken together, the developments set off a surge in global stock prices and Wall Street had its best day in about six weeks.\nThe S&P 500 rose more than 3 percent Monday, while stock benchmarks in Europe were 4 percent to 6 percent higher.\nBefore trading began in the United States, the drugmakerModernasaid its coronavirus vaccine showedpromising early resultsin tests on humans. The early-stage tests were on just eight people, but the hope that a vaccine might be quickly developed was enough to give stock prices a lift.\nAlso bolstering markets was a pledge from Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, that there was \u201creally no limit\u201d to what the central bank could do with its emergency lending facilities.\n\u201cThe one thing I can absolutely guarantee is that the Federal Reserve will be doing everything we can to support the people we serve,\u201d Mr. Powell said during a television interview broadcast on Sunday.\nThe Fed chair also suggested that the worst economic readings were yet to come,even as states begin to gradually reopen. He said that he expected \u201ca couple more months\u201d of job losses and acknowledged that the unemployment rate,which hit 14.7 percent in April, could peak at 20 percent or even 25 percent.\nStill, investors were looking for silver linings as the world grapples with lockdowns and other restrictions. Japan released economic figures on Monday that showed its economy formallyfell into recession, but Tokyo has begun easing some of its containment efforts. Some restrictions have also been lifted in parts of Europe and the United States.\nAnd trading on Monday had all the characteristics of a rally focused on the prospects for a return to normal. Shares of companies that stand to gain the most, likeUnited Airlines,Expedia GroupandMarriott International, were among the best performers in the S&P 500.\nBusinesses that have benefited as Americans stockpiled food and cleaning supplies, likeCampbell SoupandClorox, were among a small number of decliners.\nOil prices also reflected optimism about the economy, withWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, rising above $30 a barrel for the first time since March. Shares of energy companies likeChevronandExxonwere also sharply higher.\nJerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, will tell members of Congress that the central bank stands ready to do what it can to help the American economy make it through the sharp downturn underway.\n\u201cThe scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent and are significantly worse than any recession since World War II,\u201d Mr. Powell said in prepared testimony that he is scheduled to deliver to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\nHe added that the Fed was \u201ccommitted to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time even as we recognize that these actions are only a part of a broader public-sector response.\u201d\nMr. Powell will testify alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The pair will explain to senators what they are doing with a $500 billion congressional appropriation in the CARES Act that was primarily meant to back up Fed emergency lending programs, which can keep credit flowing to businesses and local governments in times of crisis.\nMr. Powell noted that one program \u2014 the Main Street facility, which is intended to lend to midsize businesses and which has been a particular focus of lawmaker concern \u2014 has been revised to count in a broader set of counterparties and could be revised further.\nThe changes made already \u201cshould help the program meet the needs of a wider range of employers that may need bridge financing to support their operations and the economic recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to adjust facilities as we learn more.\u201d\nWeWork, the office space giant that wasstruggling even before the coronavirusshut down much of the economy, is asking landlords fora break on its huge rent billas it tries to survive the pandemic.\nSome of the company\u2019s small-business customers are also seeking relief on the rent they owe. But they say WeWork has been unwilling to cut them much slack as they grapple with plunging revenues and stay-at-home orders that prevent them from using the company\u2019s sleek spaces.\nKlint Briney, who runs a marketing company in Los Angeles, was disappointed that WeWork only offered to defer one month\u2019s rent. Because much of his business comes from live events, his revenue is a fraction of what it was a year ago.\n\u201cSomething that was a legitimate offer, I certainly would have entertained,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they offered was a slap in the face.\u201d\nThe tension between WeWork, its landlords and its customers highlights the problems gripping the market for office space, a huge part of the economies of big cities. In the coming months, many tenants will be unable or unwilling to pay their rent. And landlords will have to decide whether to grant them relief, wait for them to make good on their arrears or seek to evict them. Banks and investors who lent money to property owners will face similar choices.\nJ.C. Penney, the 118-year-old retailerthat filed for bankruptcy on Friday, said on Monday that it planned to close about 242 stores \u2014 30 percent of its locations \u2014 as part of its restructuring plan. The move will leave J.C. Penney with 604 stores.\nThe retailer also aims to have its e-commerce business account for more than one-quarter of its revenue within the next few years, up from 14 percent last year, according to afilingthat included a presentation outlining J.C. Penney\u2019s business plan.\nThe company said in the filing that it would close 192 stores this year and close and sell 50 stores that it owns next year. The stores it plans to keep operating accounted for 82 percent of J.C. Penney\u2019s most recent annual revenue and represent \u201cthe highest sales-generating, most profitable, and most productive stores in the network.\u201d\nJ.C. Penney is planning to lose about half of its overall sales this year for annual revenue of about $5.1 billion. The retailer said it thinks it can expand its e-commerce sales to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024, which would make up 26 percent of its business.\nThe retailer said it would reduce expenses by having fewer workers, lowering ad spending and cutting administrative costs, as well as cutting \u201cbonus/equity and benefits.\u201d\nBlack and Latino business owners are struggling to get government assistance under the Paycheck Protection Program,a new survey has found, and many say they are on the brink of closing permanently.\nThe survey, conducted by the Global Strategy Group for two equal-rights organizations,Color of ChangeandUnidosUS, included interviews with 500 business owners and 1,200 workers from April 30 to May 11. Just 12 percent of the owners who applied for government-backed loans in the $650 billion program reported receiving what they had asked for, and nearly half of all owners said they anticipated having to permanently close in the next six months.\nBy comparison, in a survey of small businesses by the Census Bureau from April 26 to May 2, three-quarters said they had asked for a loan and 38 percent of them said they had received one.\nThis month, the federal government said it would borrow arecord-breaking $3 trillionfrom April to June to help businesses and workers get through the coronavirus-induced recession. In April alone, the United States recorded a larger budget deficit in a single month than it did for all of the 2017 fiscal year, a total of $738 billion.\nRunning such a large deficit would have been politically untenable just a year ago; since the end of World War II, economists have often warned that doing so would risk runaway inflation and possibly unsustainable tax hikes on future generations. But now, even some of the country\u2019s most ardent deficit hawks have watched the debt pile up and said: More, please.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought a new sort of deficit scolding to Capitol Hill, with economists and lawmakers warning that the United States is not borrowing enough to carry the nation through a debilitating recession that could turn into a second Great Depression.\nA legion of economists,Federal Reserve officialsand even some of the most outspoken proponents of deficit reduction in recent years are now urging Congress and President Trump to continue spending trillions of dollars to prevent a long-term collapse in business activity and prolonged joblessness.\nEvery financial services company has a coronavirus relief page on its website right now, filled with reassuring language about the assistance on offer. Federal laws and regulations are supposed to make it easier toget help.\nBut if you\u2019re wary of the corporations riding to your rescue \u2014 or even if you\u2019re not \u2014 you need to protect yourself, writes Ron Lieber. Memorialize every single thing they tell or promise you.\nOne unfortunate lesson from recessions past is that companies and consumers often disagree about what help they settled on and under what terms. Absent written proof or recorded phone calls, struggling consumers are at a disadvantage years later when assistance turns out to be fleeting or illusory.\nMany consumers are scared for their lives, not just their livelihoods. Billers, landlords and customer service reps are scattered to the winds, away from bosses and compliance officials, distracted by their own disrupted home lives. Mistakes will be made, in great volumes.\nSo, a taking of receipts is in order.\nUbersaid on Monday that it laid off 3,000 employees, closed 45 of its global offices and reorganized several of its secondary businesses as the coronavirus caused an 80 percent downturn in its ride-hailing business. Uber has also cut back its food delivery service, Uber Eats, in several countries where it was not successful and sold its bike and scooter arm, Jump. The company has laid off about 25 percent of its work force over the last month.\nTargetsaid on Monday that it would extend its temporary $2-per-hour pay increase for full- and part-time front line workers through July 4. The retailer announced the increase on March 20 and said at the time it would maintain the increase until \u201cat least May 2.\u201d Temporary wage increases during the pandemic, which some retailers have referred to as \u201chero\u201d pay, have become a majorpoint of contention in recent weeks.\nJapan fell into a recession for the first time since 2015, as its already weakened economy was dragged down by the coronavirus\u2019s impact on businesses at home and abroad. The world\u2019s third-largest economy, after that of the United States and China, shrank by an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the country\u2019s government said on Monday.\nThe chief executive ofHertz, the century-old car rental company now at risk of bankruptcy, has resigned, the company said Monday. The company\u2019s fate may be decided this week: It has until Friday to come up with a plan to pay back its lenders and continue to meet its ongoing financial obligations.\nReporting was contributed by Jeanna Smialek, Niraj Chokshi, Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, Clifford Krauss, Cecilia Kang, Ben Dooley, Carlos Tejada, Neal E.

Chenhas ravedabout the iPhone SE, Apple\u2019s new, $399 model, which has the body of a three-year-old smartphone and the brains and guts of the latest editions.\n\u201cState-of-the-art smartphone technology has finally come down to a modest price,\u201d Brian wrote Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d\nIt\u2019s beyond time. I\u2019ve written in this newsletter aboutsmartphones morphing from novel to normal, dousing our zeal to buy new and better models all the time. This is the natural order of things.\nBut what has been unnatural is the pit of despair for the smartphone of the masses. All of the attention has been on the luxury end.\nThat has meant that what we pay for smartphones on average has stayed stubbornly high in the United States. Yes, we\u2019re getting more for our money, but for most other consumer products, we\u2019re paying less AND getting improved products.\nAs long as people were splurging on new models, most companies had little incentive to make great and truly affordable phones. At least until recently. Global smartphone sales are on track to fall for the fourth straight year, and the pandemic-related economic freeze in many countries doesn\u2019t help.\nThe companies have slowly started to take the hint. Apple\u2019siPhone XR, which now goes for about $600, is far outselling its $1,000-and-up models in the United States. Samsung\u2019s top-of-the-range phones haven\u2019t consistently sold well.\nAnd while smartphones below $600, including an earlier iPhone SE, haven\u2019t been hot sellers, Brian\u2019s enthusiasm shows that great smartphones don\u2019t have to cost $1,500 or even $600. We just need the companies to put as much energy and marketing muscle into the Corolla end of their range as they do in the high end.\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m dissing those pricey phones. We should be glad that companies stretch their minds and their research labs to invent phones with bleeding edge technologyand $2,000 price tags. Fancy parts and gizmos in today\u2019s luxury phones become tomorrow\u2019s widespread, affordable and important technologies.\nSo you should feel free to buy the Lexus of smartphones if you want to and can afford it. Just know that you don\u2019t have to.\nMy colleagueCecilia Kangwrote this week about Americans in rural areas havingtrouble getting internet access at home. Friends, I have a doozy of an example for you.\nSeveral years ago, Susan Wakabayashi moved her family into a newly built home in Middleburg, Va. To her surprise, she and some of her neighbors were in a dead zone without fast internet lines.\nWhat happened next was a maddening five-year saga that shows that even people who can afford to get online can\u2019t always do so because of bureaucratic failures.\nWakabayashi tried every trick in the book so she could work from home and get online for one of her children who was home-schooled.\nShe said she paid $900 a month at times for subpar mobile internet service. Wakabayashi organized the neighbors to try to persuade internet providers to wire their area for fast internet. She said local government officials told her that exclusive contracts for internet and cellphone providers left them with few alternatives.\nWakabayashi said she even briefly considered hiring a lawyer to sue the county under the Geneva Convention treaties, which create obligations between states at war. (Such a lawsuit would have been impossible, of course, but she was desperate.)\nEventually, Wakabayashi gave up trying to work from home and instead drove three hours round trip to the office.\nWakabayashi later sold the house and moved her family further east to a place with fast internet. She said she misses her old home. Kind of. \u201cAll those horses, all those kind people \u2014 and lousy internet access,\u201d she said.\nFacebook\u2019s quasi Supreme Court:In a Times Opinion piece, the chairs of Facebook\u2019s new oversight board said they will nowbe the final word in disputesover posts deemed to violate the company\u2019s rules for harmful or hateful speech. Kara Swisher writes for Opinion that this board's rulings on individual casescan\u2019t fix Facebook\u2019s structural flawsthat stress \u201cengagement over context, speed over reflection and viral growth above all.\u201d\nThe strain of fast forwarding to the online grocery future:Instacart, which sends shoppers into supermarkets to deliver groceries, is seeing order volumes it hadn\u2019t expected until 2025, Bloomberg Businessweekreported. The pandemic surge has been a strain for staffers logging 18-hour workdays, and for some of Instacart\u2019s contract shoppers who say their compensation and protective gear is inadequate for the health risks they\u2019re taking.\n\u201cQuiz Daddy\u201d is back!Scott Rogowsky, who for a hot minute was famous as the host of the HQ Trivia online quiz game,is now streaming a comedy talk show from his apartment.\nA weatherman for the BBCdoes double dutydrumming out the news broadcast\u2019s theme music.\nWe want to hear from you.
