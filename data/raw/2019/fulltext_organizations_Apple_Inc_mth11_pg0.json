        "title": "No, That Mac Factory in Texas Is Not New",
        "fulltext": "President Trump on Wednesday toured a Texas plant that makes high-end Apple computers, chatting with Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and accepting a plate with the words \u201cAssembled in USA.\u201d\nIt was a pretty typical publicity event, until the end. Mr. Trump walked in front of the news cameras and took credit for the plant, suggesting it had opened that day. \u201cFor me, this is a very special day,\u201d he said. Mr. Cook stood next to him, stone-faced.\nThe plant has been making Apple computerssince 2013.\nImmediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Mr. Cook thanked the president and his staff. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for their support in pulling today off and getting us to this far. It would not be possible without them,\u201d he said. He did not correct the record.\nThe moment was part of a bizarre afternoon in Texas, where the president played up a six-year-old factory as evidence of his three-year-old presidency\u2019s success in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States.\nIt showed Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to leverage his influence over American companies in his pitch to voters that he deserves another four years in the White House. And it illustrated the complicated position that Mr. Cook and other corporate executives find themselves in with this president, forced to stand silently by while he sometimes misleads about their businesses.\nAfter Mr. Trump departed the factory, he tweeted, \u201cToday I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.\u201d\nApple officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe plant Mr. Trump toured is owned by Flex, a company that hasmade Apple\u2019s top-of-the-line Mac Pro computersthere since 2013.\nWhen Apple decided to make the Mac Pro in the United States in 2012, Mr. Cook went on prime-time television to announce it. Apple had previously assembled virtually all of its products in China. Yet when production of the computer began in Texas, it quickly ran into problems, in part because of a lack of nearby suppliers.\nEarlier this year, Apple unveiled a new version of the Mac Pro, with a starting price of $6,000. Shortly after, Apple and the White House begana monthslong public danceover where the computer would be made.\nApple said it needed waivers from tariffs the White House had imposed on certain Chinese-made components, like power cables and circuit boards, to keep making the Mac Pro in Texas. At first,Mr. Trump tweeted no, but the White House later granted 10 of the waivers.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cook showed Mr. Trump the new Mac Pro, which recently began coming off the plant\u2019s assembly lines. He pointed to different components in the computer and ticked off which states they came from.\nApple uses 9,000 suppliers across all 50 states for its products, it said. Nearly all of those suppliers ship their parts to China, where Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners assemble the vast majority of the company\u2019s devices, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and the Apple Watch.\nThose Chinese factories employ millions of people. Flex\u2019s plant in Austin employs about 500 workers, who assemble one of Apple\u2019s lowest-volume products.\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday, Mr. Cook used the moment to pitch Apple\u2019s new Mac Pro computer. \u201cIt can perform 56 trillion tasks per second,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of American design, American manufacturing and American ingenuity.\u201d\nHe then noted that before Mr. Trump had arrived that day, Apple had broken ground on a nearby,previously announced $1 billion campusin Austin. Those offices are expected to open in 2022 with about 5,000 white-collar employees in areas like engineering, sales, operations and customer support. The campus could eventually house 15,000 workers, but none are expected to be in manufacturing.\nMr. Cook has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019stop allies in corporate America, despite their differing styles and disagreement on certain issues. Mr. Cook has openly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on the environment and immigration, but he has put those concerns aside to lobby Mr. Trump on issues like tax and trade.\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, Apple last year brought back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash it had held abroad,saving it billions of dollars in taxes. It has since returned much of that money to shareholders.\nThe trade war between the United States and China acutely threatens Apple\u2019s business. Apple is already paying tariffs on some products, and it is set to pay more if the next round of tariffs go into effect next month. Apple has been asking for waivers from those tariffs. When asked on Wednesday whether Apple will get those waivers, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cook a \u201cvery special person\u201d because of his ability to create jobs. He turned to Mr. Cook and said, \u201cWhat would you say about our economy compared to everybody else?\u201d\nMr. Cook replied, \u201cI think we have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d\n\u201cStrongest in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nThe president then took questions on the impeachment inquiry and launched into a tirade against \u201cthe fake press.\u201d Mr. Cook stood silently nearby."

        "title": "With Big Tech in Their Path, Start-Ups Turn to Business Markets",
        "fulltext": "When Rajiv Ayyangar and two other Yahoo alumni explored start-up ideas, they experimented with concepts directed at the public, like a personal finance app. But making money from consumers was too daunting, they concluded, partly because of the tight grip that digital giants like Google and Apple had over distribution.\nSo instead, their San Francisco start-up,Tandem, founded last year, made a product for the business market, a virtual office for remote teams.\n\u201cThe bar is a lot higher in consumer, so we went to the enterprise side,\u201d said Mr. Ayyangar, Tandem\u2019s chief executive.\nHe has plenty of company these days. Entrepreneurs, engineers and venture investors are shying away from the consumer internet, and turning more to the seemingly ho-hum realm of supplying software to business, or so-called enterprise technology.\nVenture funding for social media start-ups reached a peak of $3.9 billion in 2011. But by 2018 it had fallen to $400 million, according to Pitchbook, which tracks venture deals. Over the same years, venture backing for start-ups supplying software to businesses more than tripled, to $2.8 billion.\nThat overall trend \u2014 less a sudden surge than a steady migration \u2014 is a subject of scrutiny today as federal agencies, states and Congress investigate whether the country\u2019s largesttech companies violate antitrust laws. With Facebook,some of the officials are lookinginto whether the company bought some emerging competitors to protect its dominant position in the market for social networks.\nIs the movement of money and talent simply a natural shift from a mature market to one with greater opportunity? Or is the consumer internet dominated by a few behemoths whose size and aggressive tactics have created \u201ckill zones\u201d around them, deterring start-ups and investors, stifling competition?\nFacebook and Google do loom large in the consumer market, discouraging entrepreneurs from trying ventures in the giants\u2019 ever-expanding corporate paths.\nYet evolving technology \u2014 cloud computing and machine-learning software \u2014 has also opened a lucrative market in business.\n\u201cPublic policy should pay attention to this,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, an economist at the Yale University School of Management and a former senior official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see which way the money and people are moving, and why.\u201d\nA decade ago, about half the start-ups that went to Accel, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, pitched consumer ideas, said John Locke, an investor at the firm. Today, the consumer-focused pitches have dropped to about 30 percent.\nAtAmplify Partners, more than 40 percent of the 67 investments the firm has made in business-focused start-ups are companies whose founders have consumer internet backgrounds, said Sunil Dhaliwal, a general partner there.\nDavid Ulevitch, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a large venture firm, said it was increasingly looking to enterprise start-ups, and had invested in several. \u201cThe consumer landscape is incredibly difficult, so the consumer world is shifting to the enterprise,\u201d he said.\nStart-ups are increasingly writing software that allows mainstream companies to do things that the consumer internet giants pioneered, like constant online monitoring of how people use products, regular updates and personalization. In addition, as banks, manufacturers, hospitals and others struggle to make sense of their digital data from the web, online forms and sensors, they need the help of tech companies.\n\u201cThe problems we were facing everyone else is facing now,\u201d said Kolton Andrus, chief executive of Gremlin, which offers programming tools to make internet-style cloud applications more reliable. Mr. Andrus helped found the company in 2016, after seven years as a senior engineer at Netflix and Amazon.\nSome start-ups are breathing new life into old categories of business software.Superhuman, an email servicefounded in 2014, is growing rapidly, offering fast, engaging and personalized service.\nThe start-up migrants from the consumer internet are often engineers. Their stories vary, and their motivations are nuanced. But they are all entrepreneurs fully engaged in pursuing opportunity, which they see in the enterprise marketplace, a door far more open than on the consumer side, for whatever reasons.\nIsaac Oates was an engineer at Amazon and Yahoo, before his ad tech start-up was acquired by Etsy, an e-commerce seller, where he worked for three years. In 2012, he co-founded Justworks, a supplier of cloud-based payroll and human resources software for small businesses, having experienced that need firsthand in his earlier start-up and heard the same from other entrepreneurs.\n\u201cWe have a team that came from the consumer internet, and we apply what we learned there to what we do now,\u201d said Mr. Oates, the chief executive.\nJustworks, based in New York, now has 80,000 people using its service, mostly at small businesses (15 people is the average) paying monthly subscriptions. The company employs 600 people and has raised $93 million.\nIn 2013, Facebook acquired a maker of software tools for mobile apps where Charity Majors was a senior engineer. She worked at Facebook for about three years, before departing to become a co-founder of Honeycomb, a San Francisco start-up, in 2016.\nFor years, Ms. Majors said, she had adopted the engineer\u2019s neutral mind-set \u2014 she wrote code, and others decided how it was used. But especially at Facebook, with its model of harvesting personal data for ads, she increasingly had second thoughts.\n\u201cMy career has been an escalating real-world lesson that I did care about what the technology was used for,\u201d Ms. Majors said.\nHoneycomb, she said, is trying to democratize and simplify modern programming with \u201cconsumer-quality\u201d software monitoring and debugging tools.\nThe business market still lacks the curb appeal of the consumer internet. \u201cThere is so much opportunity, but to most people this stuff is boring, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner at Work-Bench, a venture capital firm that focuses on enterprise start-ups.\nYet the change-the-world idealism, once a hallmark of the internet giants, is alive and well. At Tandem, Mr. Ayyangar views his young company\u2019s software as potentially being a force for good.\n\u201cPeople spend years working, eight to 10 hours a day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can improve their work lives, that\u2019s huge.\u201d\nSlack, the popular workplace-messaging service, is seen as a trailblazing success of the consumer-to-enterprise trend. It was founded in 2009 as a multiplayer game company, but pivoted in 2014 to become a messaging and collaboration service for office workers and software developers. Today, Slack says it has more than 12 million active daily users, and it went public in June.\nBut Slack\u2019s stock price has declined about 40 percent since its first day of trading. A major reason is that Microsoft is gaining ground with Teams, a Slack competitor, that the software giant bundles into its Office 365 cloud-based suite of productivity programs.\nThe skeptics, according to Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive of Slack, are taking \u201ca na\u00efve view that just because a company is bigger it will win.\u201d\nHistory, Mr. Butterfield said, suggests that smaller companies with a head start and an intense focus on one product often prevail, just as Microsoft did against IBM in personal computer software in the early 1990s.\nThe consumerization of business software, with individual users sampling products and later subscribing, should keep the enterprise market competitive, Mr. Butterfield noted.\n\u201cWe win when people have a choice,\u201d he said, \u201cand people in business increasingly have a choice.\u201d\nThose entrepreneurs still brave enough to start consumer internet companies tend to seek niche markets, and must navigate carefully in the shadow of the giants.\nA few years ago, when Tina Fitch knocked on investors\u2019 doors to raise money for her event-planning start-up, the first question she received was how her company could compete against Facebook, which already had an event-planning feature.\nMs. Fitch eventually raised $3 million for Hobnob. But the potential threat from Facebook, she said, was \u201ca way of suffocating funding interest.\u201d\nHobnob has a very different business model from Facebook. It does not serve ads or share its users\u2019 data. It charges fees. Ms. Fitch rarely speaks publicly about Facebook, having avoided \u201cpoking the sleeping giant\u201d as a survival tactic.\nBetter to stay off Facebook\u2019s radar, she figures, out of the way. Ms. Fitch started Hobnob from a pig farm in Hawaii."

        "title": "Apple Commits $2.5 Billion to Ease California Housing Crunch",
        "fulltext": "Apple on Monday announced a $2.5 billion plan to address the housing crisis in California, becoming the latest big tech company to devote money to a problem that local lawmakers and economists believe it helped create.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s plan includes a $1 billion investment fund for affordable housing and another $1 billion to buy mortgages. Apple also intends to make a 40-acre, $300 million property it owns in San Jose, Calif., available for new affordable housing.\nApple\u2019s housing plan is a response to the increasing pressure Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants are under to play a more active role in the region\u2019s housing crisis. As local tech companies big and small have boomed, they have flooded the region with hundreds of thousands of highly paid employees.\nBut the supply of housing has failed to keep pace, and prices have soared. The median home value in San Jose, Calif., is now nearly $1 million, roughly double the price from 2012, according to Zillow, the real estate site.\nNow, after years of complaints that they have not done enough to be good corporate neighbors, many of those companies are digging into their vast bank accounts \u2014 and tapping some of the properties they have already acquired \u2014 to help address the problem.\nLast month, Facebook saidit would offer $1 billionin a package of grants and loans in California. Google pledged$1 billionfor a similar effort in June.\nApple is offering a hefty sum, but the company can afford it. Last year, Apple used new tax laws tobring back most of the $252 billion it held abroad. Since then, the company has been busy trying to spend that cash.\nInitiatives like Apple\u2019s \u201cdefinitely relieve some of the pressure on the housing market,\u201d said Robert Silverman, an affordable housing expert at the University at Buffalo. \u201cBut you need an extensive policy at the state or federal level to reach more people.\u201d\nThe roughly $4.5 billion from the three companies will be multiplied by other public and private sources, so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how much housing it will buy. But even billions of dollars will only dent the housing problem. New construction in California has at times been handicapped by red tape and local rules that bar the more dense housing designs that planners believe is necessary to meet demand.\nUsingcurrent construction and land prices, $4.5 billion would buy roughly 10,000 new housing units in California.According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the state needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025 to meet projected housing demand.\nA similar, though not as severe, housing crunch has played out in the Seattle area, where Amazon and Microsoft are based. Microsoft pledged$500 milliontoward affordable housing in Seattle in January.\nThe companies\u2019 investments have been cheered by local politicians and housing organizations.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said in a statement that the investment was \u201cproof that Apple is serious about solving this issue\u201d and that he hopes other companies follow suit.\nApple\u2019s plan includes $150 million in long-term forgivable loans and grants for affordable housing in the Bay Area, and a $50 million donation to address the causes of homelessness in the area.\n\u201cAffordable housing means stability and dignity, opportunity and pride,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook,said in a statement.\u201cWe know the course we are on is unsustainable, and Apple is committed to being part of the solution.\u201d\nLike the Google and Facebook announcements, Apple\u2019s $2.5 billion figure comes with questions about where and how the money will be spent.\nThe companies\u2019 announcements include land value predicated on the ability to build large amounts of housing in communities that have steadfastly resisted it, along with for-profit loans that are expected to generate a financial return \u2014 albeit smaller than what the companies could earn on more traditional investments.\nExactly how generous any of these commitments are will hinge on fine-print questions, such as whether the loans\u2019 interest rates are substantially lower than what developers could get from a bank.\nApplesaid its $1 billion affordable-housing fund would give the state and others \u201can open line of credit\u201d to build more housing. The fund will last five years, and any money paid back on the loans over that time would go back into the fund for reinvestment. Interest rates on the two- to 10-year loans would differ between projects, the company added, but all rates would be below market.\nApple also said it would buy a $1 billion pool of mortgages. As part of that transaction, Apple would spend an estimated $20 million to help first-time home buyers with their down payments.\nThe details of Apple\u2019s investments drew some criticism from the presidential campaign trail. \u201cApple\u2019s announcement that it is entering the real estate lending business is an effort to distract from the fact that it has helped create California\u2019s housing crisis,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\nPutting money toward the local housing crisis is one answer to a longtime question about Apple: What does the company intend to do with all of its money?\nBecause the company has been averse to major acquisitions \u2014 its biggest ever was paying $3 billion for the headphone maker Beats \u2014 Apple has been sending most of the money back to shareholders, which helps lift its stock price. So far, Apple has committed toreturning $175 billion to shareholders. At the end of September, Apple had $98 billion left after subtracting its debt.\nSince 2005, California has added 308 housing units for every 1,000 new residents,according to the McKinsey Global Institute. In the Bay Area, 676,000 jobs have been added over the past eight years, compared with 176,000 additional housing units.\nAs a result, the Bay Area has become one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets. In June, theNational Low Income Housing Coalitionsaid Bay Area counties accounted for five of the six most expensive places to live in the country. In September, California lawmakers approved astatewide rent capcovering millions of tenants.\nThe number ofhomeless people has multiplied, with many taking shelter in tent encampments. San Jose recently reported 6,200 homeless people, a 42 percent increase over two years.\nThe extreme housing prices around Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters have put a strain on some workers and scared off others. They areone reason Apple has accelerated its expansion elsewhere, including in Austin, Texas, where it is buildinga $1 billion campusthat could eventually accommodate 15,000 workers.\nApple\u2019s new willingness to step in financially to benefit its California neighbors is a marked difference from the days of Steve Jobs, the company co-founder. In 2011,he appeared before the Cupertino City Councilto pitch Apple\u2019s sprawling new headquarters, which now houses more than 9,000 workers.\nOne member posed a question: How would Apple\u2019s 60,000 neighbors in Cupertino benefit?\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201dMr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View,\u201d a nearby town.\nDavid Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "MOSCOW \u2014 Since itgrabbed Crimea from Ukraine five years ago, Russiahas made no headway in getting the United States or the European Union to recognize the annexed Black Sea peninsula as Russian.\nBut Russia\u2019s Parliament is now rejoicing at getting at least Apple to fall partly into line. When viewed from inside Russia, Apple apps show Crimea as part of the Russian Federation and separated from Ukraine by an international border.\nThis means that Apple has joined Google, Yandex and some other technology companies in redrawing Ukraine\u2019s borders to satisfy Moscow\u2019s territorial claims, at least for customers viewing their maps on devices inside Russia. Viewed on devices outside Russia, Crimea remains part of Ukraine.\nUnlike printed maps, online cartography can shift, providing alternative realities to comfort the likely political leanings of the viewer and the policies of his or her government. This means that borders over which armies and diplomats have battled for centuries are no longer entirely static but often follow a course that exists only in the eye of the beholder.\n\u201cOur situation with Apple has now been resolved,\u201d Vasily Piskaryov, the chairman of the security and anticorruption committee of the State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe see that everything has happened the way we wanted it.\u201d\nMr. Piskaryov told the Interfax news agency that his committee would continue to monitor Apple apps to ensure \u201cthere is no going back\u201d to previous maps that showed Crimea as part of Ukraine or as a territory belonging to neither Russia nor Ukraine.\nLeonid Levin, the head of the Duma\u2019s Information Policy Committee, told the news agency that Apple \u201chas demonstrated a wish to preserve and develop its position on the Russia market.\u201d He added that the company\u2019s decision \u201cto bring the state of its cartographic services into compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Russia can only be welcomed.\u201d\nUkraine protested Apple\u2019s cave-in to Russia, withits foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, writing on Twitterthat the company should \u201cstick to high-tech and entertainment\u201d and stay out of politics. \u201cGlobal politics is not your strong side,\u201d he said.\nThe Ukrainian Embassy in Washington also voiced dismay that Apple had accepted Russian claims.In a post on Twitter, the embassysaid that occupation did not confer sovereignty and noted that Ukrainians were \u201cnot giving any thanks to @Apple this #Thanksgiving.\u201d\nThe United States and the European Unionimposed sanctions on Russia over its seizure of Crimea, and both still view the peninsula as part of Ukraine.\nCrimea is mainly Russian-speaking and inhabited mostly by ethnic Russians, but it was recognized by Moscow \u2014 and all other capitals \u2014 as belonging to Ukraine until Russia changed its mind in 2014.\nAfter sending \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2014 Russian special forces in uniforms stripped of identifying insignia \u2014 to seize Crimean government buildings, it held a referendum that endorsed the change. Russia hailed the vote as an act of democracy, but the West viewed it as window-dressing for an unacceptable military aggression.\nApple had been negotiating with Duma representatives since May over what the Russian Parliament had denounced as its \u201cinaccurate\u201d maps of Crimea. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on the Crimea decision.\nUkraine has struggled, with considerable success, since the 2014 annexation of Crimea to prevent the appearance of maps in foreign print publication that suggest the peninsula belongs to Russia. But it has had far less success online, where frontiers often change depending on where they are being viewed from.\nAnd Russia is not the only country that has raised such a fuss over cartography. China has for years waged much the same battle over Taiwan, insisting that the self-governing island be shown as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nA growing number of American companies have in recent monthstried to appease Beijing by recognizing its claims over Taiwan. Last year, the clothing retailer Gap issued an apology to China after a map on a T-shirt sold in North America did not depict Taiwan as part of China.\nChina has also been successful in getting Apple to tailor the iPhone ecosystem to suit Beijing\u2019s demands. Apple regularly removes apps that run afoul of Chinese laws. These sometimes include apps that connect users to gambling or pornography, but also include the apps offoreign news outlets like The New York Timesandeven Apple\u2019s own news app. Apple has also removed appsthat would let users leapfrog the country\u2019s censorship controls.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at a conference two years ago that he disagreed with some Chinese policies but that Apple must comply with the law wherever it operates.\n\u201cEach country in the world decides their laws and their regulations, and so your choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?\u201d he said. \u201cYou get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Times Insiderexplains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\nOne afternoon in mid-November, two New York Times designers watched as streams of pinks, oranges, blues and greens whirred by. At the paper\u2019s printing plant in College Point, Queens, the staffers, Molly Bedford and Carrie Gee, stood in awe as the press generated a special section that they hoped would offer a new experience for print readers.\nEmbedded inside the section, \u201cThe Future of Streaming,\u201d is a 48-inch, twice-folded broadsheet known as a pano-8. Removed from the rest of the section, it acts as a self-contained reading experience.\nThe articles in the section, which rolled out online in November and were delivered in print this weekend, explored what the culture, business and nature of television and cinema will look like as major media conglomerates like Disney and Apple invest more in the streaming market.It also tackles a question that seems to be plaguing many fans of film and television: Among Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and the hundreds of other streaming services available in the United States alone, which ones are worth it?\nMs. Bedford and Ms. Gee worked closely with a team of editors in The Times\u2019s Business and Culture sections. Eight writers analyzed the cornucopia of streaming services \u2014 nine if you consider A.O. Scott, the film critic, debating his alter ego, A.O. Scott, the couch potato. They addressed the chaotic nature of streaming in the entertainment industry, and askedwhat happens when major media companies embrace disruption.\nConnor Ennis, a Business editor, said thathe and his colleaguesweighed the idea of a streaming-focused section for The Times for over a year. Mr. Ennis worked with Jim Windolf, a media editor, and Lorne Manly and Jeremy Egner of the Culture desk, and they assembled a team of reporters and critics to shed light on the chaotic nature of streaming in the entertainment industry.\n\u201cWe wanted to mark the moment in some way,\u201d Mr. Ennis said. \u201cWith a stand-alone special section, especially one that has a lot of ambitious stuff in it, that\u2019s kind of a signal to readers that this is a moment you should pay attention to, and here\u2019s a package of stories that we think is very helpful or informative.\u201d\nMs. Bedford and Ms. Gee hoped to reflect the sense of business disruption in the design. They enlisted Saiman Chow, an illustrator, who created vibrant images and a color scheme inspired by the SMPTE color bar image that was used to calibrate older TVs.\n\u201cWe wanted to give it the sense of being a little overwhelming because, as a consumer, streaming is incredibly overwhelming,\u201d Ms. Bedford said.\nMs. Gee designed a quiz, partly inspired by teen magazines, intended to help readers navigate which streaming service would best suit their interests. She imagined that people could spread this four-page questionnaire out on their living room floor and find themselves somewhere in it.\n\u201cI had this vision of people opening it and taking the quiz with their kids,\u201d Ms. Gee said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really fun, but also my parents, who are totally going to do this because the information is really good here.\u201d\n\u201cWe are visual learners and not everything needs to be told with words; it\u2019s similar when you interact with your streaming service,\u201d Ms. Bedford said.\nThe Times has used the pano-8 for special sections before.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Reach Reshapes Medical Research",
        "fulltext": "In 1976, theHarvard School of Public Healthandtwo other major medicalinstitutions started a study on nurses that has become one of the largest and longest research efforts ever conducted on women\u2019s health.They haveso far enrolled more than 275,000 participants.\nOn Thursday, the Harvard school announced an even more ambitious women\u2019s health study, one that aims to enroll a million women over a decade.\nThe new ingredients allowing the huge scale: Apple\u2019s iPhones, apps and money.\nHarvard\u2019s new study is just one of three new large research efforts that Apple is working on with leading academic research centers and health organizations. Together, the studies, which Apple is paying for, show how the Silicon Valley giant and its popularproducts are reshaping medical research.\nTo enroll in clinical trials, patients have often had to travel to medical centers to be briefed by researchers and fill out the study paperwork in person. Many studies also follow patients only intermittently, in periodic surveys and visits to hospitals.\nBut Apple tools are enabling large-scale virtual studies that can follow people as they go about their daily lives. The company has developed a research app for iPhones \u2014 which participants can download from its app store \u2014 that is helping researchers quickly and easily recruit hundreds of thousands of study volunteers.\nResearchers at Stanford Medicine, who studied whether an app on the Apple Watch could detect an irregular heartbeat condition, were able to enroll more than 400,000 participants in just eight months. Applehelped recruit volunteers by promotingthe study, which was published on Wednesday,in its app store and emailing customers who had bought Apple Watches.\nDr. Ethan Weiss, an associateprofessor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said he thought there would be many more of these so-called virtual studies,partlybecause they reduce the burden and costs compared with in-person studies.\nHe noted, however, that doctors did not yet know whether monitoring people en masse through smartphones and consumer-wearable devices would significantly improve health outcomes. \u201cThis is the big question. Is this \u2018so what\u2019? Or are we going to learn something meaningful we don\u2019t know yet?\u201d\nMichelle A. Williams, the dean of Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said she hoped the new study of women, called the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, would enable researchers to learn much more about how women\u2019s bodies and reproductive health change over time.\nThrough surveys, she said, women participating in the study may choose to provide qualitative information about their menstrual cycles, pregnancies, menopause and other health issues. Through the study\u2019s app, they may also choose to automatically share fitness, heart rate and other quantitative data gathered by their iPhones or Apple Watches.\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited about the fact that we\u2019ll be able to collect women\u2019s menstrual cycle information in ways that we\u2019ve not really done before,\u201d Professor Williams said. \u201cHaving this data on a large modern cohort is so relevant to clinical women\u2019s health today because a lot of the decision making and diagnostic protocols that we\u2019re currently using are from data from 50 years ago, when the social environment was different.\u201d\nApple\u2019s involvement in the research studies is the latest example of how the biggest tech companies are edging their way into the country\u2019s$3.5 trillion health care market. The companies are making inroads in medicine in part by exploiting their scale, along with the technologies that have helped them dominate markets like cloud computing, search, productivity tools and consumer apps.\nMicrosoft recently began testing an artificialintelligence system for hospitalsthat records, transcribes and analyzes doctor-patient conversations. Google isworking with hospitalsto analyze millions of patients\u2019 medical records in the hopes of identifying patterns to improve diagnosis and treatment.\nApple is striking out in a different direction. The company has acquired health and wellness start-ups and hired prominent medical researchers. It has made health a marketing point of its devices. Last year, it introduced an electrocardiogram app on the Apple Watch Series 4. This year it introduced menstrual cycle tracking and hearing health services for the iPhone and the watch.\nIn addition to the women\u2019s health study, Apple is sponsoring a study, led by researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, that will examine physical activity and heart data from the Apple Watch to try to identify early warning signs of declining heart health. Another study, by researchers at the University of Michigan, will collect noise level data from headphones and an iPhone app to examine how long-term sound exposure can affect hearing.\nThe names of the studies also provide a marketing opportunity: They\u2019re called the Apple Hearing Study, the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, and the Apple Heart and Movement Study.\nJeff Williams, the chief operating officer of Apple, said the company hoped the studies would bolster the understanding of women\u2019s, heart and hearing health. Apple also hopes to use the study data to improve its products or create new ones.\n\u201cWe have a noise meter on people\u2019s Apple Watches,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIf we can help them understand the sound exposure in their environment and help them avoid the problem, or at least mitigate the problem, with hearing loss, that\u2019s a huge contribution to society.\u201d\nThe Apple studies could also influence how research studies treat health privacy. Apple\u2019s research app allows study participants to granularly choose which types of information \u2014 such as heart or physical activity data \u2014 they share with researchers. Participants also have the ability to stop sharing their data or change their data-sharing category selections at any time. They can also choose to delete the current day\u2019s data before it is shared with the study.\nApple has long marketed privacy as a feature that distinguishes its products from those of its rivals like Google. Apple has said that it does not have access to consumer data collected by the iPhone Health app, for instance, because the information is stored locally on users\u2019 devices.\nFor the research studies, Apple said the technology was designed to meet federal standards for safeguarding health information. The company also said its researchers would have access to study participants\u2019 data under pseudonymous ID codes \u2014 not their names.\nBut the studies reliant on Apple devices have inherent limitations, because owners of the company\u2019s products are not representative of the general American population. People who use iPhones have a median income of about $89,000 compared with $64,510 for Android users, according to recentdata from Comscore. Among the Apple Watch users in the Apple Heart Study, there was a lower percentage of women, African-Americans, Latinos and people ages 65 or olderthan in census datafor the general population.\nProfessor Williams of Harvard said that the women\u2019s health study would ask participants for demographic information and adapt its methodology to account for any underrepresented groups.\nThere are also some concerns that Apple, which has already reshaped how people live, communicate and entertain themselves, is pursuing yet another way to influence society, this time through health.\n\u201cThe broader point here is the fact that Apple has control over the app store, that Apple has connections with all of the people that have Apple iPhones, and that Apple gets to make a lot of decisions about how you collect the data, about how to notify people to be a part of the study,\u201d said Matt Stoller, the author of a new book, \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.\u201d\nWhatever the potential health benefits, he said, \u201cit\u2019s still an extraordinary concentration of power in Apple\u2019s hands.\u201d"

        "title": "Powerful Coalition Pushes Back on Anti-Tech Fervor",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Thomas Lambert, a professor at the University of Missouri\u2019s law school, gave his former colleague Josh Hawley a warning before Mr. Hawley became a senator in January.\nMr. Lambert had been wary of Mr. Hawley\u2019s decision in 2017, as Missouri\u2019s attorney general,to open an antitrust investigationinto Google, saying he didn\u2019t see the state\u2019s logic for the case.While he wished Mr. Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Mr. Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator\u2019s policy positions.\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018I assume you mean on things like tech,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lambert recalled recently. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, mainly.\u2019\u201d\nTheir interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. Therising movement in the United Statesto consider charging the country\u2019s biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts.They include academics like Mr. Lambert; lawmakers like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.\nThese conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers.Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country.\nButtheir power and influence have never been tested like this.The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general\u2019s office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign.\nMr. Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri\u2019s law school with Mr. Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook\u2019s chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company\u2019s most valuable services.\n\u201cI firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.\nHis actions have pushed Mr. Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Mr. Hawley says he does not remember.\n\u201cThis thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\u201dMr. Lambertrecently tweetedafter Mr. Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech\u2019s critics, recentlydenouncingtheir \u201csnobbery and know-betterism.\u201d\nAt the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers, and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.\nSome proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate, and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.\n\u201cI think the antitrust laws are flexible,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted byThe Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be \u201cvigorously enforced.\u201d\nOther proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test formonopoly cases, likefactoring in the effectthat a company\u2019s dominance has on workers or competitors.Still others see a solution somewhere in between.\n\u201cWhat has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,\u201d saidDiana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.\nSome of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech\u2019s critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations.\nOthers say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast.Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that themovement to change the law \u201chas emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.\u201dThibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing \u201cshould be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.\u201d\nThe tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.\nMr. Lambert and Mr. Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law & Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies.Geoffrey Manne, the center\u2019s leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some \u201chave received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.\u201d Mr. Lambert also sits on the organization\u2019s board \u2014 a position for which, he says, he is not paid.\nOn Capitol Hill, Senator Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law.\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, Mr. Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years where he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.\nMr. Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The Google TransparencyProject, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant\u2019s connections to government,recentlyraised questions about whether he was influenced by donations fromGoogle and its allies.\nMr. Lee dismissed those accusations as \u201cparanoid fantasy.\u201d (The Google Transparency Project has itselfreceived fundingfrom Oracle, a Google competitor.)\nRecently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in the industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.\nStill, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents\u2019 position becoming rapidly more mainstream.\nMr. Lee said last month that the pushback was \u201cnot necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.\u201d\nThe debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, the soft-spoken legal academicTim Wuresponded to doubts raised byTyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.\nThe enmity goes both ways. Some conservatives have applied a dismissive nickname to the efforts to rethink the existing laws: hipster antitrust.\nThe holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them.Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Mr. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.\nMr. Lee is biding his time.\n\u201cOver the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.\u201d"

        "title": "The Week in Tech: A.I.\u2019s Threat to White-Collar Jobs",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. For one last time before I leave The New York Times, here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nThe story usually goes like this: Automation is going to take our jobs.\nBut the reality is far more nuanced, and debate rages about which jobs will be automated, at what scale and where. For the most part, one thing is agreed on: Blue-collar workers who perform repetitive work are most exposed.\nThat might not be quite right, though. Astudy published by the Brookings Institutionon Wednesday looks at the degree to which professions are exposed to A.I. by comparing job descriptions with patent descriptions of new A.I. technologies, a method developed by the Stanford researcher Michael Webb. It found that A.I. will be \u201ca significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors and analysts,\u201d including those in relatively technical roles.\nPerhaps the most surprising finding: Holders of bachelor\u2019s degrees would be exposed to A.I. over five times more than workers with only a high school degree.\n\u201cLots of math, science, technology and business roles involve, say, operating a power plant to maximize energy efficiency, or running an ad campaign to minimize cost per click,\u201d explained Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cAnd these are exactly the things that A.I. is best at.\u201d\nPreviously, similar studies lumped together robotics and A.I. But when they are picked apart, it makes sense that A.I. \u2014 which is about planning, perceiving and so on \u2014 would hit white-collar roles.\nStill, workers needn\u2019t panic. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment, said A.I. was \u201cmore likely to complement people in those jobs rather than replacing them.\u201d And Mr. Muro points out that \u201cthese workers are frequently the ones that companies have already invested in\u201d and are likely to have been consulted about their futures.\nMr. Muro added: \u201cI for one am a bit less concerned about the white-collar folks than the less educated ones stuck in dead-end service work or the gig economy.\u201d\nI recently explained howTikTok is in troublebecause the red-hot video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is under scrutiny from lawmakers in the United States. At the heart of this is a big, untested argument that Chinese laws could force TikTok, in theory, to send data to the Chinese government.\nIn an interview with The Times, TikTok\u2019s chief executive, Alex Zhu,tried to assuage Washington\u2019s fears:\nNo, TikTok does not censor videos that displease China, he said. And no, it does not share user data with China, or even with its Beijing-based parent company.\nMr. Zhu said he\u2019d personally reject an appeal for data even if it came from President Xi Jinping.\nAnd it\u2019s reportedly trying other stuff, too.The Wall Street Journal reportedthat TikTok executives had discussed \u201crebranding it in the United States\u201d and \u201cexpanding operations in Southeast Asia, possibly Singapore \u2014 which would allow executives to distance the video-sharing app from China.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s unclear how far such assurances can go.\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to assuage regulators in the U.S. without removing that ownership issue,\u201d Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me.\nIn the Times interview, Mr. Zhu said a sale of TikTok\u2019s American operations hadn\u2019t been discussed. But he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of ByteDance\u2019s reorganizing it as a separate company with a new board. It might not have much choice.\nIran has demonstrated that it\u2019s willing to take its citizens offline \u2014 and, perhaps more worryingly, that it\u2019s able to do so without plunging domestic infrastructure into chaos.\nThe Iranian government recently imposed analmost complete nationwide internet blackoutthat lasted foralmost five days. It came after protests erupted across the country after the governmentsaid it would raise gasoline prices. Amnesty International estimated that as many as 106 people were killed.\nMahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, explained to me in an email that the Iranian government was trying to limit the spread of evidence of state violence.\n\u201cThe deaths and the ruthless images of authorities raining bullets on protesters that are being disseminated are not the images they want dominating their narrative,\u201d she said.\nBlocking internet traffic and, by extension, social media certainly cuts information flows. But there\u2019s little evidence that internet blackouts undermine protests. A2018 report by Human Rights Watchfound \u201cno substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.\u201d That Iran\u2019s blackout persisted, Ms. Alimardani said, was a strong indication that it had done little to calm the protests.\nBut the shutdown revealed one success for Iran\u2019s government: its National Information Network, a domestic, highly censored digital infrastructure. That infrastructure enabled the nation\u2019s critical services, such as finance and health care, to largely operate normally, demonstrating that the country is well equipped to shut down the public internet.\n\u201cThey are proving they can and will cut people off if they question authorities again,\u201d Ms. Alimardani said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d it once said. But Google\u2019s internal mantra now looks like it could be more like: \u201cDon\u2019t question the management.\u201d\nIt has come to light that Google hasended its biweekly all-hands meetings. The decision was made just days after Google employeesprotested the interrogation of two colleaguesby the company\u2019s investigations team, according to CNBC. And it all comes on the back of a staff protest last year over the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment complaints, vibrant discussions on internal memo boards about company policies and pushback from some workers about Google\u2019s work in China and with the United States military.\nThen, this past week, it transpired that Google had hiredan anti-union consulting firm to advise its managementas it deals with worker unrest.\nIt\u2019s still too early to tell how this will shake out at Google. But what\u2019s clear is that the company\u2019s traditional embrace of transparency and flexibility for workers is straining as more employees question its motives and actions.\nWhat caused Uber\u2019s autonomous car crash in 2018?The main reason, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, was thesafety driver\u2019s failure to monitor the road.\nPresident Trump visited a Texas factory that builds Apple computersandmade a series of inaccurate comments. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, didn\u2019t correct him \u2014 perhaps thinking that it might make it harder for the company to get a tariff waiver?\nThe Commerce Department extended Huawei\u2019s reprieveso that itcan still buy goods from American companies for another 90 days, and approved \u201cseveral\u201d individual licenses for American companies to do business with Huawei, while it remains on a trade blacklist.\nThe Federal Trade Commission said it waspursuing \u201cmultiple\u201d antitrust investigationsinto major digital platforms alongside its inquiry into Facebook.\nExpect Europe to get even tougher on Big Tech.In her second term as the head of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust division, Margrethe Vestagerplans to double down.\nGoogle\u2019s new cloud gaming platform, Stadia, went on sale.It\u2019s supposed to replace consoles, but the verdict of our reviewer was:Don\u2019t bother.\nDisney Plus was hacked, according toan investigation by ZDNet, and leaked user credentials apparently changed hands for as little as $3 each.\nT-Mobile\u2019s John Legere willstep down as chief executiveearly next year. It\u2019s unlikely that his successor, Mike Sievert, can possibly wear as much magenta.\nDeep fakes: Believe at your own risk.A.I. engineers create ultrarealistic videos that will have you questioning realityon \u201cThe Weekly,\u201dour TV showSunday on FX andstreaming Monday on Hulu.\nThe Bits newsletter will take a break next week for the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.

        "fulltext": "Apple canceled the premiere of\u201cThe Banker,\u201dstarring Samuel L. Jackson, on Wednesday, yanking the movie from its prestigious closing-night Thursday slot at the American Film Institute\u2019s annual festival in Los Angeles.\nApple, a newcomer to the entertainment business, acquired the movie in July and planned to put it in theaters nationwide Dec. 6 before making it available on the streaming service Apple TV Plus in January. AFI Fest\u2019s acceptance of the film, a civil-rights drama set in midcentury America, was a sign that it had Academy Awards potential.\n\u201cLast week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.\u201d\n\u201cThe Banker\u201d is based on the true story ofBernard Garrettand Joseph Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who sought to financially empower black Americans by buying homes in white neighborhoods for them to rent and offering loans to black-owned businesses. Trying to get around discrimination by the banking establishment, they recruited a working-class white man as their frontman.\nThe pair later expanded their ambitions, acquiring banks in the South. In 1965, Mr. Garrett and Mr. Morris testified at a congressional hearing on misconduct in the federally insured banking system, and they were later convicted of misusing funds.\nOne person with knowledge of Apple\u2019s decision,who was not authorized to speak publicly, said a relative of one of the film\u2019s main characters had raised some concerns.\nThe American Film Institute did not receive news of Apple\u2019s decision until Wednesday. \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d a Netflix movie starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, will close the festival in its place. Apple has yet to make a final decision about the film\u2019s theatrical release.\nApple announced itself as a major Hollywood player with the start of Apple TV Plus on Nov. 1, but its move into entertainment has had a few bumps. Its flagship series,\u201cThe Morning Show,\u201da big-budget drama starring Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell, has received mixed reviews.\n\u201cWhen those reviews came in, I didn\u2019t know what show they were watching,\u201d Mimi Leder, an executive producer of the series who directed some of its episodes, said Tuesday at a conference sponsored by Recode in Los Angeles. \u201cI thought they were nuts. The reviews felt like an attack on Apple.\u201d\n\u201cThe Banker\u201d was originally going to have an R rating, mainly because of the language used by Mr. Jackson\u2019s character, but the filmmakers successfully appealed to the Motion Picture Association of America and won a PG-13 rating.\nThey argued that black teenagers under 17, who would not be allowed to attend an R-rated movie without an adult, should be free to see a movie about a largely forgotten civil rights triumph and black financial empowerment, said Marshall Mitchell, a consultant on the film. He described the ratings debate during a talk after a screening of the film on Saturday."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A mile from Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino lies the sun-faded carcass of the Vallco Shopping Mall. At the moment it consists of empty, buff-colored buildings, acres of black asphalt and a pile of rubble where the parking garage used to be.\nAbout a year ago, a developer submitted a proposal to build 2,400 apartments on the site, half of them subsidized to put rents below the market rate. The city approved the plan reluctantly, and afterward a community group sued. The project is stuck in court.\nStories like that hang heavy over Apple\u2019s $2.5 billion plan, announced Monday, to help solve the dire shortage of affordable housing that has come to dominate life and politics in the most populous state. The pledge cameweeks afterFacebook announced $1 billion for a similar program, andmonths after Googledid the same. Earlier, in January,Microsoft committed $500 millionfor affordable housing in the Seattle area.\nBeyond public relations, the moves amount to a statement from some of the tech industry\u2019s largest employers that they are starting to take a more active role in addressing the chronic regional housing shortage that makes their expansion difficult \u2014 not just for their employees, but for the public at large.\nBut don\u2019t expect the money to make much of a difference. A few billion dollars doesn\u2019t buy a lot in California\u2019s punitively expensive housing market. Even if it did, the companies\u2019 announcements were accompanied by crucial yet mostly unanswered questions like where, how and when this money will be spent. And as the Vallco struggle illustrates, the biggest question is the one California has long wrestled with: how to get much-needed housing built when local governments and homeowners do everything they can to prevent it.\n\u201cThese investments are an opportunity, because clearly the tech companies want to engage and want their money to make a difference,\u201d said Carol Galante, faculty director of theTerner Center for Housing Innovationat the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cAnd yet, this scattershot approach, not just with each of them putting out their own announcements, but not having them coordinated with the larger conversation about how we are going to make the public policy changes that the Legislature is struggling with \u2014 unless you marry those things together, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\nThe housing programs announced by Apple and other companies are not philanthropy, but commitments to make affordable housinginvestments\u2014 for profit \u2014 in the form of corporate land and money. The details vary, but each company said it would allow housing development on land it already owned, and issue loans whose terms and interest rates are implicitly more generous than the terms that developers currently get from banks, but whose true costs will take years to figure out.\nApple said its plan would, among other things, create an affordable-housing fund that would give the state and others \u201can open line of credit\u201d to build more affordable housing beyond land that it owns. The company expects to make money from the financing, but for the returns to be lower than what it would earn on investment-grade securities where corporate holdings traditionally lie.\nA typical affordable-housing deal can have a dozen or more funding sources that encompass state, local and federal housing programs, along with bank loans and equity investments from private companies. Tech companies are in a sense positioning themselves to join that pool to aid the construction of housing at all levels \u2014 supportive housing for the formerly homeless, middle-income housing for teachers and others priced out of the area, and market-rate units of the sort where their employees might live.\nFew would disagree that putting money toward affordable housing investment is a positive move. Ms. Galante, the former head of BRIDGE Housing, one of the country\u2019s largest nonprofit housing developers, was emphatic that more money for subsidized housing, whatever its source, must be part of the long-term solution. But in the context ofCalifornia\u2019s housing problems\u2014 which are rooted in intransigent local politics, not a lack of money \u2014 even the billions from tech companies can seem inconsequential.\nConsider the math. At the moment it costs about $450,000, and considerably more in high-cost areas like the Bay Area and Los Angeles, to build a single unit of subsidized affordable housing in California, according to the Terner Center. That is by far the highest of any state, and just short of twice the nation\u2019s median home value. And it\u2019s not as if these are houses. The $450,000 figure is for an apartment of modest dimensions in a multifamily building, with standard layouts, bargain finishes and few of the amenities of for-profit development.\nGiven those figures, the $4.5 billion that Google, Apple and Facebook have earmarked would create about 10,000 housing units. To be sure, the companies\u2019 money will stretch further on already-owned land, and it is likely to be augmented by other public and private funding sources, which is why Google and Facebook estimated that their investments would produce a combined total of 40,000 housing units in the Bay Area.\nEven when the money is multiplied, however, the magnitude of the housing shortage remains pulverizing to any checkbook. According to a widely cited figure that originated with a2016 reportby the McKinsey Global Institute, California needs to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025 \u2014 more than three times the current pace \u2014 to address its shortage and regain any semblance of affordability. The theoretical cost is outlandish ($1.6 trillion), and while Gov. Gavin Newsomcampaigned on McKinsey\u2019s 3.5 million figure, his office now refers to it as \u201ca stretch goal.\u201d\nNone of this is to say that California\u2019s housing problem is unsolvable, or that tech companies shouldn\u2019t be helping. It\u2019s to make the point that if single- or even double-digit billions were enough to even dent the problem, it would have been dented long ago.\n\u201cFor 50 years, California has been designed around the idea that everyone will have a single-family home with a yard, that they will drive everywhere, and that geometry no longer works,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who last year introduceda billto make it easier to build housing near transit lines. \u201cCalifornia cities have systematically made it hard to impossible to build housing, and money can\u2019t fix that.\u201d\nAs it stands, the housing situation is getting worse, with homeless counts rising in cities likeLos Angeles,San FranciscoandOakland, despite costly efforts to ease it. The pace of California development isactually slowing, with some developerssuspending projectsbecause costs are so high that even multimillion-dollar condos and $4,000-a-month one-bedrooms won\u2019t yield a profit.\nHigh taxes are often cited, particularly by Republicans, as the reason California is a difficult place to put down roots, but the real cudgel is housing costs. After a decade-long growth streak in which California has consistently outperformed the nation by most economic measures, and despite a 4 percent unemployment rate that is thelowest on record, the state continues to seemore people move out than in. That is: The cost of housing has caused people to flee one of the hottest job markets in the nation, in one of the most beautiful places on earth.\nIn fact, economists\u2019 reports on the state\u2019s outlook often cite housing costs, not trade wars or a tech bubble, as one of the biggest question marks for future growth. Over the past year, the Bay Area\u2019s labor force \u2014 the number of people working or looking for work \u2014 has declined. Taken literally, the numbers imply that positions are being added by giving people second jobs and enticing workers tocommute from outside the region.\n\u201cPeople say housing costs are driving people out of the state,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm. \u201cNo, housing supply is driving people out of the state.\u201d\nThe Bay Area has added 676,000 jobs over the past eight years, and 176,000 additional housing units, a ratio far from the 1.5 jobs per housing unit that planners consider healthy. Cities like Palo Alto have ratios as high as four jobs per housing unit, which, judged by their swollen daytime populations, make them more Manhattan-like than Manhattan.\nWhile tech companies are widely blamed for causing the housing crisis, policy experts say that it results from decades of political decisions \u2014 and that tech companies are merely stuffing workers into office buildings that local governments have repeatedly approved while resisting new housing.\nSo far technology companies have largely been content to send fleets of private buses to ferry employees to work from ever-farther locales. But now even tech employees, despite high salaries, are not immune. Some tech executives say the prospect of a move to California, once an asset in recruiting, is now a liability.\nGoogle has said its work force is growing faster outside the Bay Area than in it, while Apple is planning tobuild a campus in Austin, Texas. But the companies also seem intent on adding tens of thousands of employees in and around their headquarters \u2014 a prospect that has become more difficult, with cities like Cupertino andPalo Altonow trying to slow the growth of office space.\n\u201cWe want to create an environment where people have access to good-paying jobs and producing more of them is seen as a positive and not a negative,\u201d Menka Sethi, director of location strategy for Facebook, said after the company announced its affordable-housing investment in October. \u201cUntil we solve the housing crisis, I don\u2019t think we are going to get back to that narrative.\u201d"
