        "fulltext": "In the last 24 hours, the Apple rumor-and-news-mill has been doing all it can to eliminate any last iota of surprise about what the company is planning to unveil this week.\nAhead of themedia eventthat Apple is holding on Wednesday to introduce its newest iPhones, the tech blogosphere has gotten even more hyped up over the details of what the company will show during a keynote presentation. It\u2019s all part of aglobal ecosystem of informationthat surrounds Apple that David Streitfeld wrote about earlier this week, which helps set the stage for what to expect.\nSo what are some of the latest Apple tidbits? Here are a few:\n\u25a0 Apple is expected to announce new wireless earbuds called \u201cAirPods,\u201dwrites AppleInsider, as the company eliminates headphone jacks from the smartphones and moves people toward wireless headphones.\n\u25a0 Apple has filed a list of trademarks that could be names for some of its new products; the names include \u201cAirPod Case,\u201d \u201cIris Engine\u201d and \u201ciBooks Storytime,\u201dwrites Brian Conroy, an intellectual property lawyer who keeps track of trademarks.\n\u25a0 For more of what to expect from the Apple event, read some of the various recaps. Here\u2019sone from CBS,another from CNN Money,this from Motley Fool, and, well, you get the picture. There are a lot.\nWe have our own look at what to expect here. And during the event, tech reporters Brian X.

        "title": "How Companies Like Apple Dodge Taxes and Their Own Investors",
        "fulltext": "As an investor, one who has been entrusted with helping to safeguard other people\u2019s money over many years, I value the high degree of disclosure required from American public companies. Corporations and the world in which they operate change every day, so investors need to know the risks their money faces.\nNo area of business demonstrates the need for full disclosure as much as one that has been in the news a lot lately: large American companies\u2019 shifting profits overseas to minimize tax bills, or to avoid taxes altogether. These schemes are starting to attract the attention of regulators and governments who view them more as tax dodges than as legitimate financial arrangements.\nGiven the risks, the last thing investors need is less disclosure. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible to ensure that companies are being open and honest, is considering exactly that: scaling back the information available to the public.\nEarlier this year, the S.E.C.published 340 questionsseeking feedback about what companies should be required to disclose to investors as part of the agency\u2019s \u201cDisclosure Effectiveness Initiative\u201d \u2014 a process that was startedfollowing commentsby the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Jo White. She warned of \u201cinformation overload,\u201d which made it difficult for an investor \u201cto wade through the volume of information she receives to ferret out the information that is most relevant.\u201d\nThis is the wrong direction. We need more information, not less.\nWhen the S.E.C. was created in the 1930s, we did not have multinational companies with scores of foreign subsidiaries or the constant risk of government crackdowns on shady tax maneuvers. Today, there are an estimated $2.3 trillion in Fortune 500 company revenues currently booked in tax havens.\nLately, these companies have been running into opposition from government regulators. Apple has accumulated billions in profits and, with the assistance of tax-haven-based subsidiaries, managed to pay little tax on those profits to any national government anywhere in the world. As a result of its near-zero tax arrangement with Ireland, Apple will now be embroiled for years in lawsuits relating to a ruling by Europe\u2019s antitrust enforcer, which ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes.\nEarlier this year, French tax authorities raided the Paris offices of Google, and Spanish tax authorities did the same in Madrid. Both countries are calling for billions in back taxes.\nSeveral years ago, members of the British government called for a consumer boycott of Starbucks because the company paid no taxes in Britain (all of its revenue was offset by \u201cexpenses\u201d paid in other jurisdictions).\nIncredibly, even though the blowback against egregious tax practices is a substantial risk to multinational companies and a significant threat for shareholders, it is often impossible for investors to determine how healthy a company really is and whether or not the profits are merely a reflection of aggressive tax planning.\nThe S.E.C.\u2019s mandate is to require companies to provide full disclosure to a \u201creasonable investor.\u201d But no reasonable investor could have known the full scope of Apple\u2019s overseas tax shelters, which were not detailed in the company\u2019s financial releases. That took multiple investigators with subpoena power working for a United States Senate subcommittee nearly a year. And there was no obvious way for investors to know the particulars of Apple\u2019s Irish deal or how risky it might prove to be.\nAnd even when disclosures are made, the sheer complexity of a company\u2019s international taxes can make even the most elemental decision impossible. During the dispute of a management buyout of Dell Computer earlier this year, two experts in valuation science, using similar methods and principles, were asked to come up with a ballpark figure for Dell\u2019s true value. Their estimates differed by $28 billion, largely because they reached different conclusions about the company\u2019s overseas taxes.\nWith companies engaging in high-risk tax avoidance, the investing public needs more information, clearly expressed. Investors should, at a minimum, be given a list of all countries in which a company operates, the revenue and earnings attributed to each country, and the amount of taxes paid in each. There might still be disputes but at least investors would be working from the same numbers.\nNothing in the current S.E.C. rules requires even that simple statement from companies. If we are going to protect the integrity of the market, we should start by requiring companies to report exactly how they are doing business, including where they pay taxes and how much. The world has changed, and our rules must change with it."

        "title": "Ireland Doesn\u2019t Want Apple\u2019s Back Taxes, but the Irish Aren\u2019t So Sure",
        "fulltext": "CORK, Ireland \u2014 When European officials ordered Ireland tocollect a record $14.5 billionin back taxes from Apple, Kieran O\u2019Connell drew up a wish list for spending the money.\nA public social worker who deals with at-risk youth, Mr. O\u2019Connell has faced drastic cuts since the Irish governmentimposed austerity measuressix years ago during a financial crisis. His salary was frozen and his pension taxed. With his agency\u2019s budget shrunk 30 percent, he hasn\u2019t been able to replace staff, keep up with the demand for addiction and retraining programs or accommodate all the homeless teenagers looking for shelter.\n\u201cYou could invest it in treatment centers, detox beds and community care,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Connell, 50, who works in this southern Irish city, where Applehas hadits European headquarters for more than 35 years.\nBut Ireland doesn\u2019t want Apple\u2019s billions. Instead, the Irish government is appealing Europe\u2019s tax ruling, a move that is exposing a rift in a country still feeling the aftershocks fromyears of harsh cutbacks.\nThe Irish government\u2019s defense is a mixture of financial realpolitik, national pride and damage limitation. The European Union\u2019s decision takes direct aim at some of the country\u2019s generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple\u2019s case.\nLocal lawmakers, in part, worry that taking the tech giant\u2019s billions could scare off other multinationals from investing in Ireland just as other countries vie to entice them. Many people across the country are also upset that European officials are meddling with the country\u2019s tax policies. Apple, which is also appealing,is taking the same stand, calling the case \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\nBut it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple\u2019s tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included.\nThe money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes.\nIn Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 percent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 percent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs.\n\u201cThat money could create at least 100,000 jobs,\u201d said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. \u201cIt would have a transformative effect.\u201d\nThis tug of war over Apple\u2019s money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn.\nMuch of the country\u2019s long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 percent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics.\nAnd Ireland is hoping to entice even more. Countries around the region are lining up to woo companies thinking about leaving Britain after itvoted in Juneto leave the European Union.\nWhile the Irish are eager for the jobs offered by international companies, years of belt-tightening are highlighting the yawning inequalities of policies that allow the world\u2019s richest companies to sidestep billions in taxes. Theimproving economyonly adds to the debate. Ireland has roared back from recession, but much of the recent growth is related to financial maneuvering and not longstanding improvements in the domestic economy.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a problem with government\u2019s appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?\u201d said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork\u2019s local government.\nAlmost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 percent less cash in his pocket.\n\u201cThe Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple,\u201d Mr. Connolly added.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has been quick to defend the company\u2019s tax practices. \u201cWhen you\u2019re accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you,\u201dhe said in an interviewwith the Irish broadcaster RTE. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the case.\nCork, with a population of about 125,000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and Irish-style austerity.\nA Starbucks in a refurbished 19th-century building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city center, attracts a techie crowd of 20-something millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech. High-end stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings.\nYet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiraling personal debt.\nA longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin.\nApple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork\u2019s suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where glass-fronted buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company.\nApple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area\u2019s largest employers. Its army of over 5,000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores.\nWhen Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labor costs sent production to Asia, the company\u2019s Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support.\n\u201cCork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin,\u201d said Des Cahill, the city\u2019s mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. \u201cWe\u2019re like an old married couple.\u201d\nJust a few minutes\u2019 walk from Apple\u2019s main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the late-summer sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing well-paying jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of high-tech skills.\nIn Cork\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, austerity has meant layoffs, economic uncertainty and often little support. The number of people living on the streetsjumpedto 345 last year compared with just 38 in 2011, according toCork Simon, a local homeless charity. The city\u2019s annual budget has been cut by 20 percent, to $170 million, over the same period.\nFor Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness.\nLike most people in Cork, Mr. Harrington, 53, said international companies \u2014 and the jobs they created \u2014 were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn\u2019t think tax rules are equally applied.\nWhen he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalize his small-scale tax avoidance, Mr. Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple?\n\u201cIf the big guys don\u2019t pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too,\u201d he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. \u201cThey owe the money, so they should just pay it.\u201d"

        "title": "E.U. Rules Look to Unify Digital Market, but U.S. Sees Protectionism",
        "fulltext": "Google may have to pay publishers for their content. Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.\nA new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.\nEurope calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.\nIn some ways, they are both right.\nIn a decade of sluggish growth, local lawmakers assert that these proposed changes will bring together the region\u2019s national economies into a so-calledsingle digital market.\nThe aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.\nFor many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.\nThe plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:\n\u25a0 Potentially giving publishers the right to charge Google and other internet companies, if they so choose, when they use online content from newspapers or magazines on news aggregation websites, like Google News. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter also could be affected. Similar rules have already been passed inGermanyandSpain, but with little success.\n\u25a0 Placing greater scrutiny on internet phone and messaging services like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, which may require them to comply with tougher telecommunications standards that now apply only to traditional text messaging and voice calls. Telecom groups say these new services are similar to text messages and soshould be regulatedunder the same rules. The tech companies believe they provide a different option for consumers and should not be encumbered with outdated regulation.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\n\u25a0 Giving European consumers the right to watch and buy some premium and online streaming content fromacross the bloc. Movie studios, sports rights holders and other broadcasters say the plans could reduce the value of their content, allowing people to buy services from the country that offers the lowest price.\n\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks. Operators may be given greater control over their internet infrastructure, potentially restricting competitors\u2019 use of these networks. Companies say such limits are needed to guarantee a return on the billions of dollars of digital investment. Consumer groups argue that it may lead to higher prices.\nEurope\u2019s proposals, which could still be subject to last-minute changes before being published, were confirmed by six people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the reforms had not yet been made public.\nFor their part, European policy makers say theyare only following the region\u2019s stringent lawsaimed at protecting people\u2019s rights in an increasingly digital world and are not specifically targeting American tech giants.\nBut with things like Europe\u2019srecord $14.5 billion claimagainst Apple for unpaid taxes and aseries of antitrust chargesagainst Google, the European Union has become a thorn in the side of many of the world\u2019s largest companies, requiring them either to alter how they offer online services worldwide or fight protracted legal battles to fend off the Continent\u2019s regulators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life that most innovative companies come from the West Coast,\u201d said Andrej Savin, an internet governance professor at the Copenhagen Business School. \u201cThe proposals coming from Brussels definitely have the American companies in mind.\u201d\nEurope has long fought to reduce this reliance on West Coast tech companies, but even homegrown success stories like Spotify, the Swedish music-streaming servicenow valuedat more than $8 billion, became a worldwide hit mostly through its expansion to the United States.\nIn part, Europe has failed to compete successfully with the United States because Europeanscan\u2019t get enough of usingAmerican digital products and services, often relying on them at a higher rate than their American counterparts.\nWith a roughly 90 percent market share, Google\u2019s search engine in Europe is more dominant than it is in the United States, where Microsoft\u2019s Bing service still holds its own. Facebook has more European users than American ones, while Germany and Britain remain two of Amazon\u2019s largest international markets.\nThe latest digital reforms \u2014 either on purpose or by coincidence, depending on people\u2019s viewpoints \u2014 take aim at that dominance, and potentially give European publishers and telecom companies a helping hand to compete head-on with their American rivals."

On Wednesday, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Brian X. Chen broke the news thatApple has been in discussions to buy a San Francisco start-up, Lit Motors, which specializes in electric self-balancing motorcycles.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Watch Updates: What You Really Need to Know",
        "fulltext": "APPLE\u2019S newiPhones and an upgraded Apple Watchhave generated tons of noise and hype.\nFor those wondering what to do with the plethora of information, here is what you really need to know: You need not rush to upgrade your iPhone or Apple Watch if you recently bought one. The people who may want to jump to buy one of the new devices are those who have owned their current iPhone for more than two years.\nThese conclusions result from a close look atApple\u2019s announcements on Wednesday, when it unveiled new iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, and a new Apple Watch, the Watch Series 2.\nFor the most part,the new gadgets looked like their predecessors, though a closer examination showed some bigger changes to the smaller components of the devices. For example, the new iPhones, which come in two sizes, are faster and water-resistant, with improved cameras and revised home buttons with force sensitivity. The new watch has a GPS sensor to enhance fitness tracking.\nYet for all smartphone owners, the biggest change to the iPhone may be the omission of the headphone jack, a connector that many have been attached to for decades. Apple said it left out the headphone jack in favor of other benefits, like cramming in faster chips and a better battery.\n\u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word: courage,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe courage to move on, do something new that betters all of us.\u201d\nIf the headphone jack removal is the biggest change, that underlines how much of what Apple unveiled on Wednesday was incremental. So there is no need to stampede to an Apple store to snap up the new products when they become available this month, unless your gadget is so out-of-date that it is time to get with 2016.\nHere is what you need to know about Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, with tips on how to prepare for the death of the headphone jack if you plan to buy a new Apple phone.\nApple\u2019siPhone 7 and 7 Pluslook roughly the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The new phones have rounded corners, and the smaller model continues to have a 4.7-inch screen whereas the larger one has a 5.5-inch screen.\nSo what is new? The iPhones have a new processor that is about 40 percent faster than the previous models. They also include a physical home button with force sensitivity for the first time, a feature that responds with a vibration when the button is pressed. As a result, the button no longer depresses when it is pressed, which might make it more durable than previous iterations.\nThe new iPhones also include improved cameras capable of capturing a wider color range. The larger model, the 7 Plus, has two cameras on the rear that work together to improve zooming capability.\nOther than that, the iPhones will continue to come in silver, gold and pink, with two new colors: matte black and shiny black. The antenna bands, which were thick lines wrapping around the back of the older iPhones, are no longer visible on the new iPhones, making the devices look cleaner.\nThe biggest change is the item that is missing: The 3.5-millimeter audio port for plugging in earphones and speakers. Apple says it sacrificed the port to make more room for faster processors and better battery life while making the device water and dust resistant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fighting for space within that same enclosure,\u201d Mr. Schiller said about the many components in a smartphone, including the headphone jack.\nApple isencouraging users to instead consider wireless accessoriesor wired earphones that hook in through the iPhone\u2019s Lightning connector, which is also used for power charging.\nThe new iPhones will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $649 for the iPhone 7 and $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus. They can be ordered online beginning on Friday.\nWhat can consumers do about the removal of the audio jack? For many people, plugging in headphones has become a habit that helped turn their phone into a moving stereo or video player on their daily commute or at the gym.\nCoping with the change depends on the type of audio accessories you use. For consumers who want to cling to their wired audio gear, Apple is making the transition less painful by including a converter with the new iPhones. Basically, that is a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in the audio accessory.\nSo the good news: You won\u2019t have to buy new audio gear. But on the downside, you will have to carry a tiny, easy-to-lose dongle; replacements cost $9.\nThat may make it a good time to consider embracing wireless audio, which has improved significantly over the last few years. Many wireless accessories connect with the Bluetooth standard, which is supported by the new iPhones. Among many that I have tried over the last year,Bose\u2019s QuietComfort 35are excellent noise-canceling headphones, andLogitech\u2019s UE Rollis a versatile, waterproof wireless speaker.\nThe car is another matter. If you are accustomed to connecting your smartphone to your car stereo using the headphone jack, you could use the Lightning-to-audio-jack converter. Or you could buy a Bluetooth kit, like Anker\u2019s SoundSync Drive, which waspicked by The Wirecutter, the product recommendations website. It plugs into a car stereo\u2019s audio jack and creates a Bluetooth connection to wirelessly connect to the iPhone 7 for music and phone calls.\nApple alsoupgraded the Apple Watch, its smartwatch that acts as a companion for the iPhone. The new version includes GPS for tracking your runs. The device is water-resistant for swimmers.\nThe new watch, Series 2, is also faster than the previous one. It will start shipping on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $370.\nThese are still incremental upgrades from the first version of the Watch. The biggest change is a new ceramic finish for the high-end version of Apple Watch, called Edition, which has a starting price of $1,250.\nApple also revised the operating system powering the Apple Watch, called WatchOS. The new version, WatchOS 3, will introduce a more intuitive interface and be included with the new Apple Watch. WatchOS 3 will also be available as a free software update for the last Apple Watch.\nIn the end, Apple\u2019s product event on Wednesday may have been more about theater than substantive changes to its devices.\n\u201cThe iPhone 7 packed few surprises,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research. \u201cThis event was a big test of Apple\u2019s ability to continue to tell a compelling story around its annual product upgrades.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Apple unveiled new iPhonesat an event on Wednesday, as it has done every September for the last few years.\nThe event, held in San Francisco\u2019s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, was the company\u2019s most important outing of the year. Even as the iPhone remains the outsize producer of Apple\u2019s revenue and profit, sales of the smartphone haverecently been declining. So more than ever, the onus is on Apple to keep up excitement for the gadget.\nWhat was different this time was that people were focused on something that the newiPhones lack, rather than a flashy new feature. The item that disappeared is the traditional headphone jack, with Apple turning people toward wireless headphones instead.\nBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Katie Benner were at the event to provide live analysis of what you need to know about the announcements, not what you don\u2019t.\nHere\u2019s what Appleannounced:\n\u25a0 New iPhones, called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\n\u25a0 The new iPhones lack a headphone jack.\n\u25a0 The new iPhones have a revised home button with force sensitivity, which will vibrate to give feedback.\n\u25a0 The iPhones are water-resistant.\n\u25a0 The Plus model of the new iPhone includes a dual-lens camera to take professional-grade photos.\n\u25a0 A new Apple Watch, called Apple Watch Series 2, which includes GPS.\n\u25a0 Pok\u00e9mon Go is available for Apple Watch.\n\u25a0 An update on how Apple Music is performing.\n\u25a0 Tweaks to its iWork suite of productivity apps.\nFarhad:This was a tricky event because there wasn\u2019t much new to the products. The iPhone has the same design as last year\u2019s (and the one the year before) and the major new thing is \u2026 a missing headphone jack. So what I was watching for was Apple\u2019s reality distortion field: How will Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, and friendsconvince us that taking away a feature is really an advancefor the iPhone?\nBrian:As Farhad said, the new iPhones \u2014 and also the Watches \u2014 look largely the same as their predecessors. The takeaway for me was that Apple focused on making the most significant changes to the tiniest components: camera sensors, upgraded chips, a revised home button and the addition of GPS to the watch. I get the impression that they are saving the big changes for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone next year.\nSo if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I\u2019d encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.\nKatie:Apple didn\u2019t offer a new killer product or a drastic update to any of the products in its lineup. Instead, Apple piled on new features \u2014 like water-resistance, stereo speakers, wireless headphones and camera features \u2014 to appeal to specific niche buyers. Frank Gillett at Forrester Research called this strategy an accumulation of compelling new features that Apple hopes will \u201cmotivate the trend followers to buy new iPhones, and expose other buyers to the benefits they\u2019ve built into iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2.\u201d\nPerhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.\nFarhad:Apple likes road maps. That\u2019s what you saw today. The company clearly has deep, long-term plans for the iPhone \u2014 it wants to improve wireless functioning, it wants to keep pushing on the camera, and it will keep improving performance without sacrificing battery life.\nThe problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.\nKatie:For the past few quarters, Apple has emphasized that services and software will drive growth as iPhone revenue ebbs. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Mr. Cook underlined that. He kicked off the morning with updates on two of the company\u2019s most important software and services divisions \u2014 Apple Music and the App Store.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201d\nMr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.\nBrian:In another nod to software, Mr. Cook said Super Mario is coming to the App Store. Nintendo, the struggling video game company, long refused to offer its games and franchise characters on mobile devices, but the company recently did a 180, with Pok\u00e9mon Go as a recent example. The change seems more beneficial to Nintendo than to Apple. Pok\u00e9mon Go was a huge success, at least initially, proving that app stores are a viable revenue stream for Nintendo beyond its consoles.\nApple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.\nFarhad:The education market has been important to Apple for decades, and for the last few years it has pushed the iPad as the perfect school computer. It did so again today, with those tweaks to its iWork software aimed at schools.\nBut Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.\nBrian:The new Apple Watch is called Apple Watch Series 2. It emphasizes fitness and health, with Apple showing a video of runners, gymnasts and swimmers using the watch. One major criticism of Apple Watch was that it did a bit of everything and did not have any strengths. Apple is trying to beef up the fitness capabilities, similar to Fitbit. The new version is water-resistant up to 50 meters (164 feet). It also includes GPS for tracking runs. The watch is faster than the previous version.\nKatie:Whether Apple Watch has been successful or not has largely been a mystery. Apple doesn\u2019t break out Watch revenue in its earnings. But Mr. Cook pulled back the curtain a little when he revealed that Apple is now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex. The Apple Watch is also the top-selling smartwatch, even though a killer app has yet to emerge for the watch. The company is hoping to change that with the introduction of a Pok\u00e9mon Go app for the watch.\nBrian:It\u2019s important to note that Apple Watch sales don\u2019t appear to be growing much. IDC, the research firm,estimates that Apple Watch market sharein the wearables market shrank 56.7 percent last quarter compared to the same period last year. That\u2019s largely because consumers have probably been waiting for a new version to come out before deciding whether to buy a watch. It\u2019s definitely still a nascent device.\nFarhad:This is the first Apple event in a few years that didn\u2019t feature any redesigned hardware. But there is a new ceramic finish for the Watch that comes closest to some new design.\nThe gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.\nBrian:For now, my advice to consumers: I see no compelling reason for people with Version One of the device to upgrade unless they are fitness buffs.\nThe addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.\nKatie:Leading up to the event, the most ballyhooed update was Apple\u2019s decision to eliminate the headphone jack. On Wednesday, Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, saved that announcement for last.\nRemoving the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.\n\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.\nThe update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.\nWhy remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201d\nFarhad:Apple said the most important reason it\u2019s removing the headphone jack is because it believes in a \u201cwireless future\u201d for audio. It\u2019s making that future a reality with a new set of wireless headphones, called AirPods. They look like Apple\u2019s wired earbuds, without the wires; they apparently just slip in your ears.\nPerhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.\nBrian:Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, said in a video at the event that we are \u201cjust at the beginning of a truly wireless future.\u201d But wireless earphones have been around for years, and Bluetooth wireless technology has become excellent. This is another example of Apple\u2019s being a latecomer to a market and saying it will make a better product than earlier ones.\nFarhad:The reality distortion was in force in other ways. In true Apple fashion, we got a deep-dive video into the development process for the iPhone 7, with not even a nod to the fact that the phone looks nearly identical to the one Apple released last year and the one the year before. Because it has a new color and a new Apple logo, Apple insists it\u2019s \u201ca beautiful new design.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.\nOne area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d billboards."

        "title": "What\u2019s Really Missing From the New iPhone: Cutting-Edge Design",
        "fulltext": "Forget about the headphone jack for a second.\nSure, it\u2019s pretty annoying that Apple\u2019s newest iPhones \u2014 the 7 and 7 Plus, which wereunveiled in San Francisco on Wednesdayand will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 \u2014 will not include a port for plugging in standard earbuds. But you\u2019ll get used to it.\nThe absence of a jack is far from the worst shortcomingin Apple\u2019s latest product launch. Instead, it\u2019s a symptom of a deeper issue with the new iPhones, part of a problem that afflicts much of the company\u2019s product lineup: Apple\u2019s aesthetics have grown stale.\nApple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple\u2019s best designs, what was iconic about the company\u2019s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.\nThis is a subjective assessment, and it\u2019s one that Apple rebuts. The company says it does not change its designs just for the sake of change; the current iPhone design, which debuted in 2014, has sold hundreds of millions of units, so why mess with success? In a video accompanying the iPhone 7 unveiling on Wednesday, Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, called the device the \u201cmost deliberate evolution\u201d of its design vision for the smartphone.\nYet there are signs that my critique of Apple\u2019s designs are shared by others. Industrial designers and tech critics used to swoon over Apple\u2019s latest hardware; nowadays you witnessless swooning and more bemusement.\nLast year, Apple put out a battery case that looked comically pregnant\u2014 \u201ca design embarrassment,\u201d said The Verge\u2014 and a rechargeable mouse with the charging port on the bottom, meaningyou have to turn it over to charge it. And the remote control for Apple TV violated the first rule of TV remote design: Don\u2019t make it symmetrical, so people can figure out which button is which in the dark. (One tip: Put a rubber band on the bottom, so you can quickly figure out which end is up.)\nThen there\u2019s software interface design. The Apple Watch, also released last year, looked fine (and some of its wristbands were truly stunning), but its user interface wasso puzzlingand took so long to learn that Apple was forced to go back to the drawing board. In a new update to be introduced soon, the watch\u2019s interface has been substantially simplified.\nIt\u2019s the same story for Apple Music.After the streaming service was widely panned for its confusing array of options, Apple had to completely redesign it this year.\nIt\u2019s not just that a few new Apple products have been plagued with design flaws. The bigger problem is an absence of delight. I recently checked in with several tech-pundit friends for their assessment of Apple\u2019s aesthetic choices. \u201cWhat was the last Apple design that really dazzled you?\u201d I asked.\nThere was a small chorus of support for the MacBook, the beautifully tiny (if functionally flawed) laptop that Apple released last year. But most respondents were split between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 5 \u2014 two daring smartphone designs that were instantly recognized as surpassing anything else on the market.\nTheiPhone 5, in particular, was a jewel; to me, its flat sides,chamfered edgesand remarkable build quality suggested something miraculous, as if Mr. Ive had been divinely inspired inhis locked white room. But the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 were released in 2010 and 2012. If you have to reach back to the last presidential election to find an Apple design that really caught your eye, there\u2019s something amiss.\nApple\u2019s design difficulties prompt two questions: How bad is this problem? And how can Apple solve it?\nTo the first: It\u2019s not acute, but it is urgent. Despitea slowdown in growth, Apple is still by far the most profitable consumer electronics company in the world. Consumer satisfaction surveys show thatcustomers love its products. And even if the tech cognoscenti no longer rave about Apple\u2019s designs, there\u2019s little sign that their griping has affected sales.\nDespite criticism, Apple Music also signed up 17 million subscribers in about a year. Apple doesn\u2019t release sales numbers for the watch, but many analysts believe thatsales have been brisk, andcustomer-satisfaction surveys are through the roof. And the iPhone has proved remarkably durable; asI argued last year, the iPhone\u2019s continuing dominance is the closest bet in tech to a sure thing.\nThe real danger is in Apple\u2019s long-term reputation. Much of Apple\u2019s brand is built on design and on a sense that everything it delivers is a gift from the vanguard.\nTwo years ago, the designer Khoi Vinh, a former design director for The New York Times who now works at Adobe,summed up Apple\u2019s design prowess this way: \u201cIf there\u2019s a single thread that runs through nearly every piece of Apple hardware, it\u2019sconviction, the sense that its designers believed with every fiber of their being that the form factor they delivered was the result of countless correct choices that, in totality, add up to the best andonlychoice for giving shape to that particular product.\u201d\nBut in assessing the iPhone 6, then new, Mr. Vinh felt Apple had gone astray. Whereas the iPhone 5 had sharp, sophisticated lines that set it apart from everything else, \u201cthe iPhone 6\u2019s form seems uninspired, harkening back to the dated-looking forms of the original iPhone, and barely managing to distinguish itself from the countless other phones that have since aped that look,\u201d he wrote.\nThat was in 2014. Now, two years later, we still have the same basic iPhone design. For years, Apple has released a redesigned iPhone every other year, but now we\u2019re going to go three years without a new iPhone look.\nAnd while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apple\u2019s big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing \u2014 exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.\nAn important caveat: Samsung\u2019s software is still bloated, and its reputation for overall build quality took a hit when it announced last week that it would recall and replace the Note 7 because of abattery defect that caused spontaneous explosions. To the extent that making a device that doesn\u2019t explode suggests design expertise, Apple is still ahead of Samsung.\nBut the setbacks from Apple\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t likely to last. Apple can\u2019t afford to rest on its past successes for long."

An ecosystem of Apple rumormongers, which stretches globally and pounces on any scrap of information, has been trotting out bits and pieces of what to expect for almost a year. Those hints and clues \u2014 sometimes flimsy, sometimes accurate \u2014 are then amplified by tech sites and social media. Often, the rumors are picked up by mainstream media. Then all of it is fed to a public that is hungry to know if they should buy an iPhone now or resist until a new one is released.\nDavid Streitfelddissected that chain of eventsfor the iPhone that is set to be revealed on Wednesday, tracing how information about the device leaked to a Japanese website last year and then spread. The upshot is to expect an iPhone that is thinner and has improved cameras, and that has no headphone jack, among other updates.\nInterest in iPhones may be helped this year by stumbles from a rival. Last week, Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones, said it had torecall its Galaxy Note 7 modelbecause of flaws in the battery cell that could result in fires, write Paul Mozur and Su-Hyun Lee.
