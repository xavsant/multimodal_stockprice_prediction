        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple andGoogle, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley.\nAs the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google\u2019s search engine as the preselected choice on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry\u2019s pecking order.\nNow, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Departmentfiled a landmark lawsuitagainst Google \u2014 the U.S. government\u2019s biggest antitrust case in two decades \u2014 and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company\u2019s illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.\nThe scrutiny of the pact, which was first inked 15 years ago and has rarely been discussed by either company, has highlighted the special relationship between Silicon Valley\u2019s two most valuable companies \u2014 an unlikely union of rivals that regulators say is unfairly preventing smaller companies from flourishing.\n\u201cWe have this sort of strange term in Silicon Valley: co-opetition,\u201d said Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel from 2009 to 2017. \u201cYou have brutal competition, but at the same time, you have necessary cooperation.\u201d\nApple and Google are joined at the hip even though Mr. Cook has said internet advertising, Google\u2019s bread and butter, engages in \u201csurveillance\u201d of consumers and even though Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, once promised \u201cthermonuclear war\u201d on his Silicon Valley neighbor when he learned it was working on a rival to the iPhone.\nApple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, worth more than $3 trillion combined, do compete on plenty of fronts, like smartphones, digital maps and laptops. But they also know how to make nice when it suits their interests. And few deals have been nicer to both sides of the table than the iPhone search deal.\nNearly half of Google\u2019s search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according tothe Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple deal has been described as a \u201ccode red\u201d scenario inside the company. When iPhone users search on Google, they see the search ads that drive Google\u2019s business. They can also find their way to other Google products, like YouTube.\nA former Google executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to talk about the deal, said the prospect of losing Apple\u2019s traffic was \u201cterrifying\u201d to the company.\nThe Justice Department, which is asking for a court injunction preventing Google from entering into deals like the one it made with Apple, argues that the arrangement has unfairly helped make Google, which handles92 percent of the world\u2019s internet searches, the center of consumers\u2019 online lives.\nOnline businesses like Yelp and Expedia, as well as companies ranging fromnoodle shops to news organizations, often complain that Google\u2019s search domination enables it to charge advertising fees when people simply look up their names, as well as to steer consumers toward its own products, like Google Maps. Microsoft, which had its own antitrust battle two decades ago, hastold British regulatorsthat if it were the default option on iPhones and iPads, it would make more advertising money for every search on its rival search engine, Bing.\nWhat\u2019s more, competitors like DuckDuckGo, a small search engine that sells itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google, could never match Google\u2019s tab with Apple.\nApple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments \u2014 up from$1 billion a yearin 2014 \u2014 in exchange for building Google\u2019s search engine into its products. It is probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple\u2019s annual profits. That\u2019s not money Apple would be eager to walk away from.\nIn fact, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai met again in 2018 to discuss how they could increase revenue from search. After the meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart that \u201cour vision is that we work as if we are one company,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint.\nA forced breakup could mean the loss of easy money to Apple. But it would be a more significant threat to Google, which would have no obvious way to replace the lost traffic. It could also push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine. Within Google, people believe that Apple is one of the few companies in the world that could offer a formidable alternative, according to one former executive. Google has also worried that without the agreement, Apple could make it more difficult for iPhone users to get to the Google search engine.\nA spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the partnership, while a Google spokesman pointed to ablog postin which the company defended the relationship.\nEven though its bill with Apple keeps going up, Google has said again and again that it dominates internet search because consumers prefer it, not because it is buying customers. The company argues that the Justice Department is painting an incomplete picture; its partnership with Apple, it says, is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space.\nOther search engines like Microsoft\u2019s Bing also have revenue-sharing agreements with Apple to appear as secondary search options on iPhones, Google says in its defense. It adds that Apple allows people to change their default search engine from Google \u2014 though few probably do because people typically don\u2019t tinker with such settings and many prefer Google anyway.\nApple has rarely, if ever, publicly acknowledged its deal with Google, and according to Bernstein Research, has mentioned its so-called licensing revenue in an earnings call for the first time this year.\nAccording to a former senior executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality contracts, Apple\u2019s leaders have made the same calculation about Google as much of the general public: The utility of its search engine is worth the cost of its invasive practices.\n\u201cTheir search engine is the best,\u201d Mr. Cook saidwhen asked by Axiosin late 2018 why he partnered with a company he also implicitly criticized. He added that Apple had also created ways to blunt Google\u2019s collection of data, such as a private-browsing mode on Apple\u2019s internet browser.\nThe deal is not limited to searches in Apple\u2019s Safari browser; it extends to virtually all searches done on Apple devices, including with Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri, and on Google\u2019s iPhone app and Chrome browser.\nThe relationship between the companies has swung from friendly to contentious to today\u2019s \u201cco-opetition.\u201d In the early years of Google, the company\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw Mr. Jobs as a mentor, and they would take long walks with him to discuss the future of technology.\nIn 2005, Apple and Google inked what at the time seemed like a modest deal: Google would be the default search engine on Apple\u2019s Safari browser on Mac computers.\nQuickly, Mr. Cook, then still a deputy to Mr. Jobs, saw the arrangement\u2019s lucrative potential, according to another former senior Apple executive who asked not to be named. Google\u2019s payments were pure profit, and all Apple had to do was feature a search engine its users already wanted.\nApple expanded the deal for its big upcoming product: the iPhone. When Mr. Jobsunveiled the iPhonein 2007, he invited Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s then chief executive, to join him onstage for the first of Apple\u2019s many famous iPhone events.\n\u201cIf we just sort of merged the two companies, we could just call them AppleGoo,\u201d joked Mr. Schmidt, who was also on Apple\u2019s board of directors. With Google search on the iPhone, he added, \u201cyou can actually merge without merging.\u201d\nThen the relationship soured. Google had quietly been developinga competitor to the iPhone: smartphone software called Android that any phone maker could use.Mr. Jobs was furious. In 2010, Applesued a phone makerthat used Android. \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy Android,\u201d Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. \u201cI will spend my last dying breath if I need to.\u201d\nA year later, Apple introduced Siri. Instead of Google underpinning the virtual assistant, it was Microsoft\u2019s Bing.\nYet the companies\u2019 partnership on iPhones continued \u2014 too lucrative for either side to blow it up. Apple had arranged the deal to require periodic renegotiations, according to a former senior executive, and each time, it extracted more money from Google.\n\u201cYou have to be able to maintain those relationships and not burn a bridge,\u201d said Mr. Sewell, Apple\u2019s former general counsel, who declined to discuss specifics of the deal. \u201cAt the same time, when you\u2019re negotiating on behalf of your company and you\u2019re trying to get the best deal, then, you know, the gloves come off.\u201d\nAround 2017, the deal was up for renewal. Google was facing a squeeze, with clicks on its mobile ads not growing fast enough. Apple was not satisfied with Bing\u2019s performance for Siri. And Mr. Cook had just announced that Apple aimed to double its services revenue to $50 billion by 2020, an ambitious goal that would be possible only with Google\u2019s payments.\nBy the fall of 2017, Apple announced that Google was now helping Siri answer questions, and Google disclosed that its payments for search traffic had jumped. The company offered an anodyne explanation to part of the reason it was suddenly paying some unnamed company hundreds of millions of dollars more: \u201cchanges in partner agreements.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nTechnology that makes our smartphones hard to break into without a password makes us safer from hackers and other unwanted intruders. But it also makes it tougher for the police to do their job.\nAmerican law enforcement officialsfor years have saidcompanies like Apple and Google should make it easier to break phone passcodes so they can better investigate crimes. Most technology experts say it\u2019s impossible to make a phone that good guys can easily get into without bad guys exploiting it.\nMy colleagueJack Nicas, who wrote on Wednesday aboutthis standoff between cops and techies, talked to me about a big revelation: Law enforcement officials are able to get into phones far more often than previously understood. Jack also said that the fight over phone security has resulted in a messy but largely effective middle ground on safety \u2014 even if no one in this debate will say so.\nShira: Don\u2019t we want the police and prosecutors to get into phones of people accused of crimes?\nJack:Most people would agree that it\u2019s appropriate in some cases for law enforcement to get data from a suspect\u2019s smartphone. And with court warrants they do, using tools from companies like Grayshift and Cellebrite to unlock encrypted iPhones and other smartphones and extract data.\nWhat worries civil rights advocates is that we\u2019ve seen that the police aren\u2019t using these code-breaking technologies only in the most serious cases, but also in shoplifting, drug and assault investigations. Andyears of records collected by the nonprofit Upturnshow that these tools are used by far more law enforcement agencies than we\u2019d known.\nWhy should law-abiding people care? People might say they have nothing to hide.\nWe know how much information our phones have, including our entire location history, passwords to accounts, all our text messages and potentially embarrassing photos. That\u2019s what makes smartphones so valuable in police investigations \u2014 and what makes it doubly important for there to be caution in when and why police search them.\nUpturn found that many U.S. law enforcement agencies had few restrictions, if any, on what circumstances they can break into people\u2019s phones and what they do with the data. More public transparency about how law enforcement uses these tools would be a welcome extra layer of accountability.\nIf the police frequently break password locks on smartphones, what\u2019s their complaint?\nIt sometimes takes days, weeks or months for law enforcement to use technology tools to break into a phone, and many investigations are time sensitive. In those situations, cops and prosecutors don\u2019t care about Apple\u2019s worries over cybersecurity.\nOur colleagues\u2019investigationlast year into child sexual abuse imagery showed the trade offs of technology that keeps our digital activity private: It lets criminals hide horrible activity. That\u2019s true of smartphone locks, too.\nAbsolutely. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of this debate \u2014 because there\u2019s no easy solution.\nCan smartphones keep us safe from bad guys and also let cops catch criminals? Is there a middle ground?\nThat middle ground may be the messy status quo.\nSmartphones for the most part are well protected from break-ins by criminals and hackers. However, in cases where many of us agree that law enforcement should be able to access phone data, there are tools to help them break in. Those methods don\u2019t require tech companies creatinga \u201cbackdoor\u201d\u2014 a software opening that security experts worry could be exploited by criminals or authoritarian governments.\nHuh. So neither cops nor Apple would admit it, but this impasse \u2026 it\u2019s good?\nPerhaps as good as it can get. Completely impenetrable phones would be bad for public safety, while \u201cback doors\u201d in encryption would be bad for cybersecurity. Neither side is terribly satisfied with this workaround, but it mostly works.\nI practically get hives when companies\u2019 purported principles clash with their behavior.\nJackwroteabout one of the allegations in the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust lawsuitagainst Google:A main way that Google preserves its alleged monopoly is through agreements that makes its search service the built-in choice for people using Apple\u2019s computers, iPhones and the Siri voice assistant.\nI also want to draw attention to Apple\u2019s role here. This is the hives part.\nApple for years has trash talked companies like Google that sell digital ads based on our activity and interests. \u201cThey\u2019re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook,saidin 2015. He\u2019srepeatedsome version of that regularly.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s hypocritical for Apple to say that digital advertising machines are ruining our lives while simultaneously taking billions of dollars each year from Google, thereby strengthening one of those digital advertising machines.\nAn Apple executive was asked in a congressional hearing last year about why the company bashes Google but takes its money. He said that Google\u2019s search engine is the best.\nHmm. Even if Google search cured cancer, it is not mandatory for Apple to take Google\u2019s money for anything.\nCompanies can conduct business how they wish. The government is not saying that Apple is doing anything wrong. But surely if Apple wanted to apply its principles about\u201ccreepy\u201dtactics of companies like Google, it could act differently.\nWhat if Appledidn\u2019ttake Google\u2019s money, and when people bought a new iPhone they had the choice of which search engine they wanted to use?\nApple could also remind people every few months to try an alternative like Bing or DuckDuckGo. Apple could, if it wanted, make its own search engine. This would be costly and possibly unwise, but hey, Apple has the money to put its principles to work if it wished to do so.\nGoogle\u2019s low-key chief executive gets the attention he probably didn\u2019t want:My colleague Dai Wakabayashi introduces us to Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s boss who now leads a company in the government\u2019s cross hairs. \u201cHe has surrounded himself with other serious, buttoned-up career Google managerswho bring a lot of boring to the table,\u201d Dai writes, delightfully.\nTechnology is regularly abused to hurt the vulnerable:Tech nerds have worried for years about \u201cdeep fake\u201d technology that digitally alters images and videos being usedfor political propaganda. But the tech is mostly abused to harass women. One service is creating unauthorized and faked images of women and girls with their clothing removed, The Washington Postreported.\nWhen members of Congress go big on Twitch:About 435,000 people at one point tuned into the web streaming site Twitch on Tuesday to see Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez play the murder mystery video game Among Us to encourage young people to vote, the Vergewrote.
