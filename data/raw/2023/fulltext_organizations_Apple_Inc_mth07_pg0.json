        "title": "Biden Administration Unveils Tougher Guidelines on Mergers",
        "fulltext": "The Biden administration\u2019s top antitrust officials unveiled tougher guidelines against tech mergers on Wednesday, signaling their deepening scrutiny of the industry despite recent court losses in their attempts to block tech deal-making.\nLina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, andJonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice, released draft guidelines for merger reviews that for the first time include a focus on digital platforms and how dominant companies can use their scale to harm future rivals.\nThe guidelines \u2014 which generally provide a road map for whether regulators block or approve deals \u2014 show the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to an aggressive antitrust agenda aimed at curtailing the power of companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon.\nThe guidelines, which aren\u2019t enforced by law, follow a losing streak in the courts. A ruling last weekprevented the F.T.C. from delayingthe closing of Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard. In January, a court sided against the F.T.C. in its lawsuit to stopMeta\u2019s purchase of Within, a virtual reality app maker.\nThe forceful antitrust posture is a pillar of President Biden\u2019s agenda to stamp out economic inequality and encourage greater competition. \u201cPromoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics,\u201d a senior administration official said in a call with reporters.\nThe new guidelines would apply to all deals across the economy. But they highlight obstacles to competition among digital platforms, including how an acquisition of a nascent rival may be intended to kill off future competition. Such deals, known as killer acquisitions, are prevalent in the tech industry and at the heart of an F.T.C. antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has accused Meta of buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to prevent future competition.\nThe F.T.C. and Justice Department also said they would look at how companies used their scale, including their large number of users, to ward off competition. These so-called network effects have helped companies like Meta and Google maintain their dominance in social media and internet search.\nThe agencies also laid out ways in which mergers involving \u201cplatform\u201d businesses, the model used by Amazon\u2019s online store and Apple\u2019s App Store, could harm competition. An acquisition could hurt competition by giving a platform control over a significant stream of data, the draft guidelines said, echoing concerns that tech giants use their vast troves of information to squash rivals.\n\u201cAs markets and commercial realities change, it is vital that we adapt our law enforcement tools to keep pace so that we can protect competition in a manner that reflects the intricacies of our modern economy,\u201d Mr. Kanter said in a statement. \u201cSimply put, competition today looks different than it did 50 \u2014 or even 15 \u2014 years ago.\u201d\nWhile they lack the force of law, the guidelines can influence how judges look at challenges to mergers and acquisitions. The effort to update the guidelines has been closely watched by businesses and corporate lawyers that navigate regulatory scrutiny of megadeals.\nThe guidelines were last updated in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Biden ordered the Justice Department and the F.T.C. to update them again as part of a broader effort to improve competition across the economy. The agencies will take public comment on the proposals and could make amendments before final guidelines are adopted.\n\u201cThese guidelines contain critical updates while ensuring fidelity to the mandate Congress has given us and the legal precedent on the books,\u201d Ms. Khan said in a statement.\nWhile the F.T.C. experienced the recent court losses, it has forced some companies, including the chip-maker Nvidia and the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to abandon some large deals. The Justice Department blocked the publisher Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster, using an unusual argument that the merger would harm authors who sold the publication rights to their books."

        "title": "I Love You, Let\u2019s Stalk Each Other",
        "fulltext": "It started because Kelsey McKinney wanted to know where her sister was every single moment of the day.\n\u201cI like to call her and she likes to call me and it was only practical to share our locations so that we would know whether or not now was a good time to call without asking,\u201d said Ms. McKinney, a 31-year-old journalist and the host of the podcastNormal Gossip. The sisters began sharing their locations using their iPhones\u2019 Find My Friends feature, which allows users to visualize all of their location-sharing friends on a global map.\n\u201cPretty quickly, I came to love looking at her little dot,\u201d Ms. McKinney said. \u201cIt was affectionate to me, and I started asking my friends to share their locations with me, or just sharing my location with them and hoping they would reciprocate.\u201d\nLocation sharing has long been the domain of parents with wayward teens or obsessive partners, but more and more, apps like Find My Friends are being used by young people who want to know where their friends are and what they\u2019re up to, without actually having to ask them.\nMost smartphones offer location sharing capabilities, but since more thanhalfof Americans use iPhones, Find My Friends is by far the most popular.\nApple\u2019s Find My function wasn\u2019t conceived as a way to lovingly stalk your pals, but that\u2019s what it has slowly become. When it debuted, in 2009, as Find My iPhone, the app allowed users to employ GPS data to track their lost iPhones; Find My Friends came two years later, marketed to anxious parents who wanted to keep tabs on their children.\nIn 2019, the companyintegrated its location-tracking capabilities into a single app, called Find My, which lets users see the location of their friends and Apple devices. Since then, Find My Friends has become a digital calling card of sorts, a way to express tenderness and intimacy between close friends and draw a distinction between them and the rest of their online acquaintances.\nCourtney Trop, a Los Angeles style blogger and the founder of Stevie, a CBD brand, said she used Find My Friends with about 15 people, including her best friend, Perry. \u201cWe use it to stalk each other to see if we went on shopping trips without each other,\u201d Ms. Trop said. If she is revealed via Find My to be shopping unaccompanied, her friend lets her have it in a cascade of \u201ccrazy messages\u201d: \u201cYou went without me! Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re at Replica right now!\u201d\nSeveral people said they used the app to track friends when they were going on Tinder dates, or to make sure they got home safely after a night of partying. It came in handy for Kevin LeBlanc, 25, a fashion associate in New York, when his friend passed out on the street one evening, and he used the app to locate her. The friend\u2019s mother told Mr. LeBlanc that her daughter was in an ambulance and asked him to follow it. \u201cI had her location on,\u201d he recalled, \u201cso I knew exactly where she was.\u201d\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic forced Americans to turn to the internet for entertainment, home delivery and more, awareness of the way companies and governments use the personal data we publish onlinealso increased.\nYet despite this growing discomfort, there\u2019s also a sense of powerlessness, a general resignation to the idea that the internet is an inescapable part of modern life, and that forking over your data is just part of the bargain. A2019 Pew Research Center surveyfound that \u201csome 81 percent of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66 percent say the same about government data collection.\u201d Pew also found that most Americans \u201cfeel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information.\u201d If tech giants and governments have access to your personal data, some may think, why shouldn\u2019t your friends and family?\nApple\u2019s Find My App usesend-to-end encryption, which means the company can\u2019t technically see the locations of its users, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is comfortable with sharing their locations with the company or with their friends. Ms. McKinney said that she had a few friends who don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing their locations, but that she wasn\u2019t a stickler for reciprocity. \u201cSome of my buddies are private and don\u2019t want me to see their location, but that\u2019s fine: They must see my location anyway,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s true that there is perhaps nothing more intimate than having live location sharing on \u2014 the level of trust you have to have in someone to willingly disclose just how much time you spend sitting in your apartment watching TV! But location sharing can also provide a feeling of closeness even when you\u2019re far away.\nMs. McKinney acknowledges that part of the appeal of the app comes from the fact that she\u2019s \u201cextremely nosy.\u201d \u201cBut I also think it provides me a feeling of safety to know that my friends are OK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is comforting even to look at my list and be like, \u2018These are all my pals, and they exist in the world even if they are not here with me.\u2019\u201d\nA trend on TikTok in which people share screenshots of their Find My Friends maps seems to have arisen from the same sentiment: \u201cMe checking find my friends to make sure all my sims are where they\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d one userwrote.\nFor Matt Brown, 31, an executive coordinator at a hedge fund in New York, Find My Friends is less a casual pastime than a lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019m always preaching that Find My Friends is my favorite app,\u201d he said.\nMr. Brown currently tracks the location of 47 of his friends across the world. \u201cAs somebody who lives in New York, spontaneity is really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to just be like: \u2018Hey what are you doing right now? Do you want to grab dinner?\u2019\u201d\nHe said he loved Find My Friends because no matter where he is in the city, someone he knows is probably close by. \u201cI\u2019ll be like: \u2018Hey, what are you doing right now? I\u2019m at this bar \u2014 do you want to come meet me?\u2019\u201d\nMs. McKinney also called Find My Friends her favorite app. \u201cMy favorite thing to do is to award one of my friends Dot of the Week for being the most interesting dot to watch that week,\u201d she said. One of her friends recently won Dot of the Week two weeks in a row for her trip to Europe. \u201cI was following her little dot in Rome, and I was so happy every day to see that she was somewhere else having fun!\u201d\nOf course, Find My Friends is only as accurate as the GPS data it has access to; almost everybody who uses it religiously has a story about the panic that set in when someone\u2019s dot appeared in a place it shouldn\u2019t. Mariel Tyler, a photographer in New York, said that once when she went to check on her sister\u2019s location during a Tinder date, the app said that she was in \u201cthe Hudson River.\u201d Ms. McKinney was recently staying at a hotel next to a hospital, which sent one of her friends into a spiral when she checked the app and thought Ms. McKinney had been hospitalized.\nTo a generation who grew up alongside the internet, location sharing may feel less like a privacy threat and more like an expression of affection and trust. Using Find My Friends requires the ability to put jealousy or FOMO aside and feel nothing but joy for the friend whose little dot is ricocheting around MetLife Stadium, even if she got Taylor Swift tickets and you didn\u2019t. Feeling happy when your friends are thriving, even at times when you might not be, is the purest expression of friendship. As one Twitter userput it: \u201cI love find my friends.. Like aww that\u2019s where my friends are :)\u201d"

        "title": "The Economic Stakes in the Hollywood Shutdown",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s happening: America\u2019s $134 billion movie and TV industry has ground to a halt after theHollywood actors\u2019 union voted to strike, joining screenwriters and shutting down virtually all productions.\nThe move reflects the growing aggressiveness of the American labor movement, which has been battling against Starbucks, Amazon, UPS and others. Only in this case, the dispute involves one of the most visible industries around \u2014 and there\u2019s no sign of a compromise in sight.\nThe actors\u2019 union blasted studios for refusing to bend on key issues,including higher payouts from streaming titles and clear limits on the use of artificial intelligence. \u201cHow they plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their C.E.O.s.,\u201d Fran Drescher, the TV actor who now leads the SAG-AFTRA union, said yesterday. \u201cIt is disgusting. Shame on them!\u201d\nThe studios argue that the unions\u2019 demands are unrealistic,given the challenges the entertainment industry faces, from streaming to fallout from the pandemic. \u201cThis is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption,\u201dBob Iger, Disney\u2019s C.E.O., said on CNBC yesterday. (More on him later.)\nExpect more such comments next week on media company earnings calls.\nTinseltown\u2019s glitz quickly went dim.Because actors are now forbidden frompromoting their films, the cast of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d walked out in the middle of the movie\u2019s London premiere. And campaigning for shows nominated for Emmy awards, which were just announced on Wednesday, was suspended.\nThat will have consequences for other Hollywood industries, including advertising and talent agencies, celebrity and trade publications and film festivals. \u201cThecelebrity factory has shut down,\u201d Janice Min, the head of the entertainment publication The Ankler, told Vanity Fair. \u201cIf this goes on for a long time, you will feel it across the whole internet.\u201d\nIn some ways, the strike could actuallybenefitstudios and streaming platforms.The lack of new shows and movies may allow them to back out of expensive production deals they signed during the content boom.\nBut the longer the strikes go on, the more audiences may grow restless with a lack of fresh scripted content. (Fall TV schedules are packed with reality and game shows.) Streaming giants with vast libraries might be OK, but lesser-stocked services may face a deluge of cancellations, and studios that sell to other platforms could be in increasingly dire straits.\nThe S.E.C.\u2019s crypto crackdown suffers a setback.The regulator has argued that digital assets should be treated as securities, but ajudge ruled yesterday that the crypto company Rippledid not break securities lawin selling its token, XRP, on public exchanges. Elsewhere,Alex Mashinsky, the founder of the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, was arrested on charges of fraud and lying about the firm\u2019s business model.\nAspartame is declared a potential cancer risk.The World Health Organization joined research agencies in saying that the widely used artificial sweetener isa possible carcinogen. Experts disagree on what constitutes an unsafe level of consumption, but Wall Street analysts say the warning could hurt the sale of diet sodas and other products.\nTucker Carlson reportedly plans to start a new media company.The former Fox News host and Neil Patel, a White House adviser under George W. Bush, are seeking to raise funding for a subscription-driven venture,according to The Wall Street Journal. Last month, Carlson returned to the public eye with a Twitter version of his popular Fox show, but its audience has beenin steep decline.\nA day after Bob Iger extended his tenure as Disney\u2019s C.E.O. by two years, the entertainment mogul suggested that he was weighing a bigger shake-up of the media giant, includingpotential dealsfor ESPN and other channels like ABC.\nThe remarks indicate that Iger, who oversaw some of Disney\u2019s biggest acquisitions, may yet do more deals \u2014 albeit as a seller. The big question is: Whom will he do them with?\nIger is under pressure to turn Disney\u2019s fortunes around,after laying off thousands and slashing costs. Though he has headed off a challenge by the activist investor Nelson Peltz, shareholders can\u2019t be happy with Disney\u2019s stagnating stock price.\nHere\u2019s what an Iger shake-up might look like:\nDisney may sell a stake in ESPN, which has suffered from a steep drop-off in cable subscriptions, to a partner that could help the sports network improve its online reach and pay for increasingly expensive broadcast rights. Likely candidates are tech titans with online video platforms, including Apple (an often-rumored buyer for Disney, antitrust concerns aside), Google and Amazon.\nBuyers for ABC and cable channels like FX are less obvious, since a deal with another media giant could draw opposition from antitrust regulators. The Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall speculated thatprivate equity or hedge fundsmay jump in, tempted by the businesses\u2019 steady cash flow and the opportunity to cut margins (as they\u2019ve done with newspapers).\nHow serious is Iger about selling?His comments may have been meant to test investor reaction. (He previously hinted Disney might sell its majority stake in Hulu, before saying he wouldmore likely buy out Comcast\u2019s stakein the platform.) Disney shares barely budged yesterday after his remarks.\nBut Iger has been pessimistic about traditional TV for some time. \u201cLinear TV is marching towards a great precipice and it will be pushed off,\u201d hesaid at the Code Conferencelast year. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when, but it goes away.\u201d\nIn other media M.&A. news: The French luxury billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault is reportedly in talks tobuy the talent agency CAA.\nA rough week for the F.T.C. chair Lina Khan ended with a grilling on Capitol Hill. On Tuesday, she lost a bid to block Microsoft\u2019s $70 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. The regulator appealed the ruling, but an effort todelay the dealwhile its challenge is heard was rejected.\nBut even as the F.T.C. faces a court battle over one fight, it started another by opening aninvestigationinto the ChatGPT maker OpenAI over whether the chatbot was harming consumers.\nThe news meant all eyes were on Khan\u2019s appearance before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, which had been billed as an examination of her \u201cmismanagement\u201d after a series of failed legal challenges. But the hearing revealed surprising support from some of her cross-examiners.\nRepublicans questioned her tactics.Khan was pressed about why the F.T.C. was appealing the Microsoft ruling when other jurisdictions, such as the European Union, had approved the deal. (She declined to comment.) Khan also faced accusations and threats. \u201cActions have consequences, Madam Chair,\u201d warned Ben Cline, Republican of Virginia, who said the appropriations committee was considering the F.T.C.\u2019s budget requests and earmarking less than she had sought in response to the agency\u2019s \u201crank partisanship.\u201d Khan was not offered the chance to respond.\nBut Khan found some unlikely fans.\u201cI want to encourage your work,\u201d Matt Gaetz, the conservative Republican from Florida and a fellow lawyer, told her. He lauded a crackdown on data brokers who sell sensitive information. Gaetz added that legal defeats were common when pressing new issues, and he urged Khan to seek help in Congress \u201cif the laws are insufficient.\u201d\nOthers praised Khan\u2019s tough stance on Big Tech.Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, pointed out that Khan had no financial links to tech companies \u2014 unlike some of his Congressional colleagues. \u201cThey spent $250 million against the bills that passed out of this committee last Congress,\u201d he said of businesses like Google and Meta.\nBuck said he and Khan were both aware of\u201cthe need to update the antitrust laws\u201d for a new economy, giving Khan the chance to say that today\u2019s rules were based on assumptions that aren\u2019t right for the digital age.\nIn other news: Britain\u2019s antitrust regulator, which blocked the Microsoft deal in April only to reopen its investigation a day after the U.S. court ruling, willextend the deadlinefor its investigation by six weeks. The companies could reportedlysell some British cloud gaming rightsto win approval.\nWith regulatory scrutiny intensifying, the PGA Tour has ditched one of the binding provisions built into its tentative deal with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league: a no-poach agreement that could have been legally problematic.\nThe provision, which would have covered players from the tour and LIV, was shelved to stave off the Justice Department\u2019s ire,report The Times\u2019s Alan Blinder and Kevin Draper and DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch.\nThe nonsolicitation clause was seen as a way to prevent an exodus of tour golfers to LIV,which had used huge prize payouts to entice top players to the breakaway league. (Rory McIlroy, one of the fiercest opponents of LIV Golf, said yesterday he would rather quit the game than play for the rival competition despite the riches on offer.) The White House has been taking on such agreements. The language appeared \u201cto be right in the field of vision that the Department of Justice has staked out for its no-poaching enforcement program,\u201d William E. Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman, told DealBook.\nThere was more problematic language in this week\u2019s Senate hearinginvolving PGA Tour officials.Antitrust experts have zeroed in on comments made by Jimmy Dunne, the Piper Sandler vice chairman who is on the tour\u2019s board.

        "title": "Warren and Graham Team Up to Take on Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "For years, policymakers have worried about the growing power of digital giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, as they came to dominate more and more of everyday life. Now, two prominent senators are pushing to create a new federal agency to rein in the power of Big Tech.\nElizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, plan to introduce theDigital Consumer Protection Commission Act, which they say would restrain tech titans while letting them continue to innovate. But these companies have fought hard against increased oversight, and it\u2019s unclear how a new agency will fit into a Washington already full of regulators.\nThe bill is in the vein of legislation that established agencies to oversee fast-growing industries,much like how Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This time, the focus is on online platforms that together command nearly $10 trillion in market cap and whose products touch on free speech, privacy, jobs and more.\n\u201cFor too long, giant tech companies have exploited consumers\u2019 data, invaded Americans\u2019 privacy, threatened our national security and stomped out competition in our economy,\u201d Ms. Warren told DealBook\u2019s Ephrat Livni.\nIn teaming up with Mr. Graham, who has expressed support for creating an A.I. czar, Ms. Warren said the bill made \u201cclear that reining in Big Tech platforms is a top priority on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\nSome issues the new commission would focus on are:\nDominant market positions, which the senators say allow companies to unfairly promote their own products and diminish competition;\nData privacy, an area not currently covered by a comprehensive federal law and which touches on targeted advertising and more;\nSocial harms like sexual abuse and exploitation of children, cyberbullying and promotion of suicidal ideation and eating disorders;\nAnd fast-growing innovations like artificial intelligence, which could lead to discrimination, job losses and a host of other unforeseen consequences.\nGraham told DealBook that the act was \u201cthe first step in a long journey to protect American consumers from the massive power these companies currently wield.\u201d\nIt\u2019s meant to coordinate the tangle of efforts to regulate tech,including the F.T.C. and the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust arm on competition, state attorneys general and more. An aide to Warren said the new agency would expand the F.T.C.\u2019s and the Justice Department\u2019s authority, for example, and take a comprehensive view on oversight. (The F.T.C. and the Justice Department declined to comment.)\nBut the proposal faces high hurdles.Democrats and Republicans agree on little these days, though reining in tech is a rare point of consensus. Skeptics also note that tech companies haveclose ties to lawmakersand have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying thathelped kill previous effortsto police their industry.\nIn other regulatory news: The E.U. has opened an antitrust inquiry intoMicrosoft\u2019s bundling of its Teams communications productwith Office 365.\nMastercard moves to block cannabis purchases using its debit cards.The payments giant told financial institutions tobar such transactions, citing the illegality of marijuana on a federal level. It\u2019s a further blow to the cannabis industry.\nCrypto marks a milestone in Congress.A bill to develop a regulatory framework for digital assetsmoved out of a congressional committee\u2014 in this case, the House Financial Services Committee. The legislation, which would specify when a cryptocurrency was a security or commodity and clarify regulators\u2019 jurisdiction, will now be considered by the House Agriculture Committee.\nThe S.E.C. proposes new rules for online brokers\u2019 use of consumer data.The regulator will push for companies like Robinhood toaddress conflicts of interestin using predictive data analytics, to avoid putting their interests ahead of consumers. The proposal follows up on concerns about the \u201cgamification\u201d of markets that the agency had raised after the meme-stock frenzy.\nSpeaking of tech giants, shares in Meta were up more than 8 percent in premarket trading Thursday after the company predicted that a recovery in its core advertising business would lead to itsfastest overall revenue growthsince a pandemic-era tech boom.\nMeta\u2019s better-than-expected earnings mirrored those of Alphabet,which this week also reported arebound in ad revenue, especially at YouTube. Investors have piled into both companies since the start of the year, pushing their combined market value above $2 trillion.\nAt Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, sales growth was powered bybetter ad targeting, thanks to A.I. tools, and increased advertising in the Reels video format on those platforms.\nBut smaller digital rivals are still struggling.Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, reported asecond straight drop in revenuethis week, sending its shares tumbling. And X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has reportedly resorted tosteep discountsto woo back advertisers.\nMeta\u2019s fortunes are turning around.After ending last year withthree straight decline quartersand havinglaid off thousandsof workers, the company is growing again. It now claims over 3.8 billion monthly users across its apps, which also include Messenger, WhatsApp and the newly launched Threads.\nThose gains appeared to offset investor concerns about spending on the metaverse.Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building tools for immersive online worlds that Mark Zuckerberg has called the future of his company, lost another $3.7 billion last quarter.\nBut the Meta chief isn\u2019t backing down, telling analysts on Wednesday: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that I\u2019m going to be right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in.\u201d\nThe Fed isn\u2019t quite predicting a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy, but the central bank is feeling more upbeat after raising interest rates on Wednesday to theirhighest level in 22 years.\nFed economists are no longer forecasting a recession, a rosier outlook than many on Wall Street hold. Fed officials now see \u201cmoderate\u201d growth ahead, an upgrade from their characterization of \u201cmodest\u201d last month. Speaking of which, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, the Commerce Department will release gross domestic product data that\u2019s expected to show the economy havinggrown by 2 percent.\nIt\u2019s too soon to say if the Fed is done raising rates.Jay Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that \u201cwe\u2019ve come a long way\u201d in bringing down headline inflation from last summer\u2019s peak of about 9 percent. But he added that it was still well above the central bank\u2019s target.\nComing up:Two key Consumer Price Index reports and two jobs reports are set to be released between now and the Fed\u2019s next rate-setting meeting in September. The central bank and investors will scrutinize those reports for any signs of inflation perking up.\nMr. Powell has laid out the importance of the upcoming data releases for Fed policy: \u201cIt is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted,\u201dhe said. \u201cAnd I would also say it\u2019s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.\u201d\nThe markets think the Fed will hold fire.The futures market on Thursday morning is showing just a 20 percent chance of a September rate increase, and it\u2019s pricing in rate cuts for the first half of next year.\n\u2014Esther Crawford, Twitter\u2019s former head of product and once a top lieutenant to Elon Musk, in a lengthy post about what it was like to work for the billionaire.\nWeeks after pro golfersraised complaintsabout how they have been treated in the PGA Tour\u2019s negotiations with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund over a shake-up of the sport, they have finally received some concessions from the tour.\nAmong them is the appointment (at the tour\u2019s expense) of Colin Neville, a partner at the merchant bank Raine, to advise players in the deal talks, DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch and The Times\u2019s Alan Blinder and Kevin Draper report. The move underscores the circuit\u2019s efforts to ease the worries of some of its most important figures.\nHiring Neville is meant to help restore trust in the deal negotiations,with the banker advising players who are members of the PGA Tour\u2019s board, including Patrick Cantlay, Rory McIlroy and Webb Simpson.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident Colin\u2019s perspective and expertise will help ensure a transparent, efficient, and collaborative process,\u201d Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, wrote in a memo to PGA Tour members on Wednesday.\nThe PGA Tour extended another olive branch to players,agreeing to give them a say in picking the successor to Randall Stephenson, the former AT&T chief whoresigned this month from the group\u2019s board. Mr. Stephenson had deep reservations about the tentative deal and the secretive process that led to it. In a departure from usual practice, Mr. Monahan said that Mr. Stephenson\u2019s replacement would require the unanimous support of the board, including the players who sit on it.\nThe tour is also trying to find a way to reward loyal players.Mr. Monahan wrote that the PGA Tour was working on a \u201cfinancially significant\u201d plan to compensate players who stuck with the circuit, even as the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit dangled large purses and enormous guaranteed contracts to defectors. The tour has also created a task force to determine how to handle players who jumped to LIV Golf series and may want to return.\nThe next significant step in all these efforts will come in Memphis, where Mr. Monahan \u2014 who recently returned from medical leave \u2014 is expected to meet with players on Aug. 8.\nDeals\nTrading giants including Citadel Securities and Virtu have beenhurt by the market slowdown.

        "title": "Lindsey Graham and Elizabeth Warren: When It Comes to Big Tech, Enough Is Enough",
        "fulltext": "The digital revolution promised amazing new opportunities \u2014 and it delivered. Digital platforms promoted social interaction, democratized information and gave us hundreds of new ways to have fun.\nBut digital innovation has had a dark side. Giant digital platforms have provided new avenues of proliferation for the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, human trafficking, drug trafficking and bullying and have promoted eating disorders, addictive behaviors and teen suicide. Parents like Kristin Bride, whose teenage son killed himself after being mercilessly cyberbullied, haveshared heartbreaking storieswith Congress and the public about the potentially deadly consequences.\nNobody elected Big Tech executives to govern anything, let alone the entire digital world. If democracy means anything, it means that leaders on both sides of the aisle must take responsibility for protecting the freedom of the American people from the ever-changing whims of these powerful companies and their unaccountable C.E.O.s. Today we\u2019re stepping up to that challenge with a bipartisan bill to treat Big Tech the way we treat other industries.\nA few Big Tech companies generate amajorityof the world\u2019s internet traffic and essentially control nearly every aspect of Americans\u2019 digital lives. Platforms are protected from legal liability in many of their decisions, so they operate without accountability. Big Tech companies have far too much unrestrained power over our economy, our society and our democracy. These massive businesses posteye-popping profitswhile they suppress competition. Google uses its search engine togive preferenceto its own products, like Google Hotels and Google Flights, giving it an unfair leg up on competitors. Amazon sucks up information from small businesses that offer products for sale on its platform, then uses that information to run its own competing businesses. Appleforcesentrepreneurs (and thereby consumers) to pay crushing commissions to use its App Store. A few Big Tech companies stifle all competition before it poses any serious threat.\nBig Tech companies also prey on ordinary users. They vacuum up our personal data, often with little care for whether their practices are responsible or even legal. Some Big Tech platformsmisleadus when we try to limit the data we share, and they regularly fall prey to massivedata leaksthat leave us vulnerable to criminal activity, foreign interference and disinformation. Adversaries in China and other countries oftenstore or processour data. And if we want to know how our data is being used or why our posts are being taken down, good luck getting an answer. We\u2019re usually in the dark about where our data goes or how it is used.\nEnough is enough. It\u2019s time to rein in Big Tech. And we can\u2019t do it with a law that only nibbles around the edges of the problem. Piecemeal efforts to stop abusive and dangerous practices have failed. Congress is too slow, it lacks the tech expertise, and the army of Big Tech lobbyists can pick off individual efforts easier than shooting fish in a barrel. Meaningful change \u2014 the change worth engaging every member of Congress to fight for \u2014 is structural.\nFor more than a century, Congress has established regulatory agencies to preserve innovation while minimizing harm presented by emerging industries. In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Commission took on railroads. In 1914 the Federal Trade Commission took on unfair methods of competition and later unfair and deceptive acts and practices. In 1934 the Federal Communications Commission took on radio (and then television). In 1975 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took on nuclear power, and in 1977 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took on electricity generation and transmission. We need a nimble, adaptable, new agency with expertise, resources and authority to do the same for Big Tech.\nOur Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act would create an independent, bipartisan regulator charged with licensing and policing the nation\u2019s biggest tech companies \u2014 like Meta, Google and Amazon \u2014 to prevent online harm, promote free speech and competition, guard Americans\u2019 privacy and protect national security. The new watchdog would focus on the unique threats posed by tech giants while strengthening the tools available to the federal agencies and state attorneys general who have authority to regulate Big Tech.\nOur legislation would guarantee common-sense safeguards for everyone who uses tech platforms. Families would have the right to protect their children from sexual exploitation, cyberbullying and deadly drugs. Certain digital platforms have promoted the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, suicidal ideation and eating disorders or done precious little to combat these evils; our bill would require Big Tech to mitigate such harms and allow families to seek redress if they do not.\nAmericans deserve to know how their data is collected and used and to control who can see it. They deserve the freedom to opt out of targeted advertising. And they deserve the right to go online without, say, some A.I. tool\u2019salgorithmdenying them a loan based on their race or politics. If our legislation is enacted, platforms would face consequences for suppressing speech in violation of their own terms of service. The commission would have the flexibility and agility to develop more expertise and respond to new risks, like those posed by generative A.I.\nOur bill would set clear rules for tech companies and impose real consequences for companies that break the law. For the giant companies, anticompetitive practices \u2014 like exploiting market dominance, tying the sale of one product to another, charging customers different prices for the same product and preventing employees from working for competitors \u2014 would be prohibited. The bill would set a high bar for mergers and acquisitions by dominant Big Tech platforms and make it possible to block and reverse harmful deals.\nReining in tech giants will be hard, but it\u2019s a fight worth fighting. If we win, Americans finally will have the tools they need to combat many online evils harming their children and ruining lives. And small businesses will have a fighting chance to innovate and compete in a world dominated by tech monopolies.\nNo company, no industry and no C.E.O. should be above the law. These reforms will ensure that the next generation of great American tech companies will operate responsibly while remaining on the cutting edge of innovation.\nIt\u2019s time for Congress to act.\nLindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) has served in the Senate since 2003.
