        "title": "Tech Backlash Grows as Investors Press Apple to Act on Children\u2019s Use",
        "fulltext": "A creator of the iPhone called the device \u201caddictive.\u201d\nA Twitter founder said the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201d\nAn early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network\u2019s impact on children\u2019s brains.\nNow, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children\u2019s use of iPhones and iPads.\nOnce uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction.\n\u201cCompanies have a role to play in helping to address these issues,\u201d said Barry Rosenstein, managing partner of Jana Partners, an investment firm that wrote anopen letter to Applethis weekendpushing it to look atits products\u2019 health effects, especially on children. \u201cAs more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over.\u201d\nThebacklash against big techhas been growing for months. Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny for their roles in enabling Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and for facilitating abusive behavior. Google was hit with arecord antitrust finein Europe for improperly exploiting its market power.\nBut until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives.\nJana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California\u2019s public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business.\n\u201cWe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,\u201d the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image.\nWhatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children\u2019s preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports.\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, there\u2019s been a bottom-up backlash,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d \u201cYou see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down.\u201d\nFor years, researchers have been sounding the alarm over the ubiquity of mobile phones and social media.A 2015 studyby Common Sense Media, a research group that studies technology use, found that more than half of teenagers spent upward of four hours a day looking at screens, and that for a quarter of teenagers, the figure was more than eight hours.In anothersurvey, in 2016, half the teenagers said they felt addicted to their mobile devices.\n\u201cThese things can be incredibly addictive,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.\u201d\nA growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune.\nSean Parker, an early investor in Facebook, reflected on the sprawling influence of the social network. \u201cIt literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,\u201d he said inan interview with Axiosin November. \u201cIt probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201d\nEvan Williams, one of the founders of Twitter,last year lamentedthe degree to which the messaging service had become a bastion for hateful speech. \u201cThe internet is broken,\u201d he said.\nChamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook executive and the chief executive of Social Capital, a venture capital firm, said in November thathe felt \u201ctremendous guilt\u201dabout his role in building the social network.\n\u201cThe short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,\u201d he said. \u201cNo civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.\u201d\nBy going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company\u2019s stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users\u2019 time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products.\n\u201cApple\u2019s business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,\u201d Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company.\nFor this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, \u201cit turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act.\u201d\nIn a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices \u201clead the industry\u201d and that \u201cwe think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them.\u201d\n\u201cWe take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\u201d\nFears about technology addiction are not new. The BlackBerry, an early smartphone, was nicknamed \u201cCrackBerry.\u201d Adam Alter, a social psychologist and the author of \u201cIrresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,\u201ddocuments instances of internet addictionspanning the globe.\nBut some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive.\nMr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about \u201chow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201d\nMr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, \u201cin the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.\u201d\nMr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, \u201cwe had no idea this was going to happen.\u201d But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones.\n\u201cNow it needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years in the making.\u201d\nEven Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company\u2019s influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days.\n\u201cThe world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do \u2014 whether it\u2019s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,\u201d hesaid in a Facebook postlast week. \u201cMy personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "In the latest indication of Apple\u2019s growing ambitions in the digital health market, the tech giant on Wednesday unveiled a new feature that would allow users to automatically download and see parts of their medical records on their iPhones.\nThe feature is to become part of Apple\u2019s popular Health app. It will enable users to transfer clinical data \u2014 like cholesterol levels and lists of medications prescribed by their doctors \u2014 directly from their medical providers to their iPhones, potentially streamlining how Americans gain access to some health information.\nA dozen medical institutions across the United States \u2014 including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles \u2014 have agreed to participate in the beta version of the new feature. Apple plans to open the beta test to consumers on Thursday.\nApple said it will not see consumers\u2019 medical data, which is encrypted and stored locally on the iPhone, unless the user chooses to share it with the company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really strange to me that you can easily pull up all of your spending record on your credit card going back a long way in every detail, yet your health is way more important and you don\u2019t have easy access to your health information,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe want to make sure that consumers are empowered with information about their health.\u201d\nTech giants includingApple, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, are going head-to-headto obtain a larger slice of American health care spending, which amounts to more than $3 trillion annually.\nApple, more than the others, has been reticent to publicize its long-term vision for health technology. But recent product introductions, like the new health records feature, highlight how focused Apple is on using its iPhone, Apple Watch and apps to give people more control over their health care.\nIn addition to the iPhone Health app, Apple has developed ResearchKit, software to help researchers develop iPhone apps to conduct health studies, and HealthKit, a platform that allows consumers to share health data on their iPhone or Apple Watch with health and fitness apps. Apple is also sponsoring clinical research, called theApple Heart Study, at Stanford University to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can detect irregular heart rhythms.\nA review of Apple\u2019s current job openings also gives clues about the company\u2019s wider ambitions in the health care sector.\nAccording to the company\u2019s site, Apple is seeking a hardware engineer to develop \u201cnext-generation\u201d health sensors for products like the iPhone and iPad; software engineers for the company\u2019s \u201chealth special projects team\u201d to join \u201can exciting new project at an early stage\u201d; an engineering manager for the company\u2019s motion technologies team \u201cto help shape the next set of groundbreaking features\u201d in fitness and health; and a biomedical scientist to help design studies for health, wellness and physiological measurement apps.\n\u201cWe will empower you to engage with a variety of internal teams and external partners to continually question the limitations of technology implemented in health products,\u201d says an Apple job description for a health tech hardware development engineer.\nApple\u2019s personal medical record feature is hardly a new idea. With much fanfare about a decade ago, both Google and Microsoft introduced free services \u2014 calledGoogle HealthandMicrosoft HealthVault\u2014 that helped consumers centralize their personal health data.\nBut the concept of the personal medical record did not generate widespread adoption in that era, which predated the popularization of the iPhone and mobile apps. Googleshut down Google Healthin 2011. Microsoft still offers itsHealthVault service."

        "title": "Bonuses Aside, Tax Law\u2019s Trickle-Down Impact Not Yet Clear",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There are good ways to start measuring how much the Trump tax cuts might be helping American workers. Tracking the bonus announcements flowing from corporations is not one of them.\nThose announcements, which include $2,500 in stock grants for Apple employees, up to $1,000 for certain workers at Walmart and $1,000 bonuses for Bank of America employees, are both real money and smart marketing. President Trump and top Republican lawmakers have praised many of the companies that are disclosing tax-cut-fueled bonuses and wage hikes.\nFor the most part, though, they are not indicative of the windfalls that companies are reaping from the $1.5 trillion tax law \u2014 and how much of that money that might trickle through to workers in the years to come.\nCompanies are acknowledging this in their fourth-quarter earnings reports and other financial disclosures, which earmark just a sliver of their future tax savings for direct and indirect investments in workers.\nBank of America\u2019s bonuses will cost the bank $145 million in 2018, or about 5 percent of the nearly $2.7 billion in savings it is expected to reap in 2018 from a lower, 21 percent corporate tax rate. Apple\u2019s bonuses will cost $300 million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law, which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than half the rate it would have paid under the old system.\nAnd two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a cost of $300 million, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt. The cost of the buyback: $4 billion.\nThe gap between what companies are saving and how they are, so far, rewarding workers, doesn\u2019t mean that the new law won\u2019t eventually lead to substantial wage increases. Economists across the political spectrum agree it\u2019s simply too soon to tell whether \u2014 and to what degree \u2014 that will happen.\nThe flurry of high-profile bonus announcements \u201care hard to interpret,\u201d said Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School whose research supports the idea that corporate tax cuts lead to at least modest wage increases. \u201cThey may well be evidence for these gains, but just as well may be an example of savvy public relations. The reality is we\u2019ll have to wait for a few years and good empirical work to really know the answer.\u201d\nBefore Mr. Trump signed the tax bill in December, few companies had committed to rewarding workers if it passed. Since then,more than 200have pledged bonuses, wage increases or other benefits for employees that are specifically tied to the new law, which includes deep cuts to business tax rates. The new law lowers the corporate rate to 21 percent, from a previous high of 35 percent, and it includes a 20 percent deduction for many owners of so-called pass-through companies, who pay taxes on their profits at individual income tax rates.\nRepublicans have celebrated the bonus announcements as part of a concerted party strategy to build public support for the new law. \u201cTax reform is working,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said on Thursday, before citing the Apple bonus announcement. \u201cWorkers are coming home and telling their families they got a bonus, or they got a raise, or they got better benefits.\u201d\nThe bonus announcements are, in some ways, a relatively easy opportunity to generate positive headlines and, perhaps, curry favor with Mr. Trump.\n\u201cCertainly, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is bonuses, rather than wages. It\u2019s a one-time thing \u2014 you don\u2019t have to do it again. It\u2019s political, obviously. It\u2019s P.R.,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.\nThere is some evidence that messaging is working: Since the bonus announcements began,polls have shownrisingsupport for the law, though it is still the case that more voters oppose the tax bill than favor it.\nLiberals, though, have latched on to other details in recent corporate announcements \u2014 the ones that show companies plan to pass most of their initial tax savings to shareholders by raising dividends or buying back stock or debt.\nAn S&P Global report estimates that banks will return 75 percent of their windfall to shareholders. More than four in five Morgan Stanley analysts, across industries, said in a survey that the firms they track will use their tax gains to facilitate buybacks and dividends. Barely one in five said firms would pass even some of the tax gains on to workers.\nAndrew Bates, deputy communications director for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, said the Walmart buybacks, which dwarf the cost of what it is returning to workers, show \u201cwhy Donald Trump is forced to hide most of the story when he tries selling this plan to the American people. It\u2019s also why they aren\u2019t buying it.\u201d\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic critic of Wall Street, said last week that tax-cut-linked share buybacks by companies such as Bank of America are \u201cnot a measure of the economic health of the American family.\u201d\nRepublicans predicted the majority of the corporate tax cut would eventually trickle down to workers through investment, jobs and wage increases. At one point early in the tax debate, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said that workers would enjoythe majority of the benefitsfrom a corporate tax cut.\nThe theory is investment in structures, equipment and other initiatives, either by companies or their shareholders, boosts productivity in companies, and with it, wages. It is a bank-shot theory of wage growth, and one that many economists espouse, though often to a much lesser degree than Mr. Hassett, whose research suggested typical workers would see an increase of between $3,000 and $7,000 in take-home pay.\n\u201cThe theory that tax cuts will increase wages is a theory based on investment, and the effect that increased investment will have on productivity,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt is not a theory based on a pure transfer of excess profits into workers\u2019 profits. That takes longer than two weeks to happen.\u201d\nAnecdotes of bonus payments, or even minimum wage increases, are the least-useful way to determine if a tax change is lifting workers, said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington. The best way is rigorous academic study, which Mr. Greenberg noted takes years to complete.\nThe middle ground between those two is watching economic indicators \u2014 the rate of investment growth in the economy, or of real wage growth.\nBut even that will prove tricky in the months to come, because the economy was strengthening even before the tax cut. Most economists believe the United States is now at or near so-called full employment, when employers are forced to compete for scarce workers, and employees are empowered to bargain for higher wages, whether their companies just received a tax break or not.\nMr. O\u2019Sullivan said it will be difficult to initially tease out the impact of the tax bill from those overall trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to buried in with everything else,\u201d he said.\nPoliticians will make no such distinctions, of course. But workers might be able to guess if wage gains are in their future, at least a little bit, by reading the fine print of corporate announcements. If companies announce new projects, initiatives or capital investments \u2014 anything that might boost worker productivity \u2014 wage increases could follow.\nNot because companies are dying to share their tax spoils with workers. But because they have to, or those workers will take a job with another company that will."

        "fulltext": "Pretend you are the lead detective on a hit new show, \u201cCSI: Terrible Stuff on the Internet.\u201d In the first episode, you set up one of thosecrazy wallsplastered with headlines and headshots, looking for hidden connections between everything awful that\u2019s been happening online recently.\nThere\u2019s a lot of dark stuff. In one corner, you have the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election with digital propaganda. In another, a rash of repugnant videos on YouTube, withchildren being mock-abused,cartoon characters bizarrely committing suicideon the kids\u2019 channel and a popular vlogger recordinga body hanging from a tree.\nThen there\u2019stech \u201caddiction,\u201dthe rising worry that adults and kids are getting hooked on smartphones and social networks despite our best efforts to resist the constant desire for a fix. And all over the internet, general fakery abounds \u2014 there aremillions of fake followerson Twitter and Facebook,fake rehab centers being touted on Googleand evenfake review sitesto sell you a mattress.\nSo who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online?\nThis isn\u2019t that hard. You don\u2019t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It\u2019s the advertising business, stupid.\nAnd if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain \u2014 and perhaps even reform.\nAds are the lifeblood of the internet, the source of funding for just about everything you read, watch and hear online. The digital ad business is in many waysa miracle machine\u2014 it corrals and transforms latent attention into real money that pays for many truly useful inventions, from search to instant translation to video hosting to global mapping.\nBut the online ad machine is also a vast, opaque and dizzyingly complex contraption with underappreciated capacity for misuse \u2014 one that collects and constantly profiles data about our behavior, creates incentives to monetize our most private desires and frequently unleashes loopholes that the shadiest of people are only too happy to exploit.\nAnd for all its power, the digital ad business has long been under-regulated and under-policed, both by the companies that run it and by the world\u2019s governments. In the United States, the industry has been almost untouched by oversight, even though it forms the primary revenue stream of two of the planet\u2019s most valuable companies, Google and Facebook.\n\u201cIn the early days of online media, the choice was essentially made \u2014 give it away for free, and advertising would produce the revenue,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association that represents companies in the digital ad business. \u201cA lot of the things we see now flow out from that decision.\u201d\nMr. Rothenberg\u2019s organization has long pushed for stronger standards for online advertising.In a speech last year, he implored the industry to \u201ctake civic responsibility for our effect on the world.\u201d But he conceded the business was growing and changing too quickly for many to comprehend its excesses and externalities \u2014 let alone to fix them.\n\u201cTechnology has largely been outpacing the ability of individual companies to understand what is actually going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really an unregulated stock market effect to the whole thing.\u201d\nFacebook, which reported its earnings on Wednesday, said itsadvertising principleshold that ads should \u201cbe safe and civil.\u201d It defended the targeted ad business\u2019s overall value, arguing that digital advertising connects people to products and services from small businesses and \u201ccreates jobs and helps the economy.\u201d\nThe company also pointed to several steps it had taken recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our ad policies, hired more ad reviewers, and created a new team to help detect and prevent abuses,\u201d said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising. \u201cWe\u2019re also testing a tool that will bring more transparency to ads running on our platform. We know there is more work to do, but our goal is to keep people safe.\u201d\nA spokesman for Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, said it was constantly policing its ad system, pointing out recent steps it has taken to address problems arising from the ad business, including several changes to YouTube.\nThe role of the ad business in much of what\u2019s terrible online was highlighted in a recent report by two think tanks, New America and Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.\n\u201cThe central problem of disinformation corrupting American political culture is not Russian spies or a particular social media platform,\u201d two researchers, Dipayan Ghosh and Ben Scott, wrote in the report, titled\u201cDigital Deceit.\u201d\u201cThe central problem is that the entire industry is built to leverage sophisticated technology to aggregate user attention and sell advertising.\u201d\nThe report chronicles just how efficient the online ad business has become at profiling, targeting, and persuading people. That\u2019s good news for the companies that want to market to you \u2014 as the online ad machine gets better, marketing gets more efficient and effective, letting companies understand and influence consumer sentiment at a huge scale for little money.\nBut the same cheap and effective persuasion machine is also available to anyone with nefarious ends. The Internet Research Agency,thetroll groupat the center of Russian efforts to influence American politics, spent $46,000 on Facebook ads before the 2016 election. That\u2019s not very much \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaigns spent tens of millions online. And yet the Russian campaign seems to have had enormous reach; Facebook has said the I.R.A.\u2019s messages \u2014 both its ads and its unpaid posts \u2014 were seen by nearly 150 million Americans.\nHow the I.R.A. achieved this mass reach likely has something to do with the dynamics of the ad business, which lets advertisers run many experimental posts to hone their messages, and tends to reward posts that spark outrage and engagement \u2014 exactly the sort thatthe Russians were pushing.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEither you have a brilliant technology that permits microtargeting to exactly the people you want to influence at exactly the right time with exactly the right message \u2014 or you\u2019re only reaching a small number of people and therefore it couldn\u2019t be influential.\u201d\nThe consequences of the ad business don\u2019t end at foreign propaganda. Consider all the nutty content recently found on YouTube Kids \u2014 not just the child-exploitation clips but also videos that seem to be created in whole or in part by algorithms that are mining the system for what\u2019s popular, thencreating endless variations.\nWhy would anyone do such a thing? For the ad money. One producer of videos that show antics including his children being scared by clownstold BuzzFeedthat he had made more than $100,000 in two months from ads on his videos.\nYouTube, which is owned by Google, has since pulled down thousands of such disturbing videos; the company said late last year that it was hiring numerousmoderators to police the platform. It also tightened the rules for which producers can make money from its ad system.\nFacebook, too, has made several recent fixes. The company has built a new tool \u2014 being tested in Canada and slated to be rolled out more widely this year \u2014 that lets people see the different ads being placed by political pages, a move meant to address I.R.A.-like influence campaigns. It has also fixed holes that allowed advertisers to target campaignsby race and religion. And it recently unveiled a new version of its News Feed that is meant to cut down on passively scrolling through posts \u2014 part of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s professed effort to improve the network even, he has said, at the cost of advertising revenue.\nThe tinkering continued on Tuesday, when Facebook also said it would ban ads promoting crypto currency schemes, some of which have fallen into scammy territory.\nYet these are all piecemeal efforts. They don\u2019t address the underlying logic of the ad business, which produces endless incentives for gaming the system in ways that Google and Facebook discover often only after the fact. Mr. Rothenberg said this was how regulating advertising was likely to go \u2014 a lot of fixes resembling \u201cWhac-a-Mole.\u201d\nOf course, there is the government. You could imagine some regulator imposing stricter standards for who has access to the online ad system, who makes money from it, how it uses private information and how transparent tech companies must be about it all. But that also seems unlikely; the Honest Ads Act, a proposal to regulate online political ads, has gone nowhere in Congress.\nOne final note: In 2015, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, warned about the dangers of the online ad business, especially its inherent threat to privacy. I wrotea column in which I took Mr. Cook to task\u2014 I argued that he had not acknowledged how ad-supported services improved his own company\u2019s devices.\nI stand by that view, but now I also regret dismissing his warning so cavalierly. Socially, politically and culturally, the online ad business is far more dangerous than I appreciated. Mr. Cook was right, and we should have listened to him."
