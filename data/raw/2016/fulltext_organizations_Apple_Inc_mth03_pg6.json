        "title": "Judge in Apple Case Seen as Unfazed by Stress, Even a Plane Crash",
        "fulltext": "RIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 Just before Christmas in 2003, a twin-engine Cessna plane crashed into the Claremont, Calif., home of Sheri N. Pym. The house was destroyed and the pilot was killed.\nJudge Pym, then a lawyer in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Riverside, Calif., was unharmed, as were her husband and children. She was later matter-of-fact in recounting the tale.\n\u201cA plane crashed into my house. Not good,\u201d she told Stephen G. Larson, who was then a judge in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.\n\u201cSomeone else might get overly excited, but Sheri was incredibly steady,\u201d said Mr. Larson, now a local lawyer. \u201cShe stays calm under pressure.\u201d\nThe incident offers clues as to how Judge Pym may handle another pressure-filled situation. Now a federal magistrate judge for the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Riverside, Judge Pym is presiding over legal arguments between Apple and the United States government regarding whetherthe company must help law enforcement break into an iPhoneused by a killer in last year\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nA hearing was scheduled for Tuesday. But on Monday, Judge Pymgranted a Justice Department request to cancel the hearingbecause it may no longer need Apple\u2019s help gaining access to the iPhone. Justice Department lawyers said they would file a progress report by April 5.\nWhen \u2014 or if \u2014 the case should return the courtroom, Judge Pym, 48, is likely to scrutinize Apple on its opposition to weakening the security of the iPhone and also to examine the Justice Department\u2019s legal arguments for pushing the company to do so.\nThe case is widely viewed as a watershed moment in thelong-running fightbetween the tech industry and the government over how and when authorities can use the troves of personal data collected and stored by tech companies. It could affect the boundaries between privacy and national security for years to come.\n\u201cShe really needs to think this through\u201d because subsequent judges will \u201cclosely read\u201d her opinion, said Patrick J. Coughlin, who oversaw Judge Pym when they both worked as lawyers at the Southern California law firm Milberg Weiss.\nIf Judge Pym should rule on the case, an appeal is likely from Apple or the Justice Department \u2014 or both. It could go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and then to the Supreme Court.\nJudge Pym did not respond to calls seeking comment.\nOver a more than two-decade legal career, Judge Pym has not specialized in technology or privacy cases. During stints as a federal judge, federal prosecutor and an associate at Milberg Weiss, she instead worked on a variety of cases, including mortgage fraud, tobacco-related litigation and prison assaults.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nBut Judge Pym is not unfamiliar with the tech industry. About a third of her work at Milberg Weiss focused on class-action lawsuits that involved Silicon Valley tech companies, Mr. Coughlin said.\nShe has been a magistrate judge since 2011, and her duties have included handling petty offenses and misdemeanors, as well as pretrial matters, conducting settlement conferences and sometimes trials \u2014 the sort of work that rarely draws national attention.\nYet with the national spotlight now on her, several of Judge Pym\u2019s former colleagues said she would not be fazed by the situation.\n\u201cWhen the Apple thing broke, I looked to see who the judge was, and I almost fell off the chair when I saw that it was Sheri,\u201d said Timothy G. Blood, a partner at Blood Hurst & O\u2019Reardon, who worked on consumer protection class-action cases with Judge Pym when she was at Milberg Weiss. \u201cShe can completely handle it. When a plane hit her house, her attitude was, \u2018What are you gonna do?\u2019 \u201d\nJudge Pym, a Seattle native, graduated with a philosophy degree from Williams College in 1989 before going into law. (Her husband, Peter G. Thielke, is a philosophy professor at Pomona College in Claremont.)\nAfter getting a law degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, Judge Pym joined Milberg Weiss in 1994. She left the firm in 2001, five years before Milberg Weiss wasindictedon charges of paying kickbacks to plaintiffs over the course of 25 years. (The indictment was later dropped after the firm settled.)\nJudge Pym then became an assistant United States attorney in the Central District of California in 2002, rising to chief of the Riverside office in 2006, where she worked on everything from felonies to misdemeanors.\n\u201cShe took care of what we called \u2018C.V.B.\u2019 matters, which are misdemeanors and citations that are the least-attractive cases,\u201d said Mr. Larson, who has filed a brief in the Apple case in support of the government\u2019s position. \u201cShe handled them with the same care and attention that others might give the most glamorous cases.\u201d\nThe San Bernardino shootinglast December, when Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in the city, took place about 10 miles from Judge Pym\u2019s courthouse. Since then, the court has been dealing with legal matters connected with the San Bernardino investigation.\nJudge Pym and another judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Riverside, David T. Bristow, have been involved in making decisions about search warrants in the investigation. On Feb. 16, Judge Pym ordered Apple to comply with the government\u2019s request to weaken its iPhone security so that law enforcement officials could extract data from the device used by Mr. Farook.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, immediatelyopposed the orderin an open letter, setting off the clash between the company and the federal government. The battle has turnedincreasingly rancorous, with both sides trading barbs in a series of legal filings.President Obama has also weighed in, saying this month that law enforcement must be legally able to collect information from smartphones and other electronic devices.\nMr. Coughlin, who worked with Judge Pym at Milberg Weiss and is now an lawyer at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said he disagreed with Judge Pym\u2019s original order compelling Apple to help break into the iPhone.\n\u201cI know Sheri would have thought the original order through very carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she finally makes her decision, you won\u2019t find any holes in her opinion.\u201d"

        "title": "Defense Secretary Takes Position Against a Data \u2018Back Door\u2019",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter assured an audience of computer security experts Wednesday that he was not in favor of a \u201cback door\u201d that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.\nSpeaking at the annual RSA Conference, Secretary Carter sought common ground with companies worried by Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone.\n\u201cJust to cut to the chase, I\u2019m not a believer in back doors or a single technical approach,\u201d Secretary Carter said to loud applause during a panel discussion at the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s technically accurate.\u201d\nApple is resistinga court orderthat would require it to create software to break the password mechanism in an iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nThe F.B.I. argues that it is not asking for any sort of permanent back door and is merely asking for help in circumventing a single phone\u2019s password protection. People in the tech industry worry, however, that the request for help in the San Bernardino case is merely a prelude and point to a number of other pending cases in which law enforcement authorities would like Apple\u2019s assistance.\nThe software Apple is being asked to create could be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible thanks to passwords or encryption.\nSecretary Carter\u2019s comments, though short on specifics, highlight the challenges various government agencies will face as they seek cooperation from Silicon Valley as the court fight between Apple and F.B.I. continues.\nAlso on Wednesday, Secretary Carter said Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, would head a new Defense Innovation Board to help connect tech companies and entrepreneurs with various Pentagon initiatives. And he announced a Hack the Pentagon initiative, which would reward hackers who find and turn over vulnerabilities in the Pentagon\u2019s computer systems.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to let one case drive a single solution,\u201d Secretary Carter said, referring to the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. \u201cWe have to innovate our way to a sensible result. And we need to do that because you can easily think of alternatives. One is a law written by people who don\u2019t have the technical expertise, one written in anger or grief, and that\u2019s not likely to work.\u201d\nMany at the conference have compared the F.B.I\u2019s software request \u2014 some are even calling it \u201cGovtOS,\u201d short for government operating system \u2014 to asking journalists to write a false article, or turn over a source, on national security grounds.\nDan Kaminsky, a well-known security researcher, likened the government\u2019s approach topersecuting firefightersduring a firestorm. The point being, he wrote in an article on Wired.com, that at a time when data breaches happen regularly, the F.B.I. is trying to force Apple to weaken the security of its phones instead of advocating stronger security.\nSecretary Carter echoed the need for stronger security but avoided taking a side in the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. \u201cThe problems of data security are many,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be one answer. There are lots of different parts to this.\u201d\nIf Silicon Valley and Washington cannot find some alternative solution through innovation, Secretary Carter added, the most likely result would be a poorly written law, \u201cor a solution written by China or Russia.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know what their view of data access and security is,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Farhad and Joe Examine Silicon Valley\u2019s Pull in Washington",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mr. Isaac is out this week, so Joe Plambeck, deputy technology editor, is filling in.\nFarhad: Howdy, Joe! Mike has the week off, so I\u2019m thrilled to have a big-shot tech editor like you join the discussion. As I tell every guest who takes Mike\u2019s place here, you have some small shoes to fill.\nJoe:Thanks, Farhad. It\u2019s a joy to be here. To get myself in something of a Mike Mode, I\u2019ve been reading about tech while eating burritos on my couch all week. I must say, what a life that guy lives.\nFarhad: On to this week\u2019s news. First, there were lots of new products.Amazon announcedtwo new versions of its Echo voice-controlled assistant \u2014 one of them is portable, and the other is meant for plugging into your home stereo. The move suggests that Amazon sees the device, which many once ridiculed, as a potential hit.\nDJI introduced a new drone, the Phantom 4, that does something amazing: It can see its environment and fly by itself, avoiding obstacles. Considering that many consumer drone flights end in crashes, autonomous flight could be a huge breakthrough \u2014 if, that is, it works.\nJoe:That is an important if. And I\u2019m not sure the self-flying machines will make the many regulators and lawmakers who are skeptical of drones \u2014 and who are one of the biggest hurdles to truly widespread adoption \u2014 any less skeptical.\nYahoo also made a small bit of news this week, and not of the negative sort flowing out of the company for many months now. Just a few weeks ago, Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s embattled leader, said she was going to dial back on its editorial ambitions. But this week, Yahoointroduced a new site for e-sports. It\u2019s an expansion of Yahoo Sports, one of the company\u2019s few bright spots, and e-sports is obviously a booming area of interest online.\nLet\u2019s also not overlook more rumblings out of Europe. The German competition authorityopened an investigationinto whether Facebook is abusing its dominant position to collect personal information about users. The investigation raises an interesting question: Could Facebook be pushing people to give up more information than they would like because they have no other good social networking option? It isn\u2019t the sort of antitrust investigation we usually see.\nFarhad: And then there was big news in goggles.\nJoe:Part of me can\u2019t believe you just wrote that sentence.\nFarhad:Look, goggles are the next big thing! Microsoft begantaking orders fora preview version of the HoloLens, the company\u2019s \u201caugmented-reality\u201d glasses, which allow you to see and manipulate digital objects superimposed on the real world. They\u2019ll sell for $3,000, but they\u2019re not ready for prime time; Microsoft says this early version is for developers looking to build HoloLens apps. A start-up called Meta also began taking orders for the second version of its A.R. goggles \u2014 those sell for $949, and they, too, are meant for developers.\nFinally, two pioneers in cryptography, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman,received the Turing Award this week, also known as the Nobel Prize of computing. The timing was interesting, as it came during the increasingly heated battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over encryption and the iPhone \u2014 the very technology inspired by the two men\u2019s work.\nAnd that gets us to our main topic for the week. Much of the tech industry rallied around Apple this week: Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo all signed on to legal briefs in support of Apple\u2019s position, though not without some internal hand-wringing. The battle lines in this case are becoming increasingly clear. Tech is on one side and Washington is on the other. Over the last couple of years, many tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have tried to establish closer relationships with lawmakers and regulators. What do you think this case means for the standing of tech in D.C.?\nJoe:There seems to be an interesting rally-around-the-flag trend in Silicon Valley. In recent years, the industry has coalesced for a few big fights in Washington, including SOPA \u2014 theStop Online Piracy Act\u2014 and net neutrality.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nWhat\u2019s unclear is what the Silicon Valley flag stands for. I don\u2019t know how much of this is about principles and how much is just about the pursuit of profit. The efforts do seem pretty effective, though, and I think we should expect only more of this. The industry has long had disdain for Washington; now, with business booming and the companies as powerful as ever, it seems to have learned how to express the disdain for political ends. Where do you think this could manifest itself next?\nFarhad:I think it\u2019s still an open question whether the tech industry has real power in Washington, at least compared with other moneyed industries, like media or oil and gas or finance. Sure, tech can muster a big push when there are collective threats to how it works \u2014 SOPA being the prime example \u2014 but the industry is less effective at advancing its interests.\nFor instance, techies have been pushing for immigration reform for years; Mark Zuckerberg made it a signature issue earlier this decade. What happened? Nothing.\nJoe:That\u2019s exactly right. I do think the message coming from government officials this week on the issue of encryption was quite interesting. For the first week or so after the fight with Apple became public, the F.B.I. and the Obama administration seemed to do a lot of aggressive chest-thumping on this issue. This week, though, some top government officials visited tech\u2019s backyard and had adifferent sort of message: Let\u2019s find some common ground.\nDefense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, for example,said he did not wantcompanies to create so-called back doors to their products. The F.B.I. has been saying something similar, but that message has largely been drowned out by the bureau\u2019s bullhorn calls for Apple to break into the phone of one of the shooters involved in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack.\nAnd of course, what Mr. Carter and the F.B.I. consider a back door is not exactly what the tech industry does. There is clearly a disconnect on many levels between Silicon Valley and Washington.\nFarhad:They\u2019re two different worlds, and they\u2019ll only move further apart. Pretty much like my relationship with Mike. Anyway, at least I got a break from him this week. This was fun, Joe. Till next time!\nJoe:We\u2019re done? Thank goodness. Mike\u2019s tiny shoes are killing my feet."

        "title": "Competing Interests on Encryption Divide Top Obama Officials",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The intensifying legal battle over encryption betweenAppleand the Justice Department has all but obscured another more subtle division, the one inside the Obama administration itself.\nDriven by competing and sometimes clashing interests about privacy, national security and the economy, some of the president\u2019s most senior aides are staking out a variety of positions on the issue.\nThe White House denies there is disagreement over the effort to force Apple to break into the phone used by one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, but the differences on how to deal with the broader questions raised by encryption have become increasingly apparent.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation wants the ability to break into smartphones and computers for investigations. The Pentagon and intelligence officials worry that the same techniques could be used by foreign powers or hackers to drain data from phones used by the United States government, and that countries like China will demand the same access provided to American law enforcement officials.\nThe conflicting positions were on display last week. On Tuesday, James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., testified in Congress about the need for some kind of government action \u2014 he avoided the word \u201clegislation\u201d because the White House has specifically said it is not seeking that now \u2014 that would guarantee access to law enforcement, no matter how encryption technology evolves.\nLess than a day later, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter,talking to technologistsat an annual computer security conference in San Francisco, struck a very different tone. \u201cData security, including encryption, is absolutely essential\u201d to the Pentagon, he said. \u201cNone of our stuff works unless it\u2019s connected.\u201d He also warned against a legislative solution.\nA law \u201cwritten in an atmosphere of anger or grief,\u201d he said, is \u201cnot likely to be the right answer.\u201d Later he drove home the point, saying \u201cit would be better to work this out rather than have a law written.\u201d And throughout his talk, Mr. Carter made it clear that he is more interested in securing data than prying into it.\nAdministration officials insist the comments do not reflect serious internal disagreements about policy. They say, for example, that the Justice Department and F.B.I. also support strong encryption \u2014 with limits \u2014 while the heads of the intelligence agencies, responsible for securing government communications, understand the stresses on those investigating serious crimes.\nIn a statement, the White House said on Friday that \u201cour policy on encryption is clear.\u201d But the policy it described delineated the differing positions rather than resolving them.\n\u201cThe United States government firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption, which is a key tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, promote free expression and association,\u201d it said. \u201cAt the same time, encryption poses a grave challenge for our national security and law enforcement professionals.\u201d\nBut officials from theNational Security Agency, theDepartment of Homeland Securityand the Pentagon describe meetings in the White House Situation Room that go over the same territory, and in the end cannot find a middle ground.\nThe arguments were touched off two and a half years ago, with the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, that the agency had gone to some lengths to undercut encryption.\nThere was evidence \u2014 none confirmed, or discussed by the Obama administration \u2014 that the N.S.A. had gained access to the unencrypted communications of servers around the world owned by Google and others to tap into foreign communications. There were suggestions that it had also tampered with the products of a foreign manufacturer of SIM cards, which go into every mobile telephone, to make it easier to intercept calls and emails.\nThe issues were taken up by a presidential commission that included legal scholars and intelligence experts, like Michael J. Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., and Richard A. Clarke, a former senior national security official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who now works in cybersecurity. Their conclusion was unambiguous in opposing the building of so-called back doors for encrypted devices.\nThe commission told President Obama that the United States government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software,\u201d and it urged more companies to adapt such systems.\nLast month, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the United States Cyber Command \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s digital arm, which both protects the Defense Department\u2019s networks and conducts offensive action \u2014 as well as director of the N.S.A., echoed that view in remarks to the Atlantic Council.\nThe view of Admiral Rogers, many experts say, may be affected by the fact that his agency has the best code-cracking capabilities in the world, and he does not need to make public what systems he is already inside. Because he cracks the codes of foreign adversaries (and more than a few allies), he does not need a warrant, as Mr. Comey does. And his agency\u2019s less publicized job is securing the government\u2019s most vital secrets.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nWith more and more government communications relying on mobile devices, including a so-called hardened version of the iPhone and the iPad, the N.S.A. is also not interested in advertising to the world ways in which those devices can be defeated.\nSo far Mr. Obama has fully backed legal efforts by the F.B.I. to force Apple to help authorities unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, who was killed in the attack. But he has rarely spoken about the broader questions, and when asked recently, a senior administration official said the White House still does not favor legislation to solve the issue.\nThe encryption issue seems particularly acute at the State Department and the Commerce Department, both of which have their own sets of concerns.\nOne of Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorite pilot programs as secretary of state, accelerated during the 2011 Arab Spring crisis, was to equip dissidents and activists around the world with the \u201cInternet in a suitcase,\u201d devices to help communicate and evade censorship.\nBut the system relies on encrypted conversations, to keep them away from Chinese state security or Egypt\u2019s brutal internal police. Any effort to force Apple to break that encryption, several American officials said \u2014 insisting on anonymity because the administration is still debating these issues \u2014 would be replicated from Beijing to Cairo.\nCommerce Department officials have made the point that if Congress ultimately mandates that all encrypted products must be accessible to investigators, it will be a boon to foreign producers of encryption hardware and software. And there are a lot of them.\nBruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, published a study recently that said there were \u201cat least 865 hardware or software products incorporating encryption from 55 different countries.\u201d After the United States, Germany tops the list with 112. Most products, Mr. Schneier said recently, \u201care as good as what you would find in the United States.\u201d\nBut so far users are not flocking to them in mass numbers for a simple reason: For novices, they can be hard to use.\nApple\u2019s design is of particular concern to the F.B.I. because the encryption is automatic; users do not have to do a thing to make it work. As arecent Harvard studyabout the problem of \u201cgoing dark\u201d \u2014 when law enforcement can no longer get access to evidence because of technological advances \u2014 pointed out, the more times users have to manipulate the programs, the greater the opportunity for error.\nWhich is exactly what the F.B.I. is hoping for."

        "fulltext": "Apple is getting ready for a busy week.\nOn Monday, the company is holding an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters to unveil smaller versions of its iPhone and iPad Pro. Then on Tuesday, Apple will face off against the United States government ata hearing in federal courtin Riverside, Calif., over whether it must help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack.\nThe iPhone case has proved to beparticularly divisive. According to aNew York Times/CBS News poll, 50 percent of respondents said Apple should accede to the government and help unlock the iPhone, while 45 percent were opposed. Overall, people\u2019s attitudes toward surveillance appear to have softened, with a quarter saying the federal government infringes too much on privacy, down from nearly half in a similar poll two years ago.\nKatie Benner, who is covering Apple\u2019s legal entanglements from San Francisco, and Matt Apuzzo, who covers national security from Washington, recently debated the iPhone case and what to expect from Tuesday\u2019s hearing:\nKatie BennerHi, Matt. What do you make of how dramatic this fight has gotten? Over the last month, each round of court filings has gottena little testier.\nMatt ApuzzoA lot of it\u2019s been theater, but \u2014 and here I go getting all rah-rah \u2014 it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing that people are being asked to think in a really big way about law and policy. I can\u2019t think of a case in which a novel legal argument hascaptured the attention of so many people. Everyone has a phone. Everyone gets this debate.\nKatieAgreed. So give us the government\u2019s strongest arguments.\nMattLet\u2019s start with the weakest arguments \u2014 it\u2019s more fun that way.\nThe government began by saying this case was just about opening this one iPhone. That is by far the weakest argument. Even the government has now walked away from that one. Everyone realizes this is a precedent-setting case.\nOn the strong argument side, the Justice Department has been unfairly mocked by some about the fact that it\u2019s relying on a law from the 1700s \u2014the All Writs Act\u2014 to justify opening this phone.\nThe fact that the law is two centuries old just tells you that it\u2019s a core tenet of our judicial system. I think the Department of Justice has stronger footing with this than people give it credit for. The All Writs Act says that government lawyers can say, \u201cJudge, you have the authority to enforce your own orders.\u201d That\u2019s not a controversial argument, on the face of it.\nKatie, what are Apple\u2019s arguments?\nKatieI\u2019m going to answer in broad strokes because Apple\u2019s arguments are complicated.\nEssentially, Apple\u2019s main argument is that the All Writs Act, which is used when there is a gap in the law, doesn\u2019t permit the court to force Apple to write new code for the government. The company bolsters its position by arguing that the government\u2019s request doesn\u2019t even fall into a gap in existing law. Apple says that a law called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which broadly says when and how companies must help the government with electronic surveillance, addresses the D.O.J.\u2019s request in this case. Congress has thought about adding tech companies like Apple to Calea but decided against doing so.\nApple argues that Congress\u2019s declining to amending that law is the same thing as saying that tech companies are exempt from the existing rule. So the All Writs Act is moot here, Apple contends.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nApple also makes constitutional arguments, including one that addresses the First Amendment. The company says that code is a form of free speech and that compelling people to write it \u2014 in this case to help unlock an iPhone \u2014 is infringing on their constitutional rights.\nOne analogy, perhaps, would be the government telling journalists to help an investigation by writing an article that includes specific elements and then publishing it on the front page. I can\u2019t imagine a lot of journalists who would want to do that.\nMattWell, judges try to avoid ruling on constitutional questions. My money is on the likelihood that this case will come down to the judge\u2019s reading of the All Writs Act. There, the government argument is based on cases that long predate any of the mobile technology we have now. To make its case, the government is arguing that something like rewriting a mobile operating system today is essentially the same as leasing old-fashioned telephone wires in the 1970s.\nThe bigger issue here is this: Has all this modern technology made existing law obsolete? I\u2019m not sure I buy your First Amendment comparison between writing code and writing a newspaper article only because there really is not a predigital analogy that works here.\nKatieYes! None of the laws we have now anticipated a world in which communications could be global and completely encrypted. We need new laws, and Congress may be pressured to deliver some.\nMattI\u2019m not holding my breath that we get legislation out of Congress in the midst of an election cycle, with the parties so divided that they can\u2019t consider a Supreme Court justice. Whatever we get will be imperfect, which isn\u2019t a terrible thing. Political compromise is part of the process.\nKatieMatt, you\u2019re such a believer in our imperfect democracy. I\u2019m singing the national anthem in my mind.\nMattJust hum it. We get it.\nBut seriously, one thing I do hear from those in federal law enforcement a lot is that they would be fine with losing the authority to search and wiretap devices like the iPhone \u2014 but only if the American people change their expectations of law enforcement.\nIf privacy overrides security here, a lot of agents will say fine. Just don\u2019t expect them to prevent every attack and solve every crime. And honestly, as a country, we\u2019ve made that decision on guns. We accept a certain amount of gun crime and resist infringement on the Second Amendment.\nLet me ask you this. Do you think for Apple, the stakes really are as high as it says?We have reportedthat the company is already at work on a software update that would make it impossible for the government to break into a lockediPhone, even with the methods it is asking Apple about now in this case. And Apple can drag this case out for a year. The courts would not be able to keep up with the innovation.\nKatieBut this is the government asking Apple to find a way to go back and weaken something \u2014 iPhone security \u2014 that it has already created.\nIf the government gets that, it could order Apple to roll back or find ways to break into any future innovation. The government might later be able to say, we need you to weaken something else, something different, because you did it before with a different \u2014 now obsolete \u2014 part of your system.\nMattYou are headed to the hearing on Tuesday. What scene are you expecting?\nKatieProtesters are already saying they\u2019ll be at the courthouse. Court officials are saying they expect huge lines to get the few available seats. And supporters on all sides will probably show up. So in short: chaos."

        "title": "American Tech Giants Face Fight in Europe Over Encrypted Data",
        "fulltext": "ROME \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s battle over encryption is heading to Europe.\nIn the United States, the F.B.I.\u2019s demands that Apple help \u201cunlock\u201d an iPhone used by a mass killer in California opened a heated debate on privacy. After recent attacks on the Continent, like thebombings in Brusselslast week and thewave of violencein Paris last November, governments across the European Union are increasingly pushing for greater access to people\u2019s digital lives.\nThis week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.\nThe battle has pitted Europe\u2019s fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people\u2019s digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.\nThe recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region\u2019s tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.\nThis balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.\n\u201cFundamental rights are just that, fundamental,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cOf course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.\u201d\nThat pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.\nIn Britain, lawmakers arecompleting legislationthat could force tech companies to bypass encryption protections in the name of national security. The law \u2014 called a \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d by opponents \u2014 may compel companies to aid the country\u2019s law enforcement agencies by hacking people\u2019s smartphones and computers, among other powers.\nAnd on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country\u2019s investigators.\nAmendments to the French law \u2014 itself a response to the attacks in November \u2014 may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France\u2019s left-wing government.\nBut politicians and industry executives say Apple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies\u2019 efforts to protect users\u2019 messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,\u201d said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.\n\u201cSure, this could have repercussions internationally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.\u201d\nAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\nEurope\u2019s attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.\nAnd to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple\u2019s executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people\u2019s phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSuch efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies\u2019 encryption technology in the name of national security.\nGermany, which has some of the world\u2019s toughest privacy rules, has balked at the proposals Britain and France are considering, while the Dutch governmentpublished an open letterthis year expressly stating its opposition to back doors in encryption services provided by the likes of Apple.\nSuch loopholes, the Dutch government said, would \u201calso make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.\u201d\nAs pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain \u2014 a top international market for most American tech companies \u2014 where expanded powers for the country\u2019s intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.\nUnder the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country\u2019s intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.\nMs. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country\u2019s security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people\u2019s privacy concerns.\nBut for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to gain access to digital communications.\nThe British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies\u2019 services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Internet messenger.\nBut in aseries of appealsto the British Parliament, several American tech giants, including Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, have complained that the proposals could force them to create backdoor access for the country\u2019s spies, or face falling afoul of the new national security rules.\n\u201cA key left under the doormat would not just be there for the good guys,\u201d Applewrotein its recent statement to British lawmakers. \u201cThe bad guys would find it, too.\u201d\nSuch concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments \u2014 either in Europe or farther afield \u2014 followed Britain\u2019s lead by passing similar legislation.\n\u201cIf these encryption plans go through, then who\u2019s to stop France or other countries\u2019 asking for the same thing?\u201d said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge whowrote a paperwith other experts last year that criticized the American and British governments\u2019 plans to weaken encryption. \u201cWhen you give one country backdoor access, where do you stop?\u201d"

        "title": "WhatsApp Encryption Said to Stymie Wiretap Order",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While the Justice Department wages a public fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone, government officials are privately debating how to resolve a prolonged standoff with another technology company, WhatsApp, over access to its popular instant messaging application, officials and others involved in the case said.\nNo decision has been made, but a court fight with WhatsApp, the world\u2019s largest mobile messaging service, would open a new front in the Obama administration\u2019s dispute with Silicon Valley over encryption, security and privacy.\nWhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, allows customers to send messages and make phone calls over the Internet. In the last year, the company has been adding encryption to those conversations, making it impossible for the Justice Department to read or eavesdrop, even with a judge\u2019s wiretap order.\nAs recently as this past week, officials said, the Justice Department was discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge had approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp\u2019s encryption.\nThe Justice Department and WhatsApp declined to comment. The government officials and others who discussed the dispute did so on condition of anonymity because the wiretap order and all the information associated with it were under seal. The nature of the case was not clear, except that officials said it was not a terrorism investigation. The location of the investigation was also unclear.\nTo understand the battle lines, consider this imperfect analogy from the predigital world: If the Apple dispute is akin to whether the F.B.I. can unlock your front door and search your house, the issue with WhatsApp is whether it can listen to your phone calls. In the era of encryption, neither question has a clear answer.\nSome investigators view the WhatsApp issue as even more significant than the one over locked phones because it goes to the heart of the future of wiretapping. They say the Justice Department should ask a judge to force WhatsApp to help the government get information that has been encrypted. Others are reluctant to escalate the dispute, particularly withsenators saying they willsoon introduce legislation to help the government get data in a format it can read.\nWhether the WhatsApp dispute ends in a court fight that sets precedents, many law enforcement officials and security experts say that such a case may be inevitable because the nation\u2019s wiretapping laws were last updated a generation ago, when people communicated by landline telephones that were easy to tap.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. and the Justice Department are just choosing the exact circumstance to pick the fight that looks the best for them,\u201d said Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on digital rights. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for the case that makes the demand look reasonable.\u201d\nA senior law enforcement official disputed the notion that the government was angling for the perfect case, and said that litigation was not inevitable.\nThis is not the first time that the government\u2019s wiretaps have been thwarted by encryption. And WhatsApp is not the only company to clash with the government over the issue. But with a billion users and a particularly strong international customer base, it is by far the largest.\nLast year, a dispute with Apple over encrypted iMessagesin an investigation of guns and drugs, for instance, nearly led to a court showdown in Maryland. In that case, as in others, the company helped the government where it was able to, and the Justice Department backed down.\nJan Koum, WhatsApp\u2019s founder, who was born in Ukraine,has talked about his family members\u2019fears that the government was eavesdropping on their phone calls. In the company\u2019s early years, WhatsApp had the ability to read messages as they passed through its servers. That meant it could comply with government wiretap orders.\nBut in late 2014, the company said that it would begin adding sophisticated encoding, known as end-to-end encryption, to its systems. Only the intended recipients would be able to read the messages.\n\u201cWhatsApp cannot provide information we do not have,\u201dthe company saidthis month when Brazilian police arrested a Facebook executive after the company failed to turn over information about a customer who was the subject of a drug trafficking investigation.\nThe iPhone case, which revolves around whether Apple can be forced to help the F.B.I. unlock a phone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., massacre, has received worldwide attention for the precedent it might set. But to many in law enforcement, disputes like the one with WhatsApp are of far greater concern.\nFor more than a half-century, the Justice Department has relied on wiretaps as a fundamental crime-fighting tool. To some in law enforcement, if companies like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram can design unbreakable encryption, then the future of wiretapping is in doubt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting useless data,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who now represents law enforcement agencies that filed briefs supporting the Justice Department in its fight with Apple. \u201cThe only way to make this not gibberish is if the company helps.\u201d\n\u201cAs we know from intercepted prisoner wiretaps,\u201d he added, \u201ccriminals think that advanced encryption is great.\u201d\nBusinesses, customers and the United States government also rely on strong encryption to help protect information from hackers, identity thieves and foreign cyberattacks. That is why, in 2013, a White House report said the government should \u201cnot in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial encryption.\u201d\nIn a twist, the government helped develop the technology behind WhatsApp\u2019s encryption. To promote civil rights in countries with repressive governments, theOpen Technology Fund, whichpromotes open societies by supporting technology that allows people to communicate without the fear of surveillance,provided $2.2 millionto help develop Open Whisper Systems, the encryption backbone behind WhatsApp.\nBecause of such support for encryption,Obama administration officials disagreeover how far they should push companies to accommodate the requests of law enforcement. Senior leaders at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. have held out hope that Congress will settle the matter by updating the wiretap laws to address new technology. But the White House has declined to push for such legislation. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Friday that he was skeptical \u201cof Congress\u2019s ability to handle such a complicated policy area.\u201d\nJames B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, told Congress this month that strong encryption was \u201cvital\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cthere are undoubtedly international implications\u201d for the United States to try to break encryption, especially for wiretaps, as in the WhatsApp case. But he has called for technology companies and the government to find a middle ground that allows for strong encryption but accommodates law enforcement efforts. President Obama echoed those remarks on Friday, saying technology executives who were \u201cabsolutist\u201d on the issue were wrong.\nThose who support digital privacy fear that if the Justice Department succeeds in forcing Apple to help break into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the government\u2019s next move will be to force companies like WhatsApp to rewrite their software to remove encryption from the accounts of certain customers. \u201cThat would be like going to nuclear war with Silicon Valley,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.\nThat view is one reason government officials have been hesitant to rush to court in the WhatsApp case and others like it. The legal and policy implications are great. While no immediate resolution is in sight, more and more companies offer encryption. And technology analysts say that WhatsApp\u2019s yearlong effort to add encryption to all one billion of its customer accounts is nearly complete."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After athird party went to the F.B.I.with claims of being able to unlock an iPhone, many in the security industry said they were not surprised that the third party did not go to Apple.\nFor all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers\u2019 communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple\u2019s code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.\nGoogle, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Mozilla and many other tech companies all pay outside hackers who turn over bugs in their products and systems. Uber begana new bug bounty programon Tuesday. Google has paid outside hackers more than $6 million since it announced a bug bounty program in 2010, and the company last weekdoubled its top reward to $100,000for anyone who can break into its Chromebook.\nApple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.\nThe company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company\u2019s website \u2014 but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.\nThe disclosure by the United States government on Monday that an unknown third party had approached it \u2014 and not Apple \u2014 tohelp open a controversial iPhoneonly highlights how the giant company approaches bug-hunting efforts and security differently from the rest of the tech industry.\nBut security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.\nJust this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple\u2019s iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.\n\u201cEspecially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.\nThe identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone \u2014 which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year \u2014 remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.\nThe Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.\nIn the past, Microsoft\u2019s systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nAs Apple\u2019s desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.\nAn Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, \u201cSecurity is an endless race \u2014 one that you can lead but never decisively win.\u201d\n\u201cOur team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,\u201d Mr. Federighi said. \u201cDespite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.\u201d\nApple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.\nApple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.\nIf the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.\nExploits in Apple\u2019s code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.\nFlaws in Apple\u2019s mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system \u2014 the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.\nChaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government\u2019s court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.\n\u201cFor every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,\u201d said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.\nTheheated battlebetween the United States government and Apple over breaking into the iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman may have inadvertently catalyzed the underground market for Apple code flaws. With the F.B.I. pushing Apple to help unlock the device with a court order and publicizing that it has been unable to get into the iPhone, hackers realized there was a blank check for them if they could accomplish it, said Jon Oberheide, the chief technology officer of Duo Security, a cloud security company.\nSome security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.\n\u201cApple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it\u2019s never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients\u2019 systems. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d"

A federal magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to help break into the device, prompting Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, to publicly defy the order.\nThe law gives judges the power to \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d\nThe ruling on Monday, by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, gives Apple a little legal momentum. But the case differs from the California one, in which Apple is being asked to build a way to break into its own phone to access data. In the New York case, the Justice Department says, Apple can already access the data the government is seeking."
