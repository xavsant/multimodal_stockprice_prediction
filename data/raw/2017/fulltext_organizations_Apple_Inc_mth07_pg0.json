        "title": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary",
        "fulltext": "Technology stocks had another scorching weeklong run last month, capped off by Amazon\u2019s startling decision to buy Whole Foods for$13.4 billion.\nAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.\n\u201cThese stocks are hitting highs \u2014again,\u201d said Todd C. Ahlsten, who oversees the firm\u2019s $15.6 billion core equity fund, pointing out that even low-risk exchange-traded funds were piling into the likes of Facebook, Apple, Google, Netflix and, yes, Amazon.\nThe explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.\nProducts of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.\nThat is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.\nFor stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.\nAccording to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices,88 percent of mutual funds that invest in large capitalization stocks trailed their benchmark over a five-year period ending last year.\nThis period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.\nValue-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.\nBut the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.\nMaking matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\n\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201d\nOver the past year through May, $263 billion has exited actively managed mutual funds that invest in United States stocks while $308 billion has poured into E.T.F.s and index funds.VanguardandBlackRockhave vacuumed up just about all of this cash, according to Morningstar.\nThis wave of money, combined with the slack performance of its old-style equity funds, prompted Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock,to shake up his stock-picking ranksthis spring.\nFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.\nMore than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.\nThe Parnassus portfolio managers are not alone in their fears. Of late,the argument has been madethat the rise of machines and passive investing is distorting the broader market.\nAnd this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.\nFor the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.\nCompared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.\nThe company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.\nIt has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.\nAssets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.\nStill, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.\nOver the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.\nBut at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.\nThrough the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.\nNevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201d\nEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.\nSo instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\n\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201d\nParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.\nAs per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.\nTo foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.\nDeep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.\nMr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.\nAnd Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.\nLately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.\nAt its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.\nBut the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.\nAll five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\n\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201d\nAt least they hope not."

        "title": "Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 China appears to have received help on Saturday from an unlikely source in its fight against tools that help users evade its Great Firewall of internet censorship: Apple.\nSoftware made by foreign companies to help users skirt the country\u2019s system of internet filters has vanished from Apple\u2019s app store on the mainland.\nOne company, ExpressVPN, posted aletterit had received from Apple saying that its app had been taken down \u201cbecause it includes content that is illegal in China.\u201d\nAnother tweeted from itsofficial accountthat its app had been removed.\nA search on Saturday showed that a number of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on the company\u2019s app store there.\nExpressVPN wrote in its blog that the removal was \u201csurprising and unfortunate.\u201d\nIt added, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China\u2019s censorship efforts.\u201d\nSunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been taken down from the app store.\n\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.\u201d\nIn a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. \u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a new reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.\nThe removals signal a new push by China to control the internet. In the past, the Great Firewall has used technology to disrupt VPNs, and Beijing has shut down Chinese VPNs and even aimed ahuge cyberattackat a well-known foreign site hosting code that circumvented the filters.\nBut they also mark the first time China has successfully used its influence with a major foreign tech platform, like Apple, to push back against the software makers.\nWhile internet crackdowns often peak every five years, ahead of a key Chinese Communist Party congress, this year\u2019s efforts cover fresh ground, a likely indication that stricter controls of things like VPNs will persist after the congress this autumn. Earlier this month, China also began apartial blockof the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp.\nGreater China is Apple\u2019s largest market outside the United States. That has left the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean itself off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.\nIn response, Apple has made a number of moves to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.\nThis month, the company said it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in China.\nApple has operated its app store in China for many years with only the occasional run-in with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store."

In recent quarters, its sales in the country havestruggled\u2014 for the period ending April 1, revenue dropped 14 percent \u2014 in part because of increased competition from a range of domestic competitors putting out ever-cheaper, high-performing smartphones.\nApple\u2019s huge successes in China have also left it more vulnerable to new rules that Beijing has set up to push back against foreign companies. Apple said this month that it would cooperate with a local company to buildits own data centerin the country, in part to satisfy the requirements of a new cybersecurity law. And experts say the law is just the beginning of further restrictions on foreign companies like Apple.\nThe regulatory and sales issues mean increased pressure on the release of the new iPhone this autumn. In China, the iPhone is as much a status signifier as a useful device, and analysts argue that many have put off buying a new iPhone until this year, with the hope that the latest model will look different enough to be noticed.\nMs. Ge Mahe stands out for her experience as an engineering manager in a position that many foreign companies have typically filled with a sales or regulatory official.\nMs. Ge Mahe led Apple\u2019s wireless software engineering teams for nine years, working on technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, according to the statement from Apple.\nApple also said that she was deeply involved in developing China-specific features for the iPhone and iPad, including support for so-called QR codes, the square bar codes that boomingmobile payments businessesuse.\n\u201cI am looking forward to deepening our team\u2019s connections with customers, government and businesses in China to advance innovation and sustainability,\u201d Ms. Ge Mahe said in the statement."

        "title": "How Microsoft Has Become the Surprise Innovator in PCs",
        "fulltext": "When Microsoft unveiled the first Surface tablet five years ago, it was a spectacular failure.\nAt the time, the Apple iPhone was well on its way to conquering the technology industry, and the iPad appeared set to lead an even more devastating invasion of Microsoft\u2019s office-worker kingdom. Microsoft conceived of Surface, an innovative laptop-tablet hybrid, as a way to show off the versatility of its software. Windows machines, it argued, could work as phones, personal computers and tablets. And didn\u2019t everyone love Windows?\nNope.Microsoft soon took a $900 million write-off for unsold Surfaces. Another effort to break into the hardware business, its acquisition of the limping phone-maker Nokia, dug a deeper river of red ink \u2014a $7.6 billion write-off. By the summer of 2015, Microsoft\u2019s hardware dreams looked crushed. Even today, the Xbox One, Microsoft\u2019s latest gaming console,is losing totheSony PlayStation 4.\nStill, Microsoft persisted \u2014 and today, the company is making the most visionary computers in the industry, if not the best machines, period. In the last two years, while Apple has focused mainly on mobile devices, Microsoft has put out a series of computers that reimagine the future of PCs in thrilling ways.\nYes, Apple loyalists, that\u2019s just my subjective view. And yes, Microsoft\u2019s latest financial results aren\u2019t exactly on my side here \u2014 the company announced last week that though itscloud software business is growing rapidly, revenue for its Surface divisiondeclined by 2 percentover the last year (because of changes it made in its launch schedule).\nMicrosoft, of course, makes most of its money from the PC business by licensing Windows to other computer makers, and it says that part of its goal in building hardware is to inspire and guide those companies\u2019 designs. But it also wants the Surface line to sell \u2014 and although the division has grown enormously in the last few years, becoming a critical part of Microsoft\u2019s overall business, Surface is stillfar smaller than Apple\u2019s Mac or iPad line.\nYet perhaps because it\u2019s way behind Apple, Microsoft\u2019s hardware division is creating products more daring than much of what has been coming out of its rival lately.\nThe hybrid Surface Pro \u2014 the inheritor of that first Surface\u2019s vision, the latest version of which was released in May \u2014 hasn\u2019t just become a moneymaker for the company. It was also the clear inspiration for the Apple iPad Pro, which supports a pen and keyboard but still feels less like a full-fledged laptop than Surface does.\nLate last year, Microsoft also unveiled Surface Studio, a big-screen desktop that bears a passing resemblance to the Apple iMac \u2014 except its vertical display effortlessly pivots into a kind of digital drafting table, a slick trick that you can imagine Steve Jobs having lots of fun showing off at a keynote address.\nAnd in the spring, Microsoft showed off Surface Laptop, which sounds humdrum enough; in shape and purpose, it isn\u2019t much different from the MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s pioneering thin and light laptop. But Microsoft\u2019s machine has a better screen than the Air, and, more important, a future. People loved the Air, but Apple doesn\u2019t appear to want to upgrade it, so Microsoft stepped in to perfect Apple\u2019s baby.\nNote, too, that the rest of Apple\u2019s PC road map has lately been looking shaky. Apple\u2019slatest laptops left many fans disgruntled, and the Mac Pro has gone years without an update. Apple is now moving quickly to address complaints from its high-end \u201cpro\u201d users \u2014 itsays the Mac Pro will be redesigned, and a new Pro version of the iMac is coming later this year.\n\u201cI think Microsoft has recognized over the last couple years that maybe the creative community isn\u2019t as locked into the Mac as many people think it is,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s this window of opportunity for Surface to get in there \u2014 and even if that window closes with some of Apple\u2019s upcoming devices, I don\u2019t think Apple has that market locked up.\u201d\nLast month, I visited Microsoft\u2019s hardware lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. I arrived in the midst of a renovation, finding a team of its best hardware designers sitting in a cavernous, mostly empty room \u2014 a scene that perfectly captures Microsoft\u2019s approach to hardware.\nUnder Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s Surface chief, the company has given its designers and engineers license to rethink the future of PCs in grand ways \u2014 to sit in an empty room, dream big things, and turn those visions into reality.\n\u201cWe have this mind-set that says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to take a shot at this, and if it\u2019s not going to work, we\u2019ll move on to the next thing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Panay told me. \u201cThat is celebrated \u2014 it\u2019s always, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s move.\u2019\u201d\nThe mind-set has resulted in several shining ideas. For Surface Studio, Microsoft built a brilliant companion device called Surface Dial \u2014 a palm-size knob that sits on your drafting-table screen, creating a tactile interface with which to control your computer.\nYou can use Dial for basic things like turning up the volume. But in the hands of a designer, it becomes a lovely tool; you can scrub through edits in a video or change your pen color in Photoshop with a turn of the wheel. Like Microsoft\u2019s digital stylus \u2014 which works across the company\u2019s PCs and tablets, whereas Apple staunchly, weirdly opposes adding touch-screen abilities to its Macs \u2014 Dial is one of those interface breakthroughs that we might have once looked to Apple for. Now, it\u2019s Microsoft that\u2019s pushing new modes of computing.\nMicrosoft\u2019s machines aren\u2019t perfect. I found Surface Studio, which starts at $3,000, to be underpowered for its price. Surface Pro is a wonderful laptop, but as a tablet, it isn\u2019t as good as the iPad. And it, too, is pricey \u2014 though it starts at $800, you\u2019re looking at $1,200 to $1,500 to get a model with decent speeds and the pen and keyboard accessories (crazily, they\u2019re sold separately).\nFor these reasons and others, it\u2019s unlikely that Microsoft\u2019s PC hardware business will beat Apple\u2019s anytime soon. But anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor."

Whether we do or not, we\u2019re getting one.\nIn honor of World Emoji Day (yes, it exists, and it was Monday), Apple \u2014 whose colorful and increasingly detailed palette of emojis has to some degree altered the way humans communicate \u2014 has shared a preview of12 of its newest emojis. They include a woman with a head scarf, a breast-feeding woman, a vomiting face, a zombie and a sandwich (finally).\nThe full set will be released later this year with updates for various Apple operating systems.\nApple has steadily moved toward inclusivity and diversity in its emojis, enabling users in 2015 to change the skin tone of most of the human emojis. The head-scarf and breast-feeding emojis seem to be in line with this trend.\nTheUnicode Consortium, a nonprofit entity charged withdeciding which emojiswill populate our phones, has a robustselection processthat might surprise some users. The top factor is whether an emoji is needed for compatibility with high-use emojis in other platforms like Snapchat or Twitter.\nAnother major factor is the emoji\u2019s expected level of use; it needs to be high worldwide or within a particular community of users. That is most likely one inspiration behind the hijab emoji, along with the efforts of a 15-year-old Saudi girl, Rayouf Alhumedhi. Her effort wassupported by Alexis Ohanian, a Reddit founder.\nRayouf submitted an emoji proposal to the consortium. Anyone cansubmit an emoji proposal, and how often a particular emoji is requested is important to the consortium.\nAJ+, Al Jazeera Media Network\u2019s current events channel,posted a video of Rayoufon Twitter. In it, she explains why this emoji needed to exist.\n\u201cMillions of women wear a head scarf, and not just Muslim women,\u201d she said, also mentioning that an emoji of a man in a turban already existed.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the head-scarf emoji hasdrawn its share of negative reactionon social media.\nAs of June, there were 2,666 emojis in the Unicode Standard.\nSo if you are bearded, wear a hijab or are feeling squeamish, fear not: You will soon get your emoji."

        "fulltext": "I used a smartphone GPS to find my way through the cobblestoned maze of Geneva\u2019s Old Town, in search of a handmade machine that changed the world more than any other invention. Near a 13th-century cathedral in this Swiss city on the shores of a lovely lake, I found what I was looking for: a Gutenberg printing press.\n\u201cThis was the Internet of its day \u2014 at least as influential as the iPhone,\u201d said Gabriel de Montmollin, the director of the Museum of the Reformation, toying with the replica of Johann Gutenberg\u2019s great invention. It used to take four monks, laboring in a scriptorium with quills over calfskin, up to a year to produce a single book.\nWith the advance in movable type in 15th-century Europe, one press could crank out 3,000 pages a day. Before long, average people could travel to places that used to be unknown to them \u2014 with maps! Medical information passed more freely and quickly, diminishing the sway of quacks. And you could find your own way to God, or a way out of believing in God, with access to formerly forbidden thoughts.\nThe printing press offered the prospect that tyrants would never be able to kill a book or suppress an idea. Gutenberg\u2019s brainchild broke the monopoly that clerics had on scripture. And later, stirred by pamphlets from a version of that same press, the American colonies rose up against a king and gave birth to a nation.\nSo, a question in the summer of this 10th anniversary of the iPhone: has the device that is perhaps the most revolutionary of all time given us a single magnificent idea? Nearly every advancement of the written word through new technology has also advanced humankind.\nSure, you can say the iPhone changedeverything.By putting the world\u2019s recorded knowledge in the palm of a hand, it revolutionized work, dining, travel and socializing. It made us more narcissistic \u2014 here\u2019s more ofmedoing cool stuff! \u2014 and it unleashed an army of awful trolls. We no longer have the patience to sit through a baseball game without that reach to the pocket. And one more casualty of Apple selling more than a billion phones in a decade\u2019s time: daydreaming has become a lost art.\nFor all of that, I\u2019m still waiting to see if the iPhone can do what the printing press did for religion and democracy. This year is also the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther posting his 95 theses against the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church; the Geneva museum makes a strong case that the printing press opened more minds than anything else.\nThe museum\u2019s exhibition \u2014 \u201cPrint! The First Pages of a Revolution\u201d \u2014 quotes Luther as saying that the press was \u201cthe greatest and most extraordinary act of Divine Grace.\u201d As a renegade Catholic monk, Luther might never have seen his writings find their way out of a monastery. But through Gutenberg\u2019s democratizing machine, about 300,000 copies of Luther\u2019s provocations were circulated between 1517 and 1520. Christianity would never be the same.\nSimilarly, it\u2019s hard to imagine the French or American revolutions without those enlightened voices in print.\nIn the beginning of the written word, about 5,000 years ago, people scrawled information on clay. Their messages were sometimes bawdy, more often banal. The Greeks gave us humor, tragedy and poetry. Scrolls of papyrus were portable; Roman commanders used them as the equivalent of paperbacks, tucked into pockets.\n\u201cOn the Nature of Things,\u201d a poem from the Roman philosopher Lucretius in the first century B.C., was one of the most \u201cdangerously radical\u201d things ever written, Stephen Greenblatt argued in his book \u201cThe Swerve.\u201d Rediscovered and then printed in the early stages of the Renaissance on Gutenberg\u2019s press, the poetic celebration of the good life overturned much of Europe\u2019s dour medieval mind-set.\nCount Magna Carta, one of the founding documents in the evolution of free societies, and Chaucer\u2019s \u201cCanterbury Tales,\u201d which popularized English vernacular, among the highlights of the thousand years or so when books were made by hand-cramped scribes, or printed from wooden blocks.\nNot long after Steve Jobs introduced his iPhone, he said the bound book was probably headed for history\u2019s attic. Not so fast. After a period of rapid growth in e-books, something closer to the medium for Chaucer\u2019s volumes has made a great comeback.\nThe hope of the iPhone, and the Internet in general, was that it would free people in closed societies. But the failure of the Arab Spring, and the continued suppression of ideas in North Korea, China and Iran, has not borne that out. And it\u2019s beyond pathetic that the leader of the free world uses his phone to insult women, or send out bizarre videos of him beating up imaginary reporters.\nThe iPhone is still young. It has certainly been \u201cone of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history,\u201d as Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook said. But I\u2019m not sure if the world changed for the better with the iPhone \u2014 as it did with the printing press \u2014 or merely changed."

        "fulltext": "Q.I have been a dedicated PC user since the mid-1980s and have only used Windows-based computers, but I am now contemplating a switch to Apple and have concerns. Will my external backup drives be accessed smoothly once connected to a Mac? I don\u2019t use the cloud because I don\u2019t want my stuff out there and don\u2019t want any additional storage expenses. How do I transfer my desktop items, Google bookmarks, etc.? Will I still be able to use Chrome?\nA.Switching computer platforms is much easier than it used to be, thanks to programs that help you copy over your data, applications that have both Windows and Mac versions and file formats like .JPG photos that can be easily opened on most desktop and mobile systems. Although getting comfortable with the Mac user interface after decades of Windows may take some time, the most labor-intensive part of the process for many people is just transferring personal data from one computer to another.\nIf your external backup drive isformatted with exFATor another file system the Mac can read,you may able to copy backed-up datafrom it to the Mac. If the Mac cannot read the format of the Windows backup drive, you may just want to start fresh by transferring the data you want to move from the Windows machine itself to the Mac, and then setting up a new backup system there.\nApple\u2019s Mac operating system includes its own backup program calledTime Machine, and if you intend to use it, you may want to invest in a new external drive that you can dedicate to the software. You do need toformat the backup driveto work with Time Machine.\nAs for moving your data from the Windows PC in the first place, Apple\u2019s site offersa free, illustrated step-by-step guideto transferring your documents, pictures, music, videos and other files to a Mac. Awelcome guideanda page of tipsfor newly arrived Windows users can also be found on the Apple site. Although you are prompted toset up an Apple ID accountto use the Mac App Store and some of Apple\u2019s services like iMessage and FaceTime, you do not have touse iCloudto store files online or pay a monthly fee.\nPrograms written for Windows do not naturally run on the Mac, so you need to find Mac-compatible versions or replacements for applications you regularly use. Google makes versions of itsChrome browserfor Apple\u2019sMacandiOSoperating systems, so you can download and install the software on the new computer.Exporting your bookmarksfrom the Windows version and importing them to the Mac version is one way to move them. If yousign into Chromewitha Google account, you can also justsync all your browser data automaticallybetween devices.\nFor Mac users contemplating a switch in the opposite direction, to a new Windows 10 computer, Microsoft has its ownwelcome guidewith tips for transferring files to a new Surface PC.Consumer Reports offers adviceof its own, as do many of the Windows-focused blogs around the web, likeWindows Central."

        "title": "How to Plan a Trip With the New TripAdvisor",
        "fulltext": "With so many websites vying for the opportunity to book your next trip,TripAdvisoris hoping its recent makeover will help it stand out from the ever-expanding crowd.\nNot that the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s largest travel site\u201d is hurting for attention, with 390 million average unique monthly visitors and over 500 million reviews for hotels, restaurants and other travel destinations. But standing pat is never an option in the highly competitive travel booking industry.\nWhich brings us to TripAdvisor\u2019s new look, which comes with additional search features and a more personalized app foriOSandAndroiddevices. With nearly half of TripAdvisor\u2019s traffic coming from mobile last year, an increase of 29 percent, according to the company, it\u2019s no surprise that the most noticeable changes are seen on its revised smartphone and tablet incarnations.\nBut does new really mean a better experience for prospective travelers?\nI used the new TripAdvisor to help plan a recent trip to North Adams, Mass., and for the most part, the change was good.\nOn TripAdvisor\u2019s new desktop home page, a cleaner design and simpler layout are instantly noticeable, and once you start searching for travel accommodations, you\u2019ll encounter a new \u201cBest Value\u201d filter, which is a ranking using TripAdvisor-specific data such as its user ratings, prices, popularity, location and your personal user preferences. You can also still sort results based on user reviews, cost and distance alone.\nRestaurants are now filterable by \u201cCheap Eats,\u201d \u201cFine Dining,\u201d \u201cMid-Range\u201d and a host of other categories. One could quickly find a vegetarian-friendly, family-friendly restaurant that has free Wi-Fi with just a few clicks. You can then reserve that table (if it allows online reservations) without leaving the website, thanks to integration with the restaurant booking service OpenTable.\nOnce you pick a city, you are placed into what is essentially a mini travel guide for that city, with the ability to smoothly switch between filterable results for vacation rentals (which can be booked directly on TripAdvisor), restaurants and things to do. As I was heading to North Adams, I could quickly toggle to see top hotels, likethe Porches Inn,restaurants such asPublic eat + drink,and attractions includingMASS MoCA.This seamless search experience cannot be found on some other popular travel sites.\nThe search experience is replicated on the app, which also offers a host of cool features not found on the desktop version or on many other travel apps (though it would be nice if they were available on both desktop and mobile).\nOne such feature is \u201cMy Trips.\u201d By creating a trip, which requires only a name and the dates, I was able to bookmark places of interest and schedule them on a trip-specific calendar. You can easily share your trip via email or SMS with your traveling partner(s) so they can see what you\u2019re interested in and add their own preferences. This may not seem as necessary for couples, but in a large group, the feature would be a great way to keep everyone on track.\nOnce I was in North Adams, I mainly stuck with the app version of TripAdvisor and appreciated that all of my bookmarked attractions and restaurants were easily accessible and placed on a map within the app. For directions between locations, TripAdvisor used Apple Maps on my iPhone, which is not my preferred maps app, but it was better than nothing.\nThe app\u2019s standout feature, depending on how paranoid you are, is the \u201cTravel Timeline\u201d option, which will allow you to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at places along your trip (similar to features on Swarm and Facebook), but tracks your journey in timeline form. As with most apps that track location, you must give the app permission to do so, and the app promises the timeline is only visible to you (though you can share portions of it with friends via SMS or email).\nThe travel timeline will ask you if you\u2019re at a restaurant or attraction; it will never assume you\u2019re anywhere unless you confirm. If you forget to check your app while at a location, it will give you an opportunity to go back and plot previous stops. Should you be taking photos along the way, it will automatically package those near the times and places on your timeline.\nWhile my wife was a bit spooked by the timeline tracking our every move, I liked that it was creating a record of where we were. If you\u2019re like me and tend to forget the name of that one restaurant while you\u2019re attempting to recommend it to a friend, you\u2019ll appreciate the timeline.\nYou can also give your mother one less reason to check your Facebook page by easily, and privately, sharing parts of your timeline via SMS or email, photos included.\nAs promising as I found many of these features, some things could be a bit more intuitive. I drove myself slightly crazy trying to turn off the timeline once my trip was over (waiting for the train on the Monday back to work is not a memory I want to retain). The on/off toggle on the timeline page goes away after you turn it on. To turn it off, you have to go to the app\u2019s settings.\nAnd while the ability to download city guides is great in theory \u2014 giving you access to information and maps offline when you lose cellular service or just want to save on data \u2014 I spent several minutes poking around trying to download the North Adams guide, but realized there isn\u2019t one for every city. But it would be nice to be able to download maps regardless of whether there is a city guide.\nIf you\u2019re able to download one of the over 300 city guides that are available, you will have convenient access to them in an appropriately labeled tab within the app.\nThe average user of the new TripAdvisor should be impressed with its intuitive layout and improved search capability, and the app has enough promising functionality that already distinguishes it from other travel-booking apps like Expedia\u2019s and Kayak\u2019s. TripAdvisor says new features like better mapping technology are coming soon, which should only strengthen its case for being a premier all-in-one online travel planner."

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: Hello, Mike. I\u2019m having a groggy morning because I stayed up late this week to watch C-Span.\nOh, who am I kidding? I stay up late to watch C-Span every night.\nMike: Sad!\nJust kidding, I was up late watching C-Span, too. But I watched it on Periscope from my phone. Because, you know, tech.\nFarhad: O.K., there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of tech news this week. It\u2019s summer. Everyone\u2019s on vacation. So let\u2019s get to the most exciting stuff first \u2014 earnings reports!\nMike:Are you trying to put me to sleep? I just told you I was up all night watching C-Span.\nFarhad:Uh-huh. So Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company,reportedthat it\u2019s doing very well even though European regulators recently slapped it with a $2.7 billion fine. It made about $3.52 billion in profit in its last quarter, which was down 28 percent from last year \u2014 but if you don\u2019t count the money for the fine, its income actually rose 28 percent. So, yeah, they can take Google\u2019s money, but they can\u2019t take it all, I guess.\nMike: Slapping Google with a $2.7 billion fine is like giving a dirty look to an A.T.M. It\u2019s gonna keep spitting out cash no matter what.\nFarhad: Let\u2019sturn to Amazon. Investors were expecting the company to show more profits this quarter, but that wasn\u2019t in the cards. Amazon reported a 25 percent increase in revenue but its profit declined to less than $200 million, compared with $857 million this time last year. That was way under Wall Street\u2019s expectations, but Wall Street is used to this sort of disappointment from Amazon, so the stock price didn\u2019t fall all that much.\nHey, isn\u2019t that your policy at work? If you never do what people want, at least they\u2019ll get used to it.\nMike: I mean, I usually like to say that I \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver,\u201d but I guess your way also sounds right.\nAmazon is so funny. They\u2019ve trained the Street not to flinch even when the company loses oodles of money \u2014 or in this case, doesn\u2019t make as much money as expected \u2014 because it\u2019s all in service of a greater good. Meanwhile, other companies hemorrhaging cash are considered to be on their deathbeds.\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s just interesting how some companies get a certain amount of latitude even when they\u2019re not delivering the best results.\nFarhad: Hey, do you remember the iPod? You may be too young, but it was basically the hot gadget of the 2000s. Everyone had one. And now, they\u2019re nearly all gone. This week, Applekilled off the iPod Nano and the iPod Shuffle, the only two iPods left that weren\u2019t based on the iPhone. The iPod Touch is still around but that\u2019s basically just a phone, so it doesn\u2019t count.\nMike:I\u2019m not that young! I remember when iPods first came out as a big white brick you were supposed to carry around, and it cost some crazy amount of money. As a kid at the time, I was still carrying around my Sony Walkman-esque CD player, praying for it not to skip if I moved the wrong way.\nFarhad:I haven\u2019t used one in years, but I really loved the simple days of the iPod. Sure, your smartphone is more powerful and can do pretty much anything, but its power comes at a cost \u2014 with all the news and status updates and email and late-night C-Span it brings you, your iPhone regularly makes you feel bad.\nBut an iPod? Pure joy, every time.\nMike:Maybe we can go back to simpler times someday, my friend. Though judging by the constant vibrations in my pocket, I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s not the case.\nFarhad:Finally, what\u2019s up with Uber\u2019s C.E.O. search? This week we got news that Meg Whitman, who\u2019s now C.E.O. of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and who led eBay for years, was one of the top choices for the job. Then on Thursday,she announced that the job wasn\u2019t hers.\nNow there\u2019s speculation that Jeff Immelt, who is stepping down as the C.E.O. of General Electric,might be in the running. What\u2019s your read on the search?\nMike:My official read is that the whole thing is off-the-rails crazy. The Jeff Immelt thing seemed only half-real, and I\u2019ve heard a number of folks who are adamantly opposed to Immelt taking any sort of leadership role. Whitman was certainly a contender, but things went south when everything leaked.\nThe latest? I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea who could be Uber\u2019s next C.E.O. And honestly, after Meg bowed out, I\u2019m not sure if they do either.\nO.K., enough of this. It\u2019s summertime, I\u2019m off to drink lemonade and watch C-Span until 3 a.m. Ta-ta for now!\nFarhad:See you!"
