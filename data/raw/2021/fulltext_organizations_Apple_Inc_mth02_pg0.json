        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Unlikely Next Battleground: North Dakota",
        "fulltext": "Last month, a lobbyist approached Kyle Davison, a North Dakota state senator, with an unusual proposal: a law to stop Apple andGooglefrom forcing companies in the state tohand over a share of their app sales.\nMr. Davison, a Republican, was focused on bills related to a $200,000 literacy program and birth records for the homeless. But he was intrigued by the lobbyist\u2019s arguments that the tech giants were hurting small businesses, and he thought such a law could attract tech companies to North Dakota. So heintroduced it.\n\u201cShe said to me that this could be big. But to me, that means the local newspaper is going to come with a camera,\u201d Mr. Davison, 60, said. \u201cI would not be truthful if I said I expected the reaction.\u201d\nAt the Capitol in Bismarck, a 21-story Art Deco tower that\u2019s the state\u2019s tallest building, a hearing on the bill last week drew Washington lawyers, North Dakota newspapers and Silicon Valley executives. Siding with Apple and Google was Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Koch family. On the other side was the Fargo Chamber of Commerce. One person called in from Alaska.\nSupporters of the bill said it would help smaller companies and only hurt Apple and Google\u2019s revenues. Apple\u2019s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testified that the bill \u201cthreatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.\u201d\nNorth Dakota is part of a new front in the battle over Big Tech and its power. Frustrated with a lack of action from courts, regulators and Congress, tech rivals and critics are turning their attention to state legislatures, pushing bills that seek to tax the biggest tech companies, rein in their power and limit their control over the internet.\nNew York isconsidering a billthat would make it easier for the state to pursue antitrust cases against the big tech companies. Lawmakers in Florida this monthproposed measures, backed by the governor, that would limit how social media companies could police content on their sites. And on Friday, Marylandenacted a lawthat will tax online ads sold by companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Connecticut and Indiana are looking at similar bills.\nThe state fights pose a thorny problem for the tech companies, whose legions of lawyers and lobbyists are trained to extinguish threats in Washington and the courts. The 50 state legislatures are diverse and unpredictable, with both Republicans and Democrats aligning against Big Tech.\nThe North Dakota bill focuses on Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s practices oftaking a cut of up to 30 percent from many app saleson smartphones, a policy that brought the companies a combined $33 billion last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, an app data firm.\nSome smaller companies have argued that Apple and Google force app makers to pay an artificially high fee only because of their sheer dominance. The two companies\u2019 software underpins nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones.\nThe bill would prohibit Apple and Google from requiring apps to use their payment systems, which enable them to collect their commissions.\nIt would also require Apple and Google to allow users of their smartphones to download apps from outside their flagship app stores, though Mr. Davison said he was trying to remove that provision to ease some of his colleagues\u2019 concerns. Google already allows such downloads, but Apple does not.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s 47 senators are set to vote on the measure this week after debate starts on Monday. The timeline is accelerated because the legislature meets for just 80 days every two years. If a majority votes aye, the bill will move on to the House.\nIf the bill fails, Apple and Google\u2019s fight would appear far from over. Georgia and Arizona lawmakers are considering nearly identical app-store legislation, and Andy Vargas, a state representative in Massachusetts, said he planned to introduce a comparable bill this week. Lobbyists said they were also pushing for app-store bills in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said most iPhone apps were free and didn\u2019t pay any commission. She added that most of the North Dakota companies that shared revenue with Apple earned less than $1 million a year from their apps, meaning they pay Apple 15 percent of some sales, rather than 30 percent. Applelowered its rate for smaller companieslast year amid scrutiny of its App Store policies.\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Davison said he had been given the draft legislation by Lacee Bjork Anderson, a lobbyist with Odney Public Affairs in Bismarck. Ms. Anderson said in an interview that she had been hired by Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite andthe plaintiff in lawsuits against Apple and Googleover their app policies. She said she was also being paid by theCoalition for App Fairness, a group of firms, including Epic, Spotify and Match Group, that has protested app commissions and is leading the push for app-store bills.\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re a very conservative state,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, a Republican. \u201cBut we also are a state where Teddy Roosevelt came from, and there\u2019s no bigger trustbuster.\u201d (Roosevelt, the former president, was born in New York but later owned a ranch in North Dakota.)\nStill, she admitted that the bill might not have enough votes to pass, which she attributed to confusion among some senators and aggressive lobbying from Apple.\n\u201cThey\u2019re setting up Zoom calls with every senator,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily play well up here \u2014 having California executives or lobbyists trying to tell people what to do.\u201d\nState Senator Jerry Klein, the Republican who leads the committee that handled the bill, agreed that Apple\u2019s presence was being felt at the statehouse. He said he opposed the legislation largely because Apple and its lobbyists warned that the bill could put North Dakotans at risk of cyberattacks and make North Dakota subject to expensive lawsuits. He also worried that interfering in an agreement between two private companies would be bad for business.\nMr. Klein, 69, a retired grocery-store owner from tiny Fessenden, said some of his colleagues were also wary of passing a bill focused on \u201cdigital application distribution platforms\u201d and \u201cin-application payment systems\u201d when they struggled to understand the effects.\n\u201cAll people here know is that they\u2019ve got their phone plugged in, it has power, they can take pictures and show photos of their grandkids,\u201d he said. \u201cThis goes beyond some of us.\u201d\nYet some app makers have a lot riding on the legislation. David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish tech entrepreneur who has fought to avoid Apple\u2019s fees with hisemail app, Hey, said the bill could be a significant blow to Apple\u2019s policies, even though it would apply only to North Dakota companies.\nHe said that if the bill passed, he was prepared to set up offices in North Dakota. And he predicted that if moving there meant avoiding paying Apple 30 percent of sales, many other companies would join him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be that large of a software company before 30 percent of your revenues is your largest line item,\u201d he said. He added that he had never been to North Dakota, where the temperature the other day dipped to minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit, \u201cbut I hear it\u2019s lovely.\u201d\nMr. Heinemeier Hansson said he wasn\u2019t betting on North Dakota\u2019s adopting the law, but he said the fact that the bill was getting attention and receiving a vote would encourage other states to consider similar measures.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Apple showed up with the big scary picture that this would end iPhone as we know it,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it wouldn\u2019t end iPhone as we know it, for this to pass in North Dakota. They\u2019re afraid that whichever state first opens the floodgates, the floodgates will then be open.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "ANorth Dakota billthat an Apple executive had warned \u201cthreatens to destroy iPhone as you know it\u201d died in a vote on Tuesday.\nThree-quarters of North Dakota\u2019s 48 state senators voted against the bill, which sought to prohibit Apple and Google from forcing North Dakota companies to hand over a share of their app sales.\nThe bill targetedApple\u2019s and Google\u2019s practices of charging a commissionof up to 30 percent on many app sales. The companies brought in a combined $33 billion from those commissions last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, an app data firm.\nCompanies like Epic Games, Spotify and Match Group, along with some smaller app developers, have protested the commissions as artificially high, arguing that Apple and Google can only charge them because they are a duopoly and that app makers have little choice but to deal with them to reach customers. The two tech giants make the software that underpin nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones.\nThe bill attracted intense lobbying on both sides. Apple in particular feared it would set a dangerous precedent for its business, enabling app developers to avoid fees that have been crucial to its recent growth. Apple and its lobbyists warned that the bill could put North Dakota at risk of expensive lawsuits.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put the state in a position where we need to spend our taxpayer dollars in litigation, because these are some very big companies,\u201d Jerry Klein, a Republican state senator, said on Tuesday on the floor of the North Dakota Senate. \u201cLet\u2019s stay out of the courts.\u201d\nAfter the vote, Kyle Davison, the Republican state senator who introduced the bill, blamed its failure on the issue\u2019s complexity and the opposition from Apple. \u201cWhen banging heads with Apple you need to be able to match their intensity with resources, including lobbyists,\u201d he said.\nCritics and rivals of Apple and Google now turn their attention to other states. Arizona, Georgia and Massachusetts are considering similar legislation, and lobbyists are pushing for nearly identical bills in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Coalition for App Fairness, a group of companies that oppose the app-store commissions, including Epic and Spotify, is leading the push for the bills.\nApple declined to comment and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

        "fulltext": "As millions get vaccinated, Apple is making a design change to its syringe emoji, swapping an image with drops of blood at the end of the emoji\u2019s needle for one that looks more like a vaccine.\nThe redesigned emoji is available only to members of the company\u2019s beta program but will be publicly available with iOS 14.5. While new emojis are more difficult to approve, changing an emoji\u2019s design can enact a similar result on a faster timeline, according to Keith Broni, the deputy emoji officer atEmojipedia, a service that archives the design and usage trends of emojis.\nThe syringe emoji dates to 1999 and had been used mainly to illustrate blood donations in Japan. The emoji was often used in discussions around blood donations and even tattooing, Mr. Broni said.\n\u201cWhen you provide someone with a communication tool, they will use it as they see fit,\u201d Mr. Broni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many different emojis take on many different connotations.\u201d\nMr. Broni said he had started to notice a spike in the usage of the emoji late last year, and saw that the conversations people were having on Twitter while using it had pivoted to talk about coronavirus vaccines.\nMr. Broni said he expected the change from Apple to be a permanent one, and that other technology companies would be likely to follow suit. He said the emoji that resembles a vaccine injection could be used more readily and that removing the blood would make the emoji more flexible and less intimidating."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nThis will be one of the inescapable threads of our digital lives: Government authorities almost everywhere are weighing whether and how to assert more control over the technology that shapes our future.\nWhat had been a relatively hands-off approach to regulating the technology industry is now being reconsidered fromglobalcapitalstosmallerU.S.states. We\u2019re seeing this play out overtaxes,novel forms of work,digital privacy, newapplications of corporate powerand thebounds of free expression.\nSome of the government efforts may be misplaced or counterproductive, but this clash is not going away, and its outcomes will be both unpredictable and momentous.\nI discussed these developments and why they matter with my colleagueDavid McCabe, who recently wroteabout U.S. states trying to impose new taxes on big technology companies.\nShira: What are some of the proposed U.S. state or local tech laws that you\u2019re watching?\nDavid:The one that justpassed in Marylandwas a novel tax on ads that companies like Facebook and Google show to state residents. The state is trying to plug budget holes by targeting new taxes at rich tech companies, and it\u2019s not alone. Indiana and Connecticut are considering similar taxes tohelp fund rural broadbandoronline bullying prevention programs.\nThere\u2019s a feeling, too, that these tech companieshaven\u2019t been taxed enough relative to their profits and influence on the economy.\nBesides the tax measures, New York hadproposed reforming its antitrust lawto make it easier to sue tech companies.\nAnd there isa bill in Floridathat would prohibit companies from suspending the accounts of political candidates. This may be one of several state proposals that we\u2019ll see in response to theunproven claimsthat social media companies are biased against conservative views.\nThose proposed bills \u2014 and North Dakota\u2019s bill onhow Apple charges for iPhone appsin the state \u2014 seem like issues that Congress typically handles.\nYes, but the state legislatures clearly don\u2019t believe issues like data privacy, online expression and tech monopolies are wholly federal matters. Congress also moves slowlyor is completely gridlockedon many of these concerns.\nIt is not clear, though, how far states are permitted to go in these tech regulations and taxes. The Maryland digital advertising tax will almost certainly be challenged in court.\nHow do tech companies feel about this?\nWe\u2019ll probably hear more from them that state lawmakers are in over their heads and will hurt their own states\u2019 economies with new taxes or regulation. That\u2019s often how any company responds to more government rules or costs.\nAnd on some issues \u2014 notably afterCalifornia passed strict digital privacy laws\u2014 big technology companies are pushing for federal laws, in part to head off any future local or state rules that might be even harsher.\nIs there a common theme among new regulations that tech companies are facing in places likePakistan,Australiaand the United States?\nIt\u2019s a sign of the new reality for Google, Facebook, Amazon and America\u2019s other tech powers. These companies started out as lightly regulated newcomers, but as they grew and went global, other countries started to become concerned about the companies\u2019 effect on their economies, workers and people\u2019s communications.\nNow the reconsideration of a laissez-faire approach to tech regulation has landed back in the United States, including in states and cities.\nTip of the Week\nIn the categoryof tiny victories, the New York Times consumer technology columnistBrian X. Chenwalks through a coming feature for newer model iPhones that recognizes our faces when we\u2019re wearing a mask. Spoiler alert: This won\u2019t apply to everyone with an iPhone.\nA nagging annoyance for many iPhone owners in the pandemic is the inability of the device\u2019s face scanner to recognize us with our masks on. That means we can\u2019t unlock our phones while wearing a face mask, and we\u2019ve had to resort to punching in a passcode. There are, of course, bigger problems this year. But still, this feels lame.\nThere\u2019s a solution on the way \u2014 if you have an Apple Watch. In the next version of iOS (14.5), you\u2019ll be able to quickly unlock the phone while wearing a mask. The watch essentially becomes the way for the iPhone to verify that it\u2019s you.\nThe new iPhone software is still in beta mode, meaning the official version has yet to be released to the public. I typically recommend against installing beta software because it can be prone to glitches. But if you\u2019re eager to unlock your phone while wearing a mask, here\u2019s what you can do:\nSign up forApple\u2019s beta software program.Then click through the steps to enroll your iPhone and Apple Watch so that they can install the beta software.\nAfter installing the beta software on both the iPhone and Apple Watch, open the Settings app on your iPhone.Then scroll down to \u201cFace ID & Passcode.\u201d In this menu, scroll down to \u201cUnlock with Apple Watch\u201d and toggle on the option to use your Apple Watch to unlock when the image scanner detects your face with a mask.\nNext time you\u2019re at the grocery store and you look at your phone, your watch will vibrate once and unlock your phone. Sweet relief.\nFrom government lawyers to private lawsuits:David\u2019s latest article is about people \u2014 including \u201cMr. Sweepy,\u201d the owner of a small sweepstakes website \u2014suing Google and Facebookwith the same claims as the government antitrust lawsuits.\nWhat do Vanilla Ice, Roger Stone and Ai Weiwei have in common?They\u2019re on Clubhouse, the nearly year-old audio chatroom app. My colleagues Erin Griffith and Taylor Lorenz wrote that Clubhouse\u2019s rise has generated debate about whether audio is the next wave of social media. The start-up has also faced complaints about harassment, misinformation and leaky user data.\nDefinitive evidence that you\u2019re not cool:Thelaugh-cry emoji is for old people,CNN tells us. The reporter also tweeted a teenager\u2019slist of youth-approved emojis.\nI\u2019m terrible at ice skating, butlook at how beautiful it looks on canals in the Netherlands. (Uhhh, butbe careful on thin ice!) And the country has beenwaiting 24 years for perfect canal iceto hold a beloved 120-mile speedskating race.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "Uber for Everything",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nOne of the technology industry\u2019s big bets is that once a company is good at transporting one thing, it should be able to do the same for anything.\nCompanies including Uber and Instacart are starting to branch out from one area \u2014 getting people or groceries to their destination \u2014 into delivering restaurant food,prescription drugs,home goods,pet foodandconvenience store items. In that vein, Uber this weekbought Drizly, which delivers from liquor stores.\nYou can imagine the potential if courier services delivered almost anything under the sun. But will it work, and is it a good thing?\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict whether one-stop delivery behemoths will pan out or what the ripple effects might be \u2014 both helpful and harmful. But we should pay attention to these companies\u2019 moves and think critically about the stakes for small businesses, our wallets, our communities and the U.S. work force.\nFirst, the promise of Uber for everything, and then some of the complications.\nThis could be awesome. Couriers could have more work if they can pick up passengers, deliver burritos and drop off cases of beer. Selling more types of stuff could reverse losses at app-based companies like Uber and DoorDash. And it\u2019s handy for people who like shopping from their sofas. Win-win-win.\nIt could be good for local businesses and our communities, too. Imagine if a local toy shop or grocery store could more easily serve both the people shopping in person and those nearby who prefer delivery. Our favorite businesses could have a second life without going broke competing against Amazon or shipping orders hundreds of miles by mail.\nMy colleagueKate Congertold me that the pandemic has shown that many of us are eager for home delivery of everything, and that has made more tech industry watchers believe that app-based companies can successfully become one-stop delivery machines.\nIt\u2019s also possible that theUbermodel for anything won\u2019t work out, or that if it does it will entrench the worst aspects of delivery-by-app companies.\nFor all Uber\u2019s talk about its beautiful dual businesses in restaurant food delivery and moving people, they are wildly different. The customers might overlap, but signing up restaurants and keeping them feeling satisfied is a whole different game than moving people around.\nPlus, each new type of delivered goods \u2014 groceries, convenience store items, home improvement stuff and booze \u2014 have different operations and logistics. Can one generalist be good at them all?\nAlso worth mentioning: Many restaurants have said that app-based delivery serviceshave been a bad bargain. Will businesses in other industries feel the same?\nIf one-stop delivery companies aren\u2019t viable, it could hurt shoppers that have relied on them, businesses that have bet their futures on them \u2014 and especially the workers who are lowest in the gig-economy hierarchy.\nIf you hang around Silicon Valley long enough, you\u2019ll probably hear a line stolen from Ernest Hemingway thatchange often happens gradually and then suddenly. One order of Cheetos and beer at a time, we and app companies may be remaking our habits, communities and the labor force.\nIn 2015, my colleague Dai Wakabayashi reported for The Wall Street Journal thatApple was working on an electric vehicle. And today, the company may still beat least half a decade awayfrom its cars hitting the roads.\nI\u2019m excited about the possibility of an Apple car.More electric cars, yes! But Apple\u2019s history shows that it\u2019s not easy being a car newcomer. And Apple may have unique disadvantages that make its brand of car no sure thing.\nThe latest news is that the maker of Hyundai and Kia cars is negotiating to eventually make Apple vehicles at a Kia factory in Georgia, CNBCreportedon Wednesday. Teaming up with an experienced car manufacturer is probably necessary.\nApple has been here before, however. About five years ago, the company worked on car engineering withMagna International in Canada. That didn\u2019t go anywhere, because Apple\u2019s car project has been a shambles.\nThe company has repeatedly staffed up its car initiative,changed its mind about its strategyand fired a bunch of people. Apple went back and forth, too, on whether to try for fully driverless cars, and whether it should create the car or just design the technology for it. Driverless technologyis apparently back on.\nNever count Apple out. But I wonder if the company\u2019s dithering reflects underlying and unfixable problems. And Apple has a cultural disadvantage here. Steve Jobs sprung the iPhone on a world surprised by it, but the company\u2019s predilection for secrecy and delight doesn\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 apply to driverless cars.\nA driverless car has to be rigorously tested on public roads and win the confidence of regulators and the public. Apple has to clue in an army of allies on its product road map \u2014 something it doesn\u2019t do to the same extent with its gadget partners. (Apple has conducted driverless car road tests, but far less than others have.)\nI hope it works. ButG.M.\u2019s whole fleet might be electricbefore Apple gets a single car off the factory floor.\nAmazon\u2019s new boss is \u201cNice!\u201d or maybe \u201cNice!!!!\u201d:Karen Weise and Dai have afun glimpse at Andy Jassy, who in a few months will become the chief executive of Amazon.

        "title": "Parler, a Social Network That Attracted Trump Fans, Returns Online",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Parler, the social network thatdrew millions of Trump supportersbefore disappearing from the internet, is back online a month afterAmazon and other tech giants cut off the companyfor hosting calls for violence around the time of the Capitol riot.\nGetting iced out by the tech giants turned Parler into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for conservatives who complained they were being censored, as well as a test case for the openness of the internet. It was unclear if the social network, which had positioned itself as a free speech and lightly moderated site, could survive after it had been blacklisted by the biggest tech companies.\nFor weeks, it appeared the answer was no. But on Monday, for the first time since Jan. 10, typing parler.com into a web browser returned a page to log into the social network \u2014 a move that had required weeks of work by the small company and that had led to the departure of its chief executive.\nParler executives did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.\nAfter many large web-hosting firms rejected Parler, the site came back online with the help of a small provider near Los Angeles called SkySilk. Kevin Matossian, SkySilk\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that he was helping Parler to support free speech. For other services required to run a large website, Parler relied onhelp from a Russian firmthat once worked for the Russian government anda Seattle firmthat once supported a neo-Nazi site.\nParler\u2019s return appeared to be a victory for small companies that challenge the dominance of Big Tech. The company had sought to portray its plight about the power of companies like Amazon, which stopped hosting Parler\u2019s website on its computer servers, and Apple and Google, which removed Parler\u2019s mobile app from their app stores.\nParler had become a hub for right-wing conversation over the past year, as millions of people on the far right had flocked to the platform over what they perceived as censorship of conservative voices by Facebook, Twitter and Google. Much of the content on Parler was benign, but for months ahead of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the site also hosted hate speech, misinformation and calls for violence.\nDays after the riot, Amazon, Apple and Google said they had cut off Parler because it showed that it could not consistently enforce its own rules against posts that incited violence. Apple and Google have said they would allow Parler\u2019s app to return if the company could prove it could effectively police its social network.\nAfter Amazon booted Parler from its web-hosting service, Parler sued it, accusing it of antitrust violations and breaking its contract. A federal judge said last month that Amazon\u2019s contract allowed it to terminate service and declined to force the company to keep hosting Parler, as the start-up had requested.\nParler had more than 15 million users when it went offline and was one of the fastest growing apps in the United States. It is largely financed by Rebekah Mercer, one of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest benefactors.\nJohn Matze, a software engineer who was Parler\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said earlier this month thatMs. Mercer had effectively fired himover disagreements on how to run the site. Ms. Mercer hired Mark Meckler, a leading voice in the Tea Party movement, to replace Mr. Matze.\nBefore the site\u2019s return on Monday, Parler executives had said they were rejected by multiple web-hosting companies that either feared a public-relations backlash or a cyberattack if they agreed to support the site.\nOn Monday morning, after Parler suddenly appeared on the web again, data behind its website showed that it was being supported by SkySilk. Hours later, Mr. Matossian, SkySilk\u2019s C.E.O., emailed a statement that said he was taking a stand for Parler.\n\u201cSkySilk does not advocate nor condone hate, rather, it advocates the right to private judgment and rejects the role of being the judge, jury and executioner. Unfortunately, too many of our fellow technology providers seem to differ,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we may disagree with some of the sentiment found on the Parler platform, we cannot allow First Amendment rights to be hampered or restricted by anyone or any organization.\u201d\nAbout a week after it went offline, Parler set up a basic webpage for people trying to visit its social network with simple messages that said the company was working to get back online and notes of support from conservatives like Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky.\nThat page, which was so simple it could have been hosted from a single laptop, still required cybersecurity protections to stay online, in part because Parler has been under attack from internet vigilantes who believe it helped play a role in the Capitol riot.\nTo stay online, Parler got help from DDoS-Guard, a Russian firm, whichraised concerns among some internet researchersthat the Russian government could surveil Parler users. Parler also partnered with Epik, a Seattle company, for its domain registration, a basic service of the internet. Epik hashelped support other fringe sitesthat lost their support from other companies, including the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site.\nMr. Matze founded Parler in 2018 with a fellow programmer outside of Las Vegas, aiming to tap into growing discontent with Silicon Valley, particularly among people on the far right, who were finding themselves increasingly restricted on mainstream social networks as Facebook and Twitter cracked down on hate speech, threats and misinformation.\nMs. Mercer bankrolled the site. Other investors include Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and Fox News pundit, and Jeffrey Wernick, an early adopter of Bitcoin who is now Parler\u2019s chief operating officer. Parler plans to eventually make money by selling ads, though that business was nascent when it shut down.\nParler is essentially a clone of Twitter, where users can broadcast messages to their followers, though it is harder to navigate and often much slower, an issue that could get even worse without the support of Amazon. It is also dominated by conservatives. The website prompts new users to follow a series of conservative voices, including Mr. Hannity, the actress Kirstie Alley, and Phil Robertson, the star of the reality TV show \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d\nParler gained momentum in 2020, particularly after the November election when Facebook and Twitter began labeling posts from former President Donald J. Trump asserting that the election was rigged. So many new users signed up that at times the flood overwhelmed Parler\u2019s systems and caused the site to crash or slow down.\nAhead of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, the conversation on Parler turned dark, with users calling for fellow \u201cpatriots\u201d to take back the United States and some calling for violence, including coordinated assassinations of Democrats. Some users posted images of guns they planned to bring to the rally in Washington and others discussed streets to avoid police and tools to break into buildings.\nIn the days after the riot, Facebook and Twitter removed Mr. Trump\u2019s account from their sites, causing millions more people concerned about what they saw as censorship to register accounts with Parler. It became the No. 1 app on Apple and Google\u2019s app stores. Then Apple and Google removed the app, and Amazon cut off its service."
