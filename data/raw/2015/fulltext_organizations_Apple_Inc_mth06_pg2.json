        "fulltext": "In an age of depressed record sales, her albums sell by the millions. Her tours fill arenas around the world. And acomplimentary tweetto her nearly 60 million followers can help kick-start another singer\u2019s career.\nBut as Taylor Swift\u2019s victory in aone-day battle against Applethis week showed, she also has a rare power to influence the music business itself, at a time of deep anxiety among artists big and small about the value of their work. These days, the concern is about the value of music in the digital age, and by taking on Apple \u2014 and Spotify before it \u2014 Ms. Swift has emerged as perhaps the most effective negotiator in the business, for her own benefit as well as others\u2019.\n\u201cShe is the most powerful person in the music industry,\u201d said David Lowery of the bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, and anadvocate for artists\u2019 rights. \u201cShe is able to bring the debate to the mainstream.\u201d\nMs. Swift reaches the masses through her adept use of social media, whether teasing a new album on Instagram or taking on industry economics on her blog. On Sunday morning, Ms. Swift wrote a diplomatic but sternTumblr posttaking Apple to task for not paying royalties on test drives of its new streaming music service, set to open on June 30.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\u201d\nBy midnight Sunday, Apple \u2014 one of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 had capitulated to the 25-year-old pop star, saying it would pay royalties on all music for the three-month trials. One of its senior executives, Eddy Cue, even said he called Ms. Swift personally to give her the news.\nThe backdrop to that decision was much more complex than the quick exchange might have indicated. For more than a week,independent labels around the worldhad been complaining about Apple\u2019s proposed terms, saying that even for 90 days, a big drop in revenue from Apple \u2014 by far the music industry\u2019s largest sales outlet \u2014 could be devastating.\nBut even though Mr. Cue carefully noted in interviews that the company\u2019s decision had been made with those labels in mind, its hurried announcement late Sunday suggested that it was Ms. Swift\u2019s shaming that led Apple to change its tune.\nDorian Cundick of CEB, a business advisory firm, said that Apple\u2019s response to the situation was remarkable for the language of Mr. Cue\u2019s public statements, which matched Ms. Swift\u2019s informal but sincere tone. \u201cWe hear you @taylorswift13 and indie artists,\u201dhe wroteon Twitter. \u201cLove, Apple.\u201d\n\u201cThey were speaking a language that people hear as being extremely human in nature, not this big lumbering corporation,\u201d Ms. Cundick said.\nIn her post on Sunday, Ms. Swift said she was withholding her latest album, \u201c1989,\u201d from Apple\u2019s streaming service. Neither Apple nor a spokesman for Ms. Swift responded to requests for comment on Monday.\nThe company\u2019s new music app, Apple Music \u2014 which includes a subscription streaming service, a free Internet radio station and a media platform on which artists can upload songs and videos \u2014 has been highly anticipated. But its announcement this month was also met with some grumbles from commentators that its many parts failed to add up to a cohesive whole. Then came the resistance from Ms. Swift.\nIt was not the first time that Ms. Swift has spoken out about the economics behind streaming music. Last year she withdrew her songs from Spotify, a move that ignited a still-burning debate over how much music should be given away free online.\n\u201cI\u2019m not willing to contribute my life\u2019s work to an experiment that I don\u2019t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music,\u201d she said in aninterview at the time with Yahoo.\nThe dispute with Apple follows another messy public debut for digital music: This year Jay Z took over the streaming service Tidal with a plan to make a majority of the company owned by artists, but it stumbled after an awkward public announcement and has been on aP.R. defensive ever since. By quickly addressing Ms. Swift\u2019s complaints, Apple may have found a way to save face and appear flexible.\n\u201cDiscussing this at all is very good,\u201d said Jim Griffin, a digital media entrepreneur and former major-label executive, \u201creflecting a growing transparency, a view behind the velvet rope.\u201d\nWhile Ms. Swift\u2019s comments follow in a long line of activism, few artists have enjoyed her success in challenging the industry\u2019s establishment powers. In the 1990s, Pearl Jam battled Ticketmaster, saying that the company had a monopoly on ticket sales, but eventually dropped its opposition. Frank Sinatra lobbied for years to change the licensing laws over royalties for radio play.\nThe record industry is still fighting for that radio royalty. But in 2012 Ms. Swift\u2019s label, Big Machine,struck a dealwith the country\u2019s largest broadcaster, Clear Channel, that would pay those royalties for the first time; other independents and even a major, the Warner Music Group, followed Big Machine\u2019s lead. (Clear Channel is now known as iHeartMedia.)\nExecutives at several independent labels, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their talks with Apple were private, said on Monday that it was still not clear how they would be paid under the free trials. Apple is said to be preparing a per-stream royalty during the free trials that would apply to everyone, these executives said. When Apple\u2019s $10-a-month subscription plans kick in, the company has said it will pay at least 71.5 percent of the revenue in royalties.\nPart of the reason Ms. Swift has been able to challenge the status quo is that she holds an unusual amount of control over her music: Big Machine is independent, and her family owns part of the company. It is a different situation for most artists signed to bigger labels, which often control distribution rights to their recordings, music executives said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate for Taylor that she has the kind of deal where she has that control,\u201d said Irving Azoff, a longtime artist manager. \u201cI have a slew of artists that would love to have done it, but their label deals wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d\nSome of Ms. Swift\u2019s supporters believe her success may partly be a result of the force of her personality \u2014 as well as her command of online communication.\n\u201cThere have been other artists that have spoken up, but it never really got to the masses,\u201d said Martin N. Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, Ms. Swift\u2019s publisher. \u201cThey were stifled or not heard.\n\u201cBut Taylor has been heard,\u201d he added, \u201cjust by an Instagram or a tweet or a blog.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple is set to kick off its annual conference for software developers on Monday. The company is expected to show new and improved versions of OS X, its Mac operating system, and iOS, the mobile software system powering iPhones and iPads. The company will also introduce a new streaming music service that it developed with Beats Electronics, the company it acquired last year for $3 billion. Absent from the unveilings will be a long-anticipated upgrade for the Apple TV set-top box, which was pulled from the conference because of issues related to content and technology.\u2014Brian X. Chen\nEconomists will be looking for signs that China\u2019s growth slowdown is bottoming out when the country releases its May economic data this week, but expectations are not high. Trade figures, to be released on Monday, are expected to show that imports remain under pressure because of weak domestic demand. Inflation data on Tuesday is likely to highlight feeble increases in prices of consumer goods. On Thursday, the government is expected to report that industrial production remains near a 10-year low, partly because of the slumping housing market. Data on land purchases by developers and new construction starts is forecast to continue to show a sharp contraction.\u2014Neil Gough\nThe McDonald\u2019s Corporation will report its sales for May on Monday, the next-to-last time it will give Wall Street a monthly look at the performance of its roughly 37,000 stores. Interest in the company has been intense over the last six months, as sales have slid despite a smorgasbord of initiatives and food tests. Menu tweaks like adding kale to salads in some stores and toasting buns longer for some burgers are being closely watched but have not yet had a chance to have an effect on sales. Sara Senatore, a Sanford Bernstein investment analyst, said the firm does not usually preview sales, but based on trends over a two-year adjusted calendar, sales in McDonald\u2019s stores in the United States in May might be down 1.5 percent, compared with a 2.3 percent decline in April.\u2014Stephanie Strom\nIn the wake of a record year for auto safety recalls, General Motors will hold its annual meeting on Tuesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Detroit. G.M. executives hope the company has largely weathered the storm created by its defective ignition switches and decade-long cover-up of the problem and its scope. Investors will hear about new efforts like the company\u2019s framework, announced in March, for investing in capital projects, which among other things will aim for a return of 20 percent or greater on invested capital, and a cash balance of $20 billion. Investors will also get a chance to vote on a shareholder proposal to split G.M.\u2019s chief executive and chairman functions. The proposal, by James McRitchie, a small shareholder from Elk Grove, Calif., is opposed by the company\u2019s board of directors.\u2014Aaron M. Kessler\nNetflix will hold its annual stockholders\u2019 meeting on Tuesday in Los Gatos, Calif., during which investors will vote on a proposal to increase the number of shares in what is seen as a precursor to a stock split. Netflix shares now trade above $633, almost double where they were at the start of the year. More proposals include the election of three directors, the appointment of an auditing firm and other stockholder proposals. Analysts are also hoping that executives will provide more details about the company\u2019s international rollout, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2016. The company is also expected to face questions on its position on a series of recently announced mergers, including Charter Communication\u2019s pair of $67.1 billion deals for Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.\u2014Emily Steel\nHSBC will hold a strategic update for investors on Tuesday and may give more insight into its review of whether to keep its headquarters in Britain. The lender, which traces its roots to Hong Kong, announced a formal review earlier this year of its domicile as it faces a shifting regulatory environment and a tax that hit British banks particularly hard.\u2014Chad Bray\nAdvisers to the Food and Drug Administration this week will discuss whether the agency should approve the first two drugs in a new class of powerful cholesterol-lowering agents. Praluent, also known as alirocumab, from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, will be discussed on Tuesday. Amgen\u2019s Repatha, or evolocumab, will be considered on Wednesday. A big question is whether lowering of LDL-C, the so-called bad cholesterol, is enough for approval or whether the companies need to demonstrate that the drugs actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, something that will not be known for another two years or more.\u2014Andrew Pollack\nThe European Parliament is expected to vote on Wednesday on the plans for a landmark trade deal between the United States and the European Union. The vote focuses on a report prepared by the lawmakers that is meant to guide officials leading the negotiations on Europe\u2019s behalf. But the lawmakers have been squabbling for months over whether to allow multinational companies to sue governments that fail to adhere to a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Last month, the Parliament\u2019s trade committee voted in favor of allowing a reformed version of that system, known as investor-to-state dispute settlement. The system is common in other trade agreements, and American and European negotiators have insisted it should part of the trans-Atlantic deal. But some political groups have vowed to vote against the final report unless it contains language explicitly rejecting the system. The 751-member Parliament has only an advisory role in the negotiations. But it has the power to veto any eventual deal, and that gives the lawmakers\u2019 vote significant political weight, even at this stage.\u2014James Kanter\nAlthough Facebook stockholders will be able to question management at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday, the votes they cast will be essentially meaningless. That is because the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, controls 54 percent of the votes through a special class of stock and has made it clear that he will run the company as he sees fit. So a proposal on the ballot to strip Mr. Zuckerberg of his super-voting power is more symbolic than real. At the moment, shareholders have little to complain about, with Facebook\u2019s revenue and profits soaring, and the stock up about 31 percent over the last year, although some have expressed concerns about Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s costly acquisitions. In another event on Thursday, Oculus, a virtual reality company owned by Facebook, will lay out its product plans, including its first headset that plugs into a personal computer, due out in early 2016.\u2014Vindu Goel\nOn Friday morning, the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary survey of consumer sentiment for June is due out, with Wall Street economists expecting a slight improvement from the May level. Consumers have been cautious about spending the windfall from lower energy prices this year, and economists are looking for signs of whether that is changing.\u2014Nelson D. Schwartz"

        "title": "Apple to Unveil Tool Kit for Watch App Developers",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 WhenApplebegan selling the Apple Watch in April, Phillip Ryu did not rush to create an app for it. Because apps on the device have limited animation and the software takes several seconds to load, Mr. Ryu, a founder of Impending, which makes mobile games, said he was constrained in terms of what programs he could create for the watch.\nNow, he is rethinking that decision. On Monday, Apple will begin its annual developer conference, where the company is set to release new tools for software developers to create smarter apps that will gain deep access to the watch\u2019s heart-rate and motion sensors, among other components.\n\u201cIt feels like we have both our hands tied behind our backs, and that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen anything really impressive,\u201d Mr. Ryu said about apps for the watch, which was released with around 3,500 programs. Now, \u201cit sounds like they plan on untying our hands.\u201d\nGaining more apps for Apple Watch is crucial toTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. The device is his first new product since taking the reins of the company in 2011. Apps from outside developers helped increase sales of Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads by vastly expanding their capabilities. Likewise, third-party apps could become important selling points for the watch, which now is primarily an expensive timepiece that requires aniPhoneto operate.\nApart from more powerful watch apps, Apple\u2019s developer conference is also set to showcase software advancements for OS X, the Mac operating system, and iOS, the mobile operating system powering iPhones and iPads. In addition, Apple plans to unveil anew streaming musicit developed with Beats, the music company it acquired for $3 billion last year, according to people briefed on the situation, who declined to be identified because the details were confidential.\nYet one much ballyhooed device will be absent from the conference: a new Apple TV, Apple\u2019s set-top box for televisions. The company planned as recently as mid-May to use the event to spotlight new Apple TV hardware, along with animproved remote controland a tool kit for developers to make apps for the entertainment device. But those plans were postponed partly because the product was not ready, according to two people briefed on the product.\nApple declined to comment.\nApple, which introduced the watch in April after months of promotion, is selling the device in nine countries and expects to expand that distribution this month. The company is keeping mum about sales, however. On its earnings call in April, Apple would only say that consumer demand for the new product had exceeded supply.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier about how things are going,\u201d Mr. Cook said about the number of apps now available for the watch, adding that customer response so far seemed to be \u201c100 percent positive.\u201d\nJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for operations, said last monthat the Code technology conferencethat developers would soon be able to write apps directly for the watch. Now, developers have to modify an iPhone app to include \u201cextensions\u201d that run on the watch. In other words, the brains of the watch apps live on the iPhone, and the smartphone beams data to the watch. As a result, some consumers have said, watch apps have loaded sluggishly and what they can do has been limited. The expanded tool kit will be introduced to developers next week, and improved watch apps should arrive by fall, Mr. Williams said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to make watch apps much more interesting, just because you get access to so much more stuff,\u201d said Brian Mueller, the developer of Carrot, a suite of productivity apps. \u201cRight now, watch apps are sort of another feature to an iPhone app.\u201d\nFor iOS and OS X, Apple is expected to do some fine-tuning after widespread criticism that its latest systems, iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, were released with many bugs, according to people briefed on the software system. Last September, Apple released an iOS update that broke the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint sensor and caused some users to lose cell service, among other issues. The company will make under-the-hood improvements to iOS and OS X \u2014 for example, mobile apps will be able to run more efficiently, which could help improve battery life, these people said.\nSales of Mac computers, while generating a small portion of Apple\u2019s revenue, remain a bright spot for the company, even as the rest of the PC industry shrinks. Last quarter, Apple strengthened its overall Mac sales, thanks in large part to its momentum in China, where Mac sales grew 31 percent from the same period a year ago.\nThose eager for a new Apple TV, however, will have to wait. The company decided to hold off an announcement because the product was not ready to be demonstrated, according to people briefed on the device.\nA major setback for the Apple TV involves content. Apple plans to offer its Apple TV, iPhone andiPadcustomers abundle of channelsthat is smaller and cheaper than the large catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription, according to people briefed on the service, who discussed the incomplete plans on the condition of anonymity. Media executives have been coy about the existence of the coming Apple TV service \u2014 the chief executive of CBS said last week that his network would \u201cprobably\u201d sign a deal with Apple. Separately, Showtimeannouncedon Wednesday a new Internet streaming service that would debut on Apple devices in July for a monthly fee of $11.\nBut in the background, content providers have alsowhispered thatthey are far from reaching dealswith Apple to offer an Internet-based TV service, largely because they have not come to an agreement on price, rights and technology issues, according to people briefed on the discussions.\nDespite the delay, many developers remain intrigued by the idea of making apps for the Apple TV. This year, Apple published a graphic that resembled its hockey-puck-shaped Apple TV on awebpagepromoting the developer conference, hinting that TV apps would be coming soon.\n\u201cThe context of everyone sitting down in front of a large-format display will be totally different,\u201d said Luke Muscat, a director of the app studio Prettygreat and creator of the games Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d"

        "title": "Zane Lowe, the D.J. Scratching Out Beats 1 for Apple",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cCheck-check. Onetwo-two-two-two-two. Hello hello hello.\u201d\nZane Lowe, Britain\u2019s most influential radio D.J., stood in a rented studio in Hollywood one recent morning, cursing about the hiss in his headphones.\n\u201cOnetwo, onetwo, onetwo,\u201d he barked into the mic. \u201cI can\u2019t even hear myself.\u201d\nFor the last 12 years, Mr. Lowe has been a top tastemaker on the BBC\u2019s Radio 1 by championing brand-new music, landing interviews with stars like Kanye West and running his show with a frenetic production style inspired by hip-hop itself. Now he is preparing for a much broader role as the guiding voice of Beats 1, a free Internet radio station from Apple that on Tuesday will begin broadcasting to smartphones and laptops around the world \u2014 an experiment, of sorts, to reinvent live radio.\nThe new gig also puts Mr. Lowe, 41, in the middle of the music industry\u2019s latest battleground: streaming. Beats 1 is part of a revamped music strategy for Apple, which revolutionized the music world with iTunes and the iPod but lately has sat on the sidelines as upstarts like Spotify, Pandora and SoundCloud lure listeners by making it easy to play songs online.\nLast year, Apple paid $3 billion for one of those upstarts, Beats, and this month the company unveiled a multifaceted new service, Apple Music, which in addition to Beats 1 includes a subscription streaming service and a media platform for artists called Connect. It has signed a gaggle of celebrities to do shows on Beats 1, among them Pharrell Williams, Drake, even Elton John. Yet the mixed reaction to Apple\u2019s plans \u2014 including a complaint by Taylor Swift over royalties that led to aremarkable turnaroundby Apple \u2014 shows how volatile the streaming music market is.\nStanding at his microphone, Mr. Lowe was looking pretty volatile himself. Though he had his first big-get interview, with Eminem, later in the day, nothing in the studio seemed to be going his way: The sound was distorted, the layout of his new console was unfamiliar, even the air conditioning wasn\u2019t working.\nTo calm down, he began spinning records like an old-school party D.J., flinging his hands over electronic mixers as the walls shook with booming beats. After several minutes of this exorcism-by-noise, he let the sound die down and exhaled.\n\u201cFeels like it might work,\u201d he said.\nCompared with the mild-mannered corporate executives who usually represent Apple in public, Mr. Lowe is a new kind of animal for the company. A motormouth both on and off the air, he is an irrepressible advocate for the music he chooses to promote. And like that of the legendary BBC announcerJohn Peelbefore him, his endorsement carries major weight: Among the artists Mr. Lowe got behind early are Adele, Ed Sheeran and the Arctic Monkeys.\n\u201cZane is a genuine enthusiast; this is not a fake thing,\u201d said Mr. John, whose Beats 1 show, \u201cElton John\u2019s Rocket Hour,\u201d will be an eclectic mix of old songs and new. \u201cHe\u2019s a fan, and he\u2019s a fan who\u2019s got the opportunity to make his position in the world work for other people. He genuinely loves music, and that\u2019s my kind of guy.\u201d\nWith a devilish stubble and a wardrobe of T-shirts that fit snugly over his muscular shoulders, Mr. Lowe \u2014 a New Zealander by birth \u2014 has carved out a certain celebrity status in Britain. But he is largely unknown in the United States, and he views Beats 1 as his opportunity to expand his profile globally.\n\u201cI\u2019d started in radio at XFM,\u201d he recalled over a dinner near Apple\u2019s Beats offices here, referring to a privately owned alternative station in London, \u201cand then I got offered a chance to go to Radio 1.\n\u201cA friend said, \u2018Why would you leave XFM?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Because at Radio 1, I can play records to the nation.\u2019 It\u2019s the same thing 12 years on: Maybe I can play records to the whole world. It\u2019s hard not to get excited by that prospect when you love being that bridge between music and an audience.\u201d\nBeats 1 is a high-tech twist on one of the oldest forms of electronic media. It is a fully programmed radio station, broadcasting with a complement of live D.J.s and even sponsors. But since it will be baked into every Apple mobile device as part of a new music app, it has the potential for a huge and instantaneous global reach.\nApple wants to exploit that reach \u2014 and help market its new music app \u2014 through radio, a medium that a decade ago may have seemed endangered by the Internet but has stayed surprisingly vital. Some 243 million people in the United States alone still listen to terrestrial radio each week, according to Nielsen, while the Internet-based Pandora draws nearly 80 million listeners each month. Apple Music will have a Pandora-like automated radio feature, in addition to Beats 1.\nThe unveiling of Apple Music this month drew some jeers, with many critics seeing it as an unimaginative collection of features available elsewhere. The New Yorker called it \u201ccluttered and overly complex,\u201d and Bob Lefsetz, an influential music industry commentator, dismissed its chances in the marketplace with typical hyperbole: \u201cIt\u2019s toast.\u201d\nLater, after Ms. Swift publicly scolded Apple for not paying streaming royalties during free trials, the company abruptly reversed its position \u2014 a dispute that underscored just how important Apple remains to the music industry\u2019s finances.\n\u201cApple is the single biggest retailer that the labels have on a global basis,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with the firm Midia Research. \u201cWhatever Apple does is crucially important, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a lot of concern about them getting it right.\u201d\nYet the piece of Apple Music that drawn the most curiosity has been Beats 1.\nAs Mr. Lowe sees it, radio\u2019s nature as an audio feed in constant flux fits the always-on mentality of the social-media era. He wants Beats 1 to be a reflection of the rapidly changing world of pop, in which songs that have just been released can be rushed on the air with the same speed at which a hot new track shoots through Twitter.\n\u201cEveryone keeps going to their devices because of fear of missing out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly going on Instagram, Twitter, wondering what\u2019s going on in my friends\u2019 lives. What am I missing? I want that for radio. What\u2019s on right now,right now,that I didn\u2019t know I wanted to listen to?\u201d\nTo keep Beats 1 sounding fresh around the world, the station will alternate one- and two-hour programming blocks by established broadcasters with those by musicians and celebrities, who will host and plan the shows themselves. Among the names on board: the teen actor Jaden Smith, the alternative singer St. Vincent, Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and the British electronic duo Disclosure.\nDr. Dre, who founded the original Beats headphone company with the music executive Jimmy Iovine, will have his own show, \u201cThe Pharmacy.\u201d Mr. Lowe, broadcasting from Los Angeles, will share weekday anchor duties with two other professional D.J.s: Ebro Darden (of the hip-hop station Hot 97) in New York and Julie Adenuga in London.\n\u201cPart of the last three months has been desperately trying to come up with a new word that\u2019s not radio,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nThe intended result is a supercharged radio station. Like the Beats Music platform that was released last year before the company was bought by Apple, its selling point is also the power of human \u201ccuration\u201d in contrast to the automated playlists on Pandora \u2014 though whether consumers care about the difference remains an open question.\nThe idea for Beats 1 came from Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who was the chief creative officer at Beats Music and has continued as one of Apple Music\u2019s key designers. With the limitless choices offered by digital music, and listeners\u2019 ability to create their own individual playlists, Mr. Reznor said, \u201cyou can feel way down in a crevice \u2014 everything gets so nichey.\u201d\nHearing Mr. Lowe\u2019s BBC show while on tour, Mr. Reznor considered the live, communal experience of an audience tuned in to the same songs. \u201cI wondered if in today\u2019s world there is still a place for monoculture,\u201d he said. \u201cCan that still exist?\u201d\nAs a throwback to free-spirited old FM radio, Beats 1\u2019s closest rival may be Sirius XM, the satellite radio service that has more than 100 stations and is widely acclaimed for high-quality programming. Sirius XM also has nearly 28 million subscribers \u2014 but Beats 1\u2019s built-in position in Apple\u2019s phones will give it a chance to be nearly ubiquitous.\n\u201cRight now music is locked behind a wall, even though everyone thinks it\u2019s all free,\u201d Mr. Iovine said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of great music that can\u2019t break free \u2014 there\u2019s no one helping, no ecosystem. But we decided to put it all together.\u201d\nMr. Lowe\u2019s high profile within Apple is a sign of how much the company is adapting to a music-industry culture after its acquisition of Beats. Apple plans to build extensive new studios for the Beats 1 team. Yet Apple\u2019s strict corporate culture still rules: Mr. Lowe said that because of the secrecy of his employment deal, his two young children did not find out they were moving to America until a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign went up in front of their house in England.\nPoring over Beats 1\u2019s first-week schedule, Mr. Lowe was having mood swings. \u201cThe whole thing could be a total, abject disaster,\u201d he said. O.K., but what might success look like? \u201cWhen an artist goes on to have a brilliant career,\u201d he answered, \u201cand five years later we can look back and be proud of whatever role we had in that.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Lowe was approached by Apple, he said, he was already antsy for a career challenge. After a dozen years, he had become a BBC fixture, but in his early days his style \u2014 talking over records, mixing and manipulating them whenever he liked \u2014 was unorthodox on the august network.\n\u201cOne of the great advantages Zane had over a lot British D.J.s when he started was not being British,\u201d said Paul Stokes, an associate editor at the British music magazines Q and Mojo. \u201cHe never had that false modesty that other D.J.s had.\u201d\nMr. Lowe started out as a rapper in New Zealand and in recent years had been trying to get back to his roots as a songwriter and producer. He co-wrote and helped produce the song \u201cRestart\u201d for Sam Smith\u2019s breakthrough album \u201cIn the Lonely Hour,\u201d earning a Grammy nomination.\nMr. Smith said that Mr. Lowe was a natural in the studio \u2014 \u201che smashed the chorus melody\u201d \u2014 and they bonded over the theme of \u201cdance music that makes you cry at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cZane Lowe is a legend to me,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI see him as so much wiser and more knowledgeable, but he was so willing to listen and learn from me.\u201d\nBut Mr. Lowe\u2019s natural habitat is behind the radio mic, as he showed in Hollywood. After he complained that morning, Mr. Lowe\u2019s technicians spent the day fixing the studio\u2019s sound in preparation for that night\u2019s interview with Eminem, scheduled to run in Beats 1\u2019s first week on the air.\nAfter Eminem and his entourage left that night, Mr. Lowe recalled the interview\u2019s high points: Eminem\u2019s work on the music for the new film \u201cSouthpaw,\u201d even his time as a boxer. The studio air was thick with the smell of sweat.\nAnd how did it sound in the headphones?\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cIt sounded great.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Music and Labels Investigated in 2 States",
        "fulltext": "WhileApplewas preparing a splashy introduction for a new service that would stream music over the Internet for a fee, the attorneys general of New York and Connecticut were quietly investigating the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s negotiations with music companies in search of potential antitrust violations.\nThe attorneys general wanted to know whether Apple pressured the music labels \u2014 or whether the labels conspired with Apple and one another \u2014 to withdraw support for popular \u201cfreemium\u201d services offered by companies like Spotify in favor of Apple\u2019s paid music subscriptions.\nA freemium service typically starts free and is supported financially by advertising. Companies with freemium business models hope a free service is compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay for a more sophisticated offering \u2014 one typically free of ads.\nUniversal Music Group on Tuesday confirmed it was cooperating with the industrywide investigation, a continuing effort led by the attorney general of New York, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the attorney general of Connecticut, George Jepsen.\nThe first written response to the antitrust inquiry came from Universal Music Group a day earlier when the company\u2019s legal firm, Hunton & Williams, sent a letter to the attorneys general. The letter said Universal Music Group had no agreements with Apple or music entities like Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group that would impede the availability of free or ad-supported services.\nThe music company added that it \u201cshares the attorneys general\u2019s commitment to a robust and competitive market for music streaming services in the mutual best interest of consumers, artists, services and content companies alike \u2014 and we have a long track record to that effect.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the attorney general was looking into Apple\u2019s negotiations with music labels to preserve the benefits consumers have enjoyed from these new streaming services.\nA response to the antitrust probe came from the Universal Music Group, whose lawyers sent a letter to the attorneys general stating, in so many words, nothing to see here.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to ensure that the market continues to develop free from collusion and other anticompetitive practices,\u201d said the spokesman, Matt Mittenthal.\nMr. Jepsen, the attorney general of Connecticut, said in a statement that his office was satisfied with Universal\u2019s response, before adding, \u201cWe will continue to monitor that market to ensure that consumers and competition are protected.\u201d\nThe European Commission is also looking into Apple\u2019s negotiations with the music labels.\nApple declined to comment. This is the second time both Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. Jepsen have pursued Apple on antitrust grounds.\nIn 2013, a federal judge said Apple violated antitrust law bycolluding with book publishersto raise e-book prices above Amazon\u2019s standard $9.99 pricing for digital books, after the publishers settled.\nThe attorneys general, who were both involved in the e-books price-fixing investigation, appear to be pre-emptively looking into the terms of Apple\u2019s new music service for any signs of industry collusion beforeApple Musicis available to consumers at the end of this month.\nUnlike Spotify and other streaming music services, Apple does not offer a free version of Apple Music. But the company offers a three-month free trial period and says it will let artists and record companies make various kinds of content, including songs and videos, available for free on Connect, a promotional section of its service.\nThe so-called freemium model used by services like Spotify has been at issue over the last year.\nLast fall, the singer Taylor Swift removed her music from Spotify in a dispute over its free version, In recent months top executives at the major record labels have been sharply critical of free services, arguing that they do not generate enough money and they give consumers no incentive to pay for music.\nYet Spotify, which started in 2008, has been by far the fastest-growing subscription music service, with 60 million users, 15 million of whom pay. Last year, the company had $1.3 billion in revenue, and 91 percent of that money came from subscriptions. However, Spotify, which is privately held, alsoreported a net lossof $197 million.\nBut some artists and executives at independent labels have defended the freemium model.\nLast month, Stephen Cooper, the chief executive of the Warner Music Group, the smallest of the three majors,warnedthat \u201cbefore people conclude that freemium should be burnt at the stake, we should think very carefully about the consequences.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Google seem to be the big mainstream sources for e-books now, but are there any independent bookstores online, with files that work on smartphones and tablets?\nA.While you can find independent authors selling their works on sites likeSmashwords, most locally owned or regional booksellers do not have their own online catalog of commercial e-books to buy and download. Sites likeInkteraandZola Bookssell e-books, though, and some independent brick-and-mortar booksellers have partnerships with the bigger e-bookstores.\nFor example, Kobo, which sells its ownKobo Reader lineof e-readers, has deals with a large number of independent bookstores around the country. When you buy a Kobo Reader from that physical store and create an online Kobo account there, that bookstore will get a share of money from each e-book you buy online from theKobo Store.\nIf you already have a smartphone or tablet and do not want an e-reader Kobo has its own stand-alone app for its online bookstore, which has millions of titles. The app works on majormobileanddesktopplatforms. When you create your user account on Kobo\u2019s website, you canlink it to a particular independent bookstoreto support it.\nKobo\u2019s site listsparticipating bookstores, and you can also check the website of your preferred shop to see if the owners are working with Kobo.Politics and Prosein the District of Columbia,the Concord Bookshopin Massachusetts,Diesel Booksin California,Powell\u2019s City of Booksin Oregon and theHousing Works Bookstore Cafein New York are among the dozens of independent booksellers in the program; some stores sell Kobo e-books directly on their sites.\nAmazon has a similar deal for independent shops that agree to sell its hardware. TheAmazon Sourceprogram gives retailers discounts on Kindle devices and 10 percent of sales from e-books purchased on those Kindles. Check with your preferred store and ask if it is part of Amazon Source.\nQ.Are computers and tablets affected by humidity, and if so, how humid does it have to be to cause problems?\nA.Excessive heat and humidity can affect a computer or tablet, causing erratic performance, shortened battery life and a buildup of condensation inside the device \u2014 especially when it is moved between temperature extremes. Air-conditioning, fans, desiccants or a dehumidifier in the room can help keep heat and humidity under control.\nYour computer manufacturer should have environmental guidelines for its products listed online or in the manual. Apple, for instance,statesthat its laptops should be operated in locations that are 50 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 10 degrees to 35 degrees Celsius) and with a relative humidity up to 90 percent (noncondensing).\nTIP OF THE WEEK:Quick tricks make learning a new device easier, and Apple now includes an official Tips app as part of itsiOS 8software foriPhone,iPadand theiPod Touch. You can even set up an alert for when Apple adds a new tip \u2014 open the Settings icon, go to Notifications, select Tips and choose the type of Notification you want. (Thetips can also be viewedon Apple\u2019s website.)\nMicrosoft has a similar app for devices running itsWindows Phone 8.1system. The company\u2019sHelp + Tips appcan be downloaded free from theWindows Phone Store. It also has aHelp + Tips app for Windows.\nCompanies selling Android-based phones often have their own suggestions for using the software, likeSamsung\u2019s page of tips for Galaxy owners. For those withNexus devicesandAndroid One phones(as well as thenow-discontinued\u201cGoogle Play edition\u201d handsets) running Android 5.0 and later, Google has its own freeDevice Assistapp for tips and troubleshooting advice."

        "title": "Video Feature: Apple Watch Apps That Are Available Now",
        "fulltext": "AT its recentannual developer conference,Applemade a move to jump-start the production of apps for the Apple Watch by announcing asoftware tool kitthat will enable developers to create more advanced programs for the new device.\nBut while we wait \u2014 this software upgrade isn\u2019t set to arrive until this fall \u2014 theApple Watchhas around 3,500 apps that users can experiment with. Many of the apps showcase the capabilities of the device, such as displaying notifications and augmenting the abilities of a smartphone app. While these appshave not turned the Apple Watch into a must-havedevice for all users, I tested programs that were great at monitoring fitness and the weather, and one that was even useful for booking a hotel room, among others.\nOne of these memorable Watch apps is Carrot Fit, a seven-minute workout app that encourages you to repeatedly jump, crunch and do other exercises by mixing sarcasm, humor, jesting insults and cartoon graphics.\nInstead of having to glance at your smartphone screen to know how long to repeat a particular exercise and which one to do next, you can see this information on your wrist with Carrot\u2019s app. The app uses a clearly visible timer disc and gives an animated view of the movements you are doing. You can start and pause workouts and get feedback on your performance. This$3 fitness appis less boring than its rivals, and more motivating.\nNotifying users of approaching bad weather is another task perfectly fit for the Apple Watch. Dark Sky is an example of this type of app, which features graphics and one useful trick: It can alert you if rain or snow is imminent where you are.\nWeather alerts may also be more noticeable on the Apple Watch than on a smartphone because of the attention-grabbing buzz on your wrist. Dark Sky for the watch shows a basic breakdown of the day\u2019s weather forecast \u2014 which is shown with clear numbers, text and simple graphics \u2014 as well as the forecast for the next five days. The appcosts $4and works only in the United States, Britain and Ireland.\nClear is a popular to-do list app that makes planning fun, thanks to its slick gesture-based interface and appealing graphics. On the Apple Watch version of Clear, whichcosts $5, some of this finesse is lost because of the small screen, but much of the app\u2019s power and ease of use remain intact.\nYou can view all of your to-do lists, easily mark items as \u201cdone\u201d with a tap (great for shopping), sort your list entries and add entries via speech recognition. You can also add alerts, which will then buzz your wrist according to when they are scheduled. These reminders can be seen in the watch\u2019s Glances page for easy viewing.\nUsing Shazam, a free music discovery app, on your phone to recognize a piece of music you are listening to has always felt high-tech. But previously you would have needed to take your phone out, unlock it and open Shazam \u2014 running the risk that the tune you are listening to will end.\nShazam on the Apple Watch will start when you tap the app on the watch face.The app, which is free, processes the sounds around you and identifies music automatically. If the album art is available, you can see it on the watch screen, and track the song name and artist name, as well as the lyrics in some cases.\nHotel Tonight for the watch, much like its phone-based counterpart, provides a list of nearby hotels that have rooms available that night. The watch app will list the same nearby hotels and will show you the hotel\u2019s price, luxury level, distance from your location and a small photo. Tapping on an entry reveals more information, including a location on a map. Withthe app, which is free, you can book a room right from your wrist.\nTry Trivia Crack and Camera Plus on Apple Watch. Trivia Crack, whichcosts $3, lets you play a general-knowledge quiz game on your wrist. While its interface is fiddly, it provides essentially the same fun experience as the full phone app.\nCamera Plus is a neat app that allows you to see your phone\u2019s camera view on your watch screen, and then snap a photo or take a video via the front or back cameras of your phone. It is great for taking selfies, but you need to run Camera Plus on your phone at the same time. The appcosts $2.\nQuick Call\nThe PBS app has long been popularon iOS.Now Androidusers can use it to catch up on full episodes of their favorite PBS shows via their phones. There is a program guide and support for sharing video with a TV that is equipped with a Chromecast device. The app is free. PBS has also updated its iOS app to include some of the same new features."
