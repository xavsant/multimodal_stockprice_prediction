        "title": "Domestic Abusers Can Control Your Devices. Here\u2019s How to Fight Back.",
        "fulltext": "Every day, Sarah Prager saw the magnet on her fridge warning her of the dangers of domestic abuse, but she didn\u2019t think much of it. Her girlfriend\u2019s tactics were much more subtle, involving checking her phone and electronic devices, she said. In response, Ms. Prager, a writer from Massachusetts, deleted text messages as soon as she sent them, and never complained when her partner went through her devices.\n\u201cShe had such control and jealousy in general that it would\u2019ve been really suspicious of me to ask her to not do that,\u201d Ms. Prager said. Her partner would flip the script on her if she refused to show what was on her devices. \u201cWhat are you hiding that I can\u2019t look at your phone?\u201dwas the go-to response.\nTracking messages is just one way technology can be used by an ill-intentioned romantic partner to monitor, intimidate, and control you \u2014 and they don\u2019t have to be a tech wizard to manipulate it. If an abuser gets access to your phone, they can unassumingly squirm into every aspect of your digital life, from private messages to location history. Technology-based abuse, also called \u201ctechnology-enabled coercive control\u201d by anti-domestic-abuse professionals, can be as nuanced as an abuser spoofing their number to bypass a list of blocked contacts and using social media posts to keep tabs on your interactions, or as sophisticated as tracking a car\u2019s location throughout the day via GPS and installing apps tomake smart-home devices run amok. The tactics executed by abusers vary widely, and they rely on tech because it\u2019s cheap and easy to implement.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to reach out and touch someone in order to control and terrorize them,\u201d said Ruth Darlene, founder and executive director ofWomenSV, a resource center serving the Bay Area of California. WomenSV specializes in helping people who face domestic abuse in middle-to-upper income areas, but Ms. Darlene and other experts note that tech-based abuse isn\u2019t limited to just one income bracket.\nData on the prevalence of technology-based abuse is limited, thanks to varying definitions, but the experts we spoke with said that such incidences go hand-in-hand with domestic abuse. It\u2019s estimated that one in three people have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner, according toThe National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey: 2010-2012 State Report(PDF) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report\u2019s authors define stalking as \u201ca pattern of harassing or threatening tactics used by a perpetrator that is both unwanted and causes fear or safety concerns in the victim,\u201d with methods including unwanted calls, emails, social media messages, and texts, as well as spying via listening devices and GPS.\nOther studies have shown that this type of abuse is much more pervasive. An article published inthe Journal of Family Violencein January 2020 found that between 62 and 72 percent of women (the only gender surveyed) have been stalked, and 60 to 63 percent have experienced technology-based abuse by an intimate partner.\n\u201cTechnology is not the only tactic; it is one of many,\u201d said Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at theNational Network to End Domestic Violence(N.N.E.D.V.). \u201cToday\u2019s technology offers new ways to perpetrate abuse, but the behaviors and the reasons for it are not new. Abusers want power and control over the other person, and this is just one more way to get that.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how to record abuse without being discovered, safeguard your devices, and, ultimately, protect yourself.\nEvery social services expert we spoke with said domestic violence survivors often convince themselves to ignore signs of abuse, technological and otherwise. So trust your gut if you suspect the worst in your partner. Signs of technology-based abuse may seem insignificant \u2014 like if an abuser brings up conversations you had in private with another person, or if you just feel like you\u2019re being watched \u2014 but they can quickly snowball. \u201cWhen those coincidences start to happen over and over again, that\u2019s a sign that something\u2019s not right,\u201d Ms. Darlene added.\nMs. Prager knew her girlfriend was invading her privacy when she found sent and deleted emails she didn\u2019t recognize in her email history, but she brushed it aside. \u201cA phone is such a basic thing that we need for our lives. She used it to monitor and check on my texts and emails, and it\u2019s what she used to contact me even when we weren\u2019t together,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was abuse at all because she wasn\u2019t physically abusive until the day that I left.\u201d Ms. Prager said her ex-girlfriend continued to stalk her, both digitally and in person, for about a year.\nIf you suspect that a verbally or physically abusive partner is using tech to spy on you, you need to safely elude tracing. First, seek help. Visit a public library, or a doctor\u2019s office for a routine appointment, and ask to use their phone to call a local domestic violence shelter, theNational Domestic Violence Hotline(800-799-SAFE), or theNational Sexual Assault Hotline(800-656-HOPE). You could alsolive chat with the N.D.V.H. or text LOVEIS to 22522.\nIf you can\u2019t leave the house, in most states you can dial 211 (or 311 in New York City) and ask to be transferred to a nearby shelter; you can also save hotline numbers in your phone\u2019s contact list under a different name to fool your abusive partner. Support centers can help you make a plan to leave your partner, as well as connect you with local resources. (Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, some municipalities consider shelters essential services, which means they are still open. You can also connect with a teletherapy provider from our guide toonline therapy services.)\nIdentifying how an abusive partner is using technology to monitor you can be difficult. Our experts recommendkeeping a handwritten log(PDF) of every time you think you\u2019re being cyberstalked, and then sharing your findings with your counselor. Avoid taking notes or recording passwords on your phone\u2019s notepad app. \u201cIf login credentials are syncing to the cloud, your partner could be reading them without your knowledge or consent, and then using them to surreptitiously access your other accounts,\u201d warned Diana Freed, a Ph.D. candidate in theDepartment of Information Scienceat Cornell Tech, who co-authored a paper oncomputer security and intimate partner violence(PDF).\nWhen you\u2019re ready to meet with an attorney, a counselor, or a private investigator, our experts advise parking blocks away from your meeting point, and leaving your electronics in the car or back at home. Ditching devices is important: Some device-security tips found on the web, especially on comment forums, are phony or ill-informed and could compromise your safety. For example, a site may recommend enabling airplane mode to prevent spying. But a phone with stalkerware \u2014 any software that enables spying, also called spouseware or spyware \u2014 installed can still collect data via the microphone or camera, even when in airplane mode, said Sam Havron, a Ph.D. candidate in theDepartment of Computer Scienceat Cornell Tech, who co-authored the aforementioned paper with Ms. Freed. If you have the means, buy a prepaid burner phone (a phone with minimal voice or data services, which are designed to be used sparingly and should not be attached to any shared credit cards) with cash, so you can contact your support network without being tracked.\nVisiting an advocacy center that specializes in auditing a survivor\u2019s devices can help pinpoint how an abusive partner is monitoring you so you can collect evidence for an order of protection. (Resources like the N.N.E.D.V.\u2019sSafety Net ProjectandWomensLaw.orghave tool kits on collecting tech-specific evidence for court.) Counselors at these centers can also walk you through how to create secure passwords, turn off location sharing, and disable each device\u2019s camera and microphone. They\u2019ll discuss your options with you, and won\u2019t pressure you to leave your partner, lock them out of your devices, or file a police report. If you\u2019re panicky about taking steps to leave your abusive partner, it\u2019s not the right time.\n\u201cThe survivor is the expert in their own situation,\u201d said Danielle Desrosiers, community advocacy program director atNew Beginnings, a Seattle-based resource for domestic violence survivors with a dedicated technology-enabled coercive control clinic. \u201cWhat can make one survivor safer, could create increased danger for another survivor.\u201d\nIf you\u2019ve weighed your options with a counselor and safely left your abusive partner, our experts agree that the first line of defense against future tech misuse and abuse is to increase the security of the technology you already use. No security setup is perfect, but these steps can make abuse much more difficult.\nIf you share accounts with an abusive partner, they can use them to track much of your day. \u201cMost commonly, abusers attempt to obtain or retain access to formerly shared accounts like iCloud and Google (and their associated email accounts) or social media like Facebook and Instagram,\u201d said Ben Walker, a technologist volunteer atNew Beginnings. This may include location apps \u2014 likeGoogle Mapsand Apple\u2019sFind My\u2014 that are otherwise legitimate, or third-party location-monitoring apps, usually billed as child or family-monitoring apps.\nIn the case of iCloud or Google accounts, shared access can grant much more information, including browser history, notes, files, photos, and more. If you\u2019ve ever shared accounts like this, or if an abuser potentially has a password because they purchased or set up the app or phone, make a note of it. Below, we\u2019ll walk you through setting up a new email account and resetting your passwords.\nSeveral experts we spoke with suggested making a list of the electronic devices you own. This includes phones, laptops, or tablets, as well as otherconnected deviceslike cameras, thermostats, smart speakers, and even newer models of cars. Don\u2019t forget about the wireless router (what you connect to for Wi-Fi) in your home. If any of these items were gifts from an abusive partner, or if they set them up, the partner could potentially use the data they collect to gather information about you. If you have children, also make a note of any devices they use.\nTally up the rest of your (non-shared) online accounts, such as email, social media, cloud storage, journaling software, notes, and even to-do list apps. In many cases, an abuser can access data from those services with your username and password. Plus, some of these services, likeGoogle,Apple, andFacebook, allow you to see which devices are currently logged in to the account. If you don\u2019t recognize a device on your list, it may be an abuser\u2019s.\nOnce you\u2019re in a safe place to do so, you should secure your accounts to prevent further access. You can do this by setting up two security measures: a password manager, which creates complex passwords for you so you don\u2019t have to remember them, and two-factor authentication, which requires access to a specific physical device to log in to accounts. But first, it\u2019s a good idea to sign up for a new email address. With access to your email, an abuser can capture password-reset notices, create custom filters to hide messages, or gain access to any details you change. Sign up for a brand-new email account from a service likeGmail orOutlook, both of which have good security standards, including two-factor authentication (we\u2019ll get to that below).\nIf you reuse the same passwords or create ones based on personal details (like your dog\u2019s name or a birthday), an abuser can gain access to your accounts with an educated guess. To counter this, your best option is to not know your own passwords. You can do this with a password manager, which generates strong passwords that are impossible to guess and then locks them behind a single \u201cmaster password\u201d that only you know. When you create a master password, it should besomething your abuser can\u2019t guess.\nThere are many different password managers out there, butWirecutter thinks 1Passwordis the best option for those who are new to password managers (if you can\u2019t afford to pay for a password manager,Wirecutter also recommends Bitwarden). Once you get it set up, go through your list of accounts, change their passwords, and update them with your new email address. If accounts have security questions (for instance, \u201cWhat\u2019s your mother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d), you should change those answers to a random word. (You can save these responses in a password manager, if needed.) For a walk-through on getting started with a password manager, head over tothis guide on the tech website How-To Geek.\nTwo-factor authentication is a security feature typically available for important online accounts, including those for banks, email, and social media. When you enable two-factor authentication, you\u2019ll need two pieces of information to sign in to your accounts: your password and a multi-digit code. The code can come from either a text message or an app. For security purposes, an app is better than a text message, andWirecutter likes the easy-to-use Authy app. However, this type of authentication assumes that only you have access to your phone \u2014 if an abuser can still get into your phone, they may be able to access the authentication codes, so it\u2019s important to secure your devices before you set it up. You should consider using two-factor authentication for any accounts that contain private information, including bank accounts,Google accounts,Facebook profiles, andApple accounts. Check out Wirecutter\u2019s guide tosetting up Authy to get started. If you\u2019re comfortable with technology, Wirecutter recommends aphysical security keyas an even better option, but getting the hang of using it does take some technical skill.\nAccounts on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter can leak location data or other streams of information to an abuser without you realizing it. Take time to run throughFacebook\u2019s Privacy Checkup, and lock down who can see your posts, remove any apps that may automatically share your location, and delete any other apps, games, or tools you don\u2019t recognize, use, or remember adding. Be sure to set up alerts for when someone logs in to your account. You may also consider making your other social media accounts, like those onInstagramandTwitter, private. If you need help navigating the settings, The New York Times (Wirecutter\u2019s parent company) maintains asocial media security and privacy checklist for journaliststhat includes many of the settings you should change.\nGoogle\u2019s not exactly a social network, but itsprivacy controlsare worth spending some time with. By default, Google saves every search you make on Google and YouTube, and Google Maps creates a record of everywhere you\u2019ve gone throughout the week. If an abusive partner has access to these accounts, they may find something in your history. You can pause these settings from youraccount dashboardat any time.\nOur smartphones provide near-instant access to everything about our daily lives. To prevent that type of access in the future, you should set up your phone as securely as possible:\nEnable a passcode.Some abusers may try to unlock a phone using a fingerprint or face login when you\u2019re sleeping, so it\u2019s best to stick with a six-digit passcode instead. If you don\u2019t have a passcode, enable one \u2014 while it adds a mildly annoying step to unlocking your phone, it makes your phone much more secure. Most Android users can openSettingsand then tapSecurityto create a passcode. (Depending on which Android phone you have, you may need to poke around to find this setting.) On iPhone, openSettings, tapTouch ID & Passcode, and make sure the passcode option is enabled. (If you have a newer iPhone, you might seeFace ID & Passwordinstead.) Disable any Touch or Face ID options while you\u2019re there.\nChange notification options.Notifications on your phone may reveal personal information, like the first few lines of a text message or email, to anyone who happens to catch a glance at your device. To protect yourself on an Android phone, openSettings, tapNotifications, and chooseHide Contentfor any apps that might include personal information. On iPhone, openSettings, tapNotifications, and change theShow Previewsoption toNever.\nCheck location settings.Location stalking is a way to see where someone is throughout the day, so it\u2019s a good idea to identify which apps have access to your location and make sure you want them to have that info. On Android, openSettings, tapLocation, tapApp permission, and then review the apps that have access. On iPhone, openSettings, tapPrivacy, and then tapLocation Services.\nSee which apps are installed.An abuser may install something on your phone to spy on you, or use dual-purpose apps, like child-monitoring software, to track your location. To see everything that\u2019s installed on an Android phone, open the Google Play Store, tap the three-line icon, tapMy apps & games, and then tapInstalled. On iPhone, openSettings, tapGeneral, and then tapiPhone Storage. If you see anything you don\u2019t recognize, you may want to delete it, but beware the abuser may get an alert when you do.\nUpdate the operating system.Updating your phone\u2019s operating system improves security and wipes out certain types of stalkerware, so set your phone to update automatically. On Android, openSettings, selectAbout Phone, and make sureCheck Automaticallyis set underSoftware Update. On iPhone, openSettings, tapGeneral, tapSoftware Update, and scroll down toAutomatic Updatesto make sure it\u2019s enabled.\nSmartphone security is also about recalibrating how you use your phone. Train yourself to avoid clicking links sent through email or text, change your passwords when you notice strange activity on your accounts, and be mindful of what information you store (and share) on your phone.\nIf you need to communicate privately with a friend, investigator, or counselor, it\u2019s worth considering switching to a secure messaging app likeSignal. Signal works exactly like Apple Messages or WhatsApp but offers privacy- and security-focused features like encryption, a second lock screen to open the app, disappearing chat history, and the ability to rename message threads to obscure a contact\u2019s name.\nAs the name suggests, stalkerware is any software used to spy on or stalk someone else. It often includes several tools, like GPS tracking and keyloggers (which record keystrokes). In extreme cases, it can also record audio from mics or capture photos from a camera. Stalkerware is expensive, often retailing for $20 to $80 per month, and with smartphones, installing the software requires an abuser to have extended access to the phone.\nJoe Seanor, a security consultant who works with domestic abuse survivors, said stalkerware typically comes into play when a phone or laptop was a gift from an abuser, is an older model, or has gone missing for an extended period of time. Once installed, Mr. Seanor said you\u2019ll notice your data usage skyrocket (you can check this on your monthly bill). \u201cIt\u2019ll double,\u201d he said, adding that you should ask yourself, \u201cDoes my battery wear out faster than before?\u201d\nRecognizing and removing stalkerware takes technical know-how and isn\u2019t recommended for most people. If you want to search your devices for this type of software, theCoalition Against Stalkerwarehas aguideto help you, but Walker fromNew Beginningssaid a factory reset is \u201ca much simpler and safer process than attempting to audit a potentially compromised device to determine how compromised it is.\u201d Also, uninstalling stalkerware alerts the abuser.\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to contact an organization like theN.N.E.D.V.before you take steps to regain control of your devices on your own. And if you don\u2019t have confidence that your partner is respecting your privacy, or if you\u2019re unsure what constitutes abuse, lean into that feeling that something isn\u2019t quite right.\n\u201cTrust your instincts and talk to someone if you believe this may be happening,\u201d N.N.E.D.V.\u2019s Ms. Olsen said. \u201cYou deserve privacy and safety \u2014 offline and online.\u201d\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911.\nIf your calls are being tracked, call your local services hotline, like 211 or 311, and ask to be transferred to a local resource center.\nIf you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been sexually assaulted, call theNational Sexual Assault Hotlineat 800-656-HOPE or theNational Domestic Violence Hotlineat 800-799-SAFE (you can alsochat live with an advocate atN.D.V.H., or text LOVEIS to 22522).\nSee Wirecutter\u2019s guide tothe online therapy services we\u2019d useif you can\u2019t safely leave the house, or if you want to connect with a therapist beyond your immediate geographic area.\nSign up for theWirecutter Weekly Newsletterand get our latest recommendations every Sunday.\nA version of this article appears atWirecutter.com."

        "title": "Investors Bet Giant Companies Will Dominate After Crisis",
        "fulltext": "An economic downturn almost always favors giants like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, the country\u2019s three most valuable companies. But the demand for their shares has only been amplified by a crisis that seemsalmost tailor-made for their future success.\nEven as analysts have trimmed expectations for all three companies\u2019 quarterly earnings, which they\u2019ll report this week, their stocks are climbing. Their combined value rose more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars since the recent market low \u2014 more than the cumulative gain of the bottom half of all stocks in the S&P 500.\nInvestors are betting, in part, that the Covid-19 crisis accelerates the already growing power of America\u2019s corporate colossuses.\n\u201cThe firms that were the top dogs going into the crisis also happen to have the most resilient business models because they can do everything online,\u201dsaid Thomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University. \u201cIt turns out Amazon was one of the most successful businesses in the U.S., and on top of it, they are the ones who can keep processing orders.\u201d\nBesides benefiting from their gargantuan size, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple are all sitting on mountains of cash that will make them largely immune to the funding squeezes other companies are experiencing.\n\u201cInvestors are telling you that the bigger, stronger, more stable balance sheet company is going to win versus its smaller peer,\u201d said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS.\nBut the depth of the current economic decline makes it reasonable to expect that such large companies will emerge in an even more dominant position this time around, said Mr. Philippon, who last year published a book, \u201cThe Great Reversal,\u201d that examines the competitiveness of the American economy.\n\u201cThis one is likely to be much worse because the death rates of small businesses is likely to be even higher,\u201d said Mr. Philippon.\nThe difference in investor expectations for large and small companies is stark: The Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest technology companies \u2014 which also happen to be the largest companies in the country \u2014 is down 0.6 percent this year. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small public companies, is down 22 percent \u2014 roughly double the 11 percent in losses for the S&P 500.\nThat has supercharged the giants\u2019 boom.\nAccording to data from Goldman Sachs, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 this month accounted for roughly 27 percent of the total value of the index. That surpassed the previous peak, which came during the tech stock frenzy of the late 1990s. The top five companies alone \u2014 Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 account for 20 percent of the index.\nBy the end of trading on Tuesday, all but Alphabet were up more than 20 percent since the market hit its recent low on March 23. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, was up 17 percent.\nTheir size gives these companies a lot of heft. All five closed lower on Tuesday, which helped drag the S&P 500 down 0.5 percent, even though 330 of the 500 companies in the index were higher.\nWhile the concentration of market wealth in top companies has hit a peak in recent weeks, it has been a long-term trend in recent years, reflecting, in part, changes in the structure of corporate America. The years since the 2008 financial crisis have been marked by an increase in the consolidation of some industries,such as bankingandairlines.\nAnd as bigger companies have steadily grown, they\u2019ve also snagged a larger share of profits. In 1975, the biggest 100 public companies in the country took in about 49 percent of the earnings of all public companies. Their piece of the pie grew to 84 percent by 2015,according to researchfrom Kathleen M. Kahle, a finance professor at the University of Arizona, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.\nThe current surge of megacap stocks suggests that many investors expect those companies\u2019 slices to expand even more after the current economic implosion, in which smaller companies are widely expected to be the hardest hit. Small-cap companies \u2014 such as those included in the Russell 2000 \u2014 carry more debt, making them vulnerable to having financing cut off by bond markets. They\u2019re less globally diversified, making them heavily dependent on the performance of the economy in the United States, the current epicenter of the crisis.\nAt the same time, the peculiar quirks of the Covid-19 crisis \u2014 almost coincidentally \u2014 play to the business strengths of the big companies that were already the largest players in the American economy.\nAmazon\u2019s combination of online retail and cloud computing services for companies seems optimized for a work-from-home economy. Apple\u2019s devices are a crucial part of mobile computing, and even though iPhone sales are expected to slow this year because of a downturn in shopping at Apple stores, analysts are projecting a robust bounce-back in demand next year. Microsoft\u2019s corporate software packages, Azure cloud computing services and video gaming all could grow stronger in a work-from-home environment.\nThose are all reasons that Microsoft is Jeb Breece\u2019s largest holding in the mutual fund he co-manages at the New York money-management firm Spears Abacus, where he is a principal.\nHe emphasizes that he doesn\u2019t believe that Microsoft, or any of the large tech companies, will be completely immune to the economic downturn. But he is betting that their financial stability will allow them to avoid layoffs and continue investing in product development and research during the downturn, helping them stay ahead of the competition.\n\u201cWhat you saw in \u201908, \u201909 was the companies that were able to continue to invest came out the other side and actually accelerated their growth relative to competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that probably happens again.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Apple\u2019s New Phone Doesn\u2019t Matter",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nJoin us for a live conversation about tech and the coronavirus. Today at 4 p.m. Eastern time, my Times Opinion colleagueCharlie Warzeland I are hosting a conference call to talk about the use of smartphone location data to fight the coronavirus and other aspects of using technology in this pandemic. Lend us your ears, and ask your burning questions. You canRSVP here.\nThis sure feels like a strange time forAppleto release a newiPhone. But here\u2019s a hard truth: Our habits show that new phones are irrelevant to most of us \u2014 in a pandemic or otherwise.\nBrian X. Chen, a New York Times personal technology writer, wrote about Apple\u2019s plan to release a new version of theiPhone SEnext week. That\u2019s the four-year-oldmodelwith a relatively small screen and a relatively lowpriceof $399 and up in the United States.\nThis iPhone model hasn\u2019t been a blockbuster, but it\u2019s a nice option for some people. Apple and other companies arelikely to keep releasingmorefresh smartphone modelsthis year, perhaps with some pandemic-related delays.\nConditions aren\u2019t ideal for selling stuff. Americanconsumer spending in March fell at the fastest ratein the nearly three decades the government has tracked the data. Many stores around the world, including Apple\u2019s and other cellphone retailers\u2019, are closed. Millions of newly unemployed people don\u2019t have spare money, and Americans areshifting what they are buying. Groceries and streaming video, yes. Electronics, no.\nApple probably had this latest model ready to go before the pandemic hit \u2014 and sure, why not give it a go? The honest truth is, it\u2019s impossible to predict if and when our buying habits will return to normal.\nNew smartphones have been a tough sell for some time. People in the United States and many other countries are waiting longer to replace their phones \u2014 for Americans, it\u2019s more than three years on average.\nPick your favorite explanation for this phenomenon. Many people don\u2019t want to pay the going rate of $1,000 or more for phones with all the bells and whistles. To some people, even the features that are supposed to be exciting feel blah.\nThe best explanation for the smartphone sales malaise is a simple one: This is what happens when products go from new and novel to normal.\nProducts get more reliable and resilient as they become mass market, and new models don\u2019t feel so different from the old. Apart from the die-hards, most people lose interest in the latest and greatest. The hot new thing feels\u2026fine.\nIn Brian\u2019sassessmentof last fall\u2019s iPhone models, he said there was no rush to buy a new phone if your current one is less than a few years old. (Yes, a professional tech reviewer suggested you might NOT need to buy something.)\nThe shift from wow to shrug happened with cars, personal computers and televisions. More than a decade after modern smartphones hit the market, we\u2019ve lost our zing for those pocket computers, too. Until economic conditions stabilize, our zing will probably be even less zingy than normal.\nA smartphone is now a refrigerator. We need it, but we don\u2019t replace our current model when a new ice-making feature comes out. This is not great for companies with shiny new phones to sell. For the rest of us, it\u2019s fine.\nA three-year-old smartphone is great. Broken government technology that\u2019s failing struggling people is not.\nMy colleagues have written about the Small Business Administration\u2019s online application systemmelting downwith loan requests from businesses applying for help. A Lyft driver in New York was told tofax his pay stubsto the unemployment office. There are unprecedented demands right now. But, wow, this is a bad look for government technology when it\u2019s needed most.\nThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily the age of the technology used by government organizations. It\u2019s the upkeep.\nThe hidden secret of the internet is that behind the scenes, there are Sputnik-era computers doing chores like handling your credit card payment on Amazon and filling your online travel reservations. That60-year-old computer programming languagethat New Jersey\u2019s governor talked about?

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nOnline shopping in a pandemic feels like a constant ethical dilemma.\nI thought about buyingjigsaw puzzlesto occupy myself in quarantine life. But I wondered whether it was worth stressing the workers who pack, ship and deliver something I didn\u2019t need. BUT, businesses need my dollars right now, and people need work.\nIt\u2019s exhausting to balance our safety, that of others and the financial health of our communities.\nI discussed this recently withSally Bergesen, the founder and chief executive of the athletic apparel companyOiselle. Neither of us are philosophers, but Sally says she wants her company to support women in leadership roles, improve conditions for female athletes and help the rest of us feel connected. She thinks about the big picture.\nI came away with a rough blueprint of how we can be conscientious shoppers in a pandemic.\nThe basic idea is to think. Think about whether the company you\u2019re buying from needs the business, and how many people involved in the purchase might be in harm\u2019s way. Think about whether what you\u2019re buying can wait for more normal times. And keep thinking about our personal responsibility as shoppers when this crisis subsides.\nThinking won\u2019t cure disease, but it matters.\nFirst, if you can, Sally said, \u201cDefinitely patronize the business that you want to see survive in the future.\u201d\nThis is a self-serving message from a small company. But she\u2019s right that the pandemic-created economic freeze is likely to leavebig companies in better shapethansmaller ones. If we wantmore thanWalmart, Amazon and McDonald\u2019s in our economy, our behavior can make a difference.\nSecond, consider cutting the number of steps between you and your purchases. If you order takeout from a local burger restaurant, calling them directly rather than ordering from an app like DoorDashcould put more moneyinto that restaurant\u2019s pocket.\nMy colleague Vanessa Friedman wrote aboutordering clothes directlyfrom the designer, or an independent boutique, rather than from a big box store that takes a cut of that product\u2019s sales.\nIf you do use an app like Instacart to hire someone to deliver or shop for you, pleasetip them what you can afford.\nAnd third, think about the conditions for people packing and delivering what you buy online. Sally said Oiselle has made sure there\u2019s more space between each worker at its warehouse, and it imposed cleaning and sanitation mandates.\nWe can\u2019t necessarily tell what happens in the path from online order to our doorstep. If you\u2019re not sure, maybe your purchase can wait. Puzzles are important if your toddler needs to stay entertained, but less so for me. I skipped them. There\u2019s a trade-off, of course. My puzzle money might be someone else\u2019s badly needed sales.\n\u201cIf you can find ways to help individuals and smaller businesses, then the balance goes in favor of that,\u201d said Ellis Jones, author of \u201cThe Better World Shopping Guide\u201d and a sociology professor at the College of the Holy Cross.\nI know not everyone has the money or brainpower right now to be choosy about what we buy and from whom. But Sally and I talked, too, about how it\u2019s become easy to be a mindless shopper. Even before a pandemic, it was easy to scroll Instagram and buy something I didn\u2019t need, or get deliveries every day from Amazon. Those choices have consequences in environmental harm and traffic congestion.\nNow and in the future, our choices add up.

Here\u2019s what we know, and a lot of what we don\u2019t know, about this pandemic-fighting tech:\nApple and Google are only creating a technology blueprint.\nApple and Google are creating a system that would be used by apps, which will have to be created by government health care authorities or others. Those apps could let people report their infections and enable contract tracing. (Look, acomic on how this infection tracing works.)\nNot every American will agree to use one of these apps, but as my colleague Jennifer Valentino-DeVries notedon Twitter, these tracking apps can still be effective. Here\u2019sa good readfrom a computer security researcher about the privacy concerns and technology limitations of what Apple and Google are proposing.\nMy colleagues also noted in this newsletter last week thedifficulty of scaling back citizen surveillanceonce an emergency is over.\nThe technology element is just ONE pandemic-fighting step.\nAutomating some tracking of potentially infected people does not replace the traditional, labor-intensive work of public health investigators. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventiontold NPRthat there would need to be teams of people to monitor those who are sick or quarantined and advise anyone with whom they\u2019ve had contact. Places likeMassachusettsandSan Franciscoare preparing for these steps.\nSlowing the spread of the coronavirus also requires testing many more Americans and getting results fast. There will need to be systems in place to make sure people who can\u2019t leave their homes have food and medicine \u2014 and alternatives for people who can\u2019t shelter in place easily.\nChina\u2019s \u201cWailing Wall\u201d:A social media account of Dr. Li Wenliang, who was threatened by Chinese authorities for warning about the spreading coronavirus and later died of the virus, has become avirtual grieving point.

        "title": "When Your Phone Says You\u2019ve Been Exposed to the Coronavirus",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nAs if the push alerts from your favorite news organization weren\u2019t delivering enough scary information, your phone could soon start warning you when you\u2019ve been exposed to the coronavirus.\nTwo weeks ago, Apple and Google, whose software powers almost every smartphone in the world,announcedthey had teamed up to develop a tool that will enable phones to use Bluetooth, the short-range wireless technology, to log other devices they come near so that users can be notified when they\u2019ve had contact with an infected person. The tool will be voluntary and could be available for downloading within several months.\nNaturally, the highly unusual collaboration between these two tech giants has elicited both fanfare and skepticism: How large a role could it actually play in ending the crisis, and at what cost to your privacy? Here\u2019s what people are saying.\nAbsent a vaccine, suppressing the coronavirus will require testing the contacts of every known case, as The Times\u2019s Donald G. McNeil Jr.explains. The strategy, known as contact tracing, is a simple one, and public-health officials have been using it to control the spread of infectious diseases for decades. In Massachusetts, a contact-tracing program is already underway.\nBut some public-health experts warn that manual contact tracing may not work for the coronavirus,Ellen Barryreportsfor The Times.The traditional method is labor-intensive (and therefore expensive), susceptible to errors and omissions of memory and, some argue,simply too slowfor this virus. \u201cUsing automation to do it, cellphones and triangulations of data, that is the easiest and fastest way, and probably the most effective way to do this,\u201d Ranu S. Dhillon, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston who advised the government of Guinea on the Ebola outbreak, told Ms. Barry.\nSeveral countries in eastern Asia have used digital tracking technology to control their outbreaks,as Derek Thompsonreportsfor The Atlantic, albeit to varying extents. South Korea, for example, draws on cellphone-location data, CCTV and credit-card records to monitor citizens\u2019 activity; when a person tests positive, local governments can push outa cellphone alertcontaining a detailed record of the person\u2019s movements. Singapore has taken a less intrusive approach, offering (but not mandating) an app that uses Bluetooth to record people\u2019s contacts.\nApple and Google\u2019s tool promises a more effective version of Singapore\u2019s strategy,as Jack Nicas and Daisuke Wakabayashiexplainin The Times. After installing the new software, smartphone owners could use it to report their infection to an app maintained by a public-health authority. Here\u2019s how it would work:\nOnce someone reports his or her infection to a public-health app, the tool will send the phone\u2019s so-called broadcast beacons, or anonymous identifiers connected to the device, to central computer servers. Other phones will constantly check those servers for the broadcast beacons of devices they had come near in the past 14 days. If there is a match, those people will receive an alert that they had likely come into contact with an infected person.\nApple and Google\u2019s partnership has sparked concerns among some digital privacy experts,as Sara Morrisonreportsfor Recode. The concerns are both specific to Google, in particular, whose advertising business model depends on data collection, and general to the moment, governed increasingly as it is by public and privateregimes of mass surveillance.\u201cOne way or another, everyone from location-data brokers to law enforcement can get access to a lot of your data through these companies\u2019 devices,\u201d she writes. \u201cHow will Apple and Google prevent their tool from being abused by governments with access to it?\u201d\nAt the same time, Apple and Google appear to have taken good-faith measures to ensure user privacy,accordingto Jennifer Granick, the surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. Crucially, the tool records only the proximity of one phone to another, not their locations, and protects its data to keep users anonymous.\nThe urgency of the pandemic has made even staunch privacy defenders more amenable to the prospect of increased surveillance.\u201cThese massive companies have the infrastructure and resources to do this,\u201d Charlie Warzel at The Timessays. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this feeling of almost, \u2018Thank God someone\u2019s stepping up.\u2019 They\u2019re trying to engineer this in a very privacy-focused way. At the same time, I fear the consolidation of power of companies that already have huge amounts of it.\u201d\n[Related: \u201cHow Apple and Google are tackling their Covid privacy problem\u201d]\nBluetooth contact tracing is not a replacement for manual contract tracing,accordingto Jason Bay, who spearheaded the development of Singapore\u2019s app. There are two key reasons for this, as Sidney Fussell and Will Knightexplainin Wired:\n\u201cBluetooth can\u2019t distinguish whether an infected person was within 6 feet for a length of time, or behind a glass wall, or in the apartment next door, or wearing a mask and gloves,\u201d they write, so the number of false positives could overwhelm health officials.\nFor a contact-tracing app to be effective, roughly 50 percent to 70 percent of a population has to use it. But in Singapore, only about20 percent of peoplehave downloaded the government\u2019s app.\nTo be sure, manual contact tracing would be an enormous undertaking,Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,writesin The Times. He estimates the government would need to recruit \u201can army\u201d of 300,000 people to do the work.\nBut the \u201cgood\u201d news is that there are millions of people now looking for employment,Casey Newtonwritesat The Verge. Helping state and county health programs hire contact tracers, he says, would be a wise use of stimulus money. \u201cFor now it seems worth saying that there\u2019s little evidence that phones are good at contact tracing \u2014 and a lot of evidence that human beings are,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs we prepare to begin reopening society, the biggest investment we need to make is in people.\u201d\nBecause of the shortage of tests in the United States, contact tracing of any kind is currently impossible to do on a large enough scale.A comprehensive contact-tracing program would entail performing 2.5 million tests per day,accordingto one estimate, but nationwide daily testing capacityhas plateaued at about 145,000. Closing the gap, Ezekiel Emmanuel and Paul Romerwritein The Atlantic, would require a nationwide mobilization of laboratories, not to mention funding from Congress.\nThe bottom line is that any contact-tracing strategy has to be part of a much broader and coordinated public-health effort,accordingto Shirin Ghaffary at Recode. \u201cHaving an app tell you you\u2019ve been exposed to Covid-19 is helpful, but it\u2019s only the first step we\u2019re seeing in effective international responses,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor these notifications to be of any use, people need access to proper testing, health care systems, and financial support to get through a period of quarantine and potential illness.\u201d Without that infrastructure in place, Apple and Google\u2019s tool may prove as fruitless as a virus without a host, little more than a piece of code.\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

        "title": "Why Apple\u2019s iPad Is the Gadget of the Pandemic",
        "fulltext": "In a flatlining economy, the $399iPhonethatAppleintroduced last week might sound attractive. But there\u2019s a better gadget deal in the pandemic: theiPad.\nRemember theiPad? You would be forgiven if you had forgotten.\nApple unveiled anew entry-level modelof the tablet computer last year for $329. Yet it barely got a mention at the company\u2019s glitzy product event in September, when Applehighlighted new iPhonesthat cost $699 to $1,099. The iPad, which always seemed like an optional accessorysitting between your computer and smartphone, has long been treated as that \u201cother\u201d device.\nNow it\u2019s time for us to reconsider the iPad. Last week, I wrote about howthe coronavirus had revealed our most essential techand weeded out the excess. The tech we have turned to over and over boils down to a computing device, communication tools, entertainment and an internet connection. The iPad delivers on all of those needs even better than a smartphone.\nWith a bigger screen than an iPhone, the iPad excels at videoconferencing with apps like FaceTime and Zoom, and it\u2019s great for watching movies and programs on Netflix and YouTube. When you attach it to a good keyboard, it becomes an excellent budget computer with a zippy internet connection for browsing the web, writing emails and composing documents. All for half the price of a regular iPhone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really in that sweet spot of being relatively affordable and having everything I think most people will need,\u201d said Nick Guy, a writer forWirecutter, a New York Times publication that tests products.\nSo even though Apple is releasing its newiPhone SEthis week, with its sped-up internals and a better camera than itspredecessor, now may not be the ideal time to buy one. After all, what good is an improved camera if you can\u2019t leave the house?\nIt\u2019s tough to recommend buying any tech in the coronavirus outbreak, actually. But if your gadgets are failing to fulfill your needs in any of the aforementioned areas and you have the money to spend, an iPad is one of the few products I can endorse for its practicality. (Apple declined to comment on this column.)\nI picked up an iPad for a $100 discount last Black Friday. Over the past few weeks, it has been my go-to device. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m naming it the gadget of the pandemic.\nI\u2019ve never been much of a video chatterer, but the pandemic has forced just about all of us to use videoconferencing with the people we care about and work with.\nInitially, I preferred doing video calls on my office-provided laptop because the screen angle could be adjusted. But after about a week, I realized that video calls on a laptop were a lousy experience. They are a power sucker; a half-hour call on Google Hangouts used 25 percent of my laptop battery.\nWhat\u2019s more, security researchers have found thatZoom, the most popular video chatting app, has major security vulnerabilities on computers but not on mobile devices like the iPad. That\u2019s because mobile apps operate in a more restricted environment with limited access to your data.\nThis made me eventually shift all my video calls to the iPad, which was by far a better experience. The iPad has much longer battery life than a laptop. And compared with a smartphone, the tablet has a big screen for video calls and can easily be propped up with a protective cover.\nMy wife and I recently used an iPad for a two-hour FaceTime call with my brother-in-law while we played a video game together. At the end of the session, the iPad still had more than 70 percent of its battery remaining.\nAfter I started doing video calls on the iPad, many of my work tasks also began shifting over to the tablet, including composing email, taking notes and even doing expenses. I appreciated the device\u2019s prolonged battery life and preferred the way apps took up the full screen, which helped me concentrate on tasks.\nNot all credit goes to the iPad alone. The gadget has only a virtual keyboard, and using it to type on a slab of glass is no fun.\nFortunately, I had researched several iPad keyboards before the pandemic and settled on the $100Logitech Slim Folio keyboard, which was simple to attach. Typing on it feels the same as using a normal keyboard, and its case protects the tablet while propping it up.\nI still do most of my writing on the laptop because the software is more suitable for multitasking. But I can do a surprising amount of my job on the tablet thanks in large part to finding the right keyboard.\nI normally read lots of books, but lately I\u2019ve been in the mood to shut off my brain by reading comics. The Comixology and Comic Zeal apps on the iPad make digital comics a better experience than reading in print: You can zoom in on individual panels, plus the screen is bright enough that you won\u2019t need to turn on a reading lamp.\nWhile I prefer watching video on a television screen, it has been nice to have an iPad to stream an HBO show while my wife is using the television to watch \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d\nI also now spend several hours a day watching YouTube videos about everything from baking to D.I.Y. home improvement. Thanks to this new obsession, I finally optimized homemade pizza dough, learned how to install a part in my motorcycle and even managed to install a bidet for my toilet. The iPad has been a great video-playing companion through this journey.\nSo why the iPad and not another tablet computer? After all, many of the same tasks can be done on cheaper tablets, likeAmazon\u2019s $50 Fire HD 8.\nYet those other devices are generally much slower and have inferior screens. TheiPad is ultimately the best tableton the market.\nThere are just two caveats, both of which add to the gadget\u2019s price. The first is that a keyboard drives its cost up an extra $100. The second is that I recommend more storage (128 gigabytes instead of 32) to carry more apps and games, which adds another $100.\nThat brings the total to $529.\nDon\u2019t let that put you off. The iPad is still cheaper than most iPhone models and a better value than just so-so laptops from Lenovo, Dell and HP, which cost about $500.\nRyne Hager, an editor for the tech blog Android Police, said he bought an iPad for his girlfriend last Christmas and noticed that she was using it more frequently during the lockdown to video chat with her family. The device\u2019s ease of use and value were so compelling that he broke the Android Police site\u2019s tradition of writing exclusively about Android products and wrote an article aboutwhy people should buy an iPad for the pandemic.\n\u201cIn a thousand little ways it offers a much better experience,\u201d he said about the Apple tablet. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of invaluable right now.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The global economy is showing signs of collapse, yet Apple said that its sales continued to rise and that it was buying back another $50 billion in stock.\nThe tech giant has long been a bellwether for global industry, and investors will now hope that is still the case. Apple said on Thursday that its revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $58.3 billion in the first three months of the year, despite coronavirus lockdowns in China, where Apple assembles nearly all of its products and sells nearly a fifth of them.\nApple said it more than compensated for a 7.5 percent decline in revenue in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong with surging sales of its internet services, like iPhone apps and Apple Music, as well as the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nYet there are signs of a rougher path ahead. Analysts expect the current quarter to be much uglier because of the shutdowns across much of the world to combat the spread of the virus. \u201cThe supply chain is largely back up and running, but now the question is what kind of demand is there going to be for their products,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research who tracks Apple.\nApple declined to forecast sales for the quarter, \u201cgiven the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said Thursday on an earnings call. \u201cOver the long term, though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business.\u201d\nApril results and Apple\u2019s expectations for the next two months suggest that the virus\u2019s upheaval of modern life would pose some challenges to Apple\u2019s business \u2014 and some benefits said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer.\nHe added the company expected sales of iPhones and the Apple Watch to suffer because customers often want to see them in store before buying, andApple has closed more than 450 stores around the worldbecause of the virus. But the company predicts sales of its internet services, as well as Mac computers and iPads, to grow as more people remain largely confined to their homes.\nDemand was slow in the first half of April, Mr. Maestri added in an interview, but that it ticked up in the past two weeks, which he attributed to government stimulus programs andnew products. \u201cWe are optimistic for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s going to be some of our products that are going to do quite well in this environment.\u201d\nApple showed some confidence by extending an aggressive pattern of stock buybacks, announcing it would repurchase another $50 billion of its stock, a potentially bold move at the likely outset of a recession.\nBecause Apple used changes in the tax lawto bring back most of the $252 billionit had held abroad in 2018, the company has nowauthorized $225 billion in share repurchases. The new tax law set off a record binge of stock buybacks in recent years, but nowsuch buybacks face increasing criticism.\nApple\u2019s results easily beat Wall Street estimates, but the company\u2019s profit still shrank 2.7 percent to $11.25 billion from a year prior, its fifth decline in profit in the last six quarters. Those declines are in part fueled by falling sales of iPhones, one of its highest-margin products. Apple said iPhone sales decreased 6.7 percent to roughly $29 billion, while revenue from Apple\u2019s services and wearables businesses together grew by 18.4 percent to $19.6 billion."

        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 In one of the most far-ranging attempts to haltthe spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it.\nThe technology giants said they were teaming up to release the tool within several months, building it into the operating systems of the billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world. That would enable the smartphones to constantly log other devices they come near, enabling what is known as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d of the disease. People would opt in to use the tool and voluntarily report if they became infected.\nThe unlikely partnership between Google and Apple, fierce rivals who rarely pass up an opportunity to criticize each other, underscores the seriousness of the health crisis and the power of the two companies whose software runs almost every smartphone in the world. Apple and Google said their joint effort came together in just the last two weeks.\nTheir work could prove to be significant in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Public-health authorities have said that improved tracking of infected people and their contacts could slow the pandemic, especially at the start of an outbreak, and such measures have been effective inplaces like South Koreathat also conducted mass virus testing.\nYet two of the world\u2019s largest tech companies harnessing virtually all of the smartphones on the planet to trace people\u2019s connections raises questions about the reach these behemoths have into individuals\u2019 lives and society.\n\u201cIt could be a useful tool but it raises privacy issues,\u201d said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who is helping San Francisco officials withcontact tracing. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the sole solution, but as part of a robust sophisticated response, it has a role to play.\u201d\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,said on Twitterthat the tool would help curb the virus\u2019s spread \u201cin a way that also respects transparency & consent.\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief, alsoposted on Twitterthat the tool has \u201cstrong controls and protections for user privacy.\u201d\nWith the tool, people infected with the coronavirus would notify a public health app that they have it, which would then alert phones that had recently come into proximity with that person\u2019s device. The companies would need to getpublic-health authorities to agree to link their app to the tool.\nPresident Trump said on Friday that his administration planned to look at the tool.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very new, new technology. It\u2019s very interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person\u2019s freedom.\u201d\nPrivacy is a concern given that Google, in particular, has a checkered history of collecting people\u2019s data for its online advertising business. The internet search companycame under firein 2018 after it said that disabling people\u2019s location history on Android phones would not stop it from collecting location data.\nApple, which has been one of the biggest critics of Google\u2019s collection of user data, has not built a significant business around using data to sell online advertising. Still, the company has access to a wealth of information about its users, from their location to their health.\nThere are already third-party tools for contact tracing, including from public health authorities and theMassachusetts Institute of Technology. In March, the government of Singapore introduced a similar coronavirus contact-tracing app, calledTraceTogether, that detects mobile phones that are nearby.\nBut given the number of iPhones and Android devices in use worldwide, Apple and Google said they were hoping to make tracing efforts by public health authorities more effective by reaching more people. They also said they would provide their underlying technology to the third-party apps to make them more reliable.\nDaniel Weitzner, a principal research scientist at M.I.T.\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and who was one of those behind the school\u2019s contract tracing app, said Google and Apple\u2019s partnership will help health officials save time and resources in developing their own applications to track the virus\u2019 spread.\nOne challenge for third-party apps is that they must run constantly \u2014 24 hours a day, seven days a week \u2014 to be effective. Google said some Android smartphone manufacturers shut down those applications to save battery life.\nApple and Google said their tool would also constantly run in the background if people opt to use it, logging nearby devices through the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth. But it would eat up less battery life and be more reliable than third-party apps, they said.\nOnce someone reports his or her infection to a public-health app, the tool will send the phone\u2019s so-called broadcast beacons, or anonymous identifiers connected to the device, to central computer servers.\nOther phones will constantly check those servers for the broadcast beacons of devices they had come near in the past 14 days. If there is a match, those people will receive an alert that they had likely come into contact with an infected person.\nApple and Google said they were discussing how much information to include in those alerts with health officials, aiming to strike a balance between being helpful while also protecting the privacy of those who have the coronavirus.\n\u201cThis data could empower members of the general population to make informed decisions about their own health in terms of self-quarantining,\u201d said Dr. Reid. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t replace the public health imperative that we scale up contact tracing in the public health departments\u201d around the world.\nApple and Google said they would make the tool\u2019s underlying technology available to third-party apps by mid-May and publicly release the tool \u201cin the coming months.\u201d The companies said the tool would not collect devices\u2019 locations \u2014 it only tracked proximity to other devices \u2014 and would keep people anonymous in the central servers.\nGoogle and Apple\u2019s approach aims to resolve one of the hurdles facing government and private efforts to create contact tracing applications: a lack of common technical standards. The European Commission, the executive of the 27-nation bloc, said on Wednesday that \u201ca fragmented and uncoordinated approach risks hampering the effectiveness\u201d of such apps.\nAshkan Soltani, an independent cybersecurity researcher, cautioned that surveillance tools thatstart as voluntary often become requiredthrough public policy decisions. China, for instance, has introduceda color-coded coronavirus surveillance appthat automatically decides whether someone must stay at home or may go outside and use public transportation.\n\u201cThe danger is, as you roll out these voluntary solutions and they gain adoption, it\u2019s more likely that they are going to become compulsory,\u201d said Mr. Soltani, a former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission.\nMr. Soltani said the tool could also be a way for the tech companies to pre-empt efforts by governments in the United States or elsewhere to mandate a more invasive collection of data to combat the pandemic.\n\u201cThe tool permits them to address the administration\u2019s ask to \u2018do something\u2019 while also relieving them of the responsibility of building the app and collecting the data themselves,\u201d he said.\nNatasha Singer and Jennifer Valentino-DeVries contributed reporting from New York, Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London and David McCabe from Washington."

        "title": "The F.B.I.\u2019s Director, a Critic of Strong Encryption, Once Defended It",
        "fulltext": "As recently as last month, Christopher A. Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was pushing tech companies like Facebook to give law enforcement access to what he called \u201cwarrant-proof encryption.\u201d\nIt was the latest salvo in an intensifying battle between the government and Silicon Valley over so-called end-to-end encryption, which protects users\u2019 data from being read by outsiders, including F.B.I. agents with a warrant. Mr. Wray, and Attorney General William P. Barr have been pushing tech companies to roll back encryption, with Mr. Barr going asfar as to imply that companieslike Facebook and Apple that offer end-to-end encryption were \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\nBut a new wrinkle surfaced in the government\u2019s arguments late Wednesday, after court documents in a separate matter between WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and NSO Group, an Israeli spyware maker, revealed that Mr. Wray\u2019s law firm previously argued in favor of strong end-to-end encryption while representingWhatsApp in a sealed 2015 case involving the Justice Department.\nIn the earlier case, which has never been made public, Mr. Wray, then a partner at King & Spalding, was hired to \u201canalyze and protect\u201d WhatsApp\u2019s software from a Justice Department effort to weaken its encryption in order to conduct wiretap of a WhatsApp user\u2019s data.\nThe arguments made by Mr. Wray\u2019s firm in favor of WhatsApp\u2019s encryption may undercut his recent calls to push tech firms \u2014 including his previous client WhatsApp \u2014 to roll back encryption, a move many security experts have likened to a government \u201cbackdoor.\u201d\n\u201cDirector Wray cannot comment on the scope of his prior representation of WhatsApp or the legal advice he provided to the company,\u201d the F.B.I. said in a statement. \u201cLike all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients\u2019 interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did for clients. Today, as director of the FBI, his duty is to act in the best interests of the American people.\u201d\nDetails of Mr. Wray\u2019s involvement in the 2015 case were made public in a WhatsApp court filing unsealed Wednesday involving WhatsApp and NSO. WhatsApp is asking a Northern California District Court judge to disqualify King & Spalding from representing NSO, citing conflicts of interest, given the firm\u2019s previous representation of WhatsApp.\nAccording to the unsealed documents, Mr. Wray was one of several King & Spalding lawyers who represented WhatsApp in its matter involving the Justice Department. Documents related to the 2015 case are still under seal because, according to the WhatsApp filing, they \u201ccontain and summarize confidential information based on a nonparty to this case, the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\nThe New York Times learned of the 2015 matterthrough confidential sources. At the time, the Justice Departmentwas also engaged in a court battle with Apple, pushing the company to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the gunmen in a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The government ultimately dropped its case after security researchers helped them bypass Apple\u2019s security.\nIn WhatsApp\u2019s case against NSO Group, lawyers also want King & Spalding sidelined because they say the law firm \u201cpossesses WhatsApp\u2019s confidential information that is material to this litigation.\u201d\nIn a statement Thursday, a WhatsApp spokesman reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to making end-to-end encryption the default option for WhatsApp messages and calls, and would continue to defend its technology in courts.\nOf its current dispute with NSO, the WhatsApp spokesman said: \u201cThe circumstances in which King & Spaulding attorneys represented WhatsApp in the past pose serious ethical concerns for their representation of NSO today.\u201d\nIn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last February, Mr. Wray singled out Facebook, telling lawmakers, \u201cWe have to have mechanisms to allow lawful access to protect flesh and blood Americans.\u201d\nHe was responding, in part, to an announcement last year by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, that Facebook plans toextend end-to-end encryptionto Facebook\u2019s other platforms, including Instagram and Facebook Messenger.\nIn his February testimony, Mr. Wray said those plans would be a \u201cdream come true for predators and child pornographers.\u201d\n\u201cIf Facebook moves forward with the plans they have at the moment, we will be blinded,\u201d Mr. Wray told lawmakers. \u201cThey will blind themselves and law enforcement, no matter what process this committee comes up with to allow us access to that content. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a decision Facebook or any one company should be making on behalf of the American people.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Can\u2019t America Make Enough Masks or Ventilators?",
        "fulltext": "Hundreds of companies across the United States are reinventing themselves to make equipment that is desperately needed to treat the coronavirus. That so many American manufacturers are rising to meet this pandemic with little coordination from the federal government reveals a deep altruism in our national character.\nIt also reveals something else: Our country is unable to meet an immediate need for critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment in the face of a crisis. The absence of adequate domestic production capacity for things like face shields and respirators, coupled with the frailty of on-demand global supply chains and our utter reliance on them \u2014 for everything from the ingredients in our medications to partsof breathing machines \u2014 has left us dangerously exposed during an international health emergency.\nMohawk Fine Papersand its United Steelworkers employees are shifting to medical gown and mask production.American Giantand other garment manufacturers are scaling up the production of medical-grade masks. Companies fromBudweisertoFordare churning out hand sanitizer and ventilators. These instances of private sector action are inspiring, but they won\u2019t be enough.\nOur policymaking is still behind the curve. President Trump is starting to selectively use the Defense Production Act, a law from the Korean War era that allows the president not only to order businesses to prioritize the manufacture of items deemed crucial to national security but also to subsidize them. This is something he should have done many weeks ago, and even still he\u2019s mostly invoking it haphazardly with companies that draw his ire.\nWhite House officialshave floatedfor a few months an executive order meant to encourage domestic production of pharmaceuticals. But the hint of such an order generated a lobbying blitz from drug makers, including one spokesperson whotold CNBCthat \u201cin times of crisis, a diverse supply chain is more important than ever.\u201d\nThis is a blas\u00e9 way of saying they\u2019d rather protect their yawning profit margins than contribute to the country\u2019s medicinal security. But many of our national political leaders aren\u2019t ready to talk about this, either. The president has promoted himself as a champion of American manufacturing, but now he avoids addressing its shortcomings.\nThe Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, only recently beganspeakingabout these supply issues, and mainly in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s scattered use of the Defense Production Act. Congress had a huge opportunity to encourage the domestic manufacture of critical supplies and avoided it; it attached no strings to force manufacturing repatriation to the $500 billion it made available to big businesses about to be damaged by the economy\u2019s collapse.\nThe bipartisan tendency of our politicians to salute workers and visit factories during campaign season, and then do little of substance to help factories expand and increase hiring, must end. This pandemic has most Americans rightfully concerned about their personal well-being \u2014 everything from their health, their job security and their ability to pay the rent or a mortgage is on the line.\nBut Americans are also now concerned with our national well-being. And one of the questions they are asking is this: How did it come to pass that we can\u2019t make enough respirator masks or ventilators when we need them most?\nThe answer isn\u2019t a blunt call for autarky. No serious person wants the economy to revert to closed borders and walls around our nation. But while globalizing supply chains may make sense in textbooks, the outsourcing we\u2019ve encouraged by decades of this trade policy and corporate profit-seeking clearly has its limitations. And manufacturing critical supplies domestically will require significant policy shifts.\nWhenever Congress and the administration decide on next steps for our national well-being, they must move beyond bromides for the working class and put into place a sensible industrial policy, one that combines the power of American ingenuity with the capabilities of public investment.\nSuch a policy should incentivize re-industrialization via the tax code. It should encourage it with its traditional power of the purse \u2014 which means expanding Buy America provisions that prioritize domestic manufacturers in federal contracting bids to virtually all spending.\nCompanies that dip into the huge fund Congress almost unanimously made available to the Treasury Department in the recent $2 trillion stimulus packageshould be expected, when applicable, to bring more of their manufacturing operations back into the country and to devote far more resources to skills training to prepare for their work force needs.\nTrade enforcement should be more stringent. While critics are right to question the specifics behind some of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, these tariffs shouldn\u2019t be removed until we see quantifiable and reciprocal change on the part of China and other international competitors, many of which banned exports of medical supplies at a critical time.\nAnd lastly, a national effort should be made to identify and then prioritize the industries where a lack of a domestic manufacturing ecosystem leaves the country extremely vulnerable. We\u2019ve known about an overdependence on imports in supply chains for pharmaceuticals and medical equipment for years, though it was easier to ignore when our nation wasn\u2019t in crisis.\nThe Defense Production Act is being invoked to call out and forceindividual companiesto make these supplies. That may be a successful short-term bludgeon, but expanding the act\u2019s use to organize a national manufacturing strategy to meet this moment would be much better than the current piecemeal approach to producing the millions of items health care workers need to handle a surge of sick Americans.\nThe next national emergency could be an attack on our power grid or water supply or a natural disaster that brings global supply chains to a screeching halt. Do we have the battery production capacity to turn the lights back on immediately? Can we produce turbines to keep our dams operating? In a crisis, could we make a smartphone in the United States to ensure Americans can continue to communicate?\nThe United States is going to have to weather the coronavirus crisis with a manufacturing sector that isn\u2019t constructed to meet it. We must address that shortcoming before the next crisis arrives, and we should start now. It\u2019s time for a 21st century Arsenal of Democracy: One that will both see us through future crises and revitalize an economy that desperately needs rejuvenation.\nScott Paul (@ScottPaulAAM)is president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
