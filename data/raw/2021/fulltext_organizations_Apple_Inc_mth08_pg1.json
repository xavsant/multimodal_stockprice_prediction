        "title": "Apple Avoids Another Legal Fight With App Developers",
        "fulltext": "Apple, in a legalsettlementannounced on Thursday with a group ofapp developers, said it would allow developers to urge customers to pay them outside their iPhone apps.\nThe move would allow app makers to avoid payingApplea commission on their sales and could appease developers and regulators concerned with its control over mobile apps, including strict policies designed to force developers to pay it a cut of their sales.\nThe settlement appears to be a small price to pay for the world\u2019s richest company to avoid another extended legal fight that could have posed major risks to its business by targeting the iPhoneApp Store. In practice, some major companies, such as Spotify, already push their customers to evade Apple\u2019s commissions.\nAppleis still awaiting a decision from a federal judge in a separatelawsuitthat was filed byEpic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, and that seeks to forceAppleto allow app developers to avoid App Store commissions altogether. Consumers, too, have sued Apple over its app commissions, in a case thatthe U.S. Supreme Court has allowedto go forward in federal court and that is seeking class-action status.\nUnder the new settlement, Apple also said it would create a $100 million fund for payouts to small app developers and agreed to not raise the commission rate for small developers, which itreduced last year to 15 percent from 30 percent, for at least three years.\nIn a briefing with reporters, anAppleexecutive said it was a major concession for Apple to allow developers to tell customers, via email and other channels, about alternative payment methods. Apple will still bar developers from telling customers inside their iPhone apps about other ways to pay.\nThe Apple executive added that Thursday\u2019s settlement showed that small app developers were mostly fine with maintaining the current App Store policies, including the reduced commission. Larger developers, which pay the higher rate, continue to complain, however.\nApple restricted reporters from naming the Apple executive or quoting her directly.\nSome companies already push customers toward other ways to pay. Spotify, for example, has long blocked customers from signing up for subscriptions to its music service in its app \u2014 and it has at timesadvertised this. Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday appears to remove a rule that it was already selectively enforcing.\nSteve Berman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the suit, which sought class-action status, said, \u201cWe truly are proud that a case brought by two developers, standing in the shoes of tens of thousands of U.S. iOS developers, could help to bring about so much important change.\u201d\nThe Coalition for App Fairness, a group of companies that are fighting to change Apple\u2019s App Store policies, said in a statement that the agreement was a \u201csham settlement\u201d designed to appease courts, regulators and lawmakers.\n\u201cThis offer does nothing to address the structural, foundational problems facing all developers, large and small, undermining innovation and competition in the app ecosystem,\u201d said the group, which includesEpic Games, Spotify and Match Group. \u201cAllowing developers to communicate with their customers about lower prices outside of their apps is not a concession and further highlights Apple\u2019s total control over the app marketplace.\u201d\nIn the settlement, Apple also agreed to publish an annual report on the number of apps it rejects or removes from its App Store, as well as data on its search results. The New York Timesreported in 2019that Apple had been favoring its own apps over rivals in search results. Apple agreed in the settlement to ensure that its search results \u201cwill continue to be based on objective characteristics\u201d for at least three more years.\nThe settlement is subject to approval by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the same judge who is presiding over the Epic Games and consumer suits against Apple.\nDevelopers who made less than $1 million a year in the App Store from June 2015 through April 2021 are eligible for payouts between $250 to $30,000 each from Apple\u2019s proposed $100 million fund, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers.\nSeparately on Thursday, Apple said it would also allow news organizations to pay the reduced 15 percent commission on subscriptions sold through their iPhone apps, butonly if they participatedin Apple\u2019s news service, Apple News. The Times and some other news organizations havepulled out of Apple Newsin recent years because, they said, it took control of their relationship with readers and potential subscribers."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Shrewd App Store Settlement",
        "fulltext": "When Applesettled a lawsuityesterday brought by a group of small app developers, it represented a shift in the balance of power in an app ecosystem that the tech giant has long tightly controlled. Just how much of a shift is up for debate.\nWhat did Apple agree to?\nDevelopers will now be allowed to tell customers, via email and other channels (but stillnotinside apps), about alternative payment methods that avoid Apple\u2019s commissions. Apple framed this as a major concession, although it selectively enforced the rule before.\nIt agreed not to raise the 15 percent commission thatApplecollects from small app developers on customer purchases for at least three years.\nIt will set up a $100 million fund for payouts to developers who made less than $1 million a year from Apple\u2019sapp storein the past few years. They will be eligible for payouts between $250 and $30,000 each.\nIt will publish an annual report on the number of apps it rejects or removes from its App Store, as well as data on its search results.\nDoes this change anything? Perhaps little for developers, but for Apple it might be a lot.Developers had already been pushing their customers to circumvent Apple\u2019s commissions, and the settlement officially blesses that arrangement. Seen through the lens of Apple\u2019s other legal troubles, the settlement could be strategically shrewd, easing the threat of more government action, and shifting Washington\u2019s focus to other tech giants who have been less willing to make similar concessions.\nApple still faces a broader lawsuit about its App Storefrom Epic Games(the maker of Fortnite), with both companies awaiting a decision from a federal judge. The Supreme Court has alsoallowed other antitrustclass actions against Apple to move forward. Notably, yesterday\u2019s settlement is subject to approval by the same judge who is presiding over the Epic Games and consumer suits against Apple.\n\u201cWe will not forgive, we will not forget.\u201dPresident Bidenvowed to hunt downthose responsible for two explosions at the Kabul airport that killed at least 13 American service members and more than 60 Afghan civilians. The attacks add to the chaos in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover and ahead of the final withdrawal of U.S. troops next Tuesday.\nChina reportedly puts a freeze on I.P.O.s abroad. New rules in the works from China\u2019s securities regulator,sources told The Wall Street Journal, would stop Chinese companies with sensitive consumer data from listing outside of China. The purported move underscores Beijing\u2019s determination to limit theambitionsof its homegrown tech firms. Separately, China\u2019s Supreme Courtcalled the 996 work culture\u2014 working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, which is common in the country\u2019s tech industry \u2014 illegal.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court lifts a federal ban on evictions.The ruling will end the moratorium, which was set to expire in October, unless Congress acts to put in a new ban.The decision, which three liberal justices dissented from, is a blow to efforts to keepup to 11 million peoplein homes while states (slowly) disburse rental aid.\nIn other housing news, California advances a zoning law to open suburbs to development.To ease a housing shortage,state lawmakers votedto allow two-unit buildings on lots that for generations were reserved for single-family homes. Similar rezoning battles are happening nationwide, often pitting housing advocates against homeowners.\nThe Long-Term Stock Exchange gets its first listings.Two tech companies, Asana and Twilio,listed their shareson the upstart exchange, which is designed to discourage short-term thinking and promote an embrace of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. The companies are already listed on the N.Y.S.E., making the move largely a technicality, but the exchange hopes others will be encouraged to list there. The exchange has gotten off to a slow start since it wasfirst conceiveda decade ago.\nTwo of the architects of Bank of America\u2019s recovery after the financial crisis, who helped chart a new path for the banking industry as a whole, are headed for the exit.\nYesterday, Bank of America announced that Anne Finucane, the bank\u2019s vice chair and one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful women, and Thomas Montag, the bank\u2019s chief operating officer, would retire at the end of the year. Their departures also open the door for new leadership at the country\u2019s second-largest lender,The Times\u2019s Lananh Nguyen reports.\nFinucane was a pioneer on Wall Street, for many reasons.Bank of America C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, who once joked that \u201cwe all report to Anne,\u201d leaned heavily on Finucane in the wake of the financial crisis to rebuild the bank\u2019s image, which had become intertwined with subprime lending.\nUnder Finucane, 69, Bank of America emerged as one of the more forward-thinking firms in finance, leading the way on environmental, social and governance issues, which Finucane promoted long before most bankers took them seriously. She articulated the bank\u2019s position when it stepped back from financing companies that make military-style assault rifles in 2018, and when it stopped lending to private prison companies in 2019.\nMontag, who came from Merrill Lynch, was crucial to restoring the firm\u2019s Wall Street armafter the crisis. Montag, 64, who maintained ahard-driving culture, is a polarizing figure.During the pandemic, some employeesfelt pressure to be in the officeeven as other banks embraced (orat least tolerated) remote work.\nIn an email to staff, Finucane said she planned to continue to work on how banking can do more to fight climate change. \u201cShe\u2019s been one of the leaders in helping to open people\u2019s eyes\u201d to what companies can do on climate, said John Kerry, President Biden\u2019s climate envoy and a former chair of the bank\u2019s advisory council.\nWhile neither Finucane or Montag were likely in line to replace Moynihan, 61, their retirements will kick off a reshuffling of the executive ranks that will send a signal about who will lead the bank next. \u201cLet the jockeying begin,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a Wells Fargo analyst who has tracked the bank for decades.\n\u2014 Cuy Sheffield, Visa\u2019s head of crypto, on the payment giantdabbling in NFTsand other projects in the blockchain industry.\nAs digital media companies vie for growth, many arelooking to scale through deals. Two well-known brands announced mergers yesterday, while a third revealed a shake-up. Here\u2019s the rundown:\nPolitico sold itself to Axel Springer,the German publishing giant that owns Insider and Morning Brew, formore than $1 billion, according to sources. A key attraction for the buyer: Politico\u2019s subscription service, which generates more than half its $200 million in annual revenue. Robert Allbritton, who helped found Politico in 2007, will remain publisher, and the company will operate separately from Springer. The deal could quash Springer\u2019s talks to acquire Politico\u2019s competitor Axios. \u201cWhy would you consider any other alternative?\u201d Springer\u2019s C.E.O., Mathias D\u00f6pfner, told employees at a town hall meeting.\nForbes said it would go public via SPAC,in a deal valuing it at $630 million. Founded as a magazine in 1917, the outlet is mostly digital these days, although it still publishes a print edition eight times a year in the U.S. The Forbes family solda majority staketo Integrated Whale Media in 2014.\nVice announced layoffs and a shift to video.The site, which has had its own SPAC discussions,cut nearly 20 full-time jobs, mostly writers and text editors, as it shifts its emphasis to video.\nNot long ago, many market watchers had marked today as a crucial date on the calendar. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, is set to deliver his annual remarks at theJackson Hole research conference, where U.S. central bank officials often unveil important policy shifts. It seemed like the moment when the Fed chief would announce the start of a tapering of the central bank\u2019s $120-billion-per-month bond purchases, but now it looks like it won\u2019t be as momentous as that.\nWith coronavirus cases on the rise, endangering the economic recovery, many believe it\u2019s premature for the Fed to make a major shift in its stance. The Jackson Hole symposium itself was forced to switch to a virtual format just a week ago. Powell\u2019s speech is scheduled for 10 a.m. Eastern, and you canwatch it here.\nHere\u2019s what some expect from the event \u2026\n\u201cTwo to three months ago, people were expecting the whole taper plan at Jackson Hole,\u201d Priya Misra of TD Securitiestold The Times. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more the economic outlook that people are struggling with.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to rush through tapering or rush into rate hikes when Delta is still a threat,\u201d Brett Ryan of Deutsche Banktold Bloomberg.\n\u201cCurrency markets are overwhelmingly positioned for a snoozer,\u201d Karl Schamotta of Cambridge Global Paymentstold Reuters.\n\u2026 and what could be left unsaid:\nThe timing of tapering.\u201cThe longer Powell waits to detail his own thinking, the greater the challenges to maintaining Fed unity, and the bigger risk that the central bank will be forced into a more disorderly slamming of the policy brakes down the road,\u201d wrote Mohamed El-Erian in anopinion article for The Financial Times.\nThe Fed\u2019s role in inequality.The theme of the Jackson Hole gathering is \u201cMacroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy,\u201d andKaren Petrouof Federal Financial Analytics told DealBook that \u201cuneven is a euphemism for unequal.\u201d She\u2019d like Powell to acknowledge how the Fed contributes to economic unevenness and adopt a different approach.

        "title": "Buy or Wait? Here\u2019s a Guide to Phone Upgrades.",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s almost phone season again \u2014 the time of year when tech companies like Apple, Google and Samsung bombard us withglitzy marketing campaignsto persuade us to upgrade.\nTheir new phones vary somewhat, but the pitch is always roughly the same: The phone you have is no longer good enough because this new one has afancier cameraand brighter screen, plus it\u2019s faster. So give the \u201cold\u201d one to a less tech-inclined member of the family or trade it in for credit toward a shiny new gadget.\nThis hype cycle creates an annual dilemma: Is it time to upgrade? We all know that after a few years, our phones no longer work as well as they used to. It might not be able to run the latest apps. It can feel sluggish. Some components, like touch-screens, may begin to fail.\nAt some point, it does become practical to get a new phone, like when too many negatives add up or the cost of fixing a broken part is too high. But often, upgrades may be unnecessary because the elements that make us unhappy with our phones can be remedied with some care.\nIn any case, let your personal situation \u2014 not the allure of phone season \u2014 guide you, and take your time to contemplate.\n\u201cIn general, we need to get away from tying the upgrade to: \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a new iPhone out. Now is the time to think about it,\u2019\u201d said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer atWirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s sister publication that tests products. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with getting a phone later.\u201d\nHere are some questions to ask yourself \u2014 and some practical advice \u2014 to help deliberate this decision.\nThe first and most important step is to gauge your satisfaction with your phone. If there are elements that make you unhappy, drill down on the problems.\nA lot of what makes us displeased with our phones can be fixed, so it helps to be aware of the solutions. Here are two of the most common frustrations and their remedies:\nIf the device feels slow or doesn\u2019t last throughout the day, one of the simplest and most affordable solutions is to replace the battery. Apple stores willreplace an iPhone batteryfor $50 to $70, and plenty of independent technicians can service batteries for Apple and Android phones for around the same price.\nReplacing the battery greatly elongates a device\u2019s life and speeds it up. Because batteries have a finite life, it\u2019s recommended to replace them every two to three years anyway, said Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that publishes instructions on repairing gadgets.\nAnother common issue is running out of data storage, which prevents people from taking more photos and downloading apps. A quick fix is to purge apps that you no longer use. On iPhones, Apple offers theiPhone Storagetool, which shows a list of apps that take up the most data and when they were last used. On Android devices, Google offers a similar tool,Files.\nSome major problems can\u2019t be easily remedied. A broken touch-screen could cost $200 or more to replace, for example, which approaches the price of a decent new phone, like the$400 iPhone SEor$300 Google Pixel 4A. When a repair is more than half the cost of a new phone, it may be time to think about trading in your beat-up gadget for credit toward a new one.\nPhone manufacturers regularly publish software updates that include new features but also address security vulnerabilities, so it\u2019s important to stay on top of installing them. A good rule of thumb is to consider an upgrade when you can no longer get software updates.\nApple phones get software updates for five to six years. (Apple\u2019s iOS 15 software, arriving this fall, will be compatible with phones back to the iPhone 6S from 2015.) Android devices get them for a shorter period \u2014 about two to three years.\nAlthough security updates are important, it may not be practical for some people to upgrade as soon as software updates run out, said Sinan Eren, an executive at the security firm Barracuda Networks. In countries like Turkey, various taxes can add up to a markup of about 100 percent on electronics, he said, meaning customers have an economic incentive to hold on to a device for longer than five years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation and therefore a luxury to even think about security,\u201d Mr. Eren said.\nThere are ways to work around this problem. Anti-malware apps, likeMalwarebytes, may keep older Android phones running safely just a little longer. Apple phones can also run apps like1Blocker,which blocks malicious ads from loading on websites.\nIt is important to imagine what your life would look like with a new phone, said Mr. Guy of Wirecutter. If you have a newborn on the way and your phone camera takes blurry shots, an upgrade with a better camera will probably change your phone experience in a remarkable way.\nBut if you mostly use a phone just for basic tasks like making calls, messaging and browsing the web, a newer, faster one won\u2019t make a big difference because phones have been plenty fast for years.\n\u201cDon\u2019t replace something that works just fine just because there\u2019s a newer, shinier version out,\u201d Mr. Guy said."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhones Will Include New Tools to Flag Child Sexual Abuse",
        "fulltext": "Apple on Thursday unveiled changes to iPhones designed to catch cases ofchild sexual abuse, a move that is likely to please parents and the police but that was already worrying privacy watchdogs.\nLater this year,iPhones will begin using complex technology to spot images of child sexual abuse, commonly known as child pornography, that users upload to Apple\u2019s iCloud storage service, the company said. Apple also said it would soon let parents turn on a feature that can flag when their children send or receive any nude photos in a text message.\nApplesaid it had designed the new features in a way that protected the privacy of users, including by ensuring that Apple will never see or find out about any nude images exchanged in a child\u2019s text messages. The scanning is done on the child\u2019s device, and the notifications are sent only to parents\u2019 devices. Apple provided quotes from some cybersecurity experts and child-safety groups that praised the company\u2019s approach.\nOther cybersecurity experts were still concerned. Matthew D. Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, said Apple\u2019s new features set a dangerous precedent by creating surveillance technology that law enforcement or governments could exploit.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been selling privacy to the world and making people trust their devices,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re basically capitulating to the worst possible demands of every government. I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re going to say no from here on out.\u201d\nApple\u2019s moves follow a2019 investigationby The New York Times that revealed a global criminal underworld that exploited flawed and insufficient efforts to rein in the explosion of images of child sexual abuse. The investigation found that many tech companies failed to adequately police their platforms and that the amount of such content was increasing drastically.\nWhile the material predates the internet, technologies such as smartphone cameras and cloud storage have allowed the imagery to be more widely shared. Some imagery circulates for years,continuing to traumatize and hauntthe people depicted.\nBut the mixed reviews of Apple\u2019s new features show the thin line that technology companies must walk between aiding public safety and ensuring customer privacy. Law enforcement officials for years have complained that technologies like smartphone encryption have hamstrung criminal investigations, while tech executives and cybersecurity experts have argued that such encryption is crucial to protect people\u2019s data and privacy.\nIn Thursday\u2019s announcement, Apple tried to thread that needle. It said it had developed a way to help root out child predators that did not compromise iPhone security.\nTo spot the child sexual abuse material, or C.S.A.M., uploaded to iCloud, iPhones will use technology called image hashes, Apple said. The software boils a photo down to a unique set of numbers \u2014 a sort of image fingerprint.\nThe iPhone operating system will soon store a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse material provided by organizations like the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, and it will run those hashes against the hashes of each photo in a user\u2019s iCloud to see if there is a match.\nOnce there are a certain number of matches, the photos will be shown to an Apple employee to ensure they are indeed images of child sexual abuse. If so, they will be forwarded to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, and the user\u2019s iCloud account will be locked.\nApple said this approach meant that people without child sexual abuse material on their phones would not have their photos seen by Apple or the authorities.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re storing a collection of C.S.A.M. material, yes, this is bad for you,\u201d said Erik Neuenschwander, Apple\u2019s privacy chief. \u201cBut for the rest of you, this is no different.\u201d\nApple\u2019s system does not scan videos uploaded to iCloud even though offenders haveused the formatfor years. In 2019, for the first time, the number of videos reported to the national center surpassed that of photos. The center often receives multiple reports for the same piece of content.\nU.S. law requires tech companies to flag cases of child sexual abuse to the authorities. Apple has historically flagged fewer cases than other companies. Last year, for instance, Apple reported 265 cases to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, while Facebook reported 20.3 million, according to the center\u2019s statistics. That enormous gap is due in part to Apple\u2019s decision not to scan for such material, citing the privacy of its users.\nApple\u2019s other feature, which scans photos in text messages, will be available only to families with joint Apple iCloud accounts. If parents turn it on, their child\u2019s iPhone will analyze every photo received or sent in a text message to determine if it includes nudity. Nude photos sent to a child will be blurred, and the child will have to choose whether to view it. If children under 13 choose to view or send a nude photo, their parents will be notified.\nMr. Green said he worried that such a system could be abused because it showed law enforcement and governments that Apple now had a way to flag certain content on a phone while maintaining its encryption. Apple has previously argued to the authorities that encryption prevents it from retrieving certain data.\n\u201cWhat happens when other governments ask Apple to use this for other purposes?\u201d Mr. Green asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s Apple going to say?\u201d\nMr. Neuenschwander dismissed those concerns, saying that safeguards are in place to prevent abuse of the system and that Apple would reject any such demands from a government.\n\u201cWe will inform them that we did not build the thing they\u2019re thinking of,\u201d he said.\nThe Timesreported this yearthat Apple had compromised its Chinese users\u2019 private data in China and proactively censored apps in the country in response to pressure from the Chinese government.\nHany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped develop early image-hashing technology, said any possible risks in Apple\u2019s approach were worth the safety of children.\n\u201cIf reasonable safeguards are put into place, I think the benefits will outweigh the drawbacks,\u201d he said.\nMichael H.

Like other consumer products including cars, TVs and refrigerators, most people in relatively affluent countries buy a new smartphone when an old one wears out or they want a change.\nLargely because of this healthyevolution from novel to normal, new smartphone sales had been declining for several years, although they\u2019reclimbingthis year.\nSomehow it feels like there\u2019s more pressure on us to have opinions and feelings about our phones than about our refrigerators. (Although I will not argue if you want to hug your fridge. Do it now. I\u2019ll wait.) I know that cars in particular can be emotionally resonant. But for many of us, getting a new phone, car, TV or fridge is neat for a little while and then we get used to it and it feels fine. That is fine.\nThat said, we should be glad that smartphone makers keep improving their devices in small and large ways. It has been good that personal computers \u2014 which like smartphones shifted to less noteworthy essentials from novelties\u2014 took the opportunityto reimaginewhat else people might want from computers.\nWe got clever new products like Chromebooks, the bare-bones laptops that took off in many U.S. schools because they were relatively inexpensive and easy for educators to customize for students. We also got more variety in computers that combine elements of tablets, souped-up PCs for people who love video games and computerswith the zippy brains of smartphones. When computers became too normal for people to care very much, it sparked invention.\nIt\u2019s possible that the same thing may happen in the not-magical phase of smartphones. I am cautiously curious about smartphones that fold or unfurl to offer more screen real estate in a relatively small package. So far, folding smartphones \u2014Samsung showed off its latest modelson Wednesday \u2014 have been mostlyexpensive and awful. I still think there\u2019s a promising idea in there. (Or, maybe not.)\nSmartphones also remain a test bed for useful inventions, particularlyfor photographyand for software features such as voice recognition.\nSo hooray for the smartphone companies that keep perfecting their products. That doesn\u2019t mean that we need to care a jot about Google\u2019s odd looking new Pixel phones \u2014 they really dolook weird, though \u2014 or Apple\u2019s coming iPhone \u2026 13? 12S? Whatever.\nThe latest phones will be lighter, faster, better and maybe more expensive than the old ones. The cool new features will be there when you\u2019re ready. You don\u2019t have to care until then.\nTip of the Week\nNot ready yet for a new smartphone?Brian X. Chen, a consumer tech columnist for The New York Times, has a tale of dogged determination to keep an old device alive and kicking:\nA few weeks ago, a reader named Marianne sent me this email:\nLast year I tried to get a new battery for my Samsung Galaxy S7 phone. I took it to Verizon, where I had purchased it. They told me they couldn\u2019t open the phone to replace the battery and suggested I take it to a repair shop. I called Samsung, and it took so many tries to actually speak to a human.\nThe person I finally spoke to said I would have to send $75 for Samsung to even agree to look at the phone, and if they could install a battery, they\u2019d contact me. I authorized my credit card for $75 and waited for the required mail authorization only to receive an email the following day saying Samsung wanted to cancel the entire transaction. At that point, I gave up. I would be perfectly happy with my S7 if it could hold a charge.\nI responded to Marianne, encouraging her to try again \u2014 but this time, contact a few local independent repair shops to ask if they could do the job. Days later, she replied that she had found someone and her phone was restored to its former glory!\nThe moral of the story: Don\u2019t give up if a brand like Apple or Samsung says it can\u2019t help you fix a phone. There is an industry of independent fixers whose business is to keep your phone running, not sell you a new one.\nMore often than not, the indie technicians are capable of doing repairs that the manufacturers are not willing to do, like replacing a defective charging port on an iPhone. Do a web search on Yelp or Google and call around to find a good, honest fixer.\nStories like Marianne\u2019s highlight the importance of the right to repair movement, which I wrote about in arecent column. In general, manufacturers have been making it increasingly difficult for independent fixers to gain access to the tools, parts and instructions to fix your electronics. The Federal Trade Commission last month voted to ramp uplaw enforcement against illegal restrictionson repairs, so hopefully people will continue to have positive experiences with indie fixers like Marianne did.\nChanging a toxic culture is difficult:A rape allegation against a manager at the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba shows again theingrained problems of sexual harassment and violencein the country\u2019s technology industry, my colleague Li Yuan writes. Alibaba has said it fired the employee accused of rape.\nIf you\u2019re not highly visible in Google searches, do you even exist?Small local companies that deliver food for restaurants told Fast Company that they\u2019re getting squeezed out by big delivery apps such as DoorDash and Uber Eats. They say that part of the problem isGoogle search results that point people hunting for food delivery to the big apps, and Google doesn\u2019t have the manpower to add links to many of the smaller companies.\nChinese Bitcoin companies in the Lone Star state:Rest of World talked to local authorities and power companies in Texas that were scrambling to generate enoughaffordable electricity for cryptocurrency \u201cmining\u201d companiesfleeing a crackdown on the practice in China.

        "title": "Why Apple Won Its Legal Settlement With Developers",
        "fulltext": "Applesaid Thursday that it hadreached a legal settlement with app developerswho accused it of abusing its control of the mobile-app market.\nThe settlement of thelawsuitwas complex, and various people in the tech industry had widely different reactions to it.Appleand the people who sued it framed the deal as a major concession fromApple and a victory for developers. Some of Apple\u2019s critics, including companies that pay it millions of dollars in app fees, called it a \u201csham\u201d that did little to changeApple\u2019s control over apps.\nHere is an explanation of the settlement and what it means.\nCourts, regulators, lawmakers and developers have been scrutinizing Apple\u2019s practice of collecting a commission of up to 30 percent on the sales of other companies in itsApp Store, a business that generates, according to some estimates,nearly $20 billiona year for Apple.\nMany companies that reach their customers through apps don\u2019t want to payApplea hefty cut, and they are increasingly fighting to change the rules. Apple argues that its commission rewards it for creating the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d of the App Store, and it is fighting to keep the status quo.\nBillions of dollars are at stake in one of the most consequential fights over the power of Big Tech.\nNot much. It agreed to keep its commission rates flat for three years and to continue to base search results in its App Store on \u201cobjective characteristics\u201d like downloads and user ratings, also for three years.\nAt a granular level, it said, it will let developers sell their apps at 500 different price points, up from 100. (For instance, now an app could charge $32.99 instead of $29.99 for a subscription.)\nAnd it agreed to create a $100 million fund for small app developers. (More on this later.)\nBut what is receiving the most attention is a \u201cclarification\u201d in Apple\u2019s rules: Companies can now send an email to customers telling them about ways to pay other than in their iPhone (or iPad) app.\nApple says so. But it appears to be a minor change to a set of rules that are at the center of complaints about how Apple controls its App Store.\nApple forces companies to use its payment system inside their iPhone apps, which enables it to collect its commission on their sales. Most companies would prefer to direct customers elsewhere to complete transactions so they can avoid Apple\u2019s fees. But Apple also generally bars companies from telling customers to pay elsewhere.\nApple has long banned such steering. It has also banned companies from even using emails to tell customers about other ways to pay if the companies got the customers\u2019 email addresses from their iPhone app.\nNow Apple is saying it is OK for companies to send such emails, if the companies get the customer\u2019s permission to do so.\nSome companies appear to have already been partly violating Apple\u2019s rules. To avoid Apple\u2019s commission, the music service Spotify, for instance, doesn\u2019t allow people to sign up for a subscription in its iPhone app. Still, after someone creates a free account in app, Spotify emails a link to its website, where it advertises its paid accounts, though the email doesn\u2019t explicitly tell users to circumvent Apple\u2019s commission.\nAn Apple spokesman said companies,including Spotify, had complained for years about Apple\u2019s restrictions on emailing certain customers.\nThere was tentative praise from some lawmakers who have proposed legislation to change App Store rules. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said on Twitter that the settlement \u201cmarks a significant step forward, but does not rectify the full & vivid range of market abuses & practices still widespread across app markets.\u201d\nThe biggest praise came from the App Association, an organization that claims to give \u201ca voice to small technology companies\u201d but isfunded by big technology companies, including Apple. \u201cOur members need Apple to continue to lead on privacy, security and safety to preserve the trust consumers have in platforms,\u201d the group said.\nMany companies that pay Apple\u2019s commission were not as kind. The Coalition for App Fairness, a group of firms fighting Apple\u2019s rules, said the settlement \u201cdoes nothing to address the structural, foundational problems facing all developers, large and small, undermining innovation and competition in the app ecosystem.\u201d The group added that Apple\u2019s restrictions on what companies could say in private communications with their customers illustrated Apple\u2019s inappropriate control over the app marketplace.\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson, an entrepreneur and app developer who is an outspoken critic of Apple\u2019s rules,said in a post on Fridaythat opening a narrow route for companies to steer customers toward other payment options only gives Apple cover to defend its ban on such communication in the places that matter, like the transaction page in an app.\n\u201cIf the developer community had any hopes riding on this class-actionlawsuit, this outcome would have been a dagger in the heart. Far worse than if no suit has been undertaken at all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf anything, this settlement cements the tremendous power that Apple has and wields. Even when a class-actionlawsuitgets underway, it can be bought with bromides and bribes.\u201d\nThere was a lot of confusion after the settlement was announced in part because of how Apple announced it. The company told reporters about an evening press briefing two hours before it was set to start and then posteda muddied news releasejust as the briefing was beginning.\nThat meant that as an Apple executive described the settlement as a win for developers, reporters were already rushing to tweet and file first drafts of articles. The incentives of digital news today reward those who are first, not those who are more nuanced or accurate. (An\u00a0Apple public-relations official required reporters to not name or quote the executive in order to hear the briefing.)\nAs a result, news headlines initially framed the change as a major avenue for companies to avoid Apple\u2019s commission. This was good for Apple, as any perception that it was making substantive changes to its App Store rules could help appease developers, the courts, regulators and lawmakers.\nIn reality, it appears that Apple has paid a small price to get rid of a potentially big legal headache.\nApple is still awaiting a decision from a federal judge in a separate lawsuit that was filed byEpic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite. Epic wants to force Apple to allow app developers to avoid App Store commissions altogether.\nThursday\u2019s settlement requires approval from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. She is also the arbiter in theEpic Gamescase.\nApple probably hopes that its rule change could help persuade Judge Rogers that it is meaningfully addressing developers\u2019 concerns. She said in May that she hoped to issue a ruling this month.\nApple is paying $100 million in the settlement. The company said it was not a legal payoff but rather \u201ca fund to assist small U.S. developers, particularly as the world continues to suffer from the effects of Covid-19.\u201d\nDevelopers are slated to get $70 million of the money. App makers that made less than $1 million a year in the App Store from June 2015 through April 2021 are eligible for payouts between $250 and $30,000 each.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are requesting the other $30 million.\nSteve Berman, one of the lawyers, said in an email that lawyers typically received 25 percent of such settlements, with more money possible if they secured other benefits for their clients. \u201cDue to the host of business changes that will aid developers, we think an upward adjustment is merited,\u201d he said."
