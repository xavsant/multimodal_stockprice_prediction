        "title": "Apple Moves Toward a Wireless Future, One Tweak at a Time",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Duringa two-hour product showcaseheld on Wednesday in one of rock music\u2019s most storied venues, Apple executives signaled that the company was heading toward a wireless future, where devices would connect without cables.\nA big step in that direction is the removal of a headphone jack from the latest version of the iPhone, called the iPhone 7.\nWhat was lacking in Apple\u2019s presentation, as has been the case for the Silicon Valley giant in recent years, was a new, can\u2019t-miss hit like the original iPod. There wasn\u2019t even a dramatic change to an old classic, like the bigger iPhones it introduced in 2014.\nBut if you like tweaks to products you may already have,Apple had plenty to offerat the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, a cavernous arena named for a famous music promoter that has hosted the likes of the Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan. The iPhone 7 includes a better camera and the bigger iPhone 7 Plus has a second high-end camera with a telephoto lens. It also has an improved home button that lets users perform different tasks by varying how hard they press it.\n\u201cBasically, Apple has shifted from one killer feature per upgrade, such as a larger screen, to a variety of compelling improvements that will appeal to a range of buyers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.\nFor more than a decade, Apple has experienced explosive revenue and earnings growth thanks to new hit products, including the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. That streak stopped with the release of the Apple Watch last year, though executives maintain that sales have exceeded expectations.\nApple\u2019s stock price is just about where it was a year ago, and this year the company has posted two consecutive quarters ofdeclining revenue. For the first time,iPhone revenue also dipped, as the global market for smartphones began to shrink and consumers began replacing their smartphones less frequently. Executives expect sales to fall again this quarter.\nBut there are probably plenty more dollars to be wrung from Apple\u2019s existing products. This update to the iPhone has been a cause for excitement \u2014 and controversy \u2014 among Apple fans.\nRemoving the port for headphones from the iPhone means they now connect only wirelessly or through a charging port. The redesign also encourages users to upgrade to Apple\u2019s new wireless earbuds, AirPods, which cost $160.\nWhile the updates to the iPhone were incremental, Apple executives hinted that the iPhone changes were part of a companywide effort to wirelessly connect everything inside a home. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained how his company\u2019s technology could be the central way to control all sorts of home wireless devices.\n\u201cThis is Apple\u2019s way of saying that someday the smartphone experience will be wireless,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. But will it be enough to reignite iPhone sales? \u201cNot by itself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this along with the other tech upgrades like cameras and processors should drive high interest for those needing to upgrade, as well as draw interest by new customers too.\u201d\nTalk about a wireless future had people already looking toward big changes that could be in store for next year, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and beyond. Mr. Bajarin, for example, expects Apple to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone in the near future. Should wireless connections become a bigger part of Apple\u2019s future, it is not a leap to imagine closer integration between the company\u2019s various devices and its software meant for cars, called CarPlay.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple has risked angering customers by moving away from a traditional design. Its desktop computers accommodated a 3\u00bd-inch disk, rather than the standard 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk; and more recently it eliminated the CD drive and several ports from its laptops. Some customers considered those changes shocking, even downright hostile acts. They got over it.\n\u201cApple has a history of doing what it wants and making people believe that it\u2019s the best idea ever,\u201d said Julie A. Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThe company has an affluent customer base that has in the past paid to upgrade because it cares about the quality of the experience.\u201d\nOther cosmetic changes were made to the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which look much like their predecessors and will have starting prices of $650 and $770. The phones will come in new colors, including a shiny, jet black and matte black, in addition to the existing options of silver, gold and rose gold.\nApple also unveiled an updated version of the Apple Watch that includes GPS tracking, which would make it more appealing to runners. It has a faster operating system that lets apps work more quickly and could make performing some tasks easier on the watch than on an iPhone. The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $370. And the original Apple Watch, rebranded Apple Watch Series 1, starts at $270.\nThe company emphasized that the Apple Watch was a useful tool for monitoring health, one of the few functions that users have embraced, and announced a partnership with Nike. It also made the new version water-resistant and added tracking for swimmers.\n\u201cThe watch is still missing a killer app,\u201d Ms. Ask said, noting that some of the functions that the Apple Watch performs especially well, such as payments, have not taken off.\nThe Apple Watch still accounts for such a tiny portion of the company\u2019s revenue that Apple doesn\u2019t break out the number when it reports quarterly earnings. But Mr. Cook revealed on Wednesday that Apple was now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex, and that Apple\u2019s was the top-selling smartwatch.\nThe overall market for wearable devices is growing. In the United States, 63.7 million adults, or about a quarter of the population, use a wearable device. That number is expected to increase by more than 17 percent next year to 74.8 million adults, according to the research firm eMarketer.\nApple has grown increasingly dependent on software and services for growth. On earnings calls with analysts, the company has emphasized the role that software and services play in keeping customers hooked on Apple\u2019s products. Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, estimates that services such as Apple Music account for nearly one-third of Apple\u2019s quarterly profits.\nMr. Cook underscored that idea at the event with updates on Apple Music and the App Store. Mr. Cook said that Apple Music had 17 million subscribers and that the company would work to nail down more exclusive deals with artists. He also said that the hit game Super Mario would come to the App Store and that Pok\u00e9mon Go would be available on the Apple Watch."

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Paul\u2019s Week in Tech: Apple\u2019s China Conundrum and Samsung\u2019s Recall Conundrum",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike is off this week, so Paul Mozur, the Times\u2019s Asia technology correspondent, stepped in.\nFarhad: How\u2019s it going, Paul! Mike is blessedly on vacation this week, so I get the pleasure of chatting with you. Thank you for turning what\u2019s normally the worst part of my week into the best.\nPaul: Happy to pitch in. Though it\u2019s hard to know what counts as pleasure for a man who I just discovereddoesn\u2019t like \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d?\nFarhad: You know what I\u2019ve been really getting into lately? \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d It\u2019s so good! But that\u2019s for another time.\nSo you\u2019re visiting San Francisco this week from Hong Kong, where you cover the tech business across Asia. But before we move to Asian tech, let\u2019s start by talking about things closer at hand. In other words, Apple.\nReviews of the new iPhone, the 7 and 7 Plus, and the new Apple Watch came out, and they were mostly positive. My own take: The lack of a headphone jack on the new iPhone isn\u2019t a huge problem, the new wireless headphones are interesting but kind of weird, and the new watch is slightly better than the old one, but nothing most people need just yet.\nBut who cares what I think. Increasingly what matters for Apple is what the people in China think of its phones. China had been a huge growth area for Apple, but in the last year things began to slide. Apple has alsohad more trouble with Chinese regulatorsas it has become a bigger force in the Chinese tech industry. What\u2019s going on? Are the Chinese still in love with iPhones?\nPaul: I do think the Chinese are still in love with the iPhone, but as with any relationship that goes on long enough, some of the thrill has gone. The main problem Apple is facing at the moment is a slew of Chinese competitors that make high-quality phones. Some fans are being led astray, and it\u2019s up to Apple to catch their eye again. Given the new version of the iPhone doesn\u2019t boast any conspicuous upgrades, it could be that Apple\u2019ssagging fortunes in China continuein the short term.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean Apple has lost its hold on the market. In covering Apple\u2019s most recentslowdown in China, I was reminded of a similar piece I wrote in2012when Apple was struggling to compete with Samsung\u2019s phones that had larger screens. Apple has recovered from lulls in China in the past, and could again.\nChinese consumers crave not only what\u2019s new, but also what stands out as new. Apple still very much has a hold on the Chinese consumer, but many may well wait another year to see what Apple does for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, when there may be more of a wow factor.\nThat said, a part of me thinks the new wireless headphones could be a hit in China. More so than a new iPhone, they broadcast that a user is willing to drop a solid chunk of change to keep up on tech trends. That formula has worked well for Apple in the past in China, though it would have helped if they made the AirPods in gold and rose gold options.\nFarhad: Oh, I bet rose gold AirPods are coming. Put me down for none.\nOther tech news this week involved cars. Uber began rolling out its self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. (Mikegot to ride in one!)\nSilicon Valley\u2019s other big car start-up, Tesla, experienced more bad news. Not only did I throw shade on its prospectsin my column this week, but anotherreport of a malfunction with its Autopilot driving system came in from China. According to a report from the Chinese government news channel CCTV, the car\u2019s self-driving system failed to stop as the vehicle approached a street sweeper, resulting in the death of the driver.\nThis got me thinking about the car business in China. Every American tech company sees China as a huge market, but the transportation companies are especially interested. Uber spent billions trying to break in there beforeselling its operations to the local competitor, Didi Chuxing, in which Uber will now have a stake.\nWhat else is going on in Chinese transportation business that you think Americans should know about?\nPaul: It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s now a safe way to have Mike behind the wheel. The first thing to realize is driving conditions in China are very different from America. In China, most traffic laws are taken as suggestions (cars blithely reverse down highways when they miss exits and occasionally use sidewalks as an extra lane) and on highways, slow moving, big vehicles like that street sweeper are not uncommon.\nAll of that means we will probably see more tech failures as autonomous driving technology starts to be used more frequently on both sides of the Pacific. In China, Baidu and LeEco are both working on driverless technology. The companies will probably be helped by the fact that the Chinese government wants to see them succeed and has proved quiteproactive in giving them a lift. Baidu already has regulatory buy-in to try out its technology on bus routes.\nI do also think we could see some political issues crop up as the technology is more widely used. The Chinese government will want to give its local companies a leg up and it has also been uncomfortable letting foreign companies collect data within China and beam it elsewhere, so it could be we see some roadblocks go up to foreign autonomous driving technology down the line.\nFarhad: Finally, one of the biggest tech stories this week is about the Korean tech giant Samsung, whose Galaxy Note 7 smartphone descended further into infamy when the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a formal recall on Thursday.\nThecommission saidSamsung has received 92 reports of batteries overheating in the United States, among them \u201c26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage, including fires in cars and a garage.\u201d\nThe formal recall comes a couple weeks after Samsung issued its own recall. But the company has been criticized for the wayit has bungled the process. The whole incident seems like a terrible blow to its reputation, which had recently been on the upswing after the company released a slate of well-reviewed phones.\nSo, what do you think? How bad is this for Samsung?\nPaul: It can\u2019t be good when planes across the world are reminding passengers that Samsung\u2019s phones can spontaneously detonate. It\u2019s a major blow, and one that probably hit some of the company\u2019s most loyal customers who would be the first to buy the new phones.\nThe bungled recall probably hints at a broader issue for Samsung. There\u2019s no real parallel in America that can illustrate just how influential Samsung is in South Korea. It\u2019s responsible for something like 20 percent of the country\u2019s exports, and that has helped it get a pass from both media and regulators in the past. The most galling example of this was when the company\u2019s former chairman waspardoned by South Korea\u2019s presidentin 2009 after he was convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement.\nOne has to wonder how much the coddling Samsung gets at home is to blame for the company\u2019s bumbling response to this battery problem. Our co-worker Brian X. Chen found the company was also pretty incompetent when hisSamsung oven broke, sending a technician seven times before ultimately replacing it.\nSamsung is much bigger than the electronics it sells to consumers. It makes microchips, screens, memory and all manner of components. It will have little trouble paying thelikely $1 billion price tagfor the recall. And its reputation will survive. Given that, the biggest question is does it learn from this?\nThere was an editorial in the Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, faulting Samsung for the technological mistakes that led to this issue. Certainly that matters, but it seems a bit beside the point. With the supply chain as complex as it is, mistakes will occasionally happen. The thing that Samsung can control, and should do better at, is communicating with its customers.\nFarhad: Right. I\u2019m curious to see if this incident changes their approach to problems. Also, I\u2019m now very scared that all our phones and laptops are hazards waiting to go off.\nSo anyway \u2026 have a good flight back!\nPaul: Thanks for playing right into my neuroses about flying."

        "title": "Whom to Vote For? Employees Tend to Follow Their Leader",
        "fulltext": "Late last month, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hosteda private fund-raiserfor Hillary Clinton in Los Altos, Calif., along with his colleague Lisa Jackson, vice president of Apple\u2019s environmental, policy and social initiatives. The private, off-the-record event required a donation of $2,700 to $50,000.\nWhile Mr. Cook\u2019s role was as a private citizen \u2014 it was not an Apple event \u2014 the message to employees about whom he is supporting for president is clear.\nThe influence of chief executives like Mr. Cook over employees\u2019 political leanings and donations, intentional or not, is substantial: It may not be an overstatement to suggest that a chief executive\u2019s politics may be one of the most significant factors in swaying how employees think about elections.\nThe results of anew academic studylooking at the power of chief executives over the politics of their employees is stunning and perhaps unsettling.\nThree business professors set out to examine \u201chow the political preferences of C.E.O.s affect their employees\u2019 campaign contributions and electoral choices.\u201d The results of the study, which looked at eight federal election cycles from 1999 to 2014 and over 2,000 companies, showed a statistically significant correlation among campaign contributions made by the chief and his or her employees as well as voter turnout. The study found that \u201cemployees direct approximately three times more of their campaign contributions to political candidates supported by their firm\u2019s C.E.O. than to otherwise similar candidates.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, C.E.O.s and employees donate along similar party lines because they share common values and interest,\u201d think again.\nThe study uncovered patterns that show a chief executive\u2019s influence is profound: \u201cWhen a new C.E.O. contributes to different political candidates from the ones supported by the prior C.E.O., employees tend to follow his/her lead and redirect their donations as well,\u201d wrote the professors, Ilona Babenko of Arizona State University, Viktar Fedaseyeu of Bocconi University in Italy and Song Zhang of the University of Lugano in Switzerland.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong, in most cases, with a chief executive or employee raising money for a particular candidate or party. Mr. Cook, it is worth noting, gives to both sides of the aisle, having just hosted a separate fund-raiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan in June.\nBut the influence of a boss\u2019s political leanings should not be underestimated. \u201cOur evidence indicates that C.E.O.s are a political force, with potentially important implications for firms they manage and for the nature of democracy,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe welfare implications depend both on whether C.E.O.s promote their own political agenda or act in the interests of their firms, and on whether the interests of the firm coincide with the interests of its employees.\u201d\nSome C.E.O.s don\u2019t just lead by example; they actively solicit donations from their own employees for candidates and company-sponsored political action committees, which can create its own thicket of ethical questions. The Federal Election Commission, for example, investigated the way Robert Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy, had solicited political donations from his employees through emails and internal videos. Some employeestold The New Republicthat they felt pressured to donate, fearing that not to do so might risk their jobs.The Federal Election Commission, ultimately, found Mr. Murray hadn\u2019t broken any laws.\nStill, the risks \u2013 and complex set of election laws \u2013 make political fund-raising a complicated endeavor for those in the corner office. \u201cThe potentially coercive effect of an employer\u2019s solicitation counsels in favor of avoiding the situation altogether,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cThe logical alternative \u2014 having a very strong and clear disclaimer \u2014 doesn\u2019t really work, since many employees might not believe the disclaimer, no matter how strongly it is worded.\u201d\nTony Fratto, a former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush who now operates a consulting firm, Hamilton Place, took issue with the idea that C.E.O.s should remain outside the political campaign arena.\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some employees feel pressure to align with the C.E.O. politically, but my experience is that in most cases both C.E.O.s and employees are overwhelmingly influenced by a candidate\u2019s views or voting record on industry issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage firms to do more to inform their employees at all levels about what political leaders\u2019 records are on their key policies. I actually think that doesn\u2019t happen enough.\u201d\nAlexander Hertel-Fernandez, a professor at Columbia University,found in his own surveythat \u201ca quarter of employees reported that their bosses have tried to engage them in politics,\u201d but reported that \u201cabout 7 percent of employees reported clearly coercive kinds of political contact at work \u2013 messages that made workers uncomfortable or included threats of plant closures, cuts in hours or layoffs.\u201d\nThis election cycle, it seems that many C.E.O.s, especially on Wall Street, have chosen to be less public about whom they are supporting in the presidential race. Perhaps because of the lingering negative memories of the financial crisis or perhaps because this presidential election has turned so decidedly nasty, many executives have stayed on the sideline. In June, Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, canceled an event at his home for Donald Trump after it was reported to be causing a firestorm among Intel employees and peers in Silicon Valley that felt Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were damaging to the industry. Mr. Krzanich later said he canceled the event because it had turned into a fund-raiser without his approval. \u201cI do not intend to endorse any presidential candidate. We are interested in engaging both campaigns in open dialogue on issues in technology,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nWhen it comes to presidential politics, some executives privately say they worry they could see reprisals against their business or industry if they were to actively campaign for one candidate or another.\n\u201cThe risk of being on the record publicly against a politician is high, particularly if that politician may take retaliatory action,\u201d said Brian Richter, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\nThat didn\u2019t stop 150 technology executives fromwriting an open letterin July opposing Trump\u2019s policies. The list of signatories included the leaders of Silicon Valley darlings like Slack and Box but notably was not signed by the current leaders of Google, Apple or Facebook, which typically face the most regulatory scrutiny.\nClearly the influence of C.E.O.s and other senior executives\u2019 political preferences on the people working for them deserves more scrutiny. In the meantime, while it is hard to know how individuals will ultimately vote when they pull the lever in November, perhaps a new election polling data point should be the preferences of their bosses."

        "title": "Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars, just as other big tech companies appear ready to plow ahead with competing efforts.\nIn a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.\nThe job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple\u2019s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project \u2014 code-named Titan \u2014 over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort.\nApple is not the only big tech company pursuing autonomous driving technology. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has tested self-driving cars on the road for years, but its focus has been on designing the underlying software and systems to make that technology work. Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use.\nSeparately, Uber, in a limited test in Pittsburgh next week, plans to start picking up passengers in self-driving cars. Last month, Uber also acquired the start-up Otto for about $700 million, a purchase that brought with it some of the top minds in robotics and autonomous technology.\nAnd automakers like Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less.\nBut Apple has stood out from the others mainly \u2014 as is often the case with the company \u2014 for its secrecy. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car, though Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the automotive industry is undergoing a drastic change and, earlier this year, he seemed to confirm the existence of the car project at its annual shareholders meeting.\n\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201d\nApple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nUnder Mr. Mansfield, Apple changed the focus of the project, shifting from an emphasis on designing and producing an automobile to building out the underlying technology for an autonomous vehicle. Bloomberg earlierreported the strategy change.\nElectric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but on technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership.\nApple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.\nThe team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.\nSteven Zadesky, a longtime Apple employee initially charged with heading the car effort, left the company for personal reasons this year. His departure opened the door for Mr. Mansfield, who worked closely with Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, but left the company\u2019s executive team in 2013.\nHe had all but retired from Apple except for the occasional visit to the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. He was coaxed into coming back to oversee the project, which could represent a new market for Apple as sales of its flagship iPhone are slowing.\nApple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added."

        "title": "Samsung to Recall 2.5 Million Galaxy Note 7s Over Battery Fires",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 A ubiquitous source of power in most modern technology, lithium-ion batteries keep cellphones, laptops, electric cars and airplanes running. They are also the source of many problems, with some overheating, catching fire and even exploding.\nIn a potentially damaging episode, Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones, announced on Friday that it would recall its Galaxy Note 7 model after discovering a flaw in the battery cell that could result in fires. The company will replace 2.5 million phones sent to stores and consumers, in one of the industry\u2019s largest recalls.\nThe recall puts Samsung, which has been trying to match the success of the Apple iPhone, in a precarious position.\nThe smartphone industry is grappling with slowing demand and intense competition. Samsung was regaining swagger with its high-end phone models, like the Note 7, in which the screens appear to spill off the side.\nBut the battery fires threaten to undermine Samsung\u2019s efforts, giving an edge to Apple. The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone.\nThe ultimate scale of the damage to Samsung\u2019s reputation and finances will depend on how quickly the company deals with the issues and how costly they turn out to be. Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products.\nSamsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall.\n\u201cIf you look at previous instances in tech history where there have been recalls, as long as it doesn\u2019t drag on to the point that the company becomes the butt of a joke, then it should be minor,\u201d said Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm.\n\u201cIf it becomes like a Pinto, where you don\u2019t want to buy it because it explodes, that would be a bad situation,\u201d he said, referring to the 1971 Ford car that became famous for erupting in flames after rear-end collisions. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll get past it.\u201d\nSamsung said that, so far, 35 battery episodes involving the Note 7 had been registered. Reports of the problem first started to emerge online, as consumers posted photographs and videos of the charred remains of phones they said had burst into flames, usually while being recharged.\nIn one video, a customer shows a half-melted phone, and explains: \u201cCame home after work, put it to charge for a little bit before I had class, went to put it on my waist, and it caught fire. Yep, brand new phone, not even two weeks old.\u201d\nSamsung said it thought the problem came from a \u201cminute flaw\u201d in the production of the batteries. Samsung would not name the supplier involved.\nThe recall covers 10 countries where the phones have been sold. Samsung said the recall would not affect China, since the models sold there used a battery from a different supplier.\n\u201cWe acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market, but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest-quality products to our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.\u201d\nThe recall is a major blow to Samsung, which had just started to regain its competitive footing. The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end.\nSamsung was gaining traction with the latest Galaxy phones. The phones\u2019 smooth, tapered edges, which make them more comfortable to hold, have been a hit with consumers.\nIn the second quarter, Samsung\u2019s global smartphone sales rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier while Apple\u2019s fell 15 percent, giving Samsung 22.4 percent of the market compared to Apple\u2019s 11.8 percent, according to IDC. While some of that growth came from Samsung\u2019s lower-end phones, IDC said that a significant part had also come from new demand for its higher-end phones, which contributed a disproportionate amount of profit.\nIn a year that Samsung originally warned could be tough, the company has performed surprisingly well. In the most recent second quarter, the company said itsoperating profit rose15 percent from a year earlier, to about $7 billion.\nSamsung had high expectations for the latest Galaxy phone, which was released last month, to help continue the momentum.\nThe Note 7 is 5.7 inches from corner to corner, making it a large phone sometimes referred to as a phablet \u2014 a combination of phone and tablet. It sells in the United States for about $900 to $1,000 without subsidies from a wireless carrier.\nThe phones were released just ahead of Apple\u2019s traditional release time in autumn, before the important holiday shopping season. Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7. With the new iPhone, Apple is expected to make major upgrades to both the hardware and software, as it generally does every two years.\n\u201cYou have to applaud Samsung for moving quickly,\u201d said Ben Wood, mobile analyst at CCS Insight in Berlin. \u201cBut they can\u2019t afford to miss the run up to the holiday season, so they have to fix this problem fast.\u201d\nLightweight and powerful, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for technology, since they don\u2019t take up much room and can quickly recharge repeatedly without wearing out. But they are also far from perfect.\nThe batteries, which include volatile and flammable chemical compounds, can become unstable if overheated or punctured. If that happens, the battery can burst into flames or explode.\nDell in 2006 recalled more than four million batteries for its notebook computers. American aviation authorities in 2013 reviewed the design of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner aftera number of incidentsinvolving lithium-ion batteries and the plane\u2019s electrical system. Tesla in 2014 had to reinforce the area protecting the batteries in its Model S after it became apparent that road debris striking the bottom of the carcould cause a fire.\nMore recently, battery problems have cropped up with increasing frequency among lower-end devices. In America, airline companies began banning hoverboards from flights after it became apparent that some of the products would occasionally burst into flames. There have also been increased reports of e-cigarette batteries spontaneously detonating.\nAnalysts, in part, attribute the issues to the low standards and few regulations in the global electronics supply chain that sprawls across China. As smaller Chinese companies have jumped at opportunities to make their own devices, some have cut corners, leading to a number of problems, including the occasionally combusting battery.\nFor Samsung, the recall strikes at the heart of what has long been considered its greatest strength: its management of the supply chain.\nSamsung owns the facilities that produce many of the components in its smartphones \u2014 including screens, chips and batteries. The system allows it to keep closer tabs on production.\nYet much like Apple, Samsung also manages a large network of suppliers.\nThat means it must coordinate the production of a high number of parts that come from factories in disparate places run on tight margins. It must also double-check the quality of each product, which can be exceptionally challenging given that production processes are complex and factories are sometimes known to sacrifice quality for profit.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is this comes from Samsung, who have such prowess and competence in manufacturing and supply chain,\u201d Mr. Ma of IDC said. \u201cYou would think this wouldn\u2019t happen to a company like that, but somehow it slipped through.\u201d"

Most economists expect the central bank to maintain its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has beensince March. It is charging a negative interest rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank, to encourage banks to lend that money rather than hold it.\nSome investors expect the central bank to announce an extension of its stimulus program to purchase 80 billion euros, or about $89 billion, a month in bonds. The bond buying program, known as quantitative easing, is currently meant to end in March. The meeting comes as the bank has faced increasingcriticism over its monetary policyin recent months, particularly in Germany, where historically low interest rates have hurt savers and pension investments.Chad Bray"

        "title": "Apple Is Said to Be Talking to Vehicle Technology Companies",
        "fulltext": "Apple, whichlaid off dozens of employeesfrom its secretive car project this month, is increasingly seeking help from outside companies with expertise in vehicles.\nThe tech giant has been talking with McLaren, the automaker known for its Formula One racecars, about an investment in the company, according to two people briefed on the talks who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions were confidential.\nApple is also in talks with Lit Motors, a San Francisco start-up that has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, about a potential acquisition, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Apple has already hired several former Lit Motors engineers.\nEven as many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Tesla and Uber, have embarked on electric and driverless car initiatives, Apple has kept quiet. Yet internally, it has pursued a car project, called Project Titan, which has had ups and downs in leadership and direction. The layoffs at the project this month came after the appointment of an Apple veteran, Bob Mansfield, to take over the effort.\nInside Apple, employees recently described the company\u2019s efforts to build a car as a project lacking vision and in complete disarray. The recent layoffs, followed by Apple\u2019s pursuit of talent and expertise from outside companies, are part of the company\u2019s effort to \u201creboot\u201d the project, said people with knowledge of the layoffs.\nApple is trying to revise its approach to making a car at a time when technology companies are accelerating efforts to bring self-driving cars to the mainstream. This month, Uber started its pilot program fordriverless cars in Pittsburgh, giving customers a chance to summon an autonomous Uber for the first time.\nThe self-driving car movement also gained a powerful ally this week: the government. Federal auto safety regulators on Mondayissued guidelinesoutlining expectations for safety and how the technology could be used in cars.\nApple declined to comment, as did Lit Motors. Wayne Bruce, a spokesman for McLaren, said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cnot in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201d\nBut McLaren did not deny having had conversations with Apple. In a phone call, Mr. Bruce added: \u201cThe nature of our business means we regularly have conversations with all sorts of parties, but those conversations remain confidential. We\u2019re not in a position to confirm or deny any previous conversation.\u201d\nThe Financial Timesearlier reportedthe talks with McLaren.\nA partnership with McLaren would allow Apple to tap into the carmaker\u2019s high-end automotive technology, forged by years of building Formula One racecars and selling sports cars topping $1 million.\nFor years, McLaren has been recognized as an innovator in automotive technology. As one example, the company pioneered the use of a single device to control a car\u2019s engine, transmission and electrical systems.\nMcLaren also invented a simulator for designing and testing Formula One cars, atechnology that it recently beganmarketing to mainstream automakers.\nMcLaren\u2019s sales are steadily growing, but the company\u2019s bet on research took a bite from its profit. In 2015, McLaren, which is backed by private shareholders, sold 1,654 cars, five more than the year before. Its profit slid 64 percent to about $7 million, from $19.4 million in 2014, in part because of increased spending on research.\nUnlike a more traditional automaker, McLaren does not have a large car production business to protect and could tap Apple\u2019s resources to make its technology available to the masses \u2014 if Apple decides to move forward with building its own automobile.\nAn acquisition of Lit Motors could also help Apple rethink its strategy with building an electric car and bring engineering talent into the company.\nFor years, Lit Motors has worked on the C-1,an electric motorcyclethat relies on two large gyroscopes, which prevent it from tipping over. The two-wheeler was designed to have the efficiency of a bicycle and motorcycle but the safety of a car.\nWhen Lit Motors announced the C-1 in 2012, it planned to sell the vehicle for $24,000. The start-up\u2019s plans stalled after its chief executive, Daniel Kim, was involved in amotorcycle crash on a racetracklast year, rendering him immobile for six months.\nLast month, Uber bolstered its autonomous car project with theacquisition of another San Francisco start-up, Otto, which was focused on self-driving trucks. Anthony Levandowski, the chief executive of Otto, who once worked on Google\u2019s self-driving cars, is now heading Uber\u2019s autonomous driving effort."

        "fulltext": "Here\u2019s what to expect in the week ahead:\nECONOMY\nMany American families are still living on less money than before the Great Recession, but the Census Bureau on Tuesday is expected to report that incomes are rising. Themedian household income in 2014was $53,657, about $4,000 below the pre-recession median after adjusting for inflation. Economists expect the government to report that gap narrowed significantly in 2015. The government will also update its estimates of the share of Americans living in poverty and the share who have health insurance coverage. Taken together, the new data is expected to show that more Americans are benefiting from one of the longest periods of economic growth in the nation\u2019s history \u2014 and also to serve as a reminder that the recovery remains incomplete.Binyamin Appelbaum\nTECHNOLOGY\nEuropean officials will unveil new technology rules on Wednesday aimed at reining in many of the world\u2019s largest companies.

The situation has, if anything,worsenedas Mr. Juncker prepares to deliver an annual State of the Union speech on Wednesday. Most of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states have barely started to carry out Mr. Juncker\u2019s plan to share the burden of the region\u2019s influx of migrants, and a majority of Britons voted in a referendum in June to exit the European Union. Mr. Juncker, right, has also faced an outcry from lawmakers and consumer groups who said a flagship plan tolower cellphone chargesfor people using their phones outside their home country did not do enough to reduce costs. In his speech, Mr. Juncker may seek to emphasize what the bloc still can do to boost Europe\u2019s lackluster economy and to tackle the scourge ofhigh youth unemploymentby redoubling calls for less austerity economics and greater investment. Mr. Juncker could also call for greater European Union cooperation on defense now that Britain, long skeptical about such an initiative, plans to leave the bloc.James Kanter\nECONOMY\nThe Commerce Department will report retail sales data on Thursday, as stores around the country continue to push back-to-school sales and promotions for the fall.

Retail sales wereflat in July.Rachel Abrams\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates steady when it announces its latest decision on rates on Thursday, but it may signal a need for a further cut in November when it provides an update on its outlook for inflation. In August, the central bankcut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain\u2019s economy over fears that the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union could weigh on growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009.\nBetter-than-expected economic data in the last week or so bolstered the pound against the dollar and has raised questions about whether the Bank of England was too dire in its warnings about the potential impact on the British economy before the referendum in June on whether to leave the European Union. At a committee hearing in Parliament last week, Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor,said he was \u201ccomfortable\u201dwith the analysis taken by the central bank ahead of the vote and the actions it has taken since then.Chad Bray\nTECHNOLOGY\nPreorders for Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus began on Friday and the devices will be available at Apple stores and carrier retail locations in more than 25 countries this coming Friday.

At 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will announce the latest data on theConsumer Price Indexfor the month of August. The index is expected to show an overall increase of 0.1 percent, with the so-called core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rising by 0.2 percent. While the reading is expected to be tame, traders will be focusing on this month\u2019s data more than usual ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019sdecision on whether to raise interest rateson Sept. 21. A stronger reading on inflation could bolster the arguments of policy makers who want to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nAt 10 a.m., the University of Michigan will release its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in September. Economists expect an increase in the index to 91 from89.8 in August, with consumer optimism buoyed by steady hiring, a strong stock market and low energy prices.Nelson D. Schwartz"

        "title": "Tim Cook, Apple Chief, Defends Tax Practices and Says Cash Will Return to U.S.",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s chief executive on Thursday stepped up the outrage over Europe\u2019s demandsthat it pay a record $14.5 billionin unpaid taxes, calling the decision \u201cmaddening\u201d and expressing confidence it would be overturned.\nTimothy D. Cook, the Apple chief, stridently defended the company\u2019s tax practices in Ireland, countering European officials\u2019 ruling this week that the Irish government had provided illegal incentives, which allowed the technology giant to pay essentially nothing some years. Inan interviewwith the Irish broadcaster RTE, Mr. Cook said the companypaid its fair sharein Ireland, the United States and elsewhere.\nMr. Cook also noted that Apple planned to send some of its enormous amount of cash overseas back to the United States next year, although he did not specify how much. Those international reserves have beenparticularly divisiveas they remain out of the reach of American tax authorities.\n\u201cThe finding is wrongheaded,\u201d Mr. Cook told RTE. \u201cIt\u2019s not true \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cWhen you\u2019re accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you.\u201d\nThe Apple case hasstirred up tensions, pitting the United States against Europe.\nIn announcing the tax decision on Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said Apple\u2019s sweetheart deals with the Irish government allowed the company to sidestep taxes by moving profits to a \u201chead office\u201d with \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201d The company paid just 50 euros, or $56 at current exchange rates, in taxes for every million euros in profit in 2014, she said.\nAfter Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism, she denied any political motivation, saying the decision was based on longstanding laws that prohibit member states from giving selected companies favorable treatment. The case, she said, would stand up in court.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the courts will hear any kind of political opinions or feeling or what\u2019s in your stomach or whatever,\u201d she said at a briefing in Brussels. \u201cThey want the facts of the case, and that, of course, is what we have to produce.\u201d\nAmerican lawmakers and officials are firm that the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, does not have the right to go after Apple in this way. American officials said such moves by Europe undermined efforts to collect taxes in the United States, which has been eyeing companies\u2019 overseas cash, including Apple\u2019s $215 billion stockpile.\nIn the past, Apple has dangled the prospect of bringing back its cash if American authorities offered a tax break. Mr. Cook, in the interview on Thursday, did not say whether the so-called repatriation of such funds would hinge on changes to American tax law.\nIn regard to the European case, Mr. Cook said Apple would set aside funds \u2014 based on the calculations of back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account should it lose its appeal. Europe has ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or $14.5 billion, plus interest.\nStill, Mr. Cook, like American officials, took issue with Europe\u2019s retroactively issuing penalties. He said that while it was legitimate to discuss whether Apple paid sufficient tax on its global operations, it was unfair to recoup funds on past activities in Ireland.\n\u201cThe European Commission\u2019s overreach in this regard is unbelievable to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing a sports game or winning a championship, and then later finding out the goals are subsequently treated differently.\u201d"
