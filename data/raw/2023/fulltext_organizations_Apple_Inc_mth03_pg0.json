        "title": "At Apple, Rare Dissent Over a New Product: Interactive Goggles",
        "fulltext": "When Apple held a corporate retreat in California\u2019s Carmel Valley about five years ago to discuss its next major product, Jony Ive, its longtime design chief, captivated a room of the company\u2019s 100 top executives with a concept video as polished as an Apple commercial.\nThe video showed a man in a London taxi donning an augmented reality headset and calling his wife in San Francisco. \u201cWould you like to come to London?\u201d he asked, two people who saw the video said. Soon, the couple were sharing the sights of London through the husband\u2019s eyes.\nThe video excited executives about the possibilities of Apple\u2019s next business-altering device: a headset that would blend the digital world with the real one.\nBut now, as the company prepares to introduce the headset in June, enthusiasm at Apple has given way to skepticism, said eight current and former employees, who requested anonymity because of Apple\u2019s policies against speaking about future products. There are concerns about the device\u2019s roughly $3,000 price, doubts about its utility and worries about its unproven market.\nThat dissension has been a surprising change inside a company where employees have built devices \u2014 from the iPod to the Apple Watch \u2014 with the single-mindedness of a moon mission.\nSome employees have defected from the project because of their doubts about its potential, three people with knowledge of the moves said. Others have been fired over the lack of progress with some aspects of the headset, including its use of Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant, one person said.\nEven leaders at Apple have questioned the product\u2019s prospects. It has been developed at a time when morale has been strained by a wave of departures from the company\u2019s design team, including Mr. Ive, wholeft Apple in 2019 and stopped advising the company last year.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans for future products.\nApple\u2019s headset is considered a bellwether for virtual and augmented reality. For more than a decade, tech leaders have been hyping it as the next wave of computing after the smartphone. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook,tolduniversity students last year that in the near future \u201cyou\u2019ll wonder how you lived your life without augmented reality, just like today you wonder: How did people like me grow up without the internet?\u201d\nBut the road to deliver augmented reality has been littered with failures, false starts and disappointments, fromGoogle GlasstoMagic Leapand from Microsoft\u2019sHoloLensto Meta\u2019sQuest Pro. Apple is considered a potential savior because of its success combining new hardware and software to create revolutionary devices. Still, the challenges are daunting.\nMeta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has plowed billions of dollars into trying to build a virtual reality business. The experience has been humbling. It has soldabout 20 million of its $400 Quest 2headsets since 2020 and recently cut the price of the Quest Pro, its premium device, to $1,000 from $1,500 amid lackluster sales.\nBy comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million iPhones annually with an average selling price of more than $800.\nUnlike the iPhone, which incorporated many existing technologies, virtual reality is requiring Apple and others to design new chips and wearable displays, said Matthew Ball, author of \u201cThe Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything.\u201d \u201cThe difficulty of the problem has been far greater than anyone expected,\u201d he added.\nUncertainty about the potential of Apple\u2019s project has led some people who have worked on it to speculate that the company could delay its release, especially in light of the shaky economy, these people said. The company has postponed other new products in the past, including AirTags, the coin-size location tracking devices, which Apple withheld for more than a year as it addressed privacy issues. But at this point, headset manufacturing is underway for a planned reveal in June, the people said.\nApple is projected to ship fewer than 500,000 headsets in a year, according to Counterpoint Research, a market research firm. By comparison, the company was expected to ship about 40 million Apple Watches after its debut. The modest expectations for the headset speak to the challenges in a category where sales declined 12 percent last year to $1.1 billion, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.\nSeeking to define a nascent market is an aberration for Apple.\n\u201cApple is always pretty good at coming into a market when the market is already established and changing that market,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cThis is not the case for Apple VR and XR. There\u2019s still a lot of learning.\u201d\nSome internal skeptics have questioned if the new device is a solution in search of a problem. Unlike the iPod, which put digital songs in people\u2019s pockets, and the iPhone, which combined the abilities of a music player and a phone, the headset hasn\u2019t been driven by the same clarity, these people said.\nThe product is being birthed during a period of limbo. This year, Mr. Ive\u2019s successor overseeing industrial design, Evans Hankey, departed. With design\u2019s leadership in flux, Mike Rockwell, an engineer, has been leading development of the device.\nThe headset looks like ski goggles. It features a carbon fiber frame, a hip pack with battery support, outward cameras to capture the real world and two 4K displays that can render everything from applications to movies, two of the people said. Users can turn a \u201creality dial\u201d on the device to increase or decrease real-time video from the world around them.\nThe New York Timeshas previously reported on some features, as haveBloombergandThe Information.\nThe headset is expected to cost about $3,000, three of the people said. And it is considered a bridge to a future product, such as augmented reality glasses, that would have broader appeal but require technical breakthroughs.\nBecause the headset won\u2019t fit over glasses, the company has plans to sell prescription lenses for the displays to people who don\u2019t wear contacts, a person familiar with the plan said.\nDuring the device\u2019s development, Apple has focused on making it excel for videoconferencing and spending time with others as avatars in a virtual world. The company has called the device\u2019s signature application \u201ccopresence,\u201d a word designed to capture the experience of sharing a real or virtual space with someone in another place. It is akin to what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, calls the \u201cmetaverse.\u201d\nThe device will double as a tool for artists, designers and engineers, tracking them as they draw freely in space in image-editing applications and tracking hand gestures for the editing of virtual reality films. Lastly, it will function as a high-resolution TV withcustom-made video contentfrom Hollywood filmmakers such as Jon Favreau, the director of \u201cIron Man.\u201d\nApple is expected to pitch its device as something different from those that Meta has introduced. During an interview last yearwith the Dutch publication Bright, Mr. Cook said he avoided using the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d because it was foreign to the average person.\nThe headset\u2019s price and applications suggest that it will appeal more to businesses such as design firms than to many of the one billion iPhone owners. Apple has enriched itself by selling expensive smartphones but always balanced price with utility.\nMr. Ball, the author of \u201cThe Metaverse,\u201d compared the company\u2019s strategy with this device to Tesla\u2019s strategy with the Roadster, its initial $100,000 electric vehicle. Eventually, Tesla followed it with lower-priced cars with broader appeal.\nMs. Milanesi said Apple\u2019s experimental approach with the goggles appeared to be more like its execution of the Apple Watch than its introduction of the iPhone. Apple initially portrayed the watch as a miniature extension of an iPhone. After learning what consumers were doing with the watch, the company marketed it more as a fitness accessory akin to a Fitbit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very Apple-like,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cBut Apple is a very, very different company.\u201d"

        "title": "How Big Tech Camouflaged Wall Street\u2019s Crisis",
        "fulltext": "The fate of the S&P 500 index \u2014 used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America, and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy \u2014 often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft.\nThe companies that make up the S&P 500, sized by share of market value.\nApple\nMicrosoft\nTech companies\n6.2%\n7.1%\nTesla\n1.5%\nNetflix\n0.44%\nLockheed\nMartin\nThese 32 companies\ncombined account\nfor 6.3% of the index\n0.32%\nStarbucks\n0.34%\nApple\nMicrosoft\nTech companies\n6.2%\n7.1%\nTesla\n1.5%\nNetflix\n0.44%\nLockheed\nMartin\nThese 32 companies\ncombined account\nfor 6.3% of the index\n0.32%\nStarbucks\n0.34%\nSource: S&P Dow Jones Indices\nBy Eli Murray\nThis means it\u2019s hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft\u2019s and Apple\u2019s market valuation.\nIt is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.\nTrading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of aglobal investment bank in Europesent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent.\nApple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.\nIt can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500,\u201d she said. \u201cThese two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index.\u201d\nIt was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seizedSilicon Valley Bankand Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60 percent, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.\nOutside the stock market,government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.\nYet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1 percent. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15 percent slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.\nMuch of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.\nAs one of 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500, the tech industry accounts for more than a quarter of the stock index\u2019s value.\nReal estate\n100%\nUtilities\nCommunications\n14% of index\n2001\nTech\n29% of index\n2021\nFinancials\nHealth\nConsumer\nstaples\nConsumer\ndiscretionary\nIndustrial\nMaterials\nEnergy\n0\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nReal estate\n100%\nUtilities\nCommunications\n14% of index\n2001\nTechnology\nFinancials\n29% of index\n2021\nHealth\nConsumer\nstaples\nConsumer\ndiscretionary\nIndustrial\nMaterials\nEnergy\n0\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nSource: S&P Dow Jones Indices\nCategories are sized by market value.\nBy Eli Murray\nApple, at roughly $2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.\nThis influence is a result of a decades-long shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.\nApple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) \u2014 a group that came to be called theFANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decade-longbull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.\nThis dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft\u2019s and Apple\u2019s combined index weight was less than Apple\u2019s is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft\u2019s 6.2 percent weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cThis is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It\u2019s market-driven.\u201d\nThe S&P also produces an \u201cequal weight\u201d index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index fell 2.6 percent.\nAnother commonly cited measure of Wall Street\u2019s performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.\nAnd then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10 percent in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5 percent and real estate companies slid 2.1 percent. They also show that other parts of the market \u2014 like utilities \u2014 fared just fine.\n\u201cThere were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech,\u201d Ms. Cincotta said.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.\nSince then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.\nThis month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies \u2014 like Visa and PayPal \u2014 into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft\u2019s dominance as the two tech heavyweights.\nOf course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20 percent, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index\u2019s total decline last year.\nBut for now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.\nOne reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake inOpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.\nTech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country\u2019s banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.\nAnd, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a big bull cycle for tech,\u201d said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will give up that paradigm easily.\u201d"

        "title": "Attention, Travelers: Now Is the Best Time to Switch to eSIM",
        "fulltext": "As vacation season looms, now is as good a time as ever to bite the bullet and become familiar with a smartphone feature that many of us have ignored for years: the eSIM, the digital version of the SIM card that carries your phone number.\nAmong many benefits, eSIM technology is a boon for travelers, and pretty soon we will all be using it because the physical SIM card will be no more. Let me explain.\nLast year, Apple eliminated the SIM card tray from theiPhone 14to free up space. That means the SIM card, which acts as a key that connects your phone with cellular networks, is being phased out for Apple phones.\nWhere Apple leads, others typically follow, so you can expect handset makers like Samsung and Google to also go all-in on eSIM \u2014 a digitized SIM card embedded into the phone\u2019s computer chip that you can activate with any cellular network\u2019s service plan.\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, it\u2019s coming,\u201d Roger Entner, a telecom expert and founder of the research firm Recon Analytics, said about eSIM technology.\nBut this move isn\u2019t really all about Apple. The Federal Communications Commission alsofavors eSIM technology, because it makes it easier for people to switch to a different carrier by using software instead of going to a store for a physical SIM card. And the technology has security benefits: If your phone is stolen, thieves can\u2019t remove an eSIM to hijack your phone number and commit identity theft, as they could with a physical SIM card.\nMost important, the experience of using eSIM data plans for travel has greatly improved. About five years ago, eSIM data plans for international roaming were overpriced, and cell service was sometimes unreliable. But in the last year, I\u2019ve tested a few eSIM services when I left the country and found them to be cost-effective and zippy.\nAs is always the case with new technology, there are downsides. Activating a data plan on a foreign network with an eSIM is not as straightforward as sticking a different SIM card into your phone. The process is especially challenging for those who are less familiar with technology, putting the onus on more tech savvy companions to help them make the switch.\nThere are also privacy concerns. Many eSIM service providers offer apps that collect your data for tracking purposes.\nYou can use my experience as a template for navigating the inevitable transition to eSIM. Recently, I tried eSIM data plans when traveling with several members of my family and acted as their tech sherpa through the switch.\nThe main reason to use eSIM services for travel is to save money. The big U.S. carriers, like AT&T and Verizon, offer international roaming options, including $10 day passes for using your phone in foreign countries. The costs quickly add up for a two-week trip with family.\nIn contrast, an eSIM data package that can be used for the entirety of your trip costs a few dollars. The tricky part is choosing an eSIM service provider because there are many, and most are unfamiliar brands like Airalo, GigSky and Flexiroam. (Appleprovides a list of eSIM service providerson its website.)\nFor a recent weeklong trip to Montreal, I researched travel blogs and pickedNomad, which offered a gigabyte of data that could be used for seven days in Canada for $7. I had the option to activate the plan with Nomad\u2019s app or by following setup instructions on the company\u2019s website. The app had high reviews in the App Store, so I clicked the download button.\nA nice thing about eSIM is that you can buy a plan and set up the service on your phone well in advance of a trip, then activate it when you arrive at your destination. After you buy a plan, the eSIM service provider sends you a list of instructions.\nThe Nomad app showed a list of steps. In the iPhone\u2019s settings app, I clicked on the cellular menu, clicked \u201cAdd eSIM\u201d and typed in an activation code. As I crossed the border into Canada, I went back into the cellular settings, selected the Nomad phone line and toggled on the option for \u201cTurn on this line.\u201d\n(If you still use a physical SIM card for your domestic phone line, you need not remove it. In the phone\u2019s cellular settings, you just switch off the service for your primary line to avoid roaming charges.)\nAfter I picked this eSIM plan, I shared the Nomad app with my wife and brother-in-law, who each followed the instructions to set it up by themselves. I didn\u2019t know how to advise my mother-in-law, who never downloads apps, how to set up the plan, so I did it for her.\nHerein lies the real problem: Less tech-inclined folks are probably not going to know how to use eSIM services. When my mother-in-law went on a trip to Hong Kong alone and I wasn\u2019t nearby to set up the service for her, I told her to pay for AT&T\u2019s international roaming plan and find a store later to buy a SIM card from a Hong Kong phone carrier.\nTerry Guo, a chief product officer of LotusFlare, the company that developed Nomad, agreed that the main demographic of travelers using eSIM service plans comprised younger, more tech-savvy people.\n\u201cWe are doing a lot of work in the app to make this simpler,\u201d he said.\nAnother downside to eSIM services is privacy-related. All the eSIM service providers I researched in Apple\u2019s App Store said in their app descriptions that they did some tracking of users across different apps and websites.\nToni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a company that helps businesses reduce their wireless bills, underlined the importance of safeguarding personal information from eSIM providers. He said many of these companies, known as mobile virtual network operators, had struggled to generate profit.\n\u201cOne way they think they\u2019ll make money is selling your information,\u201d Mr. Toikka said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should always opt out of any tracking. You shouldn\u2019t sell yourself for pennies on a dollar.\u201d\nMr. Guo said that the Nomad app contained Google\u2019s analytics technology to see how people were using the app, and that people who logged into the app with their Facebook accounts could also be tracked by Facebook.\nA simple workaround to data collection is to avoid logging into an app with third-party sites like Facebook and Google. Apple users can also click \u201cAsk app not to track\u201d when opening an eSIM app for the first time.\nAndroid users don\u2019t have the option to ask apps not to track them, so their best option is to buy the eSIM plan from the company\u2019s website and set up the service without downloading the app.\nOverall, the pros of eSIM outweigh the cons. Traveling with a smartphone with SIM cards wasn\u2019t relaxing because you needed to carry a pin to eject the card tray; plus you had to make sure not to lose the tiny SIM card.\nWhen returning from a trip using eSIM services, all you have to do is go back into the phone\u2019s settings app and switch your domestic phone line back on. That simplicity and peace of mind make eSIM worth the hassle."

        "title": "The Perils of Working on a C.E.O.\u2019s Pet Project",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 For years, working on a project that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to outsiders but was championed by the boss was a badge of honor for employees at some of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies. Google tried to create augmented reality glasses. Amazon developed its own high-end smartphone. Facebook changed its name to Meta and jumped headlong into the virtual world of the metaverse.\nWhen those projects have fizzled, workers have often slipped into another job at the company. The business usually bore the risk of a failed product or bad idea \u2014 not the employee.\nBut as tech companies have turned to mass layoffs in recent months, the big bets have increasingly looked like bad bets for holding on to a job. When companies have looked for cuts, they have turned to the groups that could be years from making something that will turn a profit.\nAt Amazon, the ax fell on teams working on the Alexa voice system, drones and automated stores, all projects championed by Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, who no longer runs the company. At Google, it hit ventures like autonomous trucks and other so-called moonshots once championed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who also no longer run their company.\nThe shifting economy and executive transitions away from founders have ushered in a new era, and employees wonder: Is their leader marching them to make their mark on the future, or right off a cliff?\nThat concern has compounded in recent months as tech companies have undertaken their biggest payroll purge in at least 15 years. Boring and profitable has never looked better. And working on the fun idea that may never pay off has never looked so precarious.\n\u201cThey have all shown they are willing to throw entire squadrons under the bus to cut costs,\u201d said Kharis O\u2019Connell, a veteran designer of futuristic products whom Amazon recruited from Google two years ago. He was laid off in November. \u201cIf you are not in a profit center, you\u2019re kind of screwed.\u201d\nThe scenario is flipped for employees at Meta, which has had significant layoffs this year. Mark Zuckerberg still runs the company he founded, but he wants to take it in a new direction, the metaverse. He had made it clear that employees had better get on board even though Facebook\u2019s metaverse plans are probably years from making serious money. A big part of the company has become one of those risky projects.\nMr. Bezos often praised ambitious goals at Amazon, even if they flopped. \u201cIf the size of your failures isn\u2019t growing, you\u2019re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle,\u201d he wrote to investors in 2019.\nWorking on a \u201cJeff project\u201d meant facing regular scrutiny, with frequent meetings and updates, according to people who worked on the Fire phone and other priority projects.\nBut when the phone was killed after tepid consumer reaction, employees were largely redeployed to other projects. Many went on to build Alexa, Mr. Bezos told investors. At one point, more than 20,000 people were employed on the Alexa project. Employees worked hard for it to succeed, but \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the Alexa org who thinks it will be profitable,\u201d said David Anderson, who spent more than a decade at Amazon, including on Alexa devices.\nIn July 2021, Mr. Bezos handed Amazon\u2019s chief executive title to Andy Jassy, who had built and run the company\u2019s highly profitable cloud computing division. Mr. Jassy took a hard look at the company\u2019s operations and costs. And when the economy started to appear shaky, he had an opportunity to make cuts and reflect his priorities, said Brad Porter, a former Amazon vice president and the founder of Collaborative Robotics.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is streamline our costs and a bunch of different areas while, at the same time, making sure that we keep betting on the things that we believe long term could change,\u201dMr. Jassy saidat The New York Times\u2019s DealBook conference in December.\nWhenjust under 2,000 peoplewho worked on Alexa and other devices were laid off late last year, Mr. Andersonpostedon LinkedIn that he was unnerved. In the past, if Mr. Bezos proposed a \u201cgoofy\u201d idea \u2014 say, \u201cJeff wants to build robots to take dogs on walks\u201d \u2014 talented engineers would still join, knowing leadership supported the work.\n\u201cWe always said it was like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Anderson wrote, \u201cwith zero risk if you failed.\u201d\nThe layoffs, which totaled about 18,000 across Amazon, came with a hiring freeze, limiting options for movement internally. Numerous employees of the company wrote Mr. Anderson that his post had hit a nerve. They told him that they hoped to switch roles internally, he said, and were \u201cnever working on one of these crazy projects again.\u201d\nStill, employees remain excited to work on Amazon\u2019s big bets, including satellite internet, health care and driverless taxis, said Brad Glasser, a company spokesman.\n\u201cThe opportunity to work on projects that are transformative for customers at scale and to build and use cutting-edge technology is the reason many employees join the company and grow their careers here,\u201d he said.\nGoogle has long been the poster child for big, offbeat ideas. In 2009, Mr. Page convinced Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor, that after the company had conquered the internet, its next feat would be to transform the real world.\nAutonomous vehicles were one of several ideas that Google began working on at the secretive division that Mr. Thrun would start, Google X, nicknamed the company\u2019s \u201cmoonshot factory.\u201d Some efforts succeeded, such as Google Brain, an artificial intelligence lab that is now part of the company\u2019s research division. Others failed, including Google Glass, augmented reality glasses that attracted ridicule, and Loon, a plan that intended to beam internet from giant balloons but never landed on a business model.\nMany of these early projects were hatched by Google\u2019s co-founders and their inner circle of advisers, Mr. Thrun said in an interview. \u201cWe found the thing to work on and the mountain to climb,\u201d he said.\nOver the four years Mr. Thrun ran the division, whose name was later shortened to X, he had only one conversation with the finance official assigned to his group, he said, and never spoke to Google\u2019s chief financial officer.\nWhen layoffs struck X in January, the unit cleaved all but one member of its strategy team \u2014 the same group that would often note if a project was unlikely to ever make money. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, said it would lay off12,000 employeesin total, or 6 percent of its work force. Several moonshots fared worse, with Verily, a health company, slashing 15 percent of its workers and Intrinsic, a robotics arm, downsizing by 20 percent.\nWaymo, the self-driving car business run by Alphabet, expected to have a significant business by 2015, Mr. Thrun said. But it still has ride-hailing operations in only Phoenix and San Francisco, and isheading to Los Angelesnext.\nThis year, Alphabet cut workers involved with Waymo\u2019s efforts to move freight, which some thought had a more obvious business model than its passenger business. Now Waymo has only a skeleton crew of trucking employees left, after shedding 72 workers in January. Last week, Waymo culled another 137 roles, according to an internal email reviewed by The Times, bringing Waymo\u2019s staff cuts to 8 percent this year.\nWaymo said it was confident that it had the right teams to succeed, while Google declined to comment.\nEven Apple, the most profitable of the tech giants, isn\u2019t immune. The company hasn\u2019t made sweeping layoffs and generally is more selective in the projects it takes on. In recent years, it has pursued ambitious efforts to develop a mixed-reality headset, an autonomous car and custom mobile chips.\nBut since beginning its car project in 2015, Apple has revamped its approach several times, and laid off about 200 employees as part of a project overhaul in 2019.\nAt Meta, employees are trying to keep their jobs safe by following Mr. Zuckerberg to his metaverse. In November, hecut more than 11,000 jobs across the company, or roughly 13 percent, and extended a hiring freeze that was to last through the first quarter of 2023. Internal rumors that more cuts may come in the months ahead abound.\nThe division that felt the least impact? Reality Labs \u2014 the locus of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse efforts.\nAbout 15 months ago, Mr. Zuckerberg went all in on the metaverse and renamed the company Meta. Some insiders were excited. But others were caught off guard by what felt like a near-overnight transformation of the company\u2019s roughly 80,000-person work force.\nMeta declined to comment.\nMany employees had to reapply for jobs responsible for building the metaverse, and working on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s pet project was widely seen as the fastest way to advance.\nBut many still question the strategy and are concerned that it will take much longer than the company\u2019s predicted 10-year horizon for the technology to improve enough for general use, and longer still for the mainstream to embrace it \u2014 if it does at all.\nWorkers have found the software that runs Meta\u2019s VR platform too buggy. Or just pointless. Last fall, a managersent a memourging employees to use the products more regularly.\n\u201cEveryone in this organization should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds,\u201d the manager said in the memo, according to a copy obtained by The Times. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that without using it.\u201d\nKaren Weise reported from Seattle, and Nico Grant and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Tripp Micklecontributed reporting from San Francisco."

        "title": "The Case Against (Some) Buybacks",
        "fulltext": "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is determined not to let America\u2019s tech giants play her for a fool. If they want taxpayer money under the CHIPS and Science Act, they willneed to promisenot to turn around and give the money to their shareholders through dividends or share repurchases.\nI think that makes good sense. On the other hand, sometimes companies should pay dividends or buy back shares. Those are two of the main ways that they reward their shareholders \u2014 who are, after all, the owners \u2014 rather than sit on excess cash or spend it wastefully.\nSo when dividends and buybacks are good and when they\u2019re bad turns out to be a really interesting question. I can\u2019t fully answer it here but I want to look at some aspects of the debate.\nSeven congressional Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, and independent Senator Bernie Sanders wrote aletterto the CHIPS program office on Feb. 10, copying Raimondo, reminding it of Raimondo\u2019spromiselast year that \u201cCHIPS money is not a subsidy for big companies to make them more profitable.\u201d\nThe eight made a solid point: Money is fungible. Even though the CHIPS and Science Act prohibits program money from being used for dividends or buybacks, companies could thwart the law\u2019s intent by stuffing the program money into one pocket and paying for dividends and buybacks out of a different pocket. To prevent such \u201caccounting mischief,\u201d they said awardees should be barred from buying back shares for 10 years \u201cor, for longer-term projects, the length of the project.\u201d\nThe standard unveiled by the CHIPS program office on Feb. 28 doesn\u2019t go as far as the Democratic lawmakers wanted. It requires applicants to \u201cdetail their intentions with respect to stock buybacks over five years, including whether they intend to refrain from or limit them,\u201d with preference given to those that \u201ccredibly commit to investing in the domestic semiconductor industry.\u201d\nI have to think Raimondo\u2019s people worried that key companies wouldn\u2019t participate in the program if the conditions were too restrictive. Companies really, really like rewarding their shareholders: The Democrats\u2019 letter cites astudyby Lenore Palladino of the University of Massachusetts Amherst finding that \u201cthe largest semiconductor companies \u2014 Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Broadcom \u2014 spent 71 percent of their net income on stock buybacks alone from 2011 to 2020.\u201d\nStripped to its essentials, the CHIPS and Science Act is trying to induce a bunch of multinational corporations that have headquarters in the United States but customers and shareholders all over the world to take pro-American actions that they wouldn\u2019t take if left to their own devices. What Raimondo is up against is what Robert Reich wrote in 1990, which I used in myquote of the dayon Friday: \u201cSo who is us? The answer is, the American work force, the American people, but not particularly the American corporation.\u201d\nI\u2019m a lot less concerned about dividends and buybacks when they\u2019re not being funded with taxpayer dollars. It\u2019s good for companies to give money back to their shareholders when they don\u2019t see any productive uses for it. The shareholders may spend the money on themselves, which is OK, or they may help fund a start-up that has world-changing prospects, which would be better.\nPresident Biden does have concerns about buybacks that go well beyond the CHIPS and Science Act. In his State of the Union address he called for quadrupling the new 1 percent tax on buybacks to encourage long-term investments. But it\u2019s not clear that the tax would get the results he wants. For one thing, companies could simply switch from buybacks to dividends.\nEven if they retain the earnings, it\u2019s not clear that companies would use them to rebuild the American economy. They might raise executive salaries, or build plants overseas or do stupid things at home like venture into businesses they don\u2019t understand. Austin Graff, the founder and chief investment officer of Opal Capital, said he invests in companies that pay high and reliable dividends because the payouts prevent management from doing things with the money that aren\u2019t in the shareholders\u2019 best interest.\nIt\u2019s true that companies often waste money by buying back their shares at high prices, as detailed in anarticleco-written by William Lazonick, the president of theAcademic-Industry Research Networkand a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. That\u2019s dumb. Inan articlefor the Institute for New Economic Thinking last month, Lazonick and Marie Carpenter singled out Cisco Systems, the networking company.\n\u201cFrom October 2001 through October 2022, Cisco spent $152.3 billion \u2014 95 percent of its net income over the period \u2014 on stock buybacks for the purpose of propping up its stock price,\u201d Lazonick and Carpenter wrote. \u201cThese funds wasted in pursuit of \u2018maximizing shareholder value\u2019 were on top of the $55.5 billion that Cisco paid out to shareholders in dividends, representing an additional 35 percent of net income.\u201d (A Cisco spokeswoman, Robyn Blum, replied in an email that \u201cCisco innovation sits at the heart of the major technology market shifts,\u201d adding that \u201cthe primary focus of our capital allocation strategy is to support the growth of the company by investing in innovation \u2014 both organic and inorganic.\u201d)\nOne reason to worry less about buybacks is that if a company weakens itself, eventually driving down the stock, by overspending on dividends and buybacks, the shareholders who stay are the main ones harmed. They have every interest in throwing the bums off the board. The incentives of capitalism are aligned with the incentives of the public.\nApple has returned more than 90 percent of its free cash flow to investors through stock buybacks and dividends over the past decade, a total of more than $600 billion, without weakening itself,wroteBen Hunt, a co-founder of the money management firm Second Foundation Partners, in November for the company\u2019s Epsilon Theory website.\nI mostly agree with Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which is a major shareholder in Apple. Buffettwrote to shareholdersin his annual letter last month that when a company buys back some of its shares, those who sell benefit because they prefer cash to shares, while those who don\u2019t sell also benefit because they prefer shares to cash. Buffett wrote, \u201cWhen you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to C.E.O.s, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).\u201d\nAre buybacks always good? No. Always bad? Also no.\nWhen the dollar strengthens, the global economy cools off. And when the global economy cools off, the dollar strengthens more. That\u2019s the \u201cdollar\u2019s imperial cycle,\u201d according tonew researchby Ozge Akinci of the New York Federal Reserve Bank; Gianluca Benigno of the University of Lausanne; Serra Pelin, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley; and Jonathan Turek of the research firm JST Advisors.\nThe dollar\u2019s importance in global trade and investment vastly exceeds the U.S. share of economic output, the scholars write. Developing nations in particular set prices for their exports in dollars, buy their inputs in dollars and often borrow in dollars. So their economies are harmed when the dollar strengthens. That has spillover effects, lowering global commodity prices and weakening manufacturing around the world, including in the United States. Because the United States is less exposed to trade than most other countries, it\u2019s less harmed, so the dollar strengthens more, continuing the imperial cycle.\nThis, they write in a blog post about their work, is \u201ca self-fulfilling, pro-cyclical force that governs global macroeconomic developments.\u201d\n\u201cPredicting the future has always been hard, but these days it\u2019s becoming tricky even to predict the past: The statistical agencies keep making large revisions to older data.\u201d\n\u2014 Paul Krugman, \u201cPeering Through the Fog of Inflation,\u201d The New York Times (March 3, 2023)"

        "title": "Troubles at Silicon Valley Bank Rock the Global Market",
        "fulltext": "Shares in U.S. banks appear poised to slide again on Friday, after the sector suffered a$52 billion sell-offon Thursday, its worst drop in three years. Driving investor concerns is thehealth of Silicon Valley Bank, one of the biggest lenders to tech start-ups, which is urgently raising cash to shore up its finances.\nContagion concerns spooked the global markets on Friday, rattling stocks from Tokyo to London. Bank stocks were the hardest hit, but smaller lenders like SVB, which has funded start-ups worldwide, are viewed as being particularly vulnerable \u2014 and now face potentially serious threats to their survival.\nBlame interest rates for the mess.As the Fed has raised rates to combat inflation, the value of bonds that banks hold as assets has fallen. That\u2019s normally not a problem, until banks need to sell those holdings to cover customer withdrawals.\nIn SVB\u2019s case, the bank disclosed late on Wednesday that it had sold $21 billion of its most easily sellable investments \u2014 crystallizing a $1.8 billion after-tax loss \u2014 and borrowed $15 billion. It also announced plans toraise $2.25 billionthrough an emergency sale of stock. That news spurred customers to start pulling deposits; investors, already unnerved by the collapse of the crypto-focused lender Silvergate, followed suit, driving SVB\u2019s stock down 60 percent on Thursday. It\u2019s down about 40 percent in premarket trading on Friday.\nSVB\u2019s efforts to restore calm are falling flat.On a conference call on Thursday, the bank\u2019s C.E.O., Greg Becker, urged venture capitalists to stick by a longtime financial partner. (The firm, which calls itself the \u201cfinancial partner of the innovation economy,\u201d offers banking, loans and wealth management services to start-ups, venture firms and tech workers.) But many of those investors weren\u2019t reassured:\nArjun Sethi of Tribe Capital advised companies to jump ship: \u201cAlmost by definition, any bank with a business model is dead if everyone moves,\u201d he wrote in an internal memo, according to The Times.\nPeter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, Coatue Management and Union Square Ventures also told their portfolio companies to switch banks,according to Bloomberg.\nOther banks are scrambling to pick off clients. A smaller rival, Levro, said on Thursday that it had \u201can expedited processing/approval process for current SVB customers\u201d; DealBook hears that bigger banks are also on the hunt.\nStill, other venture investors urged SVB clients to stay: A bank run \u201cwill feel like a big self own in hindsight,\u201d tweetedRoseanne Wincek of Renegade Partners.\nMeanwhile, investors have begun whispering about a potential bailout.DealBook hasn\u2019t confirmed any deal talks underway, but one focus of speculation is that Goldman Sachs might be a possible savior. Whether Goldman would want to step in, especially given that it\u2019s weighing a potential sale of the buy now pay later lender GreenSky, is another matter. (The billionaire financier Bill Ackman offered another potential savior:the federal government.)\nOther banks are also feeling the heat. Shares in Signature Bank fell 12 percent on Thursday, while those in Zions Bancorporation slid 11 percent. More broadly, the KBW Bank index, which tracks some of the world\u2019s biggest lenders, fell nearly 8 percent on Thursday. The blowback has even crossed the Atlantic: Shares in France\u2019s BNP Paribas were down 3 percent on Friday, while Germany\u2019s Commerzbank was off 3.5 percent, and Deutsche Bank was down 7 percent.\nThere are signs that some calm is returning to the market. An overnight rally in some intermediate-term bonds suggests that some investors believe that forced asset sales by banks are drawing to a close.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report points to a slowdown in hiring.Jittery investors will be watching the Bureau of Labor Statistics report closely for signs that wage growth, a key inflation indicator, is stabilizing. The data, which is forecast to show about 225,000 jobs were created last month,will be released on Fridayat 8:30 a.m. Eastern.\nApple faces a big shareholder vote on pay equity.At Friday\u2019s annual meeting, shareholders willhave their sayon whether the iPhone maker should report more data on racial and gender pay, a proposal pushed by activist investor Arjuna Capital, and supported by the fund manager Schroders.\nDonald Trump could face criminal charges over Stormy Daniels payment.The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office has told the former president that he cantestify before a grand jurythat\u2019s hearing evidence that he paid hush money to the porn star. It\u2019s the strongest signal yet that prosecutors are nearing an indictment in the case.\nThe Norfolk Southern C.E.O. apologizes for the Ohio train derailment.In testimony before the Senate yesterday, Alan Shawsaid he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201dabout the incident. But the railway chief stopped short of offering to pay for long-term damage to the community of East Palestine, or endorsing rail safety legislation.\nA former Goldman Sachs banker behind the 1MDB fraud gets sentenced.Roger Ng, a former managing director for Goldman in Asia,will get 10 years in prison, a federal judge ordered yesterday, for his role in looting more than $4 billion from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund.\nCredit card companies havepaused plansto implement a gun merchant code designed to detect suspicious purchases of firearms and ammunition, after fierce Republicanpushbackin a number of states.\nAmerican Express, Visa, Mastercard and Discover said yesterday that they couldn\u2019t proceed, citing inconsistency over how the rule would be applied and legal uncertainty.\nThe decision is a blow to gun control activists.They see the code as a way toprevent violenceby giving credit card companies a tool to spot dubious sales. Airlines and hotels already have their own codes, as do other industries. Activists and Amalgamated Bank had lobbied the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization for the code and the credit card companies said they had no choice but to adopt the standard when it was approved in September.\nCritics say that the code threatens gun owners\u2019 rights and fosters corporate collusion.Two dozenstate attorneys general wrote to the C.E.O.sof American Express, Mastercard and Visa in September, arguing that it potentially violated consumer protection and antitrust laws. And Republican lawmakers in Mississippi and Florida have sought to ban banks and payment processors from using it.\nAfter the pause was announced, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said in a statement that the code encouraged \u201ccoordination between corporations and government agencies to erode Americans\u2019 fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\u2014Greg Brockman, a founder of OpenAI, the start-up that created ChatGPT, responding to criticism from Elon Musk and others that its chatbot had a liberal bias. Brockman told The Information that OpenAI had been too slow to allow users to customize ChatGPT\u2019s behavior.\nIn the heart of America, officials tasked with managing states\u2019 public employee pension funds are running the numbers on the wave of anti-E.S.G. bills coming out of their state capitals and increasingly concluding that they come at a steep cost.\nKansas is the latest to reach that conclusion.The Kansas Division of the Budget this week saida billdrafted by the state\u2019s Republican legislators to divest state employees\u2019 pension money from financial companies that use environmental, social and governance parameters to make investment decisions would be a big burden to the pensioners \u2014 reducing their returns by $3.6 billion over the next decade. On Wednesday, Alan Conroy, executive director of Kansas\u2019s $25 billion public employees retirement system, asked state legislatorsto scrap the bill.\nThe state isn\u2019t buying it.\u201cE.S.G.-driven funds usually deliver a much lower return on investment,\u201d Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who helped draft the pricey bill,recently wrotein Breitbart. (Investment data from Morningstar, and others,contradict this analysis.)\nThe tussle comes as state pensions are increasingly being thrust into the culture wars\u2014 by both criticsandchampions of E.S.G. investing \u2014 at a time when many states are struggling to fund them. According to the Equable Institute, a pensions nonprofit, states \u2014 including Kansas \u2014 face a combinedfunding shortfall of $1.4 trillionfor their pensions. It also comes as the E.S.G. investing debate seems certain to become a hot-button political issue ahead of the 2024 presidential campaign.\nKansas isn\u2019t alone.In Wyoming, the House appropriations committeeunanimously rejected two anti-E.S.G. billslast month after pension executives said they would be costly and confusing to implement. Sam Masoudi, Chief Investment Officer of the Wyoming Retirement System, told legislators that the proposed definition of E.S.G. from their bills is so broad as to bar investment in any Fortune 500 company. \u201cTheoretically we wouldn\u2019t be able to invest in a coal company, which I\u2019m pretty sure is not the intent,\u201d he said. (The Wyoming Retirement System and Mr. Masoudi did not respond to requests for comment.)\nPension officials in Kentucky are opposing the state treasurer\u2019s divestment demands, arguing that they would violate their fiduciary duty and meanhigher fees.

        "title": "How Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant Lost the A.I. Race",
        "fulltext": "On a rainy Tuesday in San Francisco, Apple executives took the stage in a crowded auditorium to unveil thefifth-generation iPhone. The phone, which looked identical to the previous version, had a new feature that the audience was soon buzzing about:Siri, a virtual assistant.\nScott Forstall, then Apple\u2019s head of software, pushed an iPhone button to summon Siri and prodded it with questions. At his request, Siri checked the time in Paris (\u201c8:16 p.m.,\u201d Siri replied), defined the word \u201cmitosis\u201d (\u201cCell division in which the nucleus divides into nuclei containing the same number of chromosomes,\u201d it said) and pulled up a list of 14 highly rated Greek restaurants, five of them in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the A.I. field for a long time, and this still blows me away,\u201d Mr. Forstall said.\nThat was 12 years ago. Since then, people have been far from blown away by Siri and competing assistants that are powered by artificial intelligence, like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant. The technology has largely remained stagnant, and the talking assistants have become the butt of jokes, including in a 2018 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch featuring a smart speakerfor seniors.\nThe tech world is now gushing over a different kind of virtual assistant: chatbots. These A.I.-powered bots, such asChatGPTand the new ChatGPT Plus from the San Francisco company OpenAI, can improvise answers to questions typed into a chat box with alacrity. People have used ChatGPT to handle complex tasks like coding software, drafting business proposals and writing fiction.\nAnd ChatGPT, which uses A.I. to guess what word comes next, is rapidly improving. A few months ago, it couldn\u2019t write a proper haiku; now it can do so with gusto. On Tuesday, OpenAI unveiled itsnext-generation A.I. engine, GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT.\nThe excitement around chatbots illustrates how Siri, Alexa and other voice assistants \u2014 which once elicited similar enthusiasm \u2014 have squandered their lead in the A.I. race.\nOver the past decade, the products hit roadblocks. Siri ran into technological hurdles, including clunky code that took weeks to update with basic features, said John Burkey, a former Apple engineer who worked on the assistant. Amazon and Google miscalculated how the voice assistants would be used, leading them to invest in areas with the technology that rarely paid off, former employees said. When those experiments failed, enthusiasm for the technology waned at the companies, they said.\nVoice assistants are \u201cdumb as a rock,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in aninterviewthis month with The Financial Times, declaring that newer A.I. would lead the way. Microsoft has worked closely with OpenAI, investing$13 billionin the start-up and incorporating its technology into the Bing search engine, as well as other products.\nApple declined to comment on Siri. Google said it was committed to providing a great virtual assistant to help people on their phones and inside their homes and cars; the company is separatelytesting a chatbot called Bard. Amazon said that it saw a 30 percent increase in customer engagement globally with Alexa in the last year and that it was optimistic about its mission to build world-class A.I.\nThe assistants and the chatbots are based on different flavors of A.I. Chatbots are powered by what are known as large language models, which are systems trained to recognize and generate text based on enormous data sets scraped off the web. They can then suggest words to complete a sentence.\nIn contrast, Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are essentially what are known as command-and-control systems. These can understand a finite list of questions and requests like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in New York City?\u201d or \u201cTurn on the bedroom lights.\u201d If a user asks the virtual assistant to do something that is not in its code, the bot simply says it can\u2019t help.\nSiri also had a cumbersome design that made it time-consuming to add new features, said Mr. Burkey, who was given the job of improving Siri in 2014. Siri\u2019s database contains a gigantic list of words, including the names of musical artists and locations like restaurants, in nearly two dozen languages.\nThat made it \u201cone big snowball,\u201d he said. If someone wanted to add a word to Siri\u2019s database, he added, \u201cit goes in one big pile.\u201d\nSo seemingly simple updates, like adding some new phrases to the data set, would require rebuilding the entire database, which could take up to six weeks, Mr. Burkey said. Adding more complex features like new search tools could take nearly a year. That meant there was no path for Siri to become a creative assistant like ChatGPT, he said.\nAlexa and Google Assistant relied on technology similar to Siri\u2019s, but the companies struggled to generate meaningful revenue with the assistants, former managers at Amazon and Google said. (In contrast, Apple successfully used Siri to entice buyers to its iPhones.)\nAfter Amazon released the Echo, a smart speaker powered by Alexa, in 2014, the company hoped the product would help it increase sales in its online store by enabling consumers to talk to Alexa to place orders, said a former Amazon leader involved with Alexa. But while people had fun playing with Alexa\u2019s ability to answer weather prompts and set alarms,few asked Alexa to order items, he added.\nAmazon may have overinvested in making new kinds of hardware, like now-discontinued alarm clocks and microwaves that worked with Alexa, which sold at or below cost, the former executive said.\nThe company also underinvested in creating an ecosystem for people to easily expand Alexa\u2019s abilities, in the way that Apple had done with its App Store, which helped stoke interest in the iPhone, the person said. While Amazon offered a \u201cskills\u201d store to make Alexa control third-party accessories like light switches, it was difficult for people to find and set up skills for the speakers \u2014 unlike the friction-free experience of downloading mobile apps from app stores.\n\u201cWe never had that App Store moment for the assistants,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies who was a consultant for Amazon.\nLate last year, the Amazon division working on Alexa was a major target of the company\u2019s 18,000 layoffs, and a number of top Alexa executives have left the company.\nKinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said Alexa was much more than a voice assistant, and \u201cwe\u2019re as optimistic about that mission as ever.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s misfires with Alexa may have led Google astray, said a former manager who worked on Google Assistant. Google engineers spent years experimenting with its assistant to mimic what Alexa could do, including designing smart speakers and voice-controlled tablet screens to control home accessories like thermostats and light switches. The company later integrated ads into those home products, which did not become a major source of revenue.\nOver time, Google realized that most people used the voice assistant only for a limited number of simple tasks, such as starting timers and playing music, the former manager said. In 2020, when Prabhakar Raghavan, a Google executive, took over Google Assistant, his group refocused the virtual companion as a marquee feature for Android smartphones.\nIn January, whenGoogle\u2019s parent company laid off 12,000 employees, the team working on operating systems for home devices lost 16 percent of its engineers.\nMany of the big tech companies are now racing to come up with responses to ChatGPT. At Apple\u2019s headquarters last month, the company held its annual A.I. summit, an internal event for employees to learn about its large language model and other A.I. tools, two people who were briefed on the program said. Many engineers, including members of the Siri team, have been testing language-generating concepts every week, the people said.\nOn Tuesday,Google also saidit would soon release generative A.I. tools to help businesses, governments and software developers build applications with embedded chatbots, and incorporate the underlying technology into their systems.\nIn the future, the technologies of chatbots and voice assistants will converge, A.I. experts said. That means people will be able to control chatbots with speech, and those who use Apple, Amazon and Google products will be able to ask the virtual assistants to help them with their jobs, not just tasks like checking the weather.\n\u201cThese products never worked in the past because we never had human-level dialogue capabilities,\u201d said Aravind Srinivas, a founder of Perplexity, an A.I. start-up that offers a chatbot-powered search engine. \u201cNow we do.\u201d\nCade Metzcontributed reporting."
