        "title": "Recession? Not for Big Tech.",
        "fulltext": "Whenthe president, thetreasury secretaryandother Biden administration officialsinsisted this week that the American economy is not currently in a recession, they weremockedforweaselingout of bad news on a technicality. The Commerce Departmentannounced on Thursdaythat the broadest measure of economic activity, gross domestic product, fell for a second quarter in a row \u2014 meeting a widely held, though unofficial, definition of recession. It is true, as the Biden folks argued, that the nation\u2019s official recession arbiter, the National Bureau of Economic Research, has yet to call one, because it relies on many more signals. Still, it sure sounded as if the Biden team was splitting hairs.\nOver the past few days, though, I\u2019ve spent more time than is healthy listening to C.E.O.s expound on their businesses during quarterly corporate earnings calls. (What can I say? I\u2019m a sucker for a good time.) And I was surprised by what I heard. The C.E.O.s convinced me that the Biden people \u2014 not to mention Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, who also said this week thata recession has probably not yet begun\u2014 have a point.\nThe economy is in a really weird place. There are definitely signs of trouble. Yet at some of the biggest companies in the country \u2014 especially in the tech industry \u2014 business is hardly all glum. And even at companies that are struggling, the numbers aren\u2019t nearly as bad as investors had feared.\nAt the start of the week, I told my editor I\u2019d be writing about how the tech industry might be facing one of its worst slowdowns in two decades. By the end of the week, I found myself backing off anything so dramatic. Yes, some companies are facing unusually difficult times. Business models are blowing up. Competition is heating up. Regulators are getting tougher. Hiring is slowing down. Workers are being asked to do more with less. And all that\u2019s just at Facebook!\nBut there are also signs that some huge businesses are ably navigating tougher times \u2014 or, in a label adopted by so many C.E.O.s that I wondered if they agreed on it in a secret meeting, a challenging macroeconomic environment.\nConsider some of the brightest spots:Qualcomm, the chip-making giant, reported that despite that \u201cchallenging macroeconomic environment,\u201d profits grew more than 50 percent over last year because ofstrong sales ofits processors used in phones and automobiles.Ford reportedthat hefty sales of its SUVs and crossovers pushed its adjusted earnings before taxes and interest to more than triple from a year ago. MeanwhileVisa,MastercardandAmerican Expresssaid Americans are still spending as though there\u2019s no tomorrow. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending,\u201d Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s chief financial officer, told investors.\nMany on Wall Street had been especially worried about results from the behemoths of Big Tech \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet and Meta, the parent companies of Google and of Facebook. These are among themost valuableAmerican companies, andthey soaredduring the pandemic. But this year Big Tech\u2019s growth has slowed, and its stock prices have been crushed. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has been bullish on the tech giants, said that sentiment among tech investors was the most negative he\u2019s seen since 2009.\nThen on Tuesday, Microsoft and Alphabet released their numbers and turned the narrative around. Alphabet said its revenue grew by 13 percent over last year \u2014 lower than usual for a money-printing machine like Google but not much less than analysts had been expecting and better than many had feared. Ives said Google\u2019s not-too-bad results suggested that the online advertising market was holding up.\nMicrosoft\u2019s results were also lower than analysts had been expecting, but investors were still thrilled by them, especially the 40 percent growth in Microsoft\u2019s cloud services business. Because Microsoft\u2019s core business is in providing tech services to large companies, its strong cloud number shed a positive light on the entire economy, Ives said. \u201cThat was probably one of the most important data points in years for the tech sector,\u201d he told me.\nOn Wednesday, Meta put out what for it are somepretty dismal numbers; among other things, for the first time, the company posted a drop in quarterly revenue from the same period a year ago. But expectations had been very low for Facebook. The company\u2019s stock plummeted this year after it reported that Apple\u2019s new privacy features have hampered its ability to collect data on users. It has also faced persistent competition from TikTok. And because Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, is spending billions to pivot the company from social networking to \u201cthe metaverse\u201d \u2014 the still-in-development virtual realm that he believes will one day be at the center of our computing experience \u2014 its future looks more than a little cloudy.\nBut there was light even in Meta\u2019s grim report. Zuckerberg said that Reels, the company\u2019s competitor of TikTok, is gaining in popularity with users and with advertisers. Its user numbers have also held up. Meta has been dealing with so much bad news \u2014 this week the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to block the company from purchasing a small virtual reality start-up \u2014 that expectations could hardly fall lower. \u201cThe street was expecting just an absolute legendary disaster,\u201d Ives said. But compared with the expected hurricane of terrible earnings, Facebook\u2019s numbers were more like \u201ca little rainstorm,\u201d he said.\nAfter the markets closed on Thursday, Amazon and Apple reported their quarterly numbers. Guess what? They\u2019re also mostly crushing it.Amazonsaid its cloud business grew by 33 percent over last year. Apple\u2019s C.E.O.told CNBCthat the company expects revenue to \u201caccelerate\u201d next quarter.\nThis yearI arguedthat despite recent slowdowns, the reign of Big Tech was just beginning. As the economy softened over the course of the year, I began to doubt my bold prediction. But now I\u2019m redoubling. Tech giants, like the rest of the economy, may soon face tougher times. But Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and even Facebook are weathering difficult times much better than expected. Big Tech isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "The Fed Won\u2019t Say the \u2018R\u2019 Word",
        "fulltext": "The Federal Reserve is continuing its aggressive campaign to cool inflation, even as the economy begins to slow. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates yesterday \u2014 this time by three-quarters of a percentage point \u2014 for the fourth time this year. Investors cheered the move, with the S&P 500 rising nearly 3 percent by the end of the day. Futures markets suggest stocks will open slightly lower today. The Fed\u2019s benchmark short-term interest rate is now as high as 2.5 percent, up from near-zero in March.\nBut the big question on many minds is whether the economy will slow too much. During a news conference yesterday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, was asked in every way possible whether he thought the economy was in, or headed toward, a recession. And every time, he answered: No, not at all.\nThe Fed is more optimistic about a soft landing than Wall Street.Powell said a recession wasn\u2019t in his outlook, even though much of Wall Street sees one coming either by the end of this year or early next,reports The Times\u2019s Jeanna Smialek. Instead, Powell said the labor market indicated that the economy, while slowing, remained strong. He added that the Fed planned to continue raising rates until the end of 2023. \u201cI think he is holding on firmly to the idea that the labor market would have to be in much worse shape\u201d Michael Arone, a strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told DealBook. \u201cThe Fed won\u2019t be aggressive raising interest rates if it believed we were in a recession.\u201d\nIn part, the Fed can remain optimistic because the data about the economy is mixed.Consumer confidence is plunging, while corporate profits continue to increase, and the unemployment rate remains low. Peter Coy, our colleague from Times Opinion whowrites a newsletterabout business and economics, noted that G.D.P. and gross domestic income \u2014 another measure of economic activity \u2014 should track relatively closelybut have recently diverged. The gap between the two measures is at its widest since 1947.\nThe Fed, though, is probably not a reliable recession messenger.The central bank has said it can bring down inflation without sending the economy backward. Many question that. \u201cA big part of leadership is to project confidence,\u201d Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager for Osterweis Total Return Fund, told DealBook. \u201cI have always taken Fed-speak with a bit of salt, but when it comes to a recession, as I told my team this morning, a ton of salt.\u201d\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported this morning that the G.D.P. fell in the second quarter, for the second quarter in a row, raising fears, despite the Fed\u2019s assessment, that a recession may have already started in the U.S.Follow The Times\u2019s live coverage of reactions to the G.D.P. numbers.\nSpirit Airlines and JetBlue agree to merge.Their dealwas announced a day after Spirit and Frontier terminated their proposed agreement after monthslong talks. JetBlue will pay $33.50 in cash for Spirit shares, which closed at $24.30 yesterday. But antitrust regulators could derail the merger or demand stiff concessions.\nSenator Joe Manchin, in a reversal, agrees to action on a climate and tax plan.The West Virginia Democrat said he would supportincluding hundreds of billions of dollars for climate and energy programsand tax increases in a package to subsidize health care and lower drug costs, less than two weeks after upending hopes for such a deal. It\u2019s not clear what changed his mind.\nThe Senate passes the CHIPS Act to bolster American chip-making.The bill would provide $280 billion toexpand U.S. manufacturing and technological abilities, including $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits for companies that manufacture silicon chips domestically.\nA Berkshire Hathaway-owned lending unit will pay $20 million to settle a redlining suit.State and federal prosecutors accused Trident Mortgage ofdiscouraging people in nonwhite neighborhoods of Philadelphia from applying for home loans. The Justice Department called the settlement the second largest in its history.\nStellantis, maker of the Jeep, Peugeot and Fiat brands, reports a record profit.The automaker said this morning that its profits rose by a third, to 8 million euros,buoyed by higher North American margins. Automakers includingFord and General Motorshave also benefited from high prices for new vehicles, but inflation has pushed up the cost of materials and parts.\nA new bill being introduced in Congress today seeks to use the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to limit the spread of guns. The bill would allow the F.T.C. to investigate gunmakers for deceptive advertising practices. That is something the agency is charged with doing for other industries, but has been forbidden from doing with gun manufacturers, which have long enjoyed extra protections from Washington.\nIt is the latest front in the fight in Washington over gun control after the mass shooting in Uvalde.The bill is being sponsored by Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, and Representative Robin Kelly, Democrat of Illinois and vice chair of the congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. It calls for the F.T.C. to file a report to Congress in a year\u2019s time identifying ads that are designed to appeal to those under 18, feature semiautomatic assault weapons or imply or encourage an illegal use of guns.\nGun control advocates have been calling for the F.T.C. to investigate gunmakers for years,without success. The bill, which has a fair chance of passing in the House but is likely to face challenges in the Senate, could influence the F.T.C. to bring cases against gunmakers even if it does not become law. \u201cThis bill finally subjects the gun industry and its advertising practices to the oversight and scrutiny we apply to other industries, holds companies accountable for marketing to kids, and makes clear that there are consequences for deceptively hawking weapons of war to impressionable consumers,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said in a statement.\nThe F.T.C. yesterday sued Meta, the social media giant once known as Facebook, to block it from buying Within, a virtual reality start-up. It\u2019s the first antitrust lawsuit against a tech behemoth sinceLina Khantook charge of the commission. It\u2019s also the first to test one of the tenets of Khan\u2019s new brand of antitrust enforcement, namely that the tech giants should be stopped not just from further consolidating their markets, but also from muscling into new ones.\nThe suit puts Khan on a collision course with Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s C.E.O. Zuckerberg has staked the future of the company on the growth of virtual and augmented reality, a transition that is looking more urgentas its ad sales slump. This suit could crimp his metaverse ambitions,write The Times\u2019s David McCabe and Mike Isaac.\nMeta said the case was \u201cbased on ideology and speculation.\u201dIt\u2019s also a risk for Khan. Regulators have traditionally focused on policing deals that combine two large companies already locked in competition. And courts have been hesitant to block mergers solely based on the idea that if no deal were done, the two companies would become competitors. But the F.T.C. claims in its suit that Facebook should be forced to win over customers on its own, rather than leverage its profit and dominant position in social networking in order to buy out competition in a new market.\nFor Khan, just bringing the case could be seen as a win.Suing Facebook begins to lay the groundwork for the reframing of competition law that she is pushing for. \u201cIt\u2019s a riskier case, but one they think is worth bringing because if they succeed it will help bring the frontier of enforcement outward,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman.\n\u2014 Georg von Nolcken, chief executive of Continental Farmers Group in Ukraine.The country\u2019s farmers are skepticalthat a deal with Russia to resume grain exports will hold.

But their app stores are gateways to crypto, and they are under fresh scrutiny after the authorities raised alarms about a rash of scams that have cost investors more than $40 million. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, sent letters yesterday to Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple that were shared exclusively with DealBook, asking the chief executives to explain how their companies screened for scammers.\nCyber criminals create apps with the names and logos of legitimate businessesto lure investors, the F.B.I. warned inan advisorylast week, citing such apps on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

        "title": "Apple Continues to Grow, but Profits Drop as Costs Rise",
        "fulltext": "For years, Apple has surged behind large-scale manufacturing and rising sales in China. But, lately, the tech giant\u2019s reliance on the world\u2019s most populous country has veered from a strength to a vulnerability.\nChina\u2019s efforts this spring to combat Covid-19 disrupted iPad production and damaged retail sales across the country, denting Apple\u2019s earnings and contributing to its first profit decline in nearly two years.\nOn Tuesday, Apple reported a rise in sales of 2 percent, to $82.96 billion for the three months that ended in June \u2014 at least $4 billion less than the company said it would have collected had it avoided Covid-related shutdowns of factories in Shanghai. The company said profits fell 10.6 percent to $19.4 billion, its largest quarterly decline since 2019.\nApple was able to minimize the fallout from China because of its strategic shift in recent years from selling more devices to selling more software and services. Though combined sales of products such as iPhones, iPads and Macs declined in the most recent quarter, the company generated $19.6 billionin the quarter from sales of apps and Apple Music and Apple TV+ subscriptions. The 12-percent increase in sales of services was the smallest quarterly gain for that business in two and a half years.\nThe results exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts who had predicted a decline in iPhone sales. Apple signaled that it was optimistic about the current quarter, saying it expects its sales growth to accelerate and supply chain challenges to ease.\n\u201cTim Cook and crew threaded the needle masterfully,\u201d said Mike Frazier, the president of Bedell Frazier, a Bay Area-based firm with $600 million under management that counts Apple among its top holdings. But Mr. Frazier said it was clear that even the affluent Apple customer can cut spending a bit, which will most likely squeeze profitability in the future.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, bet big on China, consolidating the vast majority of the company\u2019s manufacturing inside a country known for its lower-cost labor and business-friendly policies. After the coronavirus outbreak began there in 2019, Apple shut down iPhone production and lost sales. It later benefited from steady production as China got the virus under control while many Western countries struggled with outbreaks.\nButChina\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d policy, which led it to shut down Shanghaiin the spring to quell an outbreak, exposed again the risks of Apple\u2019s reliance on the country to produce and export its devices. In the most recent quarter, the production disruptions meantApple was unable to benefit fully from the release of MacBooks with more powerful processors, some of which were put on back order until August.\n\u201cInvestors are concerned about the connection to China,\u201d said Dave Harden, the chief investment officer at Summit Global, a firm near Salt Lake City with about $2 billion under investment. It also counts Apple among its holdings. \u201cThey want to know: Is Apple ever going to develop the iPhone outside of that part of the world?\u201d\nApple shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nApple\u2019s mixed results for the quarter were emblematic of the broader trends buffeting the global economy. Revenue declined 1 percent in China,where the country\u2019s economy grew at its slowest pace since early 2020, but sales rose in the Americas,where retail spending has been resilientin the face of inflation increases.\nThe slowing economy will test Apple\u2019s decade of growth. It sailed through the Great Recession behind the introduction of the iPhone, which would become the best-selling product in history. But it has transitioned in recent years from revolutionary innovations in its products to incremental improvements, leading analysts and investors to question whether customers will put off buying new devices in leaner financial times.\nApple relies on the iPhone for about half of its total sales. It has broadened its customer base in recent years by offering seven models ranging in price from $429 to more than $1,500. The premium prices mean Apple\u2019s customers tend to be more affluent than the average smartphone buyer, but about a third of them earn less than $50,000 a year, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a tech research firm.\nOther tech giants, including Google\u2019s parent company,Alphabet, and Facebook\u2019s parent company,Meta, have responded to the economic downturn by announcing they will slow hiring. Their changes come as business has slowed after a rapid expansion during the pandemic."
