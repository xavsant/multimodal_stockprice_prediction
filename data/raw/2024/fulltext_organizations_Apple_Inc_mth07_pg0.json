        "fulltext": "Times Insiderexplains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\nSome journalists have broad beats \u2014animals,the entire state of California,even the cosmos.\nTripp Mickle, however, focuses on just one company: Apple. But there\u2019s still more than enough to write about. Since joining the Business desk at The New York Times in April 2022, Mr. Mickle has reported onApple\u2019s flashy new Vision Pro headset,its foray into artificial intelligenceand the ongoingantitrust case against the company, which has been accused by U.S. regulators of running a smartphone monopoly.\nDespite having a specific beat, Mr. Mickle\u2019s work still finds a wide audience. \u201cIt\u2019s this incredible company that has such influence in our lives,\u201d Mr. Mickle said in an interview. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a fortress of secrecy.\u201d\nBefore writing for The Times, he dabbled in other topics, including NASCAR for Sports Business Journal, and the tobacco and alcohol industries for The Wall Street Journal. It was during his time at The Journal that Mr. Mickle decided to take a bite of the Apple beat.\nIn a phone conversation from his home in the Glen Park district of San Francisco, Mr. Mickle discussed how his beat has changed over the years and his experience staking out the offices of OpenAI. These are edited excerpts.\nWhat made you decide to become a journalist?\nI\u2019ve wanted to become a journalist since I was in the fifth grade. I had a teacher who gave ribbons to students at the end of the year that tried to predict what you would pursue professionally in the future. Some of the ribbons were jokes, and some of them were serious. I was really obsessed with current events, and I liked writing, so she gave me a ribbon that read \u201cfuture editor at The New York Times.\u201d That became a point of direction for me as I looked out on the horizon and tried to figure out what to do.\nCan you explain your beat to readers?\nI cover Apple and now, Nvidia. One of the most fascinating things about the technology industry is that, without fail, it changes almost every three years thematically. There was a period when the major theme was regulators scrutinizing big tech firms. Now the entire tech industry has changed because of the introduction of ChatGPT and the rush to develop generative A.I.\nMore broadly, I\u2019ll also write an occasional story about what\u2019s happening in the business of A.I. For example,I recently wrote about how consultantsat firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group are making money from the rush to develop generative A.I.\nWhat are some of the biggest challenges of your beat?\nThe biggest challenge is always getting people to talk. Apple has what I call a culture of corporate omert\u00e0, where they collectively take a vow of secrecy and don\u2019t talk about the work that they\u2019re doing. That makes it really challenging to write about the company in a way that\u2019s illuminating for readers. You have to find people who are willing to open up and share stories about their work.\nDo you have an article that you\u2019re particularly proud of?\nThe most thrilling story that I\u2019ve had a chance to work on since I\u2019ve been at The Times was theOpenAI saga around Sam Altman\u2019sdismissal and return. The story played out over five intense days. It\u2019s rare when you\u2019re at a newspaper to get a chance to cover a story that a bunch of people are working on collectively. There were elements of the story that moved so fast that we were writing up to three pieces a day over a five-day period.\nThere was one Sunday when Sam was meeting with officials at the company. Their headquarters are in the Mission District of San Francisco, and we needed somebody to go stake out the headquarters and observe. I spent a day in my car in the neighborhood, like a cop on a stakeout, hoping that I could divine what was going to play out in this very upside-down scenario where the C.E.O. was trying to get back into the company that he helped found.\nDid you spot Sam?\nI did not catch a sighting of Sam, but I was able to talk to some employees as they were leaving. I interviewed a former board member outside the building. I also observed that the company ordered a ton of boba tea. I saw three deliveries at one point. There was this tongue-in-cheek joke about OpenAI\u2019s obsession with boba. It was almost like their celebratory drink for Sam\u2019s return. If I hadn\u2019t been there to observe it, it wouldn\u2019t have made its way into the newspaper.\nHow has your coverage changed over the years?\nApple has reached a stage of maturation where it is still leaning on products that are familiar while trying to transition into a new future. It\u2019s taking various swings, so my coverage is more about scrutinizing that potential and promise, and less on the devices in our pockets. This year, it\u2019s centered more on theVision Pro, a virtual reality headset that Apple developed, and the company\u2019s plan torevamp Siriand make it more of a vehicle for artificial intelligence.\nWhat are your favorite and least favorite parts of living in the San Francisco Bay Area?\nThe proximity to so many amazing and beautiful places, whether it\u2019s Lake Tahoe, Napa, Sonoma, Point Reyes or Santa Cruz. San Francisco itself is stunning. You can be on a hiking trail within 30 minutes.\nMy least favorite thing is just the absurdity of life in San Francisco. You see some ridiculous things from time to time. I didn\u2019t see this in person, but this month,there were two nudists in the Castrodistrict who rescued a tourist from a man who was wielding a blowtorch. Things like that happen here."

        "title": "How to Clean Up Your Phone\u2019s Photo Library to Free Up Space",
        "fulltext": "Are you getting ominous warnings about your phone\u2019s storage? Have you ever whipped out your phone to show someone a certain photo and had to scroll for minutes to find it? If you\u2019ve accumulated gigabytes of images over the years, streamlining your photo library and dumping other unnecessary apps and files can let you reclaim that space. Here\u2019s a guide to doing just that by using free tools that are probably already on your phone.\nStart your cleanup process by noting the space on your device \u2014 and what\u2019s filling it up.\nOn manyAndroid devices, open the Settings app and select Storage to check your available space.\nOn a Samsung Galaxy device, open the Settings app, select either Device Care or Device Maintenance and then tap Storage. On some phones, you can scroll right down to Storage.\nOn an iPhone,open the Settings app and select General and then iPhone Storage to see the amount of space left on your phone. The steps are similar for an iPad.\nZapping identical copies of photos is an easy way to reclaim turf. While subscription apps for rounding up duplicate files of all types are available (likeDuplicates Cleanerfor Android orPhone Cleanerfor iOS), consider the free options on your phone.\nIn Apple\u2019siOS Photosapp, tap the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen and scroll down to the Utilities area. TapDuplicates. The next screen shows the photos and videos with multiple copies in your library, all next to a Merge button. The Merge option preserves the highest-resolution copy (and embedded information) and moves the lesser versions to the app\u2019sRecently Deletedalbum.\nSamsung hasa similar toolfor tracking down duplicate files on its Galaxy devices. Tap the My Files icon and choose Analyze Storage from the menu. On the next screen, select Duplicate Files to see the list.\nGoogle Photoshas a duplicate-detection feature designed to spot an identical photo and prevent it from being added to the library. With Google\u2019sFilesapp for Android \u2014free in the Play storeif it hasn\u2019t already been installed \u2014 you can quicklycheck for photo duplicatesandget other file-deletion suggestions.\nOpen the Files app, tap the Menu icon in the upper-left corner and choose Clean. The next screen offers a variety of things you can delete to conserve space, including any duplicates, downloads, screenshots, little-used apps and large files.\nIt can be tedious, but scrolling back and deleting the duds by hand is a precise way to prune your pictures and videos. If you have a huge library, breaking up the project into daily sessions when you\u2019re on mass transit (or otherwise waiting around) whittles down your collection incrementally. Don\u2019t forget to also check any third-party photo apps that store pictures.\nA deleted photo doesn\u2019t evaporate immediately. Most systems keep all recently deleted photos and videos around for at least 30 days before permanent deletion, unless you manually empty the trash or deleted-items folder.\nIf you have photos you want to preserve and don\u2019t useonline backup, export copies to a computer via email,Android Quick Share,Apple\u2019s AirDropor another transfer method. (And be sure you havea backup systemin place for your computer.)\nNeed more help? Apple\u2019ssupport site has tips, and the iPhone Storage screenoffers recommendationsfor purging old files and apps.Samsung\u2019s sitehas ideas for Galaxy owners. In the user account settings, Google Photos hasFree Up SpaceandManage Storagetools that list files to review and delete.\nSuggestions typically include relocating your photos from the phone to an online server or toan external SD memory cardif your phone has a card slot, which lets you regain the space on your phone when you offload the files.\nApple\u2019siCloud for Photos,Google Photos,Samsung Cloudor a service likeDropboxfrees up space because the device is not physically storing the files, even though you can see the images on it. You get acomplimentary amountof space to start, but must pay for more once you fill it.\nWhen you delete a backed-up or synced photo \u2014on an iPhone, inGoogle Photosor wherever \u2014 it disappears on all the devices connected to that account.\nAfter cleaning the photo library, you can further organize it. For years, Android and iOS have beenautomatically grouping imagestogether into albums based on who\u2019s in them, where they were taken and other factors, but you can also create your own collections.\nTo move pictures into your own albumsin Google Photos, Samsung\u2019sGallery appor Apple\u2019sPhotos, tap the option for a new album, name it and select the pictures you want to add to it. Apple\u2019s Photos can alsocreate foldersand then make separate albums inside those folders for grouping similar albums together.\nYes, it takes time to declutter your device, but you\u2019ll be able to find your pictures faster when you want to show them off and have room to install more stuff."

        "title": "Your Driving App Is Leading You Astray",
        "fulltext": "On my way to Kennedy International Airport, I grip the wheel tightly, swerving across three lanes of expressway traffic at 50 miles per hour to reach the exit. Minutes later, still shaken from my move, I hear a cheerful, disembodied voice instructing me to re-enter the expressway I had just exited.\nI curse at my phone.\nIf you use a navigation app, you probably have felt helpless anger when your stupid phone endangers your life, and the lives of all the drivers around you, to potentially shave a minute or two from your drive time. Or maybe it\u2019s stuck you on an ugly freeway when a glorious, ocean-hugging alternative lies a few miles away. Or maybe it\u2019s trapped you on a route with no four-way stops, ignoring a less stressful solution that doesn\u2019t leave you worried about a car barreling out of nowhere.\nFor all the discussion of the many extraordinary ways algorithms have changed our society and our lives, one of the most impactful, and most infuriating, often escapes notice. Dominated by a couple of enormously powerful tech monopolists that have better things to worry about, our leading online mapping systems from Google and Apple are not nearly as good as they could be.\nYou may have heard the extreme stories, such as when navigation apps like Waze and Google Maps apparently steered driversinto lakesand onto impassable dirt roads, or whenjurisdictionsbeg Waze to stop dumping traffic onto their residential streets. But the reality is these apps affect us, our roads and our communities every minute of the day. Primarily programmed to find the fastest route, they endanger and infuriate us on a remarkably regular basis.\nWorse, the promised time savings are often a mirage. There are so many elements included in calculating a route that the estimated time is always a guess. Yet who among us has not seen her estimated arrival time change several times while en route?\nThese products should be calibrated with greater acknowledgment of the uncertainties involved in predicting unexpected slowdowns and road closures. I am firmly of the belief \u2014 which I cannot prove, as our tech overlords refuse to share data with us \u2014 that the algorithms are often optimizing for time savings that are smaller than their margin of error.\nI shouldn\u2019t dismiss the fact that digital maps have been transformational and empowering. My father, a mathematician and mapmaker, helped build the first digital maps for early GPS navigation systems. When map apps arrived on my phone, we put away paper maps with a sigh of relief.\nNow, however, we have all become so reliant on online maps that we havelostthedeep knowledgethat allows us to make our own calculations of an optimal route. And these maps don\u2019t seem to have changed very much since Google bought its competitor Waze; the company now commands anestimated more than 80 percent of the navigation app market share. (Google has prevailed, so far, in a long-running antitrust effort claiming it abused its map monopoly.)\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. A navigation app could consider factors such as the safety impact of changing many lanes with little notice. Imagine instructing the app to avoid jumping on and off highways, or to take the scenic route if the added driving time is under 10 percent. To be clear, this type of customization is possible. Porsche offers in itsnavigation appa choice of routes \u201ctailored to your driving style,\u201d defined as \u201ccurvy,\u201d \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cbalanced.\u201d The open source projectValhallaoffers dozens of ways to optimize routing algorithms with options such as prioritizing fewer turns or routes with car pool lanes. (Unfortunately, it\u2019s too difficult technically for most laypeople to use.)\n\u201cIt would be wonderful if the primary infrastructure that drives our society was built with the right values \u2014 it\u2019s just not,\u201d says Mikel Maron, a geographer and longtime contributor toOpenStreetMap, the so-called Wikipedia of maps, which is built by volunteers and whose data provides a base layer for many other maps and navigation apps.\nOn a recent trip to Chicago, I couldn\u2019t get my app to offer me the option to take the beautiful Lake Shore Drive on Lake Michigan along my route. It only offered me the Dan Ryan Expressway, a 14-lane leviathan. Sure, it was theoretically a minute or two faster, but it is also an unpleasant experience filled with 18-wheelers and prone to accidents and slowdowns.\nThe best hope for competition relies on the success of OpenStreetMap. Its data underpins most maps other than Google, includingAmazon,FacebookandApple, but it is so under-resourced that it only recently hired paid systems administrators to ensure its back-end machines kept running.\nFor a vibrant consumer navigational ecosystem to emerge, society needs to invest in OpenStreetMap as a public good. The giant corporations that rely on its maps should stop freeloading and use some of their hundreds of billions of dollars to support the project. City planners should dedicate staffers to updating their roads and bridges on OpenStreetMap. Communities should submit updates with roads and hazards in their local areas.\nIn addition, we can promote competition by using the few available alternatives. To navigate cities with public transit, try apps such asCitymapperthat offer bike, transit and walking directions. Or use the privacy-focusedOrganic Maps.\nAnd when you have to use a popular driving app, take its directions with a huge grain of salt.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Apple Settles E.U. Case by Opening Its Payment Service to Rivals",
        "fulltext": "Apple will for the first time allow banks, payment services and other app developers to use the underlying technology behind Apple Pay to make rival tap-and-go payment services, settling a long-running European Union antitrust investigation, regulators said on Thursday.\nThe agreement applies only in the European Union, where consumers could see an influx of new apps and services to make payments on the go. Apple has until now refused to grant rivals access to the payment technology on iPhones, known as near field communication, essentially forcing people to use Apple Pay.\n\u201cApple has committed to allow rivals to access the \u2018tap and go\u2019 technology of iPhones,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s executive vice president, who oversees competition policy,said in a statement. \u201cIt opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d\nThe settlement stems from an investigation started in 2020 to determine if Apple was abusing its dominant position in the smartphone market to box out rival payment service providers. The announcement on Thursday does not apply to Apple Watch, which also has tap-and-go payment technology, an E.U. spokeswoman said.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nApple\u2019s policy shift shows how tech regulation in the European Union has resulted in notable product changes for products and services used every day by consumers. Earlier this year, Apple agreed to give iPhone and iPad users access to rival app stores for the first time to comply with new competition rules. Google has also changed how it displays certain search results in the European Union, while Meta introduced a new ad-free subscription service forFacebook and Instagram usersin the region.\nThe changes are part of a broad shift in the global technology industry as a result of government policies. Products and services that were once available globally as the same offerings no matter where a person lived are now being altered or removed from certain markets as a result of regulations. For example, Apple said it would not release its latest artificial intelligence service in the European Union because of regulatory uncertainty, and TikTok islegally barredfrom India.\nIn Europe, the regulatory scrutiny is only expected to intensify. Apple was recently charged in another case with violating E.U. competition laws for its policies related to theApp Store. The company is also appealinga 1.8 billion euro finefor thwarting competition in the music streaming market. Google, Meta,Microsoftand TikTok are also under E.U. investigation."
