        "title": "Apple\u2019s App Store Draws Antitrust Scrutiny in European Union",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 Apple\u2019s App Store helped usher in the smartphone economy, leading to the birth of now-ubiquitous services such as Instagram, Uber and Candy Crush, and providing a transformative new way for people to shop from their phones.\nBut for companies that wanted to offer their products through Apple\u2019s digital store, there has always been a catch: To reach customers, they had to agree to Apple\u2019s terms and conditions, including sharing certain data with the company and giving it a percentage of any future sales made through the iPhone or iPad app.\nNow European regulators are questioning whetherApple\u2019sterms go too far.\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of theEuropean Union, said it had opened aformal antitrust investigationto determine if the terms that Apple imposes on app developers violate competition rules. The commission said it had also started aseparate investigationto see whether Apple was boxing out rivals to its mobile payments system, Apple Pay.\nIn both Brussels and Washington, officials have beenscrutinizing the power of the world\u2019s largest technology platforms.Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are being investigated by antitrust authorities over their growing power, particularly their position as gatekeepers upon which other companies depend on to reach customers.\n\u201cApple obtained a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple\u2019s popular devices,\u201d saidMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice presidentin charge of competition policy. \u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\u201d\nThe case against Apple arises from acomplaint made last year by Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store. Spotify argued that the fee constituted a tax that violated competition laws and merited an investigation. In March, the European Commission said an e-book and audiobook distributor, which it didn\u2019t identify, had filed a similar complaint.\n\u201cAt the heart of our case is the fact that Apple acts as the stadium owner, referee and player, and tilts the playing field in favor of its own services,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThis case is not just about Spotify. The commission\u2019s decision to take on this case against Apple is an important first step toward developing new rules of the road that will govern the conduct of online platforms for years to come.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, European authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the complaints had merit.\nJosh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, said the company disagreed with the European Commission\u2019s decision to start the investigations, describing the complaints that it is breaking antitrust laws as \u201cbaseless.\u201d The company has defended its tight control of the App Store as a means to preserve quality, privacy and security.\n\u201cThroughout our history, Apple has created groundbreaking new products and services in some of the most fiercely competitive markets in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe follow the law in everything we do, and we embrace competition at every stage because we believe it pushes us to deliver even better results.\u201d\nAmerican investigations of Big Tech\u2019s power, including those by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, have tended to lump Apple in with Google, Facebook and Amazon. ButApple was thought to be at the least risk of punishment there because its business practices appeared to be less problematic than its closest peers.\nBut now Europe\u2019s formal investigations show Apple still faces at least one big regulatory fight.\nIn Europe, the world\u2019s largest technology companies have long been viewed with suspicion as they have consolidated power over the digital economy. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from Apple, worth about $14.7 billion today. The antitrust authorities have also issued billions of dollars in fines against Google for antitrust violations in recent years, while Amazon andFacebookare also facingfresh scrutiny.\nSpotify has been discussing Apple\u2019s practices with European regulators for about five years, according to a person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private. Tuesday\u2019s announcement is a major milestone, yet the commission could still spend a year or more investigating the company\u2019s practices before determining whether to bring charges.\nSince Spotify madeits formal complaint in Europein March 2019, regulators have been considering how to show harm from Apple\u2019s actions, according to the person involved. They eventually concluded that Apple\u2019s 30 percent share of some revenues collected via the App Store raised competitors\u2019 costs, eventually leading to higher prices for consumers, this person said.\nSpotify said it had raised its monthly subscription price to $13 from $10 in 2014 to make up for Apple\u2019s cut. A year later, Apple introduced its streaming-music competitor, Apple Music, priced at $10 a month. Spotify then decided to pull out of the App Store payment system, restricting Apple from taking a share and prompting Spotify to drop its price back to $10 a month. It then became more complicated to sign up for Spotify\u2019s paid service; customers now have to go to a website instead of simply tapping a button in the app.\nApple has faced other scrutiny of how it uses its influence over the App Store. For years it has packed the top of many App Store search results with its own apps, even when they were less popular or relevant than competitors\u2019 offerings, according toan investigation by The New York Times. In 2018, Apple also beganrestricting or removing many popular appsthat helped people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones, just after Apple released competing tools. After the makers of two parental-control apps complained to European regulators and The Times reported on Apple\u2019s moves,Apple quietly reversed its policyand let the apps back into the App Store.\nIn addition to App Store policies, European authorities are investigating Apple Pay, which allows people to make purchases within apps or in shops with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The questions surround requirements companies must agree to when integrating Apple Pay into apps or websites. The commission said it would review how the company controlled access to \u201ctap and go\u201d technology for rival payment systems on Apple devices.\n\u201cIt is important that Apple\u2019s measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\nThe Apple investigations are part of a multifront challenge that the biggest tech companies are grappling with around the world.\nIn Germany and Britain, lawmakers are debating changes to antitrust laws that would make it easier for the authorities to bring tech cases. European Union officials are exploring a digital services law with wide-ranging implications, including potential liability rules for harmful content spread on social media, as well as expanded powers for regulators to quickly step in against what they conclude are unfair business practices. Australia, India and Brazil are also cracking down.\nSpotify said that federal and state regulators in the United States had approached the company about Apple and that it had provided information, but that it expects real action to come in Europe.\nGene Kimmelman, a former chief counsel of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said Europe continued to lead on enforcement.\n\u201cEurope is moving much more quickly and much more aggressively with both antitrust and regulation,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cI think the U.S. will respond to that.\u201d\nAdam Satariano reported from London, and Jack Nicas from Centerville, Mass."

        "fulltext": "It has been five years sinceAppleintroduced its Watch \u2014 a smartwatch that over the years has producedpraise,complaints,confusionand evencomedy.\nTo mark this milestone, we asked a few experts what impact the device has had on the public, the watch universe and even their own lives. Their comments were edited and condensed.\nAn independent Apple analyst based in Connecticut and founder of Above Avalon, a subscription-based Apple analysis site\nComputing on the wrist becomes a reality\nUnwieldy comparisons between it and the iPhone placed high expectations on Apple Watch at launch. As a result, many have had difficulty seeing how Apple Watch has ushered in a paradigm shift in computing by changing the way we use technology.\nThis shift has manifested itself in three areas: seamless tracking and monitoring, intelligent assisting and contextual awareness. With seamless tracking and monitoring, the Apple Watch tracks one\u2019s fitness and more important, health, in a nonintrusive and intuitive way that isn\u2019t possible with nonwearable devices.\nIn terms of intelligent assisting, wearing a computer on the wrist has shown the value found in having a digital assistant push small amounts of information and data to the user throughout the day instead of having the user pull data from smartphones and tablets. And a device that is always on us can enhance our surroundings by using our location and activity to deliver contextual experiences.\nBy allowing people to get more out of technology without having it take over their lives, the Apple Watch has earned a spot on 75 million wrists. With the product category bringing in about $12 billon per year, computing on the wrist is no longer about potential or promise. Rather, it\u2019s reality.\nA consulting psychiatrist and co-founder of Cognacity, a mental health practice in London\nA newly self-aware consumer\nWhen you\u2019re busy, you don\u2019t take time to stop and analyze your behavior, so one of the key things people have to develop if they want to take positive steps to look after themselves is self-awareness. This is what the Apple Watch and the smartwatch category have given us.\nThrough the gathering of data, such as the number of steps we take each day, smartwatches give us an opportunity to change our behavior. The question is now becoming \u201cHow do we sustain that change?\u201d The secret is in incremental or marginal gains, as we see in performance psychology.\nAs Apple Watch has become more complex, it can track more and more data, and from this people are able to make sensible decisions. If you\u2019re motivated to use this in the right way, it can be very beneficial. Of course, for the small percentage of the population whose baseline anxiety is raised, you can see how the integration of this data into their lives could be problematic.\nOver all, Apple Watch has had a positive impact on our behavior. Now we need the developers to build in signposting to health care professionals.\nTransport and technology editor, Wallpaper magazine\nBut is it a desirable design object?\nWith the first Apple Watch, the company was stepping tentatively into a market sector that it couldn\u2019t create, upend, revolutionize or reboot. It was the first time that Apple Inc. depended primarily on its own cachet to succeed with a product.\nBy 2015, smartphone ubiquity and utility had overcome the status-defining role of the iPhone. The Apple Watch offered customers two things: the extension of a tried-and-tested operating system and the ethos of the brand distilled into a desirable, wearable object. The design, with help from the design superstar Marc Newson, struggled to stand out in a sea of copycat devices, walking a rather uneven line between the purism of the iPhone and the fetishistic, fidgety qualities of a mechanical watch.\nThe now, rather unfashionable idea was to elevate tech tothe status of fashion, especially with the ambitiously priced Gold Edition.\nAs the OS and hardware has matured, the Apple Watch has evolved into a peerless lifestyle device. With a choice of case, strap, size and watch face, it far exceeds the company\u2019s traditional tight grip on design. To succeed, Apple had to lose a little bit of control.\nManager of editorial products at the online watch platform Hodinkee, based in New York City\nAnd how has it affected the traditional watch market?\nIt\u2019s honestly hard to imagine the watch world without the Apple Watch.\nBefore it was released in 2015, the traditional watch industry was doing a lot of hand-wringing about it. Depending on who you asked, the watch was either the second coming of the quartz crisis that devastated the industry in the 1970s, or a total nonplayer that wouldn\u2019t catch on and couldn\u2019t hope to threaten \u201creal watches\u201d (whatever that means).\nFast forward half a decade, and it\u2019s safe to say that there has been no better news for the makers of traditional watches than the Apple Watch. If you make quartz fashion watches that compete in the same price segment, you\u2019re in trouble, but otherwise, the Apple Watch has made watches a part of daily conversations all over the world again.\nA design engineer \u2014 and marathon runner \u2014 who lives in Swindon, England\nThe device that could save your life?\nApple Watch saved my life. Last year, my fianc\u00e9e, Clarice, gave me the watch for my 30th birthday. We were training for a marathon, and the idea with the watch was to track our progress.\nDuring training, I started having what I thought were heart palpitations. So I did an electrocardiogram with the watch and it flagged up atrial fibrillation. Nine days before the race, I went to hospital, and the doctors ran some tests and told me not to run the marathon. If I\u2019d run it, that could have been it.\nAfter some more tests, I went to see a consultant, and a week later I was on the operating table having open-heart surgery to repair a damaged mitral valve. Seven weeks later, we got married.\nThat wasn\u2019t the end of it, though. Even after surgery, the watch was reporting irregular heart-rate patterns. After further tests, I was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease.\nI wrote to Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, to let him know his watch \u2014 and my wife \u2014 saved my life and that, for as long as he makes one, I\u2019ll be wearing an Apple Watch."

        "title": "Apple to Ditch Intel Chips in Macs as It Consolidates Its Power",
        "fulltext": "Apple confirmed on Monday that it would design the processors inside its new Mac computers, ditching Intel, its partner of 15 years, andcompleting a yearslong effortto control the core components underpinning its main devices.\nApple said that the first Macs with Apple chips would arrive by year\u2019s end, and that the full transition from Intel to Apple chips would take two years.\nApple\u2019s move, announced at the start of its annual developers conference, is the latest sign of the growing power and independence of the biggest tech companies.\nMaking the silicon chips that power computers has been a multibillion-dollar industry for decades, creating giants like Intel that built their businesses by supplying PC makers with the processors for their devices.\nWhile companies like Dell and HP still rely on Intel for the chips inside their laptops, Apple has become large enough to design and produce its own silicon with the help of Asian chip-making partners. Apple already made custom chips for iPhones, iPads and the Apple Watch, andnow it will do so for its final major product line: the Mac.\n\u201cWhen we make bold changes, it\u2019s for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said during a recorded video announcing the change on Monday. \u201cWhen we look ahead, we envision some amazing new products, and transitioning to our own custom silicon is what will enable us to bring them to life.\u201d\nJohny Srouji, the head of Apple\u2019s chip team, said in the video that Apple\u2019s processors would make Mac computers faster and more powerful, while consuming less power. Apple, Microsoft and Adobe have already transitioned many of their Mac apps to the new chips, Apple said, and developers will be given tools to make their software work on the new computers, too.\nThe most noticeable change for Mac users: IPhone and iPad apps will work directly on Mac computers with the Apple chips, with few if any changes needed by their developers.\nApple\u2019s Mac chips are expected to be built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the partner Apple uses to build similar components it designs for iPhones and iPads \u2014 an arrangement much like Apple\u2019s use of Foxconn to assemble iPhones.\nLosing Apple as a customer is a symbolic hit, as well as a financial one. Intel sells to Apple about $3.4 billion in chips for Macs each year, or less than 5 percent of Intel\u2019s annual sales, according to C.J. Muse, an Evercore analyst.\n\u201cIntel remains focused on delivering the most advanced PC experiences and a wide range of technology choices that redefine computing,\u201d the company said in a statement. Intel-powered computers give users \u201cthe best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers.\u201d\nWith the full transition to take two years, Mr. Cook said Apple still had several Intel-based Macs in its product pipeline.\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference is the company\u2019s annual get-together with the entrepreneurs and programmers who make the apps and services that run on iPhones, iPads and Macs. Apple uses the weeklong event to tell developers about its new software, teach them new tools and further cultivate them as Apple loyalists.\nWith this year\u2019s conference fully virtual for the first time, Apple already had a challenge. But then last week,the hot topic in tech circlesbecame Apple\u2019s control over its App Store and the fees and rules it enforces on app developers.\nThe European Unionannounced an antitrust investigationinto how Apple wields its control over the App Store, responding to a complaint from Spotify. The music-streaming service has protested Apple\u2019s strict rules on Spotify\u2019s iPhone app, including that Apple collects 30 percent of the revenue from many Spotify subscribers.\nOne of Apple\u2019s most outspoken developersalso complainedthat Apple had restricted his new email app because it didn\u2019t allow people to subscribe via Apple\u2019s payment system, preventing Apple from collecting its cut of sales.\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management tool, compared Apple\u2019s moves against his Hey email app to a \u201cMafioso\u201d breaking a store owner\u2019s windows in order to collect his tax. Apple said it was merely enforcing years-old rules that all developers follow.\nAfter a weeklong back-and-forth, Apple eventually approved a new version of the Hey app, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said. Apple said it would temporarily allow the app while it worked to comply with the rules, while Basecamp came up with a workaround so it still wouldn\u2019t have to pay Apple a cut of its sales.\nOn Monday, Apple did not mention the spat, nor did it directly address its App Store rules or financial relationship with developers.\nYet Apple did announce a new feature that could further upset many developers: App Clips, a way for iPhone owners to basically use an app without having to download it. For the feature to work in many cases, users would sign in and pay for an app\u2019s services with Apple\u2019s proprietary systems, further entrenching Apple between businesses and their customers \u2014 a central complaint of many app developers.\nMany iPhone users, however, will probably like the feature; it means they will have to download fewer apps, with privacy policies they haven\u2019t read or don\u2019t understand.\nOn the privacy front, Apple made three significant moves in its new iPhone software, set for this fall. Apps will have to get permission from iPhone owners to track them across other apps and the web. Apps must clearly say what data they collect and share about a user, before they are downloaded. And iPhone owners can choose to share just their approximate location with apps.\nThose changes could have the biggest long-term impact of any of Apple\u2019s announcements on Monday. They could sharply reduce the amount of data many apps collect about their users, which would hamper their advertising-based business models. Apple has benefited from the digital economy\u2019s slow shift away from advertising and toward subscriptions; Apple takes a cut of many of the subscriptions sold in the App Store.\nDon Clark contributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nFor the free-speech absolutists out there, let me point you to a corner of the digital world that embraces its utter lack of free expression: Apple\u2019s app stores.\nApple alone decides what apps you can download on your iPhone, iPad and Mac. The company reviews every line of software code and is happy to block any app that it believespromotes harmful behavior, isin poor taste,enables surveillance, or is trying tosteal moneyoryour data.\nThere are dangers to apps being subject to Apple\u2019s whims. But the success of the app storefronts \u2014 and online hangouts like Snapchat that alsodon\u2019t pretend to be anything-goes havens of freedom\u2014 show that the public sometimes embraces companies dictating what people can say and do inside their virtual walls. You \u2014 yes, you! \u2014 are probably not universally against digital censorship.\nFrom the day the iPhone app storeopened, employees reviewed and tested apps before making them available to the public. The vetting gave people confidence that apps were safe and worthy of their consideration. Google\u2019s Android storefront also screens apps, but is generally more permissive. Applesaidlast year that it reviewed 100,000 apps weekly and rejected about 40 percent.\nThere are downsides to Apple\u2019s absolute app authority. In China, Apple\u2019s control at times has enabled the government to block apps it believes break its laws. That has included some news apps, including The New York Times.\nIn addition, app makers gripe about the process, the reasons for rejections, as well as the fees Apple charges for apps on the store. They also question whether Appleshuts out their appsormakes them harder to findbecause the company wants to help its own apps orinternet services. The makers of a new email service, which my colleague Brian X. Chenreviewed, arefuriousabout what they say are Apple\u2019s capricious reasons for blocking the app.\nEuropean regulators are investigating whether Apple\u2019s terms go too far, my Times colleaguesreportedthis week. Apple hassaidit worked to make people trust the app store and offer app makers a good business opportunity. The company said there was no basis to complaints that it was violating European competition laws.\nBut few credible people say that Apple should let anyone and anything into its app stores, at least in the way that some people argue for a Wild West on social media. The fight we\u2019re having \u2014 appropriately \u2014 is over the terms of Apple\u2019s censorship zones. (The freewheeling internet gives Apple some cover here.)\nIt\u2019s time to stop debating whether we want powerful gatekeepers vetting information. We do. We don\u2019t want people to be able to shout the proverbial \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater, and we don\u2019t want terrorists, stalkers, dangerous conspiracy theorists and authoritarians to have free rein on the internet.\nLet\u2019s move past simplistic free-speech arguments. The real debate is how we make sure that powerful gatekeepers exercise their authority effectively, fairly and with accountability.\nI promise you that I love to argue. But I confess that I\u2019m a little bored arguing about political advertising on Facebook. It feels as if we\u2019re fighting too much about the wrong thing. (This, perhaps, is the theme of today\u2019s newsletter.)\nIf you have been alive and conscious for the last \u2026 forever \u2026 you might have noticed that politicians twist or ignore the truth when they pitch themselves to voters.\nThis has become a much bigger problem in the social media age. Lies can travel farther and faster than ever before.\nThis is a serious problem, and the big internet companies have tried different approaches to tackle it. Twitter hasrefused to acceptpolitical-related advertisements at all, and Facebook has staked out an opposite position that peopleshould be able to evaluate the warts-and-all paid pitches from candidates.\nNow,my colleague Mike Isaac reported, Facebook will start giving people the option to hide from their feeds political ads, commercials about social issues and similar paid messages. It\u2019s a mushy middle ground that, I assure you, will satisfy no one.\nPolitical ads are important because they represent what a candidate most wants voters to know. And it\u2019s fair to say that internet companies shouldn\u2019t financially benefit from false advertisements.\nBut we also can\u2019t lose sight that most of the garbage-fire parts of Facebook are not paid political messages.\nThe Air Force sergeant who sought toorganize violence against law enforcement officialson Facebook had nothing to do with paid political messages.Dangerous health conspiraciesthat spread on Facebook are not paid political messages. And even most of the horrible stuff that politicians say on Facebook are not paid political messages.\nSo, yes, we should be debating how Facebook \u2014 and political candidates \u2014 should best keep voters informed.

        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 For months, British authorities have pursued an app that they promised would help ease the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, despite growing criticism that it posed privacy risks and would not work well.\nOn Thursday, officials abruptly reversed course, saying Britain will join other countries and design a new contact-tracing app based on software provided by Apple and Google.\nThe announcement was an embarrassing turnaround, adding to a string of promises related to the coronavirus that the British government has failed to deliver on. At one point, the government said the contact-tracing technology would be available to the public in May. Now the aim is to have it ready by winter.\nBritish officials had counted on the app, which is intended to alert anyone who may have come near an infected person, such as on a bus or subway, to help lift lockdown orders and prevent a second wave of infections.\nLeadersstuck to a planof building an app in-house even as other countries changed course. Germany and Italy, which both agreed to use Apple and Google\u2019s technology more than a month ago,debuted contact-tracing apps this week.\nBritish public health officials wanted to avoid using the software provided by Apple and Google because it limits the amount of data that can be centrally collected and analyzed \u2014 information they felt was critical in tracking the disease. But the British team struggled to build an app that worked properly without support from the Silicon Valley giants.\nApple and Google, whose iOS and Android operating systems run on nearly every smartphone on the planet, prevented outside apps that did not use their code from taking full advantage of a device\u2019s ability to measure proximity. The companies took this approach in the interests of privacy to prevent governments from creating a database with sensitive health and location information, particularly in countries with fewer civil rights.\nBritish officials argued that access to more data had added public health benefits, such as the ability to spot clusters of infection. But after testing on the Isle of Wight, an effort to build a workaround was abandoned.\n\u201cCountries across the globe have faced challenges in developing an app which gets all of these elements right,\u201d Matt Hancock, Britain\u2019s health secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThrough ongoing international collaboration we hope to learn, improve and find a solution which will strengthen our global response to this virus.\u201d\nThe reversal, which the government characterized as the \u201cnext phase in development,\u201d was the latest in a string of British mishaps responding to the coronavirus.\nThe government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has faced criticism for struggling to put together an overarching strategy even as the death countapproaches 50,000, making it one of the hardest hit countries, along with the United States and Brazil. A highly touted plan to build an army ofhuman contact tracershas been riddled with problems.\nWithout an effective human or digital infrastructure to help identify clusters of infections as they emerge, the British government is facing questions about the country\u2019s readiness to reopen its beleaguered economy.\nEngland\u2019s manual contact tracing system has faced many challenges.\nAfter working to track down the contacts of confirmed cases in the early days of the pandemic, Britain largely scrapped that plan by March 12, after government scientists said it was no longer practical. Officials have indicated that the government did not have enough testing capacity to keep track of the virus.\nBy the next month, with the death toll soaring and scientists excoriating the government for its response, the government backtracked and promised to reconstitute the system for England.\nSince then, the government has built a 25,000-person phalanx of contact tracers, many of them employed by private companies. Health professionals are supposed to call people who test positive for the virus and obtain a list of their recent contacts. Then a lower-level tier of workers calls these people to ask them to isolate themselves.\nBut thousands of infected patients are still being missed, and some are not even being transferred into the contact tracing system at all, according to government figures released on Thursday.\nAnd roughly 90 percent of the contacts of infected patients are being reached not by the newly hired staff members, but rather by existing public health teams charged with handling complex cases in settings like nursing homes and schools.\nAt the same time, development of the contract-tracing app was hobbled by a dispute over privacy and how much data the authorities should be able to collect.\nTechnical specifications from Apple and Google prevent any government from collecting data that could be stored in a centralized database. Instead, the information is stored on an individual\u2019s phone, which occasionally communicates with a server to allow analysis of an anonymous roster of people who have shared their confirmed case of Covid-19. If people have been in touch with an infected person, they will receive an alert urging them to self-quarantine and call a doctor.\nThe contact-tracing apps are meant to speed up the process of identifying people who may have contracted the disease but are not yet showing symptoms, a critical moment when people are most likely to spread it to others. The technology works by using a smartphone\u2019s Bluetooth signal to measure proximity to nearby phones.\nOn Thursday, the government said it would now aim to develop an app more integrated with its tracing system, including allowing people to order a virus test. But in a sign that the app is losing importance among leaders, a government minister said this week that the technology, \u201cisn\u2019t the priority at the moment.\u201d\nThe tracing app is not the first time Britain has been slow to turn away from plans that were widely seen as flawed. In March, the country kept businesses and schools open longer than most other European countries, a period that public health officials now believe cost many lives. It was not until this month that authorities began requiring masks be worn on public transportation.\nNow that Britain has changed course on its contact-tracing app, France is the biggest European country that is developing an app without the help of Apple and Google. Officials there have said private companies should not be allowed to dictate the public health response of a democratically elected government."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Even as Facebook grappled this month withan internal revoltanda cascade of criticismover its refusal to take action on President Trump\u2019s inflammatory posts, the social network was actively making other bets behind the scenes.\nLate one Tuesday, as attention was focused on how Facebook might handle Mr. Trump, the Silicon Valley company said ina brief blog postthat it had invested in Gojek, a \u201csuper app\u201d in Southeast Asia. The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followeda $5.7 billion investmentit recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.\nThe moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile underseafiber-optic cableencircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebookconfirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.\nOther technology giants are engaging in similar behavior. Apple has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. Microsoft has purchased three cloud computing businesses. Amazon is in talks to acquire an autonomous vehicle start-up, has leased more airplanes for delivery and has hired an additional 175,000 people since March. Google hasunveiled newmessaging and video features.\nEven with the global economyreeling from a pandemic-induced recessionand dozens of businesses filing for bankruptcy, tech\u2019s largest companies \u2014 still wildly profitable and flush with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance \u2014 are deliberately laying the groundwork for a future where they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.\nAmazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are aggressively placing new bets as the coronavirus pandemic has made themnear-essential services, with people turning to them to shop online, entertain themselves and stay in touch with loved ones. The skyrocketing use has given the companies new fuel to invest as other industries retrench.\nThe expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe are sounding the alarm over the tech giants\u2019 concentration of power and how that may have hurt competitors and led to other issues, such as spreading disinformation. This week, European Union officials were preparingantitrust charges against Amazonfor using its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals, whileBritain began an inquiryinto Facebook\u2019s purchase of the GIF company.\nSome of the tech behemoths have made little secret of their intention to forge ahead in a recession that has putmore than 44 million Americans out of workand that officials warnwill be protracted.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is keep investing in building the future,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in an investor call last month. \u201cWhen the world changes quickly, people have new needs, and that means there are more new things to build.\u201d\nIn doubling down on growth in a time of economic pain, the largest tech companies are continuing a pattern. In previous recessions, those that invested while the economy was at its most vulnerable often emerged stronger. In the 1990s, IBM used a recession to reorient itself from a hardware company into a software and services company. Google and Facebook both rose out of the dot-com bust about 20 years ago.\nApple, whose iPhones now dominate computing, doubled its research and development budget for two years during the downturn in the early 2000s. That led the company, which nearly went bankrupt in the late 1990s, to create its iPod music player and iTunes music store \u2014 and eventually the iPhone, the App Store andan unbridled growth streak, said Jenny Chatman, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.\nRanjan Roy, a tech commentator forThe Margins, an internet industry blog, said it was clear the tech behemoths were unafraid to get more aggressive now and that the power they were accruing should give people pause.\n\u201cWithout any pushback from regulators, big tech companies would almost unquestionably come out of the pandemic more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many additional parts of our daily lives are becoming dependent on their products, or they could just buy or copy the services they don\u2019t yet deliver.\u201d\nStill, the companies are taking risks by spending in an uncertain period, said John Paul Rollert, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\u201cTo double and even triple down when the casino is on fire is a remarkable move, because they may not even be able to cash in their chips later on,\u201d he said.\nAmazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which declined to or did not respond to requests for comment, have plenty of cash. Combined, they are sitting atop about $557 billion, enabling them to maintain a pace of acquisitions and investments similar to last year\u2019s, when the economy was humming, according to a tally of financial disclosures. They have been among the top corporate spenders on research and development for most of the last decade,accordingto PwC, the big accounting firm.\nThe companies have ramped up their activity since March, when shelter-in-place orders began. As Amazon, Facebook and others adapted to their employees working from home, they experienced a spike in use. Messaging and otherteleconferencing software soaredin popularity.\nThat created opportunities. Microsoft, for one, started promoting its Teams videoconferencing service, which allows people to talk and collaborate online. Microsoft also snapped up three cloud computing companies in the last few months \u2014 Affirmed Networks, Metaswitch Networks and Softomotive \u2014 to offer more technology to businesses.\nGoogle, too, updated products that people can use to work from home. In April, it said that its video chat service, Google Meet, would be easily available inside people\u2019s Gmail windows and free to anyone with a Google account. It also said it would start making listings in its shopping search results mostly free, instead of having merchants pay for all their products to appear in the results, to bolster e-commerce searches.\nAmazon was initially overwhelmed with a surge of online orders andsafety concerns over its warehouse workers. In response, the company added morethan 175,000 jobsto keep up with demand.\nAmazon has since invested further. While aviation all but ground to a halt in the pandemic, the company said this month that it wasadding 12 Boeing 767sto its fleet of more than 70 delivery planes. It also discussedbuying Zoox, an autonomous vehicle start-upvalued at $2.7 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The discussions were earlierreportedby The Wall Street Journal.\nApple, with $193 billion in cash and debt, went on its own buying spree. This year, it bought DarkSky, a popular weather smartphone app; NextVR, a virtual reality company; Voysis, a digital assistant and speech recognition software company; andXnor.ai, an artificial intelligence start-up.\nThe company will soon hold a developer conference virtually and is managing a surge in activity on FaceTime and iMessage as people use those services to communicate in quarantine.\nFacebook\u2019s activity has been the most pronounced. When the coronavirus swept through the United States in March, the social network was inundated with people flocking to its apps to use voice and video chat services. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was \u201cjust trying to keep the lights on.\u201d\nBut the company soon capitalized on the momentum. Mr. Zuckerberg accelerated the building of some products,introducing Messenger Rooms,a group video chat service, in April.\nThat same month, Facebook said it was taking a$5.7 billion stake in India\u2019s Reliance Jio. It was the company\u2019s largest investment in an outside company, giving it more access to one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing digital markets.\n\u201cWe are committed to connecting more people in India together with Jio,\u201d Facebook said of the deal, noting that Jio had brought more than 388 million people online in less than four years.\nLast month,Facebook bought the GIF company Giphyfor an estimated $400 million. Giphy is to be integrated with Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. And last week, the social network invested millions in Gojek. Based in Jakarta, Indonesia, Gojek makes an app for digital payments, transportation and other services that is used by more than 170 million people in Southeast Asia.\nFacebook is now working on the new venture fund, which will help it spot new popular apps. The fund wasreported earlierby Axios.\nIn driving the activity, Mr. Zuckerberg may be taking a cue from a Facebook board member, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. In April, Mr. Andreessen wrote ablog posttitled \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Build\u201d and said, \u201cWe need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors.\u201d\nLess than two weeks later, Mr. Zuckerberg saidon the investor callthat he was doing exactly that: building.\nHe said he felt \u201ca responsibility and duty to invest\u201d and added, \u201cWe\u2019re in a fortunate position to be able to do this.\u201d\nDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.; Karen Weise from Seattle; and Erin Griffith from San Francisco."

        "title": "How Social Media Has Changed Civil Rights Protests",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nOmar Wasow is steeped in both social media and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. And he marvels at how the two have melded in the current demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality.\nWasow, a professor at Princeton University and co-founder of the pioneering social network BlackPlanet.com, said social media was helping publicize police brutality and galvanizing public support for protesters\u2019 goals \u2014 a role that his research foundconventional mediaplayed a half century ago. And he said he believed that the internet was making it easier to organize social movements today, for good and for ill.\nHere are excerpts from our conversation.\nHow has social media changed, or not, civil rights protests today compared with the 1960s?\nThe 1960s civil rights leaders figured out that images in national media that showed the brutality of Jim Crow forced an often indifferent white America to take seriously the concerns of black citizens.\nThere\u2019s a through line today. The video of George Floydtaken by Darnella Frazieris an echo of the bearing witness of the beating of Rodney King, and before that the images ofBloody Sunday in Selma[in 1965]. Part of what social media does is allow us to see a reality that has been entirely visible to some people and invisible to others. As those injustices become visible, meaningful change follows.\nBut racial inequality or police brutality didn\u2019t end with Selma or Rodney King. Does the internet change that?\nIt\u2019s obviously depressing how often excess force by police against African-Americans resulted in protest movements that didn\u2019t ultimately fix the problem. But after Selma,public opinion on concerns for civil rights spiked dramatically. The Voting Rights Act was passed in five months.\nThe legal scholarThomas Stoddardtalked aboutcultural shifts leading to durable social change. I think you\u2019re seeing that now withbroad public supportfor the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nAre there ways in which meaningful protests are harder now?\nSocial media radically simplified organizing and coordinating large groups. The downside is there isn\u2019t a deep well of trust among demonstrators, as there was among people who did the first sit-ins of lunch counters andall knew each other.\nBut if one way this movement has an impact is by having weaker ties but with broad reach, that is OK in some cases. And social media is enabling new kinds of protests. My wife has been doing activismaround a chronic health issue, and many of those people are bed bound. Organizing online has been a way to raise consciousness and call attention to the health system\u2019s failures.\nAre there lessons from the social networks you ran 20-plus years ago to make today\u2019s online hangouts healthier for the world?\nWhen we launched what used to be called a bulletin board service in the 1990s, our slogan was \u201cthe mix is the message.\u201d We were trying to get the variety of New Yorkers to talk to each other. Today there are places online where people can find others like them, and that\u2019s good. But I wonder if there\u2019s also more that could be done on sites like Facebook and Twitter to bring people together rather than sorting them into camps.\nAny app maker that wants to sell a video game, a digital subscription or most other virtual goods in an iPhone app has a binary choice: Make people pay with Apple\u2019s payment system and share revenue with Apple, or don\u2019t allow any purchases at all in the app.\nA lot of app makers chafe at this choice. It\u2019s why you can\u2019t buy a subscription to Spotify or Netflix from those companies\u2019 iPhone apps. Spotify and Netflix refuse to give Apple a cut of sales, and Apple\u2019s rules mean there\u2019s no alternative.\nI understand both sides here. Apple wants to be paid forkeeping its app store appealing and safe. App makers say they feel it\u2019s unfair to hand over a chunk of their hard-won sales in perpetuity.\nBut the status quo does more harm than good. It\u2019s annoying to iPhone users, makes developers angry andrisks getting Apple in trouble with regulators.\nHow about a middle ground: Give people multiple ways to pay.\nWhat if people had the choice to pay for things in iPhone apps with either their Apple account or another payment method of the app maker\u2019s choosing?\nIt would be easier for you to buy a Netflix subscription in the iPhone app with your fingerprint or face scan connected to your Apple account. If you do that, then Apple would get to take a slice of Netflix\u2019s sales.\nBut Netflix could also let you create a new account and hand over your credit card details to Netflix. In that case, Netflix would keep all the money. This is similar to the approach on Android, where app makers have the option to let people pay them directly and not share revenue with Google.\nThis split-the-baby approach might not end allthe fightsabout what Apple allows in its apps. I bet it would resolve a lot of disputes, though, and it would make many apps a bit less confusing for all of us.\nWhat a mess:My New York Times colleagues looked into England\u2019s system of humans and technology for tracking down people who had been exposed to the coronavirus.The results so far have not been promising, with some virus hunters filling their days with internet exercise classes and a government virus-tracking app hampered by fears about technical glitches and data breaches.\nSoon every tech company will have a coronavirus-fighting product to sell:Verily, aGoogle sister company, is introducing anemployee virus testing and health analysis servicefor businesses, my colleagueNatasha Singerwrites.

        "title": "Europe Rolls Out Contact Tracing Apps, With Hope and Trepidation",
        "fulltext": "ROME \u2014 When three people in the northern Italian region of Liguria tested positive for thecoronaviruslast week, they gave their doctors permission to punch into a national server anonymous codes generated by a newcontact tracingapp on their phones. Moments later, the phones of people who had also voluntarily downloaded the app and had come into contact with them buzzed with an alert.\nItaly expanded that pilot program on Monday, to join the firstEuropeancountries using national contact tracing apps. France has also activated its own app, Germany\u2019s is available for downloading as of Tuesday morning, and Britain is testing one, too.\nThe launch of the apps comes as more European countries loosened restrictions andopened borders to each otherthis week, hoping to revive their societies and economies without reigniting the contagion. But as they turn to unproven technology to avoid a second wave of infection, European nations are setting off widespread debate about how best to fight the virus while safeguarding privacy rights.\nItaly\u2019s new app is just the latest iteration of the existential challenges the virus has thrust upon Europe. Just months ago, Italy crossed a threshold when it became the first European country to mandate astrict nationwide lockdown, raising questions of whether it was running roughshod over individual rights, as well as threatening the European Union\u2019s internal cohesion, in its effort to contain the virus.\nThose concerns seemed to melt away quickly as more and more European countries saw the necessity for similar measures. Now the tracing apps present a host of new questions, not least whether they work effectively or better than human tracing. Europeans also wonder whether the apps are placing nations on a slippery slope toward a new kind of surveillance state, or handing over too much power to foreign tech giants.\nIn addition, there are the questions of how to reconcile national independence with Europe-wide interoperability. On Tuesday the European Union announced that its members had agreed to standards to allow their various apps to share data.\nSuch issues have not been limited to Europe, and have been addressed variably around the globe. In Asia, nations like South Korea have used cellphone data and credit card activity to successfully track and contain infections. India has required its citizens to download an app. The United States has tended to rely on human tracers in efforts that remain patchy and limited.\nItaly has tried to finesse some of the thornier privacy concerns by making its app \u2014 called Immuni, or Immune \u2014 voluntary. What\u2019s more, the app is built on a platform developed in a rare collaboration between Apple and Google, which sided with privacy advocates who raised concerns about how much data governments could collect through the apps and limited Immuni\u2019s data-transmission capabilities.\nThose restrictions and the voluntary approach may reduce the app\u2019s effectiveness, but may also go some way toward assuaging public queasiness about state intrusion. Its creators hope that the app will be used widely enough to play an important part in protecting public health.\n\u201cIt could be a tool with major impact,\u201d Paola Pisano, Italy\u2019s minister for technological innovation, said. \u201cIt depends on how it will be used.\u2019\u2019\nInitially, Italy had envisioned a centralized system that would send data about potentially contagious interactions to the government. But European sensibilities about privacy, and the meteoric arrival of Apple and Google into the debate, led it to reverse course.\nSome public health officials said that Apple and Google\u2019s design prioritizes privacy at the expense of learning more about the disease, an unusual criticism for an industry more often accused here of gobbling up personal data for profit and power.\n\u201cThis is a health care strategy in a global pandemic with thousands of deaths,\u201d said C\u00e9dric O, the junior minister for digital affairs in France, who is leading the development of the country\u2019s tracing app, calledStopCovid. It does not use Apple and Google\u2019s standards. \u201cIt is highly abnormal that you are constrained as a democratic state in your technical choice because of the internal policies of two private companies.\u201d\nThe apps built with Apple and Google limit what data can be collected about each reported infection, such as how long or how closely an infected person was in proximity to someone else.\nThey also curtail a government\u2019s ability to perform deeper statistical analysis about a person\u2019s connections or to study the characteristics of a super spreader, said Christophe Fraser, an infectious disease expert at Oxford University\u2019s Big Data Institute, which has advised Britain, France, Germany and Italy on its tracing apps.\n\u201cEpidemiological insight is the information we need right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need it to prevent infection, to be able to resume our lives with a degree of normality and to save lives.\u201d\nOther governments have determined the privacy intrusion is not worth the potential benefits. In Norway, officialsthis weekhalted the use of its app after the country\u2019s data-protection authority raised alarms.\nMs. Pisano argued that Italy struck the best balance possible for a country that \u201cis not South Korea, and we are also happy that it isn\u2019t.\u201d She added that if Italy only had to consider health concerns, and not citizens\u2019 privacy, \u201cmilitary GPS gives me precision to three millimeters.\u201d\nBut she also attributed Italy\u2019s about-face to what she said was its failure to integrate a centralized model with the operating systems on Apple phones, which tightly safeguarded privacy.\nShe said Italy\u2019s goal of \u201cinclusivity,\u201d and thus effectiveness, motivated the decision. She said it had the benefit of addressing privacy concerns, and potentially making the app more integrated with those of other European nations. Germany, she said, had taken some of Italy\u2019s code and consulted with Italian technicians.\n\u201cFrance has accepted to be less inclusive,\u201d she said. The French had different priorities, she said, including avoiding reliance on the Silicon Valley: \u201cFor France it was more important to remain unattached to certain giants or to develop the app internally.\u201d\nIn the meantime, she said Italy continued to negotiate with Apple to get as much data as possible for research, including about the quantity of infections in a given area. \u201cThey have to loosen up a little,\u201d she said.\nNavigating all these concerns has delayed the release of contact tracing applications across Europe. In Italy, myriad layers of Italian bureaucracy and regional opposition compounded delays, and as of this week, 2.7 million Italians \u2014 in a country with a population of 60 million \u2014 had downloaded Immuni.\nMs. Pisano, reluctant to raise expectations, studiously avoided an official target number for downloads, though she said the government \u201chad a calculation.\u201d She said that the real universe of potential users, when one subtracted the Italians without access to the internet or those under the 14 years of age required to download the app, was about 30 million Italians.\nShe said the government would begin a major advertising campaign this week to get the word out, knowing full well that Immuni\u2019s success depends on a critical mass of Italians downloading it.\nProf. Fraser, who worked on earlier epidemics including SARS, said that even if slightly more than 10 percent of a population used a tracing app, it could cut down on infections. He estimated that for every one to two users, one infection could be prevented.\n\u201cWe think that incremental benefit is really quite striking,\u201d he said.\nBut the weeks leading up to Monday\u2019s national introduction of Immuni were not without bugs.\nOpposition politicians, including Matteo Salvini, the nationalist leader of the League party, insinuated, falsely, that the government\u2019s partners could collect private health data to send to Chinese business partners.\nForeign Minister Luigi Di Maio, like Ms. Pisano a member of the governing and sometimesfuturistFive Star Movement, incorrectly suggested the app could be used to tell you when you could come in contact with the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crystal ball,\u201d Ms. Pisano said with a laugh.\nThis month, liberal politicians criticized what they considered sexist depictions of gender roles on the app, which showed a man working on his laptop and a woman tending to a baby. After protests by Italy\u2019s Equal Opportunities Minister, the image was changed to a woman working on a laptop and a man tending to a baby.\nMs. Pisano, whose party has deepexperience spreading spinacross the web, said Italy intended to embrace the widely reported mistake as a marketing opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to spread this baby around a bit,\u201d she said.\nLuca Ferretti, an epidemiologist who also works at Oxford\u2019s Big Data Institute and advised the Italian government, raised a more fundamental concern: Italy and many other countries had not thought through how to manage a person who receives a notification through the app.\nHe lamented that without widespread testing and a network of human tracers, the technology would be less effective. Some regions have not trained doctors how to use the app and respond to people who have received an alert.\n\u201cNobody factored in, once people have a notification, what should they do?\u201d he said.\nEven if the app takes off, many experts consider it a poor substitute for contact-tracing boots on the ground.\nIn Italy, mostly health care professionals, administrative staff and, if needed, people from veterinary public services can be employed in contact tracing.\nBut Ms. Pisano spoke dismissively about the more old-fashioned, door-knocking approach, which proved critical in stopping past epidemics. \u201cWe believe in technology,\u201d she said.\nJason Horowitz reported from Rome, and Adam Satariano from London.
