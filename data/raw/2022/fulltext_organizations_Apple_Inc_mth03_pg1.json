        "fulltext": "Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics firm that assembles Apple\u2019s iPhones, said Monday that its factories in Shenzhen, China, would suspend operations after the city imposed a seven-day coronavirus lockdown.\nShenzhen borders Hong Kong, which has reported nearly 3,780 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 700,000 new cases since late January. While infections in the rest of China remain low compared with the rest of the world, the number of reported cases is growing rapidly. China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 3,122 new cases on Sunday, about double the amount on Saturday and three times that on Friday.\nShenzhen, an electronics manufacturing hub with a population of 17 million, reported 66 new cases on Sunday. It will be shutting down most businesses and public transportation in the city and is requiring nonessential workers to stay home.\nIn a statement, Foxconn said that it had \u201cadjusted the production line\u201d to other plants in China to minimize any impact and would be requiring all employees to take P.C.R. tests.\nThe Shenzhen government will determine when the plant, as big as a midsize city, can reopen, the company said.\nShenzhen\u2019s lockdown might disrupt global supply chains. An outbreak in the city last year held up port operations, causing a surge in global shipping rates and the prices of many goods."

        "title": "It\u2019s Scary How Dominant Apple Has Become. But How Scary?",
        "fulltext": "How big of a deal is it that a film from Apple, founded as a computer company, just won three Academy Awards, including one for best picture? If you\u2019re among those worried about the inescapable economic, political and cultural dominance of that set of nerdy giants we now call Big Tech, how much greater panic should this induce?\nPerhaps none. On its own, the awards-season success of \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 the feel-good film about a deaf family that Apple purchased for its subscription TV service at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival \u2014 will be immaterial to the company\u2019s very big bottom line. And anyway, Apple is hardly the first corporate interloper to find fortune (or, more often, failure) in showbiz. For decades,auto-parts companies,Canadian liquor magnatesandstoried American corporationshave gone to Hollywood in search of lucrative side hustles and brand-enhancing corporate jewels. Sony, whose Walkman was the iPod of its day, got into the entertainment businessway back in 1989; now Sony Pictures\u2019 capacious library of filmsincludes a dozen best picture Oscar winners.\nStill, when \u201cCODA\u201d won big on Sunday night, I was struck by a set of complicated insights about this biggest of Big Tech behemoths. And I was again left wondering: As a technological and cultural force, should we be more inclined to celebrate Apple or to fear it?\nAmong my epiphanies were the following.\nFirst: Boy, Apple sure is executing well these days. As recently as the late 2010s, with the Mac line foundering, its cloud services second-rate and each new iPhone hardly better than the last, Apple had seemed to grow a bit lazy, even boring. In the 2020s it\u2019s shaken off any such malaise. Over the past year, I have been wowed by a parade of Apple products \u2014 thespeed of its new Macs, the cameras and battery life on the latest iPhones, the way newversions of iPadOS and MacOS have become magically interoperable, theway Face ID now works with masks. Nowadays, even Siri is sometimes halfway helpful. The wins for \u201cCODA\u201d and Apple\u2019s streaming success fit that larger story: This is a very well-run company making very good products that customers are willing to spend a lot of money for.\nSecond: But a film from Apple becoming the first from a streaming service to win the Oscar for best picture was not just a tale of a well-oiled corporate machine. Apple got into the movie business the way a lot of the tech giants do a lot of things nowadays: It spent gobs of money to win a top spot in a market dominated by much smaller companies, and where money wasn\u2019t enough, it used its advantages as a tech platform to help it along. We first saw this sort of bigfooting with music.In 2015, in an effort to compete with Spotify and other music streamers, Apple introduced amusic service that came installed on the iPhoneand handed out free three-month subscriptions to anyone who wanted one. Early mixed reviews for Apple Music didn\u2019t matter; because it was baked into the device, Apple\u2019s music plan quickly garnered millions of paying users, and today it reportedly has more subscribers than everyrival other than Spotify.\nIn 2019 it did a similar thing with TV. Apple spent areported$6 billion on content to start Apple TV+, and it gave away afree year of the service with the sale of new Apple devices. Apple TV+\u2019s lineup was full of sleepers \u2014 even \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d its most beloved show, takes some time to warm up to \u2014 but with a built-in audience of every new iPhone, iPad and Mac user, the company could afford to take its time to find its footing before asking people to pay. The success of \u201cCODA\u201d was also a story of Apple\u2019s deep pockets: The $25 million Apple spent on the film\u2019s distribution rightswas a Sundance record. According toThe Wall Street Journal, a veteran awards consultant estimated that Apple spent more than $10 million on the Oscar campaign for \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 more than the film cost to produce.\nApple can continue to throw money at its TV service indefinitely; it could easily afford to never make any money from TV+ and simply run the service as a kind of brand-marketing project. The company\u2019s revenue was about $366 billion in fiscal year 2021. Netflix\u2019s revenue last year was just under $30 billion \u2014 about 8 percent of Apple\u2019s.\nThird: All of this would seem bad \u2014 bad in an antitrust, massive-corporations-gobbling-up-everything sort of way. Netflix and Spotify remain thriving companies, but it just does not seem fair or conducive to competition for Apple to leverage its dominance in one market, smartphones, to get ahead in other markets, like the music and movie businesses. It\u2019s especially troublesome when you consider all the onerous rules that Apple imposes on its rivals through its App Store. For instance, it generally takes up to a 30 percent cut of revenue that app makers collect through in-app purchases. Apple\u2019s own apps don\u2019t have to worry about such concerns.\nBut again, there are complications here. For one thing, Apple is not, in traditional terms, anything close to a monopoly in the smartphone business. Although analysts believe it makes thevast bulk of the profits inthe smartphone industry, its global market share is on parwith many rivals\u2019. In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of \u201cFortnite,\u201dsued Appleto fight the 30 percent commission and other App Store rules. Last year Apple largely won the case. \u201cGiven the trial record, the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,\u201d afederal judge ruled. (Both Apple and Epic are appealing the decision.)\nThe other wrinkle is that Apple sometimes uses its market power in ways that are inarguably good for its customers. The most recent example is App Transparency Tracking,a phenomenal privacy featurethat Apple added to iPhones and iPads last year. The system cracked down on rampant privacy abuses by the internet advertising industry. Now when you run Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and many other ad-supported iOS apps, Apple requires the apps to get consent from users to collect some of their information for advertising purposes. Surprise: When you force apps to ask users if they want to be tracked, a lot of people decline. Just how many people became apparent in February, when Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, said the feature would cost the company$10 billion in revenue this year.\nI regret to say that after considering the scope of Apple\u2019s power, I\u2019ve arrived at the sort of no-easy-answer muddle that better opinion columnists than me usually try to avoid. But that\u2019s just where we are: Apple, with a valuation of about $3 trillion and firing on every cylinder, seems unstoppable. On the one hand, its market power is scary, and sometimes its ethical and moral compass leaves a lot to be desired. (Seeits deference to the Chinese government.)\nOn the other hand, it is probably the best-run, most innovative and still most consumer-friendly of the Big Tech baddies. Maybe that\u2019s as good as it gets.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "Arizona Offers Driver\u2019s Licenses on iPhones. Other States Want to Be Next.",
        "fulltext": "It started as a digital catchall for credit cards and concert tickets, enabling anyone with an iPhone to be waved through checkout lines and turnstiles.\nThe technology thenexpanded to vaccine passport recordsduring the pandemic. And this week, the Apple Wallet, an app for iPhones and Apple Watches that stores payment information and QR codes, added driver\u2019s licenses for the first time.\nOn Wednesday, Arizona became the first state to offer digital copies of driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards as part of a sweeping partnership with Apple that wasannounced last year.\nThe project is expected to expand to Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Utah, as well as the territory of Puerto Rico. The initiative has been promoted by the tech giant and the states for its convenience.\nHowever, the expansion is drawing renewed scrutiny to privacy issues and Apple\u2019s outsize sphere of influence. Few places will accept the digital driver\u2019s licenses at the start of the program, and Apple did not say when the other states and Puerto Rico would join Arizona.\nApart from the Apple Wallet initiative,LouisianaandColoradohave their own smartphone apps that offer digital driver\u2019s licenses that are recognized by certain law enforcement agencies. The apps are compatible with iPhones and Android devices.\nArizona residents should hold off on discarding their old-school driver\u2019s licenses and government identification cards, though. The digital ones will not be valid should they get pulled over by the police or carded at a bar.\nFor now, the digital licenses will only be accepted at select security screening checkpoints at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that are operated by the Transportation Security Administration, a federal agency, officials said.\nAs of Thursday, the state\u2019s Motor Vehicles Division, which is part of the Arizona Department of Transportation, estimated that 11,500 people had requested digital copies of their driver\u2019s licenses or state ID cards.\n\u201cIf they like technology and they want to be an early adopter for it, by all means,\u201d Bill Lamoreaux, a spokesman for the Motor Vehicles Division in Arizona, said on Thursday. \u201cThis is absolutely voluntary.\u201d\nIn announcing the debut of this feature, Apple said that residents in participating states could press the plus sign in their Apple Wallets to add their license or state-issued ID card to their iPhone or Apple Watch.\nThe process requires participants to photograph the front and back of their license using their phone\u2019s camera, and to complete a series of facial and head movements, according to Apple. Users must also provide a selfie, which is sent to their state using encryption along with the photos of their license so that local authorities can verify their identity.\nIt was not immediately clear how much it would cost the states to vet the requests associated with the digital licenses, which Apple and state officials said would not create an additional expense for people using them.\nAt the airport security checkpoints, people with an iPhone or an Apple Watch can hold the device up to an electronic reader, which will then prompt them to use facial recognition, a thumbprint or a passcode on their phone to consent to transmitting their encrypted information to a T.S.A. agent, Apple said.\nThe company emphasized that personal information is not stored on Apple\u2019s servers, and that people will never have to hand over their phones to the security agents.\nBut not everyone is so bullish on the expanding technology.\n\u201cApple is now sort of trying to vertically integrate your whole life into its phone,\u201d Elizabeth M. Renieris, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said on Friday.\nProfessor Renieris said that while Apple is known for its robust encryption technology, the company is poised to amass even more information about the habits and everyday activities of its customers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re normalizing the presenting of identification and other credentials,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is also coming on the back of the conversation around digital vaccine passports.\u201d\nResidents of some states can request a digital copy of their coronavirus vaccination card that can be added to their Apple Wallet, which displays a QR code that is unique to that person. One of those states is Connecticut, which plans to participate in Apple\u2019s digital license program.\nTony Guerrera, the deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles, said on Friday that the state was still assessing the technological aspects of the initiative, including privacy concerns. The state does not have a timetable for when digital licenses will be available, he said.\n\u201cWe just want to make sure that all our i\u2019s are dotted and all our t\u2019s are crossed,\u201d Mr. Guerrera said. \u201cThat is why we\u2019re not rushing into this.\u201d\nStill, he said, he can see the appeal of being able to store a copy of a license on an iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\u201cListen, in today\u2019s techno world, I would think there are many, many individuals that would love to have something like it,\u201d he said. \u201cApple is a world-renowned corporation, and they\u2019ve done their research, and they know that people want this.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple iPhone SE Review: A Phone for the Anti-Consumer",
        "fulltext": "Apple has anew, cheaper iPhonearriving in stores on Friday that encapsulates the bare minimum of what we need in a smartphone. The latest iPhone SE has a bright screen, a zippy processor, a quality camera and robust battery life. It makes phone calls, too.\nYet for most of us, that won\u2019t be enough.\nYear after year, the majority of customers gravitate toward more expensive iPhones that range from $700 to $1,100. Even though we get superfluous features we seldom use, a phone is more than just a phone for many of us. Instead, it\u2019s an investment in how we expect to do work, stay entertained and connect with our loved ones. Some of us are evenwilling to go into debt forwhat\u2019s become a status symbol.\nThis is all to say thatApple\u2019s budget iPhone SEis for a certain type of customer: the anti-consumer. You will probably want this $430 phone if you meet any of these criteria:\nYou don\u2019t care about whiz-bang features like ultrafast cellular speed.\nYou correctly recognize that smartphone technology has been around for so long that you should be paying less for it today.\nYou don\u2019t care about what the number of camera lenses or pixels on a screen tells your friends and colleagues about your wealth.\nYouupgrade to a new phoneonly when you truly feel you need to.\nIn short, the latest iPhone is for those who just want a no-frills phone that works well for a reasonable price. If that\u2019s you, here\u2019s what you need to know about it.\nFor this budget iPhone, Apple took the best parts of its more expensive iPhones and squeezed them into the shell of an older iPhone with a home button and smaller screen.\nLet\u2019s start with the highlights.\nLike fancier iPhones, the new iPhone SE includes connectivity to5G, the latest cellular network. In my tests of the device in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5G data speeds were up to 20 percent faster than 4G. That\u2019s not mind-blowing, but it\u2019s a nice feature to have as 5G networks become more widespread.\nThe new iPhone also has the same computing processor as the more expensive iPhone 13 models. According to the speed-testing app Geekbench, the cheaper phone\u2019s computing power was the same as the iPhone 13\u2019s. That meant apps and games opened in a snap and ran smoothly.\nThe iPhone SE\u2019s battery was another strength. The phone\u2019s previous generation from 2020 had a subpar battery that was depleted by around 7 p.m. each day. I found the new model has enough battery life to last until bedtime.\nJust as important to know is what the new iPhone lacks compared with the fancier models. Here\u2019s some good news: In my tests, the trade-offs were minor.\nOne of the most notable omissions from the iPhone SE was compatibility with an ultrafast variant of 5G known as \u201cmillimeter wave.\u201d This data connection, hyped by carriers like Verizon and AT&T, can deliver speeds so fast that a feature-length movie can be downloaded in seconds.\nThe problem is that 5G millimeter wave technology travels short distances and has trouble penetrating walls and obstacles. As a result, it\u2019s rare to even find a connection. People who buy an iPhone SE probably won\u2019t even know that it is missing.\nThe more noticeable disadvantage of the latest iPhone is the camera. The fancy camera system on pricier iPhones has multiple lenses capable of capturing more light.\nIn my tests, the iPhone SE took clear and vibrant photos in daylight, but it didn\u2019t do as well in more challenging lighting conditions. In a photo of my dogs on a shaded path, the iPhone SE produced an image with less detail and unnatural colors compared with the $700 iPhone 13 Mini. The iPhone SE camera also lacks the special night mode found on the fancier iPhones for taking photos in the dark. Using flash is always an option, though.\nThe most obvious difference was the screen. The iPhone SE\u2019s 4.7-inch screen felt constrained and looked dimmer compared with pricier iPhones, which have displays of 5.4 to 6.7 inches. This was probably the most distinguishing factor \u2014 if your eyesight isn\u2019t great or if you spend lots of time streaming videos, you will probably prefer a bigger screen.\nWhile there are some compromises when you spend less on a smartphone, the new iPhone delivers more than satisfying results. The $700-plus iPhones are better, but not 60 percent better.\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that there are other strong phone contenders in the iPhone SE\u2019s price range. Those include Google\u2019s $400 Pixel 5A, which has different pros and cons. In my tests, the Google phone has a slightly larger screen and takes better photos in low light. But the Pixel phone wasn\u2019t as fast as the iPhone SE, and it may not last as long because Google guaranteessoftware updates for the deviceonly until 2024.\nIn the end, though, both phones excelled at doing what we need them to do \u2014 connect with the internet, place phone calls and take pictures \u2014 at a fraction of the price of their higher-end counterparts. In an era where the cost of just about everything seems to be skyrocketing, that\u2019s something to celebrate."

        "title": "How the West Marshaled a Stunning Show of Unity Against Russia",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 The day after Russian tanks and troopspoured across the Ukrainian borderon Feb. 24, NATO leaders received a deeply frightening message. The alliance\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, opened an emergency video summit by warning that President Vladimir V. Putin had \u201cshattered peace in Europe\u201d and that from now on, he would openly contest the continent\u2019s security order.\nHowever unlikely, Mr. Stoltenberg told the leaders, it was no longer unthinkable that Mr. Putin would attack a NATO member. Such a move would trigger the collective defense clause in the North Atlantic Treaty, opening the door to the ultimate nightmare scenario: a direct military conflict with Russia.\nPresident Biden, who had dialed in from the White House Situation Room, spoke up swiftly. Article 5 was \u201csacrosanct,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cone for all, all for one\u201d principle that has anchored NATO since its founding after World War II. Mr. Biden urged allied leaders to step up and send reinforcements to Europe\u2019s eastern flank, according to multiple officials briefed on the call.\nWithin hours, NATO had mobilized its rapid response force, a kind of military SWAT team, for the first time in history to deter an enemy. It was one in an avalanche of precedent-shattering moves, unfolding in ministries and boardrooms from Washington to London and Brussels to Berlin. In a few frantic days, the West threw out the standard playbook that it had used for decades and instead marshaled a stunning show of unity against Russia\u2019s brutal aggression in the heart of Europe.\nA \u201cnew normal,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg called it.\nIn truth, these 10 days in February shook the world, upending long-held assumptions, sundering decades of productive engagement, and wiping out billions of dollars of investment in Russia. It was anything but normal.\nMuch as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 set off a tumultuous cascade of changes across Europe, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought the West to a comparable, if far more ominous, historical reckoning.\n\u201cThat was an epochal, peaceful liberation,\u201d Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, said of Communism\u2019s collapse. \u201cThis is an epochal, violent attempt at recolonization. As we were moved then with hope and excitement, so we\u2019re moved now by horror, anger and fear.\u201d\nThe shock of Russia\u2019s invasion led Germany to discard six decades of military-averse policy rooted in its own wartime experience. Chancellor Olaf Scholz announcedthe Germans would ship Ukraine1,000 shoulder-launched antitank rockets, 500 surface-to-air Stinger missiles and 2,700 Soviet-era shoulder-fired missiles \u2014 as well as embark on a mammoth, $110 billion rearming program at home.\nIt led the once-divided European Union to unite behind choking sanctions that will ban Russia\u2019s central bank, which holds Mr. Putin\u2019s war chest, from selling any assets to European banks. Brussels, long derided as an economic giant but a foreign-policy dwarf, pledged to spend $500 million on defensive weapons for Ukraine.\nIt led Mr. Biden to recast a presidency that had been focused on rebuilding America after the coronavirus pandemic and confronting China to one that is waging a twilight struggle against a Cold War rival on the plains of Eastern Europe.\nIt has reverberated not just in the councils of state, but also in corporate suites, cultural institutions and sports leagues \u2014 to say nothing of city streets from Mexico City to Madrid, where tens of thousands of demonstrators have waved the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag and chanted against Russia\u2019s aggression.\nOvernight, oil giants like BP, Shell and Exxon walked away from gargantuan investments in Russia. Technology companies like Apple halted sales in Russia, while Google pulled Russian media off their networks. Sports bodies like FIFA and the International Olympic Committee barred Russians from competing.\nFor each of these institutions, such actions would have been inconceivable only a week earlier. Although the United States and its allies had labored quietly for months, as Russian troops were massing on Ukraine\u2019s border, to lay the groundwork for sanctions, the readiness of much of the West remained in doubt.\nOn Feb. 19, five days before Mr. Putin set his army in motion, Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, Volodymyr Zelensky, flew to a security conference in Munich to issue a frustrated challenge to Western leaders:\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d\nTo trace the 10-day period before and after Russia\u2019s invasion in the worlds of geopolitics, business, culture and sports, is to see how Mr. Putin\u2019s brazen attack made the inconceivable suddenly inevitable.\nNone of these momentous moves, it must be said, have succeeded in halting the Russian war machine. Ten days on, Europeans are girding themselves for a prolonged siege in Ukraine, facing a future that is menacing and unmoored. On Saturday, Mr. Putin likened the West\u2019s sanctionsto a \u201cdeclaration of war.\u201d\n\u201cThe world and Europe fundamentally changed,\u201d said Michael Roth, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Parliament. \u201cAn offensive war is once again the bitter reality on the European continent and we as liberal democracies have to deal with that reality.\u201d\nFew in the elite crowd gathered for the Munich Security Conference late last month believed Russia would go through with a full-blown invasion. Despite detailed warnings in intelligence declassified by the United States and Britain, many said Mr. Putin was playing an elaborate bluff. Even if he did move against Ukraine, some predicted he would stop in two separatist territories in the East, where the large Russian-speaking populations would make it easier to seize and hold ground.\nMr. Zelensky, a comedian and actor turned politician, was the star attraction at the gathering in Munich. When he stepped to the podium under heavy guard at the elegant Bayerischer Hof Hotel, the same stage where Mr. Putin had in 2007 famously inveighed against what he said was NATO\u2019s encroachment of Russia, Mr. Zelensky was deliberately undiplomatic. He harshly condemned the West\u2019s slow-motion approach.\n\u201cWhat do attempts at appeasement lead to?\u201d Mr. Zelensky asked. The post-World War II security order, he said, was a poor match for the predations of leaders like Mr. Putin. \u201cThey do not keep up with new threats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not effective for overcoming them. This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.\u201d\nAfterward, Mr. Zelensky met privately with Vice President Kamala Harris. There, he repeated his insistence that the United States support Ukraine\u2019s effort to join NATO, perhaps as soon as this summer. He asked for far more military support. While Ms. Harris characterized it as a good exchange with a valued partner \u2014 if not an ally \u2014 the Ukrainians emerged angry that she had not come with more concrete plans for military help.\nBy midafternoon, Mr. Zelensky was in the air again, on a plane with neither a tail number nor a filed flight plan. Journalists and others followed the plane on an app that tracks aircraft, noting how it avoided the airspace of Russia and Belarus to deposit Mr. Zelensky back in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, in time for dinner \u2014 and an approaching onslaught.\nMr. Scholz, the German leader, was only two months into his new job whenhe got a taste of Mr. Putin\u2019s ambitions. It came in a nearly four-hour meeting in Moscow on Feb. 15, where the two were separated by the now-famous 20-foot-long table, where Mr. Putin had also held a marathon encounter with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\nUkraine, Mr. Putin told Mr. Scholz, was historically part of a Greater Russia that had been unraveled by a series of tragic mistakes. Ukrainians and Russians were \u201cone people,\u201d he said. Asked that evening what Mr. Putin was up to, the chancellor replied, \u201cI think we have to take him literally.\u201d\nThe gravity of the situation became clear six days later when Mr. Putin declared that Russia wasformally recognizing the separatist territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, a move that was widely viewed in the West as a prelude to invasion.\nWith war seemingly hours away, Mr. Scholz acted quickly, and unexpectedly. Shortly before noon on Feb. 22, he announced thatGermany would scrap Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion undersea pipeline that would transport gas from Russia \u2014 and provide Mr. Putin with significant leverage over Europe. A subject of tortured debate in Mr. Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party, the pipeline had become a symbol of German softness toward Russia and its mercantilist instinct to put economic interests first.\nNow, he had killed it.\n\u201cThe situation is today fundamentally changed,\u201d Mr. Scholz said, standing next to Ireland\u2019s prime minister, who happened to be in Berlin.\nThe same day, Germany signed off on a first package of sanctions with other members of the European Union. The nearly 600 pages of penalties included travel bans and asset freezes aimed at people in Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, including his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, and his chief of staff, Anton Vaino.\nIn Britain, where Russian oligarchs have burrowed deep into the political and commercial establishment, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed travel bans on three wealthy Russians and said any British assets they held in the country would be frozen.\nEuropean officials made clear that sanctions could be ratcheted up if Mr. Putin made further incursions into Ukraine. But Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was not entirely satisfied.\nA member of the Green Party who had long pressed for tougher treatment of Russia, she lobbied for targeting Russia\u2019s central bank and excluding some Russian banks from SWIFT, an international messaging system for cross-border financial transactions. Removing banks from it would make it much harder to receive or transfer money outside Russia. At this point, though, the chancellor was still resisting.\nStill, in halting Nord Stream 2, a major German taboo had fallen. Mothballing the pipeline has already reopened an anguished debate over the country\u2019s energy policy, with some urging a delay in shuttering of the country\u2019s last few nuclear power plants and Mr. Scholz announcing plans to speed up the construction of two LNG terminals to reduce Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian gas.\nMore than any other factor, perhaps, Germany\u2019s sudden reversal from equivocation to robust involvement in Western deterrence signaled the united front that Mr. Putin would face if he invaded.\n\u201cIt was a declaration of war,\u201d Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, the chairwoman of the defense committee of the German Parliament, said about Mr. Putin\u2019s recognition of the two Ukrainian territories.\nAnd then the war started.\nWhen Mr. Putin went on television in the early hours of Feb. 24 to announce he had ordered a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine \u2014 avoiding the word \u201cwar\u201d \u2014 the sound of explosions and air-raid sirens erupted almost immediately in Kyiv and other cities. Russian troops pierced the country from three sides. Military vehicles rumbled across the border from Crimea, whichMr. Putin had annexed by force in 2014.\nUntil that moment, said Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to the United States: \u201cI don\u2019t think everyone in Europe and around the world expected it to be full-blown. That was the moment that jolted everyone.\u201d\nThe European Union\u2019s belated recognition was evident in the initially plodding negotiations over sanctions. A decade of crises \u2014 from eurozone debt problems to Brexit and the pandemic \u2014 had created an almost ritualistic pursuit of self-interest when it came to hammering out Europe-wide policy in Brussels.\nThen, too, there are the myriad ways European countries are intertwined with Russia, even beyond gas and oil. There are the Russian tourists who vacation on Greek islands and Cypriot beaches; Italian and French luxury goods sold to well-heeled shoppers in Moscow; Russia-mined diamonds sold in the hustling trade in Belgium\u2019s port city of Antwerp; Austrian banks with Russian branches.\nThese national interests, coupled with lingering skepticism in European capitals of the alarms that American and British intelligence agencies were sounding, led officials in Europe to push for a slow, gradual unfolding of the penalties.\nEuropeans were similarly reluctant about shipping lethal weapons to the Ukrainian Army, even those categorized as defensive. Fearing a backlash at home, Germany and its neighbors limited themselves to sending protective gear like helmets or flak jackets.\nBut their resolve quickly stiffened with the start of the war. Shortly before Germany, the Netherlands offered Ukraine Stinger missiles and other weapons. Last Saturday, the European Union set up a nearly $500 million fund for members to send weapons. It was the first time the bloc jointly purchased lethal weapons to arm another country\u2019s army under the E.U. banner \u2014 another Rubicon crossed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when the target of Western sanctions was so economically integrated into the West,\u201d said Tom Keatinge, a senior researcher with the British Royal United Services Institute, a research group in London. Punishing Russia, he said, became an imperative for world leaders and everyday consumers. \u201cIt became about, \u2018What are you, man on the street, going to sacrifice for Ukraine?\u2019\u201d\nCountries that are geographically closer to Russia, like Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the Netherlands \u2014 backed by the United States and Canada \u2014 pressed for a single huge set of sanctions that would genuinely hurt Mr. Putin, according to European officials who took part in the talks.\nIn particular, these countries were pushing for personally penalizing Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and suspending Russian banks from SWIFT, a kind of financial nuclear option that had by that point become a rallying cry for protesters on the streets of Europe and on social media. But SWIFT was still a no go for the Germans, several officials said.\nIt was before dinner on Feb. 24, on the evening after the invasion began, when Mr. Zelensky\u2019s image flickered on a video screen. European leaders were meeting under the highest level of secrecy, without advisers or electronic devices. Clad in suits and ties, they were seated in the comfort of a high-tech conference room in Brussels. Mr. Zelensky appeared to be in a bunker, somewhere in Kyiv, wearing his now-famous military-green T-shirt. The contrast was not lost on anyone in the room.\n\u201cThis may be the last time you see me alive,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said in making yet another fervent plea for tougher sanctions and more weapons.\nWhen the leaders emerged from the room, they were visibly shaken, several officials said. Some described Mr. Zelensky\u2019s appearance as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d and a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Later that night and the next morning, they instructed their envoys in Brussels to freeze the assets of Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov, and to finally greenlight the severing of many Russian banks from the SWIFT platform \u2014 concerted action against a country that had long divided them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quantum leap,\u201d said Rosa Balfour, the director of Carnegie Europe. \u201cPutin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought Europeans together on what probably has been the single most divisive foreign-policy issue since the start of the European Union.\u201d\nThere was a similar evolution in the thinking of the Biden administration. The United States also had initial concerns about using SWIFT as a weapon. There could be unintended consequences, some officials argued, like driving Russia closer to China financially.\nAt the NATO emergency summit on Feb. 25, Mr. Johnson, the British prime minister, urged other leaders to suspend Russian banks from SWIFT. He was seconded by leaders from Poland, Latvia and the Czech Republic.\nBy the next day, the United States was on board, along with the European Union: They would penalize Russia\u2019s central bank and remove some Russian institutions from the SWIFT system, choking off Russia\u2019s access to a cushion of international reserves it had built up since first invading Ukraine in 2014.\nLike Germany\u2019s shuttering of the Nord Stream project, the action on SWIFT took Western penalties to an entirely new level.\n\u201cRestricting central bank of Russia assets in the early days of a conflict goes far beyond the playbook that we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d said John E. Smith, the former director of the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. \u201cTo get the U.S., U.K, E.U., Canada, Japan and other jurisdictions to voluntarily impose this over a weekend is a staggering accomplishment and repudiation of Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe annexation of Crimea hung over American officials. Over breakfast at the security conference in Munich, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken vividly recalled the mistakes made in 2014, when Western allies were taken by surprise by Russia\u2019s lightning conquest. It took them nearly a year to cobble together sanctions, none of which were severe enough to force Mr. Putin to reverse himself.\nMr. Blinken, who worked for Mr. Biden, then the vice president, pushed for the United States to send Javelin antitank missiles to Ukrainian troops. But President Barack Obama, fearing a cycle of escalation with Moscow, resisted. Gathering foreign policy experts at a White House dinner in September 2014, Mr. Obama asked, \u201cWill somebody tell me: What\u2019s the American stake in Ukraine?\u201d\nThose memories stuck with Mr. Biden, who as vice president had visited Kyiv several times. Now, as president, he viewed Ukraine as a chance to reassert the United States\u2019 leadership on the world stage \u2014 a role that had become tarnished after his administration\u2019s chaotic, bloodstained departure from Afghanistan.\nAmerican diplomats had held hundreds of meetings with European officials since Russia began massing troops in the fall. In a striking break from practice, the C.I.A. disclosed detailed intelligence about Mr. Putin\u2019s war plans, including so-called false-flag operations that Russia could use as a pretext to strike. That stripped Russia of any element of surprise, even if it did not cause Mr. Putin to rethink his course.\nWhile the Pentagon is not sending soldiers into the fray, its top generals are deeply immersed in trying to anticipate Russia\u2019s military maneuvers. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, carries around a map of Ukraine, marked with tactical details. With aides, he drills down for details about the location and combat readiness of specific Russian ground units and ship movements.\nHours after the Russians attacked on Feb. 24, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III called his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksiy Reznikov, to reassure him that the United States\u2019 support for Ukraine\u2019s independence and territorial integrity was \u201cunwavering,\u201d and that new supplies of Javelins and Stinger missiles were on the way.\nThe next day, the White House approved another $350 million package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine that Pentagon officials said began flowing within days \u2014 lightning speed, as arms shipments go.\n\u201cThe United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,\u201d Mr. Biden said. But he added, \u201cLet me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.\u201d\nAs the images of burning buildings and fleeing Ukrainians filled screens around the world, the ripple effects of Russia\u2019s invasion spread far beyond government ministries. For multinational companies like Apple, Google, BP and Shell, the costs of doing business in Russia suddenly became untenable.\nApple halted sales of iPhones and iPads, prompting a social media video of a Russian man smashing his iPad with a hammer. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, said YouTube, which it owns, would suspend advertising on channels affiliated with state-funded Russian media groups. Google Maps stopped displaying real-time traffic information in Ukraine for fear that it could jeopardize the safety of people there.\nIt was a turnabout from previous episodes when Google and Apple acquiesced to Russia\u2019s demand to alter how their digital maps demarcated the disputed Crimean Peninsula after Russia annexed it. Last year, both yielded to Russian pressure and removed an app created by allies of the jailed dissident leader Aleksei A. Navalny that was meant to coordinate protest voting during a parliamentary election.\nBut Google\u2019s actions did not go far enough to satisfy European Union officials. In a video call, they urged Alphabet and YouTube\u2019s chief executives to remove two Russian state-owned news agencies, RT and Sputnik, from YouTube altogether. Two days later, they did so.\nWestern oil giants were coming to a similar recognition. BP\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Looney, knew his company would have to walk away from its $14 billion stake in Rosneft, a state-controlled Russian oil company, almost as soon as the invasion began, according to people with knowledge of the company.\nTwo days after Russia attacked, Mr. Looney held a videoconference with Britain\u2019s business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, who expressed the government\u2019s concerns. By Sunday afternoon,BP\u2019s board voted to exit the Rosneft holding, ending a foray into the rough-and-tumble world of Russian oil and gas that dated to 2003.\nThe prospect of Mr. Looney serving on the same board as Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Rosneft and a longtime confidant of Mr. Putin\u2019s, would not have sat well with either the British government or people who fill up at BP\u2019s gas stations.\nThere is no obvious buyer for BP\u2019s Russian stake, and the company warned that the divestiture would force it to take a large write-off in the first quarter. But BP has diversified aggressively into renewable energy like wind and solar power \u2014 making its Russian adventure, about which shareholders have long been leery, less central to its fortunes.\n\u201cThey needed to make a move because otherwise they would face a lot of reputational issues at home and globally,\u201d said Alexander Smotrov, who leads the Russia and Central and Eastern Europe practice at Global Counsel, a London-based consulting firm.\nThe most quoted Russian in the heart of Europe right now is not Vladimir Putin, but Vladimir Lenin: \u201cThere are weeks where decades happen.\u201d\nTen days after a desperate Mr. Zelensky asked the world what it was waiting for, the world responded on a global scale and with dizzying speed. In gestures small and not so small, individuals and institutions stood up to Russia\u2019s aggression and expressed solidarity with Ukraine.\nIn the process, NATO has been revitalized, the United States has reclaimed a mantle of leadership that some feared had vanished in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the European Union has found a unity and purpose that eluded it for most of its existence.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a time when people from Britain, Spain, France and Italy were prepared to put their lives on the line to defend Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,\u201d Professor Garton Ash of Oxford said. \u201cThe question to which European leaders don\u2019t yet have an answer is, \u2018What are we prepared to do for Ukraine in the long term?\u2019\u201d\nAs Mr. Putin presses his lethal military advance, the unthinkable has already happened. Now it gives way to the unknowable.\nMark Landlerreported from London,Katrin Bennholdfrom Berlin andMatina Stevis-Gridnefffrom Brussels. Reporting was contributed byDavid E.

No flop sweat.\nToday, Apple is selling eight different models of the iPhone, including versions released over the past few years. The company offers 10 different Mac computers and five iPad editions. It also sells TV gadgets, wristwatches, fitness and music software, home speakers, multiple models of headphones and on and on.\nIn a prerecorded video presentation on Tuesday, Apple willdiscuss updated versionsof some of its product lineup, which no longer fits on a normal table. Apple now needs thetable of the United Nations Security Councilto hold it all.\nApple\u2019s shift to YES, MORE is another sign of the transformation of technology from occupying a nerdy niche to providingessential but ordinaryconsumer products like cars or breakfast cereal. Manufacturers offer a flotilla of options to satisfy any one of our potential whims and catch shoppers\u2019 eyes.\nComplexity is a sign that a company can no longer take its customers for granted. It has to try hard to win us over.\nThis happened to Ford, too. There\u2019s an old line by Henry Ford that a customer could have any color of car he wanted \u201cas long as it\u2019s black.\u201d Limited choice was a necessity when assembly line production was still new, but the quip also showed the power that the early Ford Motor Company had over customers. Cars were a novelty, and people took whatever they could get.\nWe know that consumer products aren\u2019t like that anymore. Today at Ford, you can choose from among eight truck models, including a Ford F-150 XLT, an F-150 Lariat, an F-150 King Ranch, an F-150 Platinum and an F-150 Tremor. Black is definitely not the only option.\nMore options are great, but they can also be overwhelming. I bet some new car buyers have a hard time picking among those Ford trucks. Not long ago I considered buying an Apple TV streaming gadget, and it took some hunting to figure out the differences between the options that the company was selling. I didn\u2019t buy anything.\nA side note: Maybewe don\u2019t need Apple\u2019s product infomercials, like the one on Tuesday, at all?\nThese staged presentations devoted to what feels like the 32nd version of an iPad made slightly more sense when technology was confined to a shiny thing in a box intended mostly forthe 1 percent of die-hards. But now, technology is everything and for everyone. And increasingly, it\u2019s most useful when we don\u2019t notice it all. That includes the smart software that nudges us to read only the important emails or spots a faulty factory assembly line before it breaks down.\nRant over. My point is that having choices is mostly good for us. But it\u2019s also weird for Apple. The company isa geniusat product segmentation, marketing and pricing strategies but tends to behave as though it just makes awesome products and \u2014 oopsie, where did thesegiant piles of cashcome from? No one wants to be atry-hard.\nApple has managed to preserve the image of being exclusive and cool while selling one of the most widely used commodities on the planet. Smartphones and many other technologies in our lives are both extremely useful necessities andcompletelynormal. It\u2019s long past time to stop treating the companies behind them like wizards.\nApple now has nearly the array of product optionsthat Cheerios does. That should demystify the company a bit.\nRussia\u2019s digital isolationism:Russia passed a law that makes it illegal to call its war on Ukraine a war, and it has blocked Facebook and is choking off other foreign websites and apps.

        "title": "Shaming Apple and Texting Musk, a Ukraine Minister Uses Novel War Tactics",
        "fulltext": "After war began last month, PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyof Ukraine turned to Mykhailo Fedorov, a vice prime minister, for a key role.\nMr. Fedorov, 31, the youngest member of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s cabinet, immediately took charge of a parallel prong of Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia. He began a campaign to rally support from multinational businesses to sunder Russia from the world economy and tocut off the country from the global internet, taking aim at everything from access to new iPhones and PlayStations to Western Union money transfers and PayPal.\nTo achieve Russia\u2019s isolation, Mr. Fedorov, a former tech entrepreneur, used a mix of social media, cryptocurrencies and other digital tools. On Twitter and other social media, he pressured Apple, Google, Netflix, Intel, PayPal and others to stop doing business in Russia. He helpedform a group of volunteer hackersto wreak havoc on Russian websites and online services. His ministry also set upa cryptocurrency fundthat has raised more than $60 million for the Ukrainian military.\nThe work has made Mr. Fedorov one of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s most visible lieutenants, deploying technology and finance as modern weapons of war. In effect, Mr. Fedorov is creating a new playbook for military conflicts that shows how an outgunned country can use the internet, crypto, digital activism andfrequent posts on Twitterto help undercut a foreign aggressor.\nIn his first in-depth interview since the invasion began on Feb. 24, Mr. Fedorov said his goal was to create a \u201cdigital blockade\u201d and to make life so unpleasant and inconvenient for Russian citizens that they would question the war. He praised companies that had pulled out of Russia, but said Apple, Google and others could go further with steps such as completely cutting off their app stores in the country.\nA technological and business blockade, he said, \u201cis an integral component of stopping the aggression.\u201d\nMr. Fedorov, speaking via videoconference from an undisclosed location somewhere around Kyiv, also brushed off concerns that his actions were alienating urban Russians who might be the most likely to oppose the conflict.\n\u201cWe believe that as long as Russians are silent that they are complicit to the aggression and to the killing of our people,\u201d he said.\nMr. Fedorov\u2019s work is not the only reason that multinational companies like Meta andMcDonald\u2019shave withdrawn from Russia, with the war\u2019s human toll provoking horror and outrage. Economic sanctions by the United States, European Union and others have played a central role in isolating Russia.\nBut Peter Singer, a professor at the Center on the Future of War at Arizona State University, said Mr. Fedorov had been \u201cincredibly effective\u201d in calling for companies to rethink their Russia connections.\n\u201cNo celebrity, let alone nation, has ever been more effective than Ukraine at calling out corporate brands to name and shame them into acting morally,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cIf there is such a thing as \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 the Ukrainians can claim to have honed it in war.\u201d\nIn the 45-minute interview on Zoom, Mr. Fedorov, wearing a loosefitting gray fleece with black zippers, sat in front of a wood-paneled wall. He has gotten about three to four hours of sleep a night, he said, often interrupted every 30 minutes or so by alerts on the iPhone that he keeps next to his bed. He said he has been worried about his father, who has been in intensive care for the past week after a missile struck the house next door.\n\u201cI\u2019ve brushed shoulders with the horror,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war has come knocking on my door as well personally.\u201d\nMr. Fedorov grew up in the small town of Vasylivka in southern Ukraine near the Dnieper River. Before going into politics, he started a digital marketing company called SMMSTUDIO that designed online advertising campaigns.\nThe work led him to a job in 2018 with Mr. Zelensky, then an actor who was making an unexpected run for Ukraine\u2019s presidency. Mr. Fedorov became the campaign's director of digital, using social media to portray Mr. Zelensky as a youthful symbol of change.\nAfterMr. Zelensky was electedin 2019, he appointed Mr. Fedorov, then 28, to be minister of digital transformation, putting him in charge of digitizing Ukrainian social services. Through a government app, people could pay speeding tickets or manage their taxes. Last year, Mr. Fedorov visited Silicon Valley to meet with leaders including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple.\nAfterRussia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Fedorov immediately pressured tech companies to pull out of Russia. He made the decision with Mr. Zelensky\u2019s backing, he said, and the two men speak every day.\n\u201cI think this choice is as black and white as it ever gets,\u201d Mr. Fedorov said. \u201cIt is time to take a side, either to take the side of peace or to take the side of terror and murder.\u201d\nOn Feb. 25, he sent letters to Apple, Google and Netflix, asking them to restrict access to their services in Russia. Less than a week later,Apple stopped selling new iPhonesand other products in Russia.\nThe next day, Mr. Fedorov tweeted a message to Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, asking for help in obtaining Starlink satellite internet systems that are made by Mr. Musk\u2019s company SpaceX. The technology could help Ukrainians stay online even ifRussia damaged the country\u2019s main telecommunications infrastructure. Two days after contacting Mr. Musk, a shipment of Starlink equipment arrived in Ukraine.\nSince then, Mr. Fedorov said he has periodically exchanged text messages with Mr. Musk.\nMr. Fedorov also had a call last month with Karan Bhatia, a Google vice president. Google has since made several changes, including restricting access to certain Google Maps features that Mr. Fedorov said were safety risks because they could help Russian soldiers identify crowds of people. The company has since then also suspended sales of other products and services, and, on Friday blocked access to Russian state media globally on YouTube.\nMr. Fedorov has traded emails with Nick Clegg, the head of global affairs at Meta, which is the parent of Facebook and Instagram, about the unfolding war.\nApple, Google and Meta declined to comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nPublic shaming has been effective, Mr. Fedorov said, because companies are \u201cemotional as well as rational in decision making.\u201d\nBut while many companies have halted business in Russia, more could be done, he said. Apple and Google should pull their app stores from Russia and software made by companies like SAP was also being used by scores of Russian businesses, he has noted.\nIn many instances, the Russian government is cutting itself off from the world, including blocking access to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Russian regulators said they would alsorestrict access to Instagramand called Meta an \u201cextremist\u201d organization.\nSome civil society groups have questioned whether Mr. Fedorov\u2019s tactics could have unintended consequences. \u201cShutdowns can be used in tyranny, not in democracy,\u201d the Internet Protection Society, an internet freedom group in Russia, said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cAny sanctions that disrupt access of Russian people to information only strengthen Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d\nMr. Fedorov said it was the only way to jolt the Russian people into action. He praised the work of Ukraine-supporting hackers who have been coordinating loosely with Ukrainian government to hit Russian targets.\n\u201cAfter cruise missiles started flying over my house and over houses of many other Ukrainians, and also things started exploding, we decided to go into counter attack,\u201d he said.\nMr. Fedorov\u2019s work is an example of Ukraine\u2019s whatever-it-takes attitude against a larger Russian army, said Max Chernikov, a software engineer who is supporting the volunteer group known as the IT Army of Ukraine.\n\u201cHe acts like every Ukrainian \u2014 doing beyond his best,\u201d he said.\nMr. Fedorov, who has a wife and young daughter, said he remained hopeful about the war\u2019s outcome.\n\u201cThe truth is on our side,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\nDaisuke WakabayashiandMike Isaaccontributed reporting."
