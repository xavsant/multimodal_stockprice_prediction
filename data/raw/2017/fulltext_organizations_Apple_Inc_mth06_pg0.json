        "title": "Apple Customer Data in China Was Sold Illegally, Police Say",
        "fulltext": "To Apple\u2019s mounting problems in China, add official scrutiny over privacy.\nThe Chinese police said this week that they had arrested 22 people suspected of selling the personal data of an unspecified number of Apple customers. The police, in Cangnan County in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the thieves had reaped 50 million renminbi, or about $7.3 million, over an unspecified period.\nMany of the details were unclear, including the identities of those involved and the severity of the breach.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Cangnan police said they found that Apple employees had illegally acquired personal data, then later in the same statement said 20 of the 22 people worked for companies that sell Apple products or are Apple contractors. The police did not disclose information about the other two people. In China, Apple\u2019s products are sold broadly, in electronics chain stores and small booths in shopping malls in addition to the company\u2019s official Apple Stores.\nThe Cangnan police also said the data included the names, Apple identification numbers and phone numbers of Apple users. They did not say whether passwords or financial information like credit card numbers were involved, which would suggest the thieves had access to internal Apple data and would make the breach more serious.\nThe arrests are part of a set of broader difficulties in China for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Sales of iPhones, still a sign of middle-class aspiration in China, have slowed, according to analysts, as the public waits for new models and as Chinese manufacturers of cheaper phones step up their quality and marketing.\nApple has also faced new scrutiny from the government on other fronts. Last year its movie and book serviceswere shut downin China.\nStill, Apple may simply be caught up in a wider rising of concern over privacy in China.\nFew people in China expect the country\u2019s authoritarian central government to stay out of their business. But outside of that, a growing number of Chinese people fear cybercrime and identity theft, particularly as millions of themturn to online shoppingand using money electronically.\nBetween widespread malware campaigns and a large number of new internet users, China has become a playground for internet fraudsters. Last year, China tried 361 criminal cases involving violation of personal data, up from 176 in 2015, said Xie Yongjiang, associate director for the Institute of Internet Governance and Law at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.\n\u201cIt is very common. Every one of us can feel it,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cFor example, after your child is born at a hospital, someone will phone you and ask if you need baby products. When your child turns 3, someone will phone you and ask if your child would go to their nursery school. When your child reaches primary school age, someone will phone you to ask if you need training services.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea who exposed your personal data,\u201d he added.\nThe problem is not new. In one incident reported in the Chinese news media just this week, an employee of a Shanghai delivery company was recently arrested on suspicion of selling clients\u2019 personal data.\nOther examples abound. An apparent trove of login information leaked onto the Chinese internet was used to hack more than 20 million accounts on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce site Taobao,according to news reports. Alibaba said that its security systems had not been breached and that it had worked with the police to quickly catch the perpetrators.\nIn another example, China News Service, a state-run news agency,reported late last yearthat login information and other personal data from accounts associated with the Chinese e-commerce site JD.com were exposed in 2013 as part of a security problem. JD.com said it had quickly fixed the issue.\nThe problem is not even new to Apple. Last year, 10 employees of an Apple contractor in China were also found with data from more than 80,000 users."

        "title": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified",
        "fulltext": "The laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.\nAfter a relentless three-year ascent, large bellwether companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon led a two-day sell-off,prompting fears of a wider stock market retreat.\nNo one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.\nYet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\n\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201d\nOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.\nNetflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.\nIn the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.\nThe declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.\nTo the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.\nThe bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.\nUBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.\nGoldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.\nWhile traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.\nAccording to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.\nHedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)\nCompared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.\nTo a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.\nIn the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.\nCredit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.\nIn the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change."

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: More Ugly News for Uber",
        "fulltext": "Farhad:Hello, Mike! Usually we start off with some kind of dad joke but today there\u2019s no time. We have a huge tech story to get to, one that will deeply affect my life and the lives of all of our readers:Taylor Swift is finally putting all of her music backon all streaming services, including Spotify. Hurrah!\nMike, what\u2019s your favorite Taylor song?\nMike:Hmm, I\u2019m gonna have to go with \u201cTelephone.\u201d Or maybe \u201cThe Greatest.\u201d That\u2019s Taylor Swift, right?\nFarhad:Yeah, I know, it\u2019s so hard to pick just one. But seriously: This is an interesting development. Taylor famously ditched Spotify a couple years ago, arguing that the service\u2019s free, ad-supported tier devalued music. (Spotify also has a paid service, but she didn\u2019t let her music on there, either, out of spite, I guess.) Spotify has since adopted a few policies to address this concern, includinga \u201cwindowing\u201d systemthat allows labels to keep their newest hits off Spotify\u2019s free service. So maybe that changed Taylor\u2019s mind?\nThe other possibility: It\u2019s a way to mess with Katy Perry, whose new album is releasing this week. Remember,the two have bad blood. Celebrities \u2014 they\u2019re just like us!\nMike:Ooh, I like \u201cBad Blood\u201d too. I used to have to play that by opening the music video on YouTube on my phone, then jack into my car stereo. It was very inconvenient. This makes it a lot easier.\nAlso of note: Taylor Swift is a shrewd businesswoman. She knew how much leverage she had to force change in Apple Music and Spotify, and she\u2019s used her catalog to do so. Perhaps coming back to Spotify now isn\u2019t a concession, more a victory lap.\nFarhad:On to some smaller tech news. After President Trump announced last week that he would pull the United States out of the worldwide global warming deal known as the Paris Agreement, lots of tech companies balked.\nBut I guess those wounds heal quickly.Bloomberg reportedthis week that many tech C.E.O.s will visit the White House this week for the first meeting of the American Technology Council. That\u2019s the group headed by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, which is looking to modernize government through tech. So much for tech joining the #resistance, eh?\nMike:I go back and forth on this sort of thing. On the one hand, I think there\u2019s merit in the idea that engagement with a group \u2014 even one as clearly obstinate as the Trump administration seems to be \u2014 can be a method of changing opinions. I imagine the biggest names in information technology would have at least some sway inside the beltway.\nThat said, do we have any proof that these meetings make any difference whatsoever in changing their opinions? Travis Kalanick, Bob Iger, Elon Musk \u2014 all left the president\u2019s economic council after they felt they were getting nowhere. It\u2019s hard for me to see this little gathering as more than glorified public relations.\nAnd to that end, the leaks around this have been highly orchestrated to shine a positive light on the tech companies involved. Kudos to the P.R. reps doing their jobs well.\nFarhad:Big surprise, there was more Uber stuff this week. In an apparent preview of a highly anticipated report on the company\u2019s culture by Eric Holder, the former attorney general, the company disclosed details of another internal investigation. It said it hadfired 20 people for harassment, discriminationand other inappropriate behavior.\nThen Recode reported a doozy: In 2014, Eric Alexander, until recently a top executive,obtained the medical records of a womanwho said she had been raped during an Uber ride in India. Alexander showed the records to Travis Kalanick, the C.E.O., among other execs. Folks at the top even speculated that the woman\u2019s story might not be true, and that the whole thing was somehow invented by Uber\u2019s Indian rival, Ola. Stay classy, Uber.\nMike:Obviously Uber has to do an investigation into any legal matters that have to do with their company. But this whole thing is clearly beyond the pale. It pretty much speaks for itself.\nI think we\u2019ll see more come out in the Holder report, which is about as hotly anticipated in Silicon Valleyas the Comey hearing. But I figure with all the explosive and often awful items leaking out of Uber right now, firing 20 midlevel employees across the organization is not going to fly with the general public as a solution. We\u2019ll see for whom the bell tolls next \u2014 if anyone.\nFarhad:Finally, Apple had a thing. At the company\u2019s annual developer conference this weekit showed off several improvements to its mobile and desktop operating systems, and it also unveiled a new voice-activated home speaker called HomePod. This is Apple\u2019s answer to the Amazon Echo. It has much better sound quality than other small speakers \u2014 I got to hear it at the event and I was blown away by its sound. But that comes at a cost \u2014 when it goes on sale in December, it will sell for $349, about twice the price of the Echo. Plus, we don\u2019t know yet how well Siri will work on it, or whether it will work with non-Apple Music services like Spotify.\nSo, any thoughts on this thing? Or Apple generally? Or Taylor?\nMike:Well, let me start with a confession: I have a Sonos, but my dog is scared of music so I can\u2019t actually use the thing. It\u2019s a serious point of contention in my life, considering I spend most of my waking hours outside of my house listening to music. So even if I were in the market for a new speaker, I\u2019d have to wait till my dog took a vacation from my house to use it.\nFarhad:Woof. That\u2019s ruff.\nMike:Ugh, Farhad.\nAnyway, at first glance I thought it was a bit silly for Apple to ask people to pay $150 more for a glorified Sonos, which starts at $200. But some folks informed me that way of thinking was slightly off. For one, this most likely competes with Sonos\u2019s $300 to $500 offerings, which are rather decent and nice-sounding speakers.\nBut you have to look beyond direct music competitors to get the full scope of what Apple is doing. Some propose that marketing the HomePod as a music listening device is just a backdoor entry into Apple\u2019s living room strategy, something on par with what Amazon is doing with Alexa and Google\u2019s similar move with its Home device. It\u2019s clever, too, as it can slowly learn over time and not stumble trying to do too much right off the bat, as we have seen a little bitwith Google\u2019s public stumbles.\nWill I buy one? Probably not, but I have issues. Or rather, my dog does.\nFarhad:Dogs scared of music \u2014 is this a common thing? Try playing\u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d\u2014 not even Bruna could resist. See you next week!"

        "fulltext": "Q.The Music program on my iPhone is stuck on the same song, playing it over and over, and I don\u2019t see how to stop it. Why is this?\nA.Since the heyday ofthe iPod, Apple has included controls for shuffling tracks, repeating playlists and albums and looping a song. If the song-looping option is accidentally turned on, the same track will play again and again.\nOver the years and up through touch-screen interfaces, the controls for Shuffle and Repeat have moved around. WithiOS 10 for the iPhone, they are not immediately visible. To turn off the Repeat button when you are on the Music app\u2019sNow Playingscreen, swipe up on the album cover to pull the lower part of the screen into view. There, you should see the buttons for Shuffle and Repeat, as well as a list of the next tracks to be played andthe option to display lyrics.\nWhen the Repeat button is magenta and displays a pair of curved arrows, the album or playlist will repeat. When the magenta button shows the arrows with a tiny 1 between them, the app will keep playing that one song. Tap the Repeat button to turn it gray and turn off the setting.\nOn the latest version of the touch-screen iPod Nano, you can get to the same controls bytapping the Now Playing screen. Once they are visible, tap the icons to turn on the feature; tap the Repeat button three times to cycle through the options."

        "title": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC",
        "fulltext": "\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\n\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\n\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.\nAmazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.\nApple had long been rumored to be working on a device meant to take on the Echo, which hasbecome a surprise hitsince Amazon released it nearly three years ago. The category is getting pretty crowded: Last year, Google released a talking home computer of its own,called Google Home, and Microsoft\u2019s assistant, Cortana, is also making its way to home speakers.\nSo how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.\nAlthough Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.\nThe big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.\n(With the announcement of HomePod, Apple seems to be finally embracing the technologies it has long put on the back burner. Read more from Farhad Manjoo in hisState of the Art column.)\nApple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.\nThat included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201d\nThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.\nAfter Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.\nSome of Apple\u2019s rivals have capitalized on the iPad\u2019s stumbles. Amazon said recently that its tablet sales had grown substantially compared with last year. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire tabletsare extremely cheap, starting at $50, and they allow for basic functions like reading e-books, streaming Netflix and listening to music.\nApple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.\nOne of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.\nThe new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.\nWith this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.\nThe company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.\nLast year was rough for the Mac. Fans of the MacBook Pro waited for Apple to unveil a major upgrade after the laptop had remained relatively unchanged for about four years. But when Appleintroduced a new MacBook Prowith a Touch Bar, a virtual touch strip embedded into its keyboard,customers were divided. Some fans concluded that the Mac was now in the back seat because Apple was prioritizing the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch.\nEvery year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.\nThe most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.\nBecause the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.\nThe iPhone already supports augmented reality withgames like Pok\u00e9mon Go. On Monday, Apple said it was offering a new tool kit for bringing advanced augmented reality applications to the iPhone and the iPad. Mr. Cook has spoken several times of Apple\u2018s interest in augmented reality, hinting that the company could be developing an augmented reality headset.\nApple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.\nApple also unveiled a new operating system for its Mac computers, called High Sierra. The company made privacy a key selling point with this and said the next version of its Safari web browser would block videos that automatically start playing andstop advertising trackers. While users will probably welcome those changes, the development was another blow to web publishers, who rely on ads that Apple will now block. Apple added optional ad blocking to the iPhone and the iPad last year."

        "title": "Apple Piles On the Features, and Users Say, \u2018Enough!\u2019",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its developer conference on Monday, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are already too complicated for many users to figure out.\nAtlast year\u2019s conference, for example, Apple\u2019s top software executive, Craig Federighi, demonstrated how users could order food, scribble doodles and send funny images known as stickers in chats on its Messages app. The idea was to make Messages, one of the most popular apps on the iPhone, into an all-purpose tool likeChina\u2019s WeChat.\nBut the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say.\nDoorDash, a food-delivery app that Mr. Federighi displayed on stage as a model of the new feature, dropped its Messages app for group orders a few months after releasing it because it drew little interest.\n\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t end up moving forward with it, we\u2019re excited about other ways we\u2019re making delivery faster and more efficient,\u201d Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a statement.\nA similar lack of enthusiasm among users and developers has limited adoption of the iPhone\u2019s 3-D Touch feature, where a long, hard press on an app sometimes offers additional options such as viewing an email without opening it. And sales of the Apple Watch have been hampered by thesteep learning curveit requires of users, who must master pushing, turning and tapping various parts of the watch and a related iPhone app.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much stuff,\u201d said David de Min, chief executive ofVelapp, a start-up based in London. \u201cThey are trying to cram things in.\u201d\nVelapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But Mr. de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really see,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\nApple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voice mail messages.\nAt this year\u2019s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif., the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.\nWith Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices.\nApp developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple\u2019s latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago.\nApple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. \u201cThere is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever,\u201d he said.\nThe slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers.\nThere are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch.\n\u201cYou get your new iPhone and you don\u2019t know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, \u201cI downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?\u201d\nThat is not exactly in line with the simple \u201cit just works\u201d philosophy that Apple built its business on.\nApple is not the only major technology company struggling to find the right balance between constant innovation and ease of use. Facebook has changed course several times in its approach to apps and bots within its Messenger app and regularly battles feature overload in its News Feed. Google, whose search box is a paragon of simplicity, famously retreated from an attempt to tie all of its services together with the unwieldy Google Plus social network.\nBen Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, which makes apps for companies like JetBlue Airways and Turner, said he would like to see Apple simplify and smooth out some of its current features. He said Messages apps have potential if Apple can figure out how to make it easier for people to find them.\nMr. Reubenstein pointed to a feature of Google Photos as an example of the simplicity that people want. He said he backs up his iPhone photos to Google, which uses face recognition to tag people in the images. For Mother\u2019s Day, Google made it so easy to create quick movies from those photos that he made three, for his mother, his mother-in-law and his wife.\nChalen Duncan, a graduate student in emerging media at the University of Georgia, was so frustrated by the interface for stickers and apps in Messages that he redesigned it andposted his version online.\n\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a discoverability issue,\u201d said Mr. Duncan, who worked part time on Apple\u2019s telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the stickers exist.\u201d\nHe said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots.\n\u201cA lot of people will think it\u2019s their fault, and it\u2019s really the designer\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want apps to be easy to use.\u201d"

        "title": "Can Amazon Be the Next Apple?",
        "fulltext": "Blood is running in the retail aisle. Sears, the most iconic name in American retailing, told its investors in March that \u201csubstantial doubt exists related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The appliance retailer HH Gregg went defunct at the end of May, and once-celebrated companies like Bebe and Limited are desperately trying to survive as online-only storefronts. The carnage has spread beyond empty shopping malls and big-box stores to the grocery trade. Last week, a poor earnings report cost Kroger, the nation\u2019s second-largest food retailer, 19 percent of its stock market value in a matter of hours \u2014 and that was before Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market.\nSo why might Amazon, the giant of online shopping, want to spend $13.4 billion on 461 brick-and-mortar stores of the sort other retailers are shedding left and right, along with a coffee roaster, 11 food distribution centers and manufacturing plants that do things like bake bread and gut fish? One obvious possibility is that Amazon could try to cut delivery times and costs by letting shoppers order online and then pick up their goods at the nearest Whole Foods. Another is that Amazon, for some reason, wants to grab a share of the low-profit grocery business, where online sales have not taken off, and see whether its technological wizardry can revolutionize food shopping.\nBut there may be a less obvious explanation of Amazon\u2019s interest in Whole Foods: Perhaps it wants to be a bit more like Apple.\nThere\u2019s no question that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has built a hugely successful business. But a large part that business comes from selling the products of others. Only a tiny fraction of its retail sales \u2014 its Kindle e-reader, its Echo home control center, the audio books published by its Audible subsidiary, its Amazon Original videos \u2014 are exclusive to Amazon. The company makes money on the rest only if the prices on its website, with delivery costs added in, are below those elsewhere.\nWhat that means is that Amazon\u2019s margins are skinny. Last year its business that provides cloud-based web services for businesses and governments, with $12 billion of revenue, brought in three times the pre-tax profit Amazon reaped from $125 billion in retail sales.\nHow to solve this problem? An envious glance at one of their company\u2019s best-known competitors might offer Amazon executives an answer.\nIn 2016, not a stellar year, Apple Inc. reported net income equal to 21 percent of sales \u2014 a ratio 12 times higher than Amazon\u2019s. A large part of Apple\u2019s profit is generated at its retail stores. Apple doesn\u2019t disclose such information, but its Apple Stores arebelievedto have annual sales above $5,500 per square foot. No other retailer comes close. The corresponding figure for Macy\u2019s, to take one example, is around $200.\nApple doesn\u2019t need flashy stores in expensive locations to distribute phones and computers; those can be ordered on the internet. The Apple Stores, meticulously planned from their online appointment books to the transaction processing system that emails a receipt before you\u2019ve walked out the door, sell an experience, not electronics. Their purpose is to persuade customers that Apple has extraordinarily exciting products for which premium prices are entirely justified.\nWhole Foods started out with a similar idea, but its approach hasn\u2019t been working well. Its customer count dropped 2.6 percent last year as shoppers rebelled against high prices for food that didn\u2019t seem worth the premium. In a phone call with investors on May 10, John Mackey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Whole Foods was striving for \u201clower costs, lower prices and higher sales.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like the mantra of a high-end retailer.\nAside from its troubled grocery business, though, Whole Foods brings Amazon two important assets: affluent customers and locations in high-income neighborhoods. Amazon might use these assets to broaden its business in a way it cannot do online.\nOnline retailing allows retailers access to millions of customers, but that\u2019s not always a benefit. One of the challenges of e-commerce is that it\u2019s difficult to segment the market. Every customer has access to the same web pages. Online merchants may take advantage of information about individuals\u2019 browsing history and past purchases to offer different prices to some than to others, but there\u2019s no way to make online shopping a special experience with Apple-style margins. For that, it\u2019s still critical to bring customers in the door.\nThat\u2019s where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods\u2019s stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon\u2019s online business.\nThey could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet \u2014 profit margins that look a lot more like Apple\u2019s."

        "title": "Apple, Moving In on Prestige TV, Poaches Two Sony Executives",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 As Apple takes the plunge into original television-style content, it has hired two of Hollywood\u2019s most respected studio executives to oversee the effort.\nOn Friday, Apple named Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to newly created positions overseeing worldwide video programming. The men, considered among the brightest of a rising generation of studio executives, are currently the leaders of Sony Pictures Television, the company behind high-quality cable dramas like \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d major Netflix series like \u201cThe Crown\u201d and broadcast network comedies like \u201cThe Goldbergs.\u201d\nIn a blow to Sony, Mr. Erlicht, 48, and Mr. Van Amburg, 46, will start at Apple by the end of summer. They will report to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software and services. \u201cWe have exciting plans,\u201d Mr. Cue said in a statement. \u201cThere is much more to come.\u201d\nApple declined to elaborate. By hiring Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg, however, Apple has sent a clear message to Hollywood: We are finally serious about building an original video business. In a statement, Mr. Erlicht said that Apple wanted programming of \u201cunparalleled quality.\u201d Agents, writers, producers, stars \u2014 and competitors like HBO \u2014 will interpret those words as meaning that Apple is ready to spend.\nSo far, Apple has onlydipped a toein the original video waters. In February, the company announced several shows designed to distinguish Apple Music, its subscription streaming service, from competitors like Spotify. One offering, \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d is a reality show about iPhone app developers that counts Gwyneth Paltrow as a judge.\nSo far, Hollywood has not been impressed.Variety, the entertainment trade news outlet, called \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d which debuted this month, \u201ca bland, tepid, barely competent knock-off of \u2018Shark Tank.\u2019\u201d\nAmong technology companies, Apple is late to the original video party. Way out in front are Netflix, which is spending about $6 billion on programming this year, and Amazon, expected to spend $4.5 billion. In the meantime, Apple \u2014 with more than$250 billion in cash\u2014 has explored several Hollywood strategies; at one point it was seriously considering the purchase of Imagine Entertainment, a film and television company founded by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.\nMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg are known as builders. When they became senior executives at Sony\u2019s television business in 2002, the studio was working to re-establish itself after severe cutbacks had essentiallyleft the division for dead.\nWorking with their boss at the time, Steve Mosko, the two men were able to make inroads against more entrenched rivals by spotting the cable industry\u2019s move toward prestige dramas. Sony quickly sold shows like \u201cRescue Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shield\u201d to FX.\nThe loss of Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg comes at an awkward time for Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has signaled that it wants to expand its television business under Tony Vinciquerra, whotook over as chief executivein May. Mr. Mosko, Sony\u2019s longtime television chairman,left last yearamid tension with Mr. Vinciquerra\u2019s predecessor.\nOn the bright side, Sony may now be better positioned than rival television studios to do business with Apple. \u201cWhile we are sad to see them go,\u201d Mr. Vinciquerra said in an email to employees about the executives\u2019 departure, \u201cwe are excited by the opportunity to work with them as partners in the future.\u201d"

        "title": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters",
        "fulltext": "Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.\nNot only do theydominate our daily lives, but as their stocks continue to soar, these technology giants may also dictate our financial futures.\nIn the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.\nBut this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\n\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201d\nDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.\nOther markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.\nThe stock market, however, remains the main attraction.\nLate in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.\nAccording to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.\nAs is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.\nThe push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.\nThrough these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.\nIt is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\n\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.\nIn Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.\nSo when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\n\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201d\nStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.\nStill, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?\nFor example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.\nOf course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.\nAmazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.\nStill, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.\nSurprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.\nBill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.\nMr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\n\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201d\nAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.\nWhile skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\n\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201d\nAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.\nThat is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.\nAnd as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.\nSo be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Throughout the turbulence of his first months in office, President Trump has been able to point to one bastion of support: the stock market. Earlier this monthhe tweetedthe \u201cgreat economic news\u201d he thinks the mainstream media has been ignoring: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 16 percent and the Nasdaq up 19.5 percent since his election. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rossmaintainedthat the Trump administration had bestowed $4 trillion in gains on investors.\nInvestors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.\nBut as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201d\nInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201d\nThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.\nOn June 14, the Federal Reserveraised short-term interest ratesfor the second time this year, a move that was widely expected. But more ominously for stock investors, the Fed also said it would reduce its $4.2 trillion balance sheet and taper its purchases of longer-term government bonds (though it didn\u2019t say how fast), bringing to an end thequantitative easingit undertook after the financial crisis. And the prospect that European central banks might join in the tightening has sent bond prices lower.\nAnd then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.\nSo I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.\nAfter some of the Faang stocksplunged over 3 percenton June 9, Goldman Sachs compared them to the leading stocks of the tech bubble. But by the end of the month they\u2019d recovered and were again approaching all-time highs.\nThere\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.\nThe tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201d\nMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201d\nBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.\nEveryone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\n\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201d\nMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201d\nMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.\nMr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201d\nOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\n\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201d\nNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.\nAt the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201c\nHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201d"
