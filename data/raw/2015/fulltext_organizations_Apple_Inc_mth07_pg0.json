Is there a similar place on the computer I can look to see how much of my hard drive space is occupied by photos?\nA.Both Windows and OS X can give you a quick snapshot of your hard drive \u2014 and what types of files are filling it up. If your hard drive becomes too full, it could start running slower and behave erratically, so monitoring the drive\u2019s free space is a good idea.\nOn a Windows 8.1 computer, press the Windows and C keys to open the Charms bar on the right side of the screen; on a touch screen you can just swipe your finger in from the right edge to open the Charms Bar. Next, select Settings and then Change PC Settings. Now, select PC and Devices and on the screen after that, choose Disk Space. TheDisk Space screenshows how much space is taken by each type of file \u2014 like apps, pictures, videos and documents and so on.\nOn a Mac running OS X Yosemite, go up to the Apple menu in the top-left corner and chooseAbout This Mac. Click the Storage tab to see a colorful graphic depicting your hard drive\u2019s contents, divided by categories like Photos or Applications.\nUsing Bluetooth Speakers With iTunes\nQ.Is there a way to get iTunes on a PC to play over Bluetooth speakers? The Music app on the iPhone will play just fine, but iTunes won\u2019t. Any ideas?\nA.Once you have ensured that you have the latest updates for iTunes,QuickTime, Windows and your Bluetooth drivers, check your computer\u2019s audio configuration. When you have paired the Bluetooth speakers with the PC, go to the Control Panel and to the sound settings for your version of Windows. Make sure those speakers are selected as the default audio output device for the computer and have not been disabled for playback.\nOnce you have chosen the Bluetooth hardware, quit and restart iTunes (if it was open), then try playing a song to see if the program has found the new speakers. When you are finished with iTunes or want to hear your computer\u2019s sound through its own speakers again, return to the Control Panel and switch back from the Bluetooth speakers.\nAs an additional troubleshooting step, some Windows usershave reported on Apple support forumsthat going to the Edit menu in iTunes, choosing Preferences and then Playback and switching between Direct Audio (if it is available) and Windows Audio Session may help with the issue. Quit and restart iTunes each time you fiddle with its playback settings."

Failure to pay the E.C.B. would have forced the bank to cut off emergency funding for Greek banks, causing them and the Greek economy to collapse. The debt payments represent a step back from the precipice of a eurozone exit for Greece, but the government led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must cope this week with the political turmoil caused by his decision to accept unpleasant conditions set by eurozone creditors in return for financial aid. In a move toward normalcy, Greek banksreopened on Monday. \u2014Jack Ewing\nMorgan Stanleyannounced its second-quarter earningson Monday morning, making it the last of the major Wall Street banks to do so.

Analysts are viewing the wristwatch as a litmus test for whether the company can still make successful products. When Apple announces its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, financial analysts are expected to scrutinize the company\u2019s revenue numbers to assess whether the product was a hit or a miss. \u2014Brian X. Chen\nNew data will be presented this week on experimental drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s disease at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Washington. Of particular interest will be additional results, which are expected on Wednesday, from clinical trials sponsored by the biotechnology company Biogen and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. The results will be incremental, not definitive, but Wall Street will be watching closely. Biogen\u2019s drug, aducanumab, slowed the decline in cognition in an early-stage trial. The new data this week from that same trial could solidify those findings or cast doubt on them. Eli Lilly\u2019s drug, solanezumab, a treatment for those in the earliest stages of the disease, failed in late-stage trials, but the company has started a big new trial. Data this week could bolster or weaken confidence that the drug will succeed in the new trial. \u2014Andrew Pollack\nThe Bank of England on Wednesday will release the minutes of its recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The minutes may provide more insight on when the central bank will look to raise its benchmark interest rate, which has remained at an all-time low since March 2009. In a speech last week at Lincoln Cathedral, Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said a decision on when to begin the process of increasing the benchmark rate \u201cwill likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year.\u201d Mr. Carney added: \u201cIt would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalization begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historical averages.\u201d \u2014Chad Bray\nThe Swiss bank Credit Suisse reports its second-quarter results on Thursday as earnings season kicks off for Europe\u2019s largest banks. In a research note last week, Deutsche Bank said that Credit Suisse\u2019s results could be pressured by lower revenue from its investment bank, particularly in its fixed-income business. Last week, two of its investment banking rivals, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, reported declines in their fixed-income trading revenue in the quarter. \u2014Chad Bray\nGeneral Motors, the largest American automaker, is expected to report solid second-quarter earnings on Thursday. The company posted strong vehicle sales in the United States during the quarter, primarily of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But G.M. continues to struggle to make money in Europe, and its profits will probably be hurt by the effects of fluctuating currencies in South America and slowing industry sales in China. \u2014Bill Vlasic\nThe Food and Drug Administration is expected by Friday to approve Praluent, the first of a new class of powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs. Doctors are excited, but health care companies are worried about the potentially huge cost of treating all of the people who may need an extra boost to lower their lipids. Health carriers and Wall Street will be watching the price set by Praluent\u2019s developers, Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, (estimates are $7,000 to $12,000 a year). Which types of patients will be eligible for treatment according to the drug\u2019s label is also of interest; this information may determine how widely Praluent will be used. \u2014Andrew Pollack\nA judge will rule on Friday on whether Chicago can proceed with plans to restructure two city pension funds that are at risk of going broke. Chicago hopes to reduce benefits and increase yearly contributions to the funds, from workers and from the city. Unions say the Illinois State Constitution bars any reduction of public pensions. But the city argues that the restructuring is lawful, because it would give the workers a valuable, healthy pension plan in exchange for their current failing plan. The decision will most likely affect Chicago\u2019s credit rating and bond values. \u2014Mary Williams Walsh"

        "title": "With CarPlay, Apple Looks to Upend Tradition",
        "fulltext": "APPLE\u2019S widely anticipatedCarPlaysoftware is making its mainstream debut this summer in models from Hyundai and Chevrolet, but Apple is already looking ahead to leverage its potential in a way that could turn the automotive industry\u2019s current approach to connected cars on its head.\nAimed at streamlining the welter of apps from smartphones that play on some dashboards into a more cohesive \u2014 and less distracting \u2014 arrangement, CarPlay combines iPhone-based programs, including maps, messages and music, into a single interface. It makes adroit use of Siri voice commands and familiar touch controls.\nBut it cannot control standard car functions, like switching FM radio stations or checking a vehicle\u2019s engine status. To use those features, drivers will have to switch out of CarPlay.\n\u201cAny user interface jump within a single display is a hard thing for people to reconcile,\u201d said Parrish Hanna,Ford\u2019s global director of human machine interface. Switching between different sets of controls, even between digital and physical control buttons, can be confusing and potentially distracting, he said.\nSo at its developers\u2019 conference last month, Apple proposed that rather than following the traditional route of simply having technology companies create apps for cars, automakers should do a U-turn and write apps for the technology company\u2019s software.\nFord, for example, could write an app for gauging fuel efficiency to run under CarPlay, giving iPhone owners a more seamless experience. But it would also raise issues about safety and privacy, and essentially turn automakers into Apple developers. (Googlehas a similar option in its competingAndroid Autosoftware.)\nSo will automakers start creating software for Apple\u2019s program?\n\u201cIf we were to do it,\u201d says Phil Abram, the chief infotainment officer atGeneral Motors, \u201cit would have to make sense for the car.\u201d Using voice commands to roll down a window, for example, would seem gratuitous to many drivers. G.M. is introducing CarPlay in more than a dozen models this year, including the Corvette and the Cruze. Support for Google\u2019s Android Auto will follow.\nWith its OnStar system, G.M. already has apps for smartphones to perform tasks like remotely starting or unlocking vehicles. Furthermore, G.M. will allow Apple\u2019s CarPlay maps to use onboard GPS data directly from the car, Mr. Abram said. But with the G.M. ignition switch recall looming in the background, the automaker is taking pains to emphasize safety, and is not going to take the risk of allowing another company \u2014 Apple or Google \u2014 access to critical components like the electronic stability control and braking systems.\nAddressing the privacy issue, Apple will not collect or use tracking information from the proposed auto company apps. \u201cThe data goes directly to us as the creator of the application,\u201d Mr. Hanna of Ford said.\nStill, if automakers were to begin developing apps for CarPlay, it could open a new avenue for hackers, experts say. And there are already potential vulnerabilities, as the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyhas demonstrated in experimentsshowing how a criminal could remotely take control of a connected car.\n\u201cThere are absolutely security issues,\u201d said Robert Clyde, international vice president at Isaca, a nonprofit organization focused on information technology security. \u201cCould a bug in iOS or in Android give someone access to critical systems?\u201d Apple and Google declined to comment.\nOnce a problem is discovered, there is also the practical problem of updating the software, which in many cases would require extensive testing to ensure that no new conflicts were introduced. In most cases, drivers would then have to return to the dealership for a software update.\nMost automakers have already invested considerable time and effort in developing their own connected car systems. Ford has had such a system for more than seven years and is introducing its latest version, Sync 3, this summer. Sync 3 already supports a multitude of smartphone apps, taking the more traditional approach of having companies like Pandora develop apps for its system, rather than the other way around. To make the process easier for developers, Ford is promoting SmartDeviceLink, which would give app creators a way to write a program once that could then run in any compatible car. Toyota has said it is studying SmartDeviceLink as well.\nThere is also technology\u2019s rapidly evolving nature to consider, Mr. Hanna said. \u201cThe apps are going to come and go,\u201d he said, pointing out that Ford\u2019s Applink software now supports Apple and Android \u2014 but not BlackBerry.\nThe lesson: Automakers cannot afford to hitch their connected car future to any one device.\nMoreover, many drivers will not want to be forced to rely on a smartphone in their vehicles, so car companies will have to continue to develop built-in connected systems \u2014 especially with self-driving cars on the horizon, some experts said.\n\u201cIt will be impossible to do everything from a phone,\u201d said Andrew Poliak, the global director of automotive business development at QNX Software Systems. QNX is responsible for the software behind many connected car systems, including Audi\u2019s and Ford\u2019s. (QNX is owned by BlackBerry.) Cars will still need built-in navigation for semiautonomous driving assistance features to work, Mr. Poliak says, as well as to meet safety and security standards.\nAnd even if automakers started developing significant software for CarPlay, \u201cyou\u2019d need to change the whole supply chain and how things are done now,\u201d said Mark Haidar, the co-founder and chief executive of Vinli, which has been working on a device to add connected car features to older cars. \u201cAnd the return is that it will only benefit people using Apple products.\u201d\nWhich is why Mr. Haidar remains skeptical. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fly in the auto industry,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple Profit Up 38%, but iPhone Sales Disappoint Wall Street",
        "fulltext": "Even whenApplejumps, investors wonder why the company can\u2019t jump a bit higher.\nThat was underscored on Tuesday when Apple reported double-digit increases in sales and profit for its fiscal third quarter, a rate of growth that is highly unusual for a company of its size. Yet the results still fell short of estimates by Wall Street analysts, who are accustomed to Apple blowing past projections and had been predicting sky-high sales of iPhones and the company\u2019s brand-new Apple Watch.\nIn total, Apple reported a 38 percent increase in profit, to $10.7 billion, from a year ago, with revenue surging 33 percent to $49.6 billion. Sales of the company\u2019s biggest revenue and profit generator, theiPhone, soared 35 percent to 47.5 million units.\n\u201cThat\u2019s mind-boggling\u201d growth for a company that produces more than $200 billion in annual revenue and clocks in with a market capitalization of $753 billion, said Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThat said, everyone expected that and a little bit more.\u201d\nThe disconnect between market estimates and reality sent Apple\u2019s shares plunging in after-hours trading and highlights the expectations quandary that the company\u2019s success has created. The lingering question among investors is how long the company, based in Cupertino, Calif., can keep growing at double-digit rates before it begins to plateau.\nIPhone sales faced some tough sequential comparisons. The 47.5 million units sold in the quarter was below the roughly 50 million that analysts had calculated Apple would sell, and was also down from the 40 percent growth in the previous quarter and the 46 percent growth two quarters earlier. Still, the rate of growth exceeded the 13 percent increase in the same period a year ago.\nAnd while Apple did not share numbers on sales of the Apple Watch, which began selling in April, analysts on Tuesday calculated that the company had sold between 1.5 million and three million watches, far less than the three million to five million watches they had predicted ahead of Apple\u2019s earnings report.\nDespite falling short of investors\u2019 expectations, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the company had a strong quarter.\n\u201cWe had an amazing quarter, with iPhone revenue up 59 percent over last year, strong sales of Mac, all-time record revenue from services, driven by the App Store, and a great start for Apple Watch,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a statement, adding that excitement forApple Music, its new streaming music service, was \u201cincredible.\u201d\nFor Apple, the jump in iPhone sales is noteworthy because the spring season tends to be when device sales slow down. Sales usually heat up between September and December, when consumers stock up on new devices for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, and cool down afterward.\nIn response to questions about the perceived slowdown of iPhone growth, Mr. Cook said only 27 percent of iPhone customers had upgraded to the latest iPhone 6, indicating there was more room for sales as people trade up. He added that more people were also switching from mobile devices based on Google\u2019s Android mobile software to Apple devices than ever before.\n\u201cFrom our point of view the iPhone is doing outstanding,\u201d he said.\nApple also reported $2.6 billion in revenue for a category it calls \u201cOther Products,\u201d which includes theApple Watch. Before the report, analysts had estimated that if revenue in the category exceeded $5 billion, it would be a sign that Apple had sold at least five million watches, much higher than the number of iPhones and iPads that were sold in their first quarters on the market.\nThat sales performance, they said, is a litmus test for whether Apple can continue successful product introductions since the death in 2011 of Steve Jobs, who drove the company to new heights with products like the iPhone andiPad.\nIn an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said the watch\u2019s sales in its first nine weeks exceeded those of the iPhone and iPad in their first nine weeks of availability.\nYet analysts had to revise down their estimates for watch sales. Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, calculated Apple had sold from two million to 2.5 million watches in the quarter, down from a previous prediction of five million.\nMr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein also estimated Apple had sold roughly two million watches, falling short of his forecast of three million. He said it was still too soon to tell whether the Apple Watch was a hit or a miss.\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to render a verdict on the watch,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can say is relative to expectations, whether those were misplaced or not, the watch was a disappointment this quarter.\u201d\nIn his earnings call, Mr. Cook said that he expected the watch would be a strong seller and among the top gifts of the holiday season.\nApple\u2019s sales in the quarter were fueled by overseas buyers, with international regions accounting for 64 percent of the quarter\u2019s overall revenue. Sales in the greater China region,one of Apple\u2019s prime growth areas, more than doubled to $13.2 billion.\nThe company also reported healthy growth for its Macintosh computer business. Apple sold 4.8 million Macs, up 9 percent from a year ago.\nYet the iPad, which has experienced declining sales over the last year, continued to shrink. The company posted sales of 10.9 million iPads, down 18 percent from 13.3 million sold in the same quarter a year earlier.\nMr. Maestri said Apple remained confident about the prospects of the iPad. The next version of iOS, the company\u2019s mobile operating system, will add major new features to the tablet, like the ability to run two apps side by side. The company has also seen progress in its partnership with IBM to make iPad apps tailored for business, he added.\nBesides, Apple has another ace in its pocket: $202.8 billion in cash, up from $164.5 billion a year ago."

        "fulltext": "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\nSo began the email to Stephen L. Joseph. It was 2003, and Mr. Joseph, a public interest lawyer, had just filed a lawsuit against Kraft Foods for marketing Oreos to children. The trans fats in the cookies, he argued, were unsafe and easily replaced.\nThe email writer took issue with Mr. Joseph\u2019s methods. \u201cWe live in America, land of the free, where we can eat whatever the hell we want!!! If you don\u2019t like it, move to Afghanistan, you damn terrorist.\u201d\nTo judge by his inbox, with its thousands of similar angry emails \u2014 \u201cMost of them telling me to get a life. Also, some telling me to drop dead,\u201d Mr. Joseph said \u2014 he was on the wrong side of history, his ideas destined for the dust bin.\nBut the movement grew, and last month, the federal government told the food industryit has until 2018to stop using trans fats. Mr. Joseph helped propel the movement and was a pioneer in nutrition-related lawsuits; after getting Kraft to eliminate trans fats from Oreos, he then sued McDonald\u2019s over a delay in eliminating those fats in its fries.\nMr. Joseph, who was born in England and now lives in Los Angeles, seems to relish a Quixotic fight. His chief weapon is the lawsuit. Now he has a new target: the world\u2019s largest tech companies. He isaccusingthem of creating products used in the deadly habit of distracted driving.\nIn April,he filed a lawsuitin state court in Los Angeles against Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. Their smartphones and watches, his complaint says, encourage people to focus on texting and other social media instead of the road, and the companies have a responsibility to help confront the problem.\nHis suit calls on them to pay up to $1 billion a year to fund an education campaign about the risks of multitasking behind the wheel. \u201cThe only rule in technology is if it can be done, it will be done,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody is saying to them: \u2018Wait a minute, stop. This is not good. You\u2019re going to hurt people.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThe technology companies declined to comment on the lawsuit. It stands to reason that they\u2019ll ask the court to throw it out. And several legal scholars suggested that dismissal was the likely outcome. But Mr. Joseph, not easily deterred, tends to think that he will eventually get others to see the world through his glasses.\nIn mid-June, Mr. Joseph, 61, stood on a corner in San Francisco\u2019s North Beach neighborhood watching passing cars. Spotting drivers interacting with their phones has become a pastime, and he was quickly obliged by a man in a silver Ford sedan driving through the intersection while tapping on a touch-screen phone.\n\u201cIf he knew what he was doing. If hereallyknew, he wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Joseph said. Then he held up his left wrist and displayed his Apple Watch. \u201cAnd how much smaller is this!\u201d he exclaimed. To interact with it, he said, requires drivers to look away from the road. \u201cHow can Apple just throw it into the car and say it has nothing to do with that?\u201d\nOne obvious response is that it\u2019s the drivers\u2019 responsibility to ignore the devices. Apple, while it declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, did point out that drivers can turn off the devices, use voice commands, or features like airplane mode, aimed at limiting interference. (The same can be said of the products of Apple\u2019s competitors.)\nMr. Joseph argues in his lawsuit that the buzz of devices is \u201cvirtually irresistible\u201d and the notifications are \u201cdesigned and intended to distract.\u201d Further, he notes that the devices are designed for use in the car; the Apple Watch, after all, has turn-by-turn navigation.\nFor his legal argument, Mr. Joseph is relying on a relatively novel reading of an evolving body of \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d law. Historically, this theory was used by governments to combat sources of community disruption \u2014 a raucous rock concert, for instance. Increasingly, though, government agencies have used nuisance suits to try to address public health issues, like suing gun companies for spreading handgun violence, according to Robert L. Rabin, a Stanford Law professor who specializes in public health and safety.\nMr. Rabin noted, however, those efforts had typically failed in court, and in the few instances they had succeeded, they were brought by the government and not by a private individual.\n\u201cNuisance theory is an ill fit here,\u201d Mr. Rabin said of Mr. Joseph\u2019s claim.\nMr. Joseph countered that recent state appellate court decisions in California, and a federal court ruling, supporting the right of a private party to file a public nuisance lawsuit on behalf of the general public.\nThe distracted-driving situation, Mr. Joseph argues, is clearly a public nuisance that threatens his personal safety. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t text and drive, someone can kill me,\u201d he says.\nMr. Rabin says that might be true. \u201cHe\u2019s pursuing a noble cause,\u201d he said of Mr. Joseph. But the legal basis for the suit is a big impediment, he said, adding this issue \u201cwould be dead on arrival before most trial court judges.\u201d\nOver lunch at a North Beach restaurant, Mr. Joseph pointed at the Italian flags painted on light poles. Some of the paint was grubby and chipped. \u201cIs that acceptable? Look at that. Look at that!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cI drive people nuts.\u201d And he reflected on how he gets fixated on things, like the smudged Italian flag or graffiti. \u201cOther people can sit here and not see that at all. I can see only that.\u201d He sounded like Woody Allen channeling Che Guevara.\nMr. Joseph\u2019s first real act as a public gadfly involved taking on graffiti in San Francisco in 2000. He\u2019d moved to the city after working in Washington for 17 years as a lawyer and lobbyist. (He continues to do private legal work that supports his public interest cases.) Appalled by the prodigious graffiti, he began cleaning it himself. He pestered the city to help, but when that didn\u2019t happen, he filed a lawsuit. \u201cBy the time I got home\u201d from the courthouse, \u201cI already heard about the lawsuit on the radio. In just 15 minutes! That night, Channel 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11 were all in my home!\u201d\nIt was a public nuisance suit, and the court threw it out because he lacked legal standing to bring it. (He faces a similar challenge with the tech companies.) But by then, the city was cleaning up the graffiti. \u201cI lost the lawsuit, but won the war,\u201d he said.\nNext up was trans fats, which he learned about first in an article in The San Francisco Chronicle. He began studying the issue and had a revelation one day after he learned of Oreo-like cookies made by Newman\u2019s Own that didn\u2019t use trans fats.\n\u201cI went to Whole Foods and bought some, and I told my wife: \u2018If these cookies taste good, I\u2019m going to file a lawsuit against Kraft. If they taste like cardboard, I won\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nHis palate was satisfied, and the lawsuit, filed in Marin County Superior Court, caused an instant uproar. Mr. Joseph was widely pilloried on right-wing radio, which he felt helped his cause immeasurably. \u201cThey were hating the Oreo lawsuit so much that they were repeating, \u2018Trans fat, trans fat, trans fat,\u2019 creating awareness of the issue.\u201d\nShortly after, Mr. Joseph dropped the lawsuit; Kraft told him it would abandon trans fats in the Oreo. Again, winning the suit became secondary to filing it. Mr. Joseph acquired a reputation as someone who used lawsuits effectively, even if he wasn\u2019t a particularly subtle litigator, said Steven Gardner, a longtime public interest lawyer.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more like an intellectual do-gooder than Bartleby the Scrivener,\u201d Mr. Gardner said of Mr. Joseph, adding, \u201cGood for him.\u201d\nAfter his trans fats campaign, Mr. Josephdefendedthe plastic bag industry in its battle with environmentalists in California. Mr. Joseph took the position that the environmental groups, which wanted to outlaw plastic bags, were vastly overstating the harm they caused.\nWith financial support from plastic bag companies, he filed a lawsuit that made it to the California Supreme Court and handed Mr. Joseph and his allies a mixed result. He lost on some key points, but scored one win: The court ruled that Mr. Joseph\u2019s organization had the right to file the suit on behalf of the public. Still, it was an instance in which Mr. Joseph arguably won a courtroom battle, but lost the war; more than 100 California cities have banned plastic bags.\nMr. Joseph speaks eloquently on the legal theories of his case against the tech companies. But, as much as that, he\u2019s apt at using the courts to draw the eye of the public. As Peter Grande, the chief executive of Command Packaging, a Los Angeles company that makes plastic bags, put it: \u201cHe uses the legal system to get everybody\u2019s attention.\u201d"

        "title": "Keeping Dictation on a Mac Private",
        "fulltext": "Q.Why do you have to be online for the text dictation function to work in Mac OS X Yosemite?\nA.When you use theDictation feature of OS X, your spoken words are recorded and uploaded to Apple\u2019s servers for translation \u2014 and return as the typed text you see on screen. All that requires an active Internet connection.\nApple does collect certain bits of information about you during this process (like your name and personal contacts) so its software can better understand you andyour commands. To see how the company treats your personal data, readApple\u2019s Privacy Policyposted on its site.\nYou can use the dictation feature without having to be online all the time or worry about your words flying to and from Apple\u2019s servers. To do so, switch to the Enhanced Dictation option in the OS X settings. You will need to install about a gigabyte of additional software, but the update itself is free.\nTo get the Enhanced Dictation program, open the Mac\u2019s System Preferences icon from the Dock and click Dictation & Speech in the window. Turn on the checkbox next to Use Enhanced Dictation and let the download begin.\nMoving to Windows 10\nQ.I plan to upgrade to Windows 10 this summer, but instead of downloading the system, I\u2019m just going to buy a new PC with Windows 10 already on it. What\u2019s the easiest way to move all my documents and photos to the new computer?\nA.Moving your files to a new machine can be as simple as dragging them on and off an external hard drive, as long as you can see everything you want to move. If you have all your files organized into a few folders, temporarily uploading those folders to an online storage server likeMicrosoft OneDriveand then downloading them right to the new PC is another approach. On recent Windows systems, OneDrivecan be usedto restore files and settings backed up with File History on the old PC to a new computer.\nBut if you have a wider variety of things to move \u2014 email, browser bookmarks and so on \u2014 you might consider using a dedicated file-transfer program likeLaplink\u2019s PC MoverorZinstall\u2019s WinWinorEasy Transfer. These applications may cost money, but they offer more automated and thorough data transfers between computers.\nTIP OF THE WEEKSmartphone cameras make it easy to quickly snap photos without fussing a lot with settings. If you occasionally want a little more control over your shots, though, dig a little deeper into your camera app\u2019s settings.\nFor example, when you have the camera function open in theGoogle Camera app for Android, tap the three-dot menu icon in the lower-right corner to get to the settings for the camera\u2019s timer, grid and more. To change the resolution of your photos, switch to manual exposure or turn on (or off) location information embedded in the picture files, swipe from left to right on the main screen. Tap the Camera icon, then tap the cog-shapedSettingsicon on the lower-right side. Swiping to the right also reveals the icons for Google Camera\u2019s other special effects like Photo Sphere, Panorama and Lens Blur, as well as the Video function.\nApple\u2019sCamera app for iOS 8keeps most of its features like the timer, HDR and filters visible on screen when you have the app open. You can change the type of photo or video you take by swiping through the options listed at the bottom of the camera display; photos can be taken in the square and panoramic formats and videos can be recorded in time-lapse and slow-motion modes. To superimpose the composition grid on the camera\u2019s screen, open the Settings icon, choose Photos & Camera and flick down to the Grid option."

        "title": "In Apple Watch Debut, Signs of a Familiar Path to Success",
        "fulltext": "Asking if theAppleWatch will become a hit or a flop is a bit like asking if my 2-year-old daughter is destined to go to Yale or to jail. Interested parties can speculate on the basis of thin evidence \u2014 she learned to walk pretty early, though on the other hand, she still thinks cats say \u201cbow wow\u201d \u2014 but youth is inherently unpredictable, and anyone venturing a long-term forecast based on short-term performance runs the risk of looking quite silly.\nTechnology pundits tend to be a rash bunch, though, so there has been no shortage of prognostication about the Apple Watch, a device that went on sale three months ago. Because reviews (including mine) were mixed and the device hasn\u2019t proved to be culturally revolutionary, some aredeclaring the watch dead on arrival.\nApple has declined to provide sales figures for the watch, its newest product. In itsearnings report for the fiscal third quarter, released on Tuesday\u2014 the first to include sales of the Apple Watch \u2014 the company was cagey about sales, withTimothy D. Cook, the chief executive, saying the device had \u201ca great start.\u201d\nAnalysts\u2019 estimates vary wildly, withmanyoriginally predictingthat Apple sold three million to five million watches from April to the end of June. After studying Apple\u2019s opaque earnings report, several analysts revised their estimates down to about 1.5 million to three million watches. Even at the lower end, that\u2019s the opposite of instant death: Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, pointedly said the watch sold more in its first nine weeks on the market than either theiPhoneor theiPaddid in that same period.\nYet the future of the Apple Watch will not be determined by first-quarter sales. Apple\u2019s product debuts tend to follow a well-worn script: A first-generation device is always criticized as overpriced and a bit lacking in utility and is often vulnerable to the charge that it is a solution in search of a problem. Then, over a few years, Apple and its customers figure out the best uses for the gadget, and the company methodically improves design and functionality to meet those needs. It also tends to lower its prices. Correspondingly, sales explode.\nGiven this history, the question to ask about the Apple Watch isn\u2019t how well it has sold so far, but how well Apple is following that script. Is it moving quickly to address the early criticism of the watch and to expand access to and functionality of the device?\nThe answer here is far more definitive than the murky sales figures: So far, Apple is following exactly the same playbook for the watch that it did for the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. If it sticks to that pattern \u2014 trying to add new capabilities to the device while perhaps lowering prices and expanding distribution \u2014 the future of the Apple Watch could be bright. The only catch is that determining success will take months, if not years. Waiting may be too much to ask of itchy tech observers, especially because Mr. Cook\u2019s legacy is riding on his ability to introduce a new product category to the world\u2019s tech-obsessed masses. But waiting may be the only option.\nOf the data we have on the watch so far, much of it leans positive. Owners of Apple Watches, for one, seem to like them.Creative StrategiesandWristly, two research firms, recently conducteda studyof more than 800 Apple Watch owners. About 97 percent reported being either very or somewhat satisfied with the device. That level is better than corresponding levels of satisfaction for the original iPhone and iPad, both of which scored in the low 90s in early customer-sentiment studies.\nBen Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said the study also revealed a point of perhaps deeper importance. There is a split, the research found, between people who describe themselves as tech-obsessed \u2014 people who work in the industry or build apps for a living \u2014 and those outside the tech world, also known as normal people. Early adopters were pickier about the watch\u2019s shortcomings, the study found. Only 43 percent of app developers described themselves as \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the watch, compared with 73 percent of nontech users who were delighted by the device.\nFortunately for Apple, according to the study, a slim majority of Apple Watch owners did not describe themselves as techies \u2014 a finding that surprised Mr. Bajarin.\n\u201cMy assumption was that a high proportion of people who bought the Apple Watch early were probably going to be people who are investors or they\u2019re super into gadgets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly have those people in the survey, but we also have people from Milwaukee who are insurance agents and are not early adopters.\u201d\nHe added that the appeal for those outside tech bodes well for the watch. \u201cThere are clearly way more mainstream users in Apple\u2019s ecosystem than there are early adopters, so it\u2019s good that the watch is already not confusing for people who aren\u2019t your bleeding-edge techies,\u201d he said.\nThe split between the tech elite and mainstream users echoes a story that has been repeated throughout Apple\u2019s history. The iPod, the iPhone and the iPad all confounded tech insiders, who loudly criticized faults with the devices that they claimed would be fatal \u2014 and that, it turned out, didn\u2019t much matter to ordinary people, or to Apple\u2019s long-term success. The first iPod, which sold for $399, was called too expensive, and it worked only with Macs. The iPhone didn\u2019t have a copy-and-paste function, it ran only the slow Edge network and it didn\u2019t have a removable battery. Also, it couldn\u2019t run third-party apps. The iPad didn\u2019t load websites with Flash animation, and it didn\u2019t have a camera.\nA few of these were genuine shortcomings, and Apple eventually addressed them. The company created a Windows version of the iPod, added an app store to the iPhone and put a camera on the iPad. But in many instances it ignored the techies: Apple never added Flash to iOS, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anyone in tech these days who thinks that was a bad idea.\nThe point here isn\u2019t that the tech critics are always wrong. Instead, the pattern suggests the early criticism isn\u2019t necessarily the best long-term guide. It takes time to figure out which shortcomings in a new product are significant and which are merely symptoms of an outmoded way of looking at technology.\nWith the Apple Watch, the company is clearly studying these patterns now, and it has already shown off some coming changes. There have been two main criticisms of the watch thus far: It\u2019s too slow, and it\u2019s not necessary \u2014 it doesn\u2019t do all that much you can\u2019t do on your phone. A more pernicious problem is that developers have not yet hit on killer ideas for the watch, and some of the world\u2019s largest tech companiesare moving cautiously to create apps for it.\nApple is fixing these problems faster than it addressed major shortcomings with other first-generation products. At its developer conference in June, the companyunveiled an updateto the watch\u2019s operating system that Apple said would greatly improve its speed. The new operating system, appearing later this year, will also let developers use more of the sensors and other technologies on the watch, allowing for more powerful apps.\nThese advances might sound small, but in tech, incremental improvements can drive big changes. Jan Dawson, an independent tech analyst, told me the new operating system would \u201cbe a big part of generating more compelling-use cases for the watch for mainstream users, because that\u2019s when we\u2019ll really start to see a flood of third-party apps that make sense.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, bit-by-bit improvements are part of Apple\u2019smodus operandi. We saw it with the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. After creating something new, the company continually adds small new features over time. Over a few years, this turns an initial burst of interest about Apple\u2019s newest thing into a long-term tech institution that just about everyone can use and enjoy. That\u2019s happening with the watch, and the strategy just might work."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Recently I noticed an uninvited and unwelcome addition to my bookmark list in Firefox: View Pocket List. I do not use Pocket List and do not want to. I can\u2019t seem to either remove it or demote it to the bottom of the list where it takes up less valuable real estate. Can you provide a fix for this intrusive creature?\nA.Mozilla Firefox version 38.0.5 and later includesPocket, a utility that lets youquickly savecontent you find on the web for later. Through an online account you create, Pocket can sync the bookmarked pages to your other computers and devices. As you have noticed, a View Pocket List entry is also now visible in your Firefox bookmarks menu so you can find saved stories there, too.\nIf you have no use for Pocket,you can disable itand remove it from your Firefox toolbar and bookmarks menu. In the Firefox toolbar or corner menu, look for thePocket icon(which resembles a small coin purse or a pouch with a V-shaped flap).\nOnce you find the icon, right-click it (or hold down the Control key and click) and choose Remove From Toolbar or Remove From Menu. Once you do, View Pocket List disappears from your Bookmarks menu. If you ever want it back, just click on the Firefox menu icon, select Customize and drag the Pocket icon back into the toolbar or menu.\nCruising Windows 10 With Chrome\nQ.Will Windows 10 support the Google Chrome browser? I have read in various places that it won\u2019t.\nA.When asked, a Google representative said, \u201cChrome is an equal opportunity browser and will work great on Windows 10.\u201d Some users running the Windows 10 preview software have reportedissueswith running Chrome in the last few months, but Google\u2019s browserhas worked fine for others. The finished version of Microsoft\u2019s new operating systemarrives on July 29, so when you have upgraded your PC, make sure you get the latest version of Google Chrome to be up to date.\nMicrosoft\u2019s ownInternet Exploreris one browser that will be taking a back seat in Windows 10. Although it will still be available to use, Internet Explorer will be replaced as the default program byMicrosoft Edge, the browser formerly code-namedProject Spartan.\nTIP OF THE WEEKThe MacBook laptop family with multitouch trackpads (typicallythose built in 2008 or later) respond to avariety of gesturesyou can use to navigate and control the action on screen \u2014 with just a few swipes and other finger moves. Multitouch gestures also work on Apple\u2019sMagicTrackpadaccessory for its desktop Macs.\nTo see a demonstration of each gesture and what it does, open the System Preferences icon from the Mac\u2019s Dock and click Trackpad. In the Trackpad preferences box, select the multitouch move you would like to learn. You can turn off gestures you do not use \u2014 or use accidentally \u2014 here as well.\nIf you have the \u201cLook Up\u201d gesture enabled in recent versions of OS X, tapping the trackpad with three fingers over a selected word on the screen brings up a box with the dictionary definition, thesaurus suggestions and other information. In OS X 10.10.3 and later, you can do even more with the three-finger tap. When you have a webpage open in the Safari browser, use the three-finger tap on a link on the screen to open a quick preview window of that linked page. You can open the full page in a new tab by clicking the preview window, or you can click the Add to Reading List button in the preview window to save the page for later."
