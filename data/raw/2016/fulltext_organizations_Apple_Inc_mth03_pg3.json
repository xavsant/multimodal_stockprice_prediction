        "fulltext": "The Feds solved one mystery, and may have left the rest of us with several more.\nOn Monday, Katie Bennerreports, the Department of Justice withdrew a legal action that tried to compel Apple to thwart the security on one of its iPhones.\nIt was not necessary anymore, the D.O.J. said, because it had been able to get at the data in an iPhones used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in last year\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The government is not saying whether it found anything of interest to its investigation in the phone, nor the method by which it cracked what was held to be a secure device.\nNeither of those things are particularly great news for Apple. If it was proved there was nothing of interest on the phone, it would not have mattered legally, but it probably would have made Apple\u2019s life easier in the court of public opinion. Hints that there was vital terror information on a phone that Apple did not want cracked would not help its image.\nMore important, the iPhone now seems less secure than Apple itself knew. As the government will not say what vulnerability it exploited, that means every phone out there will potentially carry the flaw.\nIt also implies that there are engineers outside of Apple more capable than Apple\u2019s best with Apple products. Earlierreportsindicated the F.B.I. was able to unlock the phone with the help of third parties. Nobody ever has a lock on all the smart people, of course, but no company likes having this pointed out, either.\nApple is probably not the only party walking away a little sore from this experience. Most observers were counting on this case to eventually land in the Supreme Court, where we would begin to hash out important issues of personal privacy and public security in an era of strong encryption on consumer devices.\nLike any good lawsuit, however, it probably does not end here. Apple may sue the government to find out how the phone got hacked, opening the way for a new bout of arguments on corporate needs and state capabilities. If the government is forced to do that, the iPhone will be a stronger, more secure device.\nOne thing is nearly certain: If a newly secure iPhone is someday at the center of a major crime, we are likely to revive something like the lawsuit that just got killed."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple on Tuesday emphasized its opposition to a court order requiring it to help unlock an iPhone for law enforcement purposes, saying in a new legal brief that the government\u2019s \u201cmethods for achieving its objectives are contrary to the rule of law, the democratic process and the rights of the American people.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s argument quickly drew a response from the Justice Department, which upbraided Apple for trying to stand above the law. \u201cThe Constitution and the three branches of the federal government should be entrusted to strike the balance between each citizen\u2019s right to privacy,\u201d a Justice Department spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a statement. \u201cThe Constitution and the laws of the United States do not vest that power in a single corporation.\u201d\nThe latest volleys between Apple and the Justice Department represent a final cementing of positions in a case that has pitted the world\u2019s largest company against the government, which wants to extract data from an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last December. Apple has refused to comply with the order and its filing on Tuesday was the last before a crucial hearing in the case, which is scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.\nThe case has set off afierce debate over privacy and security, with heated arguments between Apple and the government. Apple has contended that the court order could have grave consequences for digital security and privacy. The Justice Department has said Apple\u2019s inability to get into its smartphones has created a system tailor-made for criminals.\nFor the last few weeks, the two sides have stumped for their positionsbefore Congressand in thecourt of public opinion. Each side has asked Congress to decide under what circumstances the government may see private customer data.President Obama said last weekthat law enforcement authorities must be legally able to collect information from smartphones and other electronic devices.\nIn its legal filing Tuesday, Apple tried to move the debate from an intense and personal tone and refocus attention on what it said it sees as the matter at hand, a fight over civil liberties and data privacy. The issue cannot be weighed without taking into account the larger national debate over data privacy concerns, Apple said.\n\u201cThe Justice Department and F.B.I. argue that this court must decide this issue in a vacuum,\u201d the company said in its brief. \u201cThe court not only can consider this broader context, it must do so.\u201d\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nApple\u2019s filing on Tuesday also reiterated points the company made last month when it asked the court todrop its order, contending that the request would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201d\nThe filing emphasized the constitutional arguments that Apple has made, specifically that the court order violates the company\u2019s constitutional right to free speech and subjects it to \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by the government.\nApple also repeated its argument that the government was overstepping its bounds by seeking to force the company to break into the iPhone using a statute called the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. Apple has said the government is interpreting the law too broadly, and re-emphasized that point on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe All Writs Act cannot be stretched to fit this case,\u201d Apple said.\nThe filing was less fiery than thebrief filed in the case last Thursdayby the Justice Department, which suggested Apple was refusing to comply with the government while secretly conducting a different, special relationship with China. Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, has said that the accusations were baseless and cited unnamed sources.\nApple\u2019s brief on Tuesday, while less angry in tone, did seek to put to rest what its lawyers called the government\u2019s most inflammatory claims about the company\u2019s relationship with China and its use of privacy as a marketing tool. To buttress its defense, Apple cited declarations from Craig Federighi, its senior vice president for software engineering, and Robert Ferrini, its senior director for worldwide advertising and planning.\n\u201cApple uses the same security protocols everywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Federighi said in his declaration filed Tuesday. \u201cApple has never made user data, whether stored on the iPhone or in iCloud, more technologically accessible to any country\u2019s government. We believe any such access is too dangerous to allow.\u201d\nMr. Ferrini also disputed the government\u2019s contention that Apple was using privacy as a marketing tool. Of Apple\u2019s approximately 1,793 advertisements worldwide, he said, \u201cnot a single one has ever advertised or promoted the ability of Apple\u2019s software to block law enforcement requests for access to the contents of Apple devices.\u201d\nAny decision by Judge Pym is likely to be appealed and could reach the Supreme Court, which has issued a mixed set of rulings in recent years on the scope of the government\u2019s powers to collect evidence.\n\u201cWe look forward to responding to Apple\u2019s arguments before the court next week,\u201d said Ms. Pierce of the Justice Department."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s New Challenge: Learning How the U.S. Cracked Its iPhone",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Now that theUnited States government has cracked open an iPhonethat belonged to a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting without Apple\u2019s help, the tech company is under pressure to find and fix the flaw.\nBut unlike other cases where security vulnerabilities have cropped up, Apple may face a higher set of hurdles in ferreting out and repairing the particular iPhone hole that the government hacked.\nThe challenges start with the lack of information about the method that the law enforcement authorities, with the aid of a third party, used to break into the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, an attacker in theSan Bernardino rampagelast year. Federal officials have refused to identify the person, or organization, who helped crack the device, and have declined to specify the procedure used to open the iPhone. Apple also cannot obtain the device to reverse-engineer the problem, the way it would in other hacking situations.\nMaking matters trickier, Apple\u2019s security operation has been in flux. The operation was reorganized late last year. A manager who had been responsible for handling most of the government\u2019s data extraction requests left the team to work in a different part of the company, according to four current and former Apple employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the changes. Other employees, among them one whose tasks included trying to hack Apple\u2019s own products, left the company over the last few months, they said, while new people have joined.\nThe situation is in many ways a continuation of the cat-and-mouse game Apple is constantly engaged in with hackers, but the unusually prominent nature of this hacking \u2014 and the fact that the hacker was the United States government \u2014 creates a predicament for the company.\n\u201cApple is a business, and it has to earn the trust of its customers,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of the tech security companySynackand a former National Security Agency analyst. \u201cIt needs to be perceived as having something that can fix this vulnerability as soon as possible.\u201d\nApple referred to a statement it made on Monday when the government filed to drop its case demanding that the company help it open Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone. \u201cWe will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated,\u201d Apple said.\nApple has been making many long-term moves to increase the security of its devices. The company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, hastold colleaguesthat he stands by Apple\u2019s road map to encrypt everything stored on its devices and services, as well as information stored in Apple\u2019s cloud service iCloud, which customers use to back up the data on their mobile devices. Apple engineers have also begundeveloping new security measuresthat would make it tougher for the government to open a locked iPhone.\nFor now, with the dearth of information about the flaw in Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone 5C, which runs Apple\u2019s iOS 9 operating system, security experts could only guess at how the government broke into the smartphone.\nForensics experts said the government might have attacked Apple\u2019s system using a widely discussed method to extract information from a protected area in the phone by removing a chip and fooling a mechanism that blocks password guessing, in order to find the user\u2019s password and unlock the data.\nThe authorities may have used a procedure that mirrors the phone\u2019s storage chip, called a NAND chip, and then copied it onto another chip. Often referred to as \u201cNAND-mirroring,\u201d this would allow the F.B.I. to replace the original NAND chip with one that has a copy of that content. If the F.B.I. tried 10 passcodes to unlock the phone and failed, it could then generate a new copy of the phone\u2019s content and try another password guess.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to play the same level on Super Mario Brothers over and over again and just restoring from your saved game every time you kill Mario,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert.\nNewer iPhone models may be less susceptible to NAND-mirroring because they have an upgraded chip known as the A7, with a security processor called the Secure Enclave that has a unique numerical key not known to the company and which is essential to the securing of information stored in the phone.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in Apple products have become increasingly prized by hackers in recent years, given the ubiquity of the company\u2019s mobile devices. Yet as interest has grown in attacking Apple\u2019s hardware and software, the company\u2019s own security teams have been in flux.\nApple previously had two main security teams \u2014 a group called Core OS Security Engineering and a product security team. The product security team included a privacy group that examined whether data was properly encrypted and anonymized, among other functions, according to three former Apple employees. The product security team also had people who reacted to vulnerabilities found by people outside Apple, as well as a proactive team, called RedTeam, which worked to actively hack Apple products.\nLast year, the product security team was broken up and the privacy group began reporting to a new manager, the former employees said. The rest of product security \u2014 the proactive and reactive pieces \u2014 was absorbed by the Core OS Security Engineering team, which itself experienced shifts.\nThe leader of the Core OS Security Engineering team, Dallas DeAtley, left the security division last year to work in a different part of Apple. Mr. DeAtley was one of the few employees who over the years had taken care of government requests to extract data from iPhones. Mr. DeAtley did not respond to requests for comment.\nA few other members of the team also departed. Others joined Apple as the company acquired a handful of security outfits last year, includingLegbaCore, which previously found and fixed flaws for Apple.\nSome of the departures had more to do with market forces, the former Apple employees said. Security professionals are some of the most sought-after engineers in the technology sector.\nWhether Apple\u2019s security operation will ever obtain information about how the government hacked into Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone remains unclear.\nIt\u2019s possible that the government won\u2019t say how it opened the iPhone because the method is \u201cproprietary to the company that helped the F.B.I.,\u201d said Stewart A. Baker, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s first assistant secretary for policy.\nWithin the security community, researchers and professionals said they were incensed that they \u2014 and Apple \u2014 may not find out how the F.B.I. was able to crack Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone.\n\u201cThere is very little debate that it is in everyone\u2019s best interest that Apple find out about this vulnerability and everyone should be asking why that is not the case,\u201d said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer atHackerOne, a security company in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for corporations."

But the variety of legal arguments was interesting nonetheless.\nAs Nick Wingfield reported, Apple\u2019s supporters challenged \u201cevery legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\u201d\nThe government will not take these arguments lightly.

        "title": "U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Justice Department said on Monday that it had found a way to unlock an iPhone without help from Apple, allowing the agency to withdraw its legal effort to compel the tech company to assist in a mass-shooting investigation.\nThe decision to drop the case \u2014 which involved demanding Apple\u2019s help to open an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in theDecembershooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people \u2014ends a legal standoffbetween the government and the world\u2019s most valuable public company. The case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the authorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important.\nYet law enforcement\u2019s ability to now unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method.\n\u201cFrom a legal standpoint, what happened in the San Bernardino case doesn\u2019t mean the fight is over,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, a staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. She notes that the government generally goes through a process whereby it decides whether to disclose information about certain vulnerabilities so that manufacturers can patch them.\n\u201cI would hope they would give that information to Apple so that it can patch any weaknesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if the government classifies the tool, that suggests it may not.\u201d\nIn atwo-paragraph filing on Monday, the Justice Department said it had \u201cnow successfully accessed the data stored on Farook\u2019s iPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance from Apple.\u201d\nF.B.I. investigators have begun examining the contents of the phone but would not say what, if anything, they have identified so far. A senior federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was possible that law enforcement might not find anything useful on the phone.\nThe Justice Department also remained tight-lipped about how it was able to finally get into the smartphone after weeks of furious public debate.\nA second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apple\u2019s iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.\nMelanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, signaled in a statement that the broader battle over access to digital data from devices was not over.\n\u201cIt remains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can obtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public safety, either with cooperation from relevant parties, or through the court system when cooperation fails,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cWe will continue to pursue all available options for this mission, including seeking the cooperation of manufacturers and relying upon the creativity of both the public and private sectors.\u201d\n\u201cThis case should never have been brought,\u201d Apple said in a statement, adding that it would continue to help with law enforcement investigations.\nGiven that the F.B.I. may never tell Apple how it forced open the iPhone, the company also said that it would \u201ccontinue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated.\u201d\nThe conflict between Apple and the government erupted openly last month when a federal magistrate judge in California ordered the Silicon Valley company to help unlock the smartphone used by Mr. Farook. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,opposed the court order in a public letter, saying that \u201ccompromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk.\u201d\nThe resistance led to heated rhetoric from both sides in dueling court filings, and the issue spurred debates \u2014 finding its way onto late night talk shows, and dividing the public. Apple and the Justice Department had been due in court last week in Riverside, Calif., and the case was seemingly headed toward appeals and even the Supreme Court.\nThen last Monday, the Justice Department said it had beenapproached by a third partywith a potential alternative method for opening the iPhone.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s cracking of the iPhone has implications for other cases that involve locked iPhones. Last month, a federal magistrate judge in the Eastern District of New Yorkrefused to grant an order, requested by the government, that asked Apple to extract data from an iPhone used by a drug dealer in Brooklyn. The Justice Department is in the process of appealing that decision.\nThe federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters on Monday said it was premature to say whether the method it used to open the phone in the San Bernardino case could be used on phones in other cases. The phone in the Brooklyn case was an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 mobile software.\n\u201cCourts should be skeptical going forward when the government claims it has no other option besides compelling a device maker\u2019s assistance,\u201d said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.\n\u201cNow that the F.B.I. has accessed this iPhone, it should disclose the method for doing so to Apple,\u201d she added. \u201cApple ought to have the chance to fix that security issue, which likely affects many other iPhones.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Like in no other industry, technology companies depend on their claim to the future. They have world-changing products like smartphones, social networks and Internet search, and exuberant bosses who pretend they know where all this is going.\nThat makes it particularly awkward when big tech companies do not exactly seem in charge of their own futures. That is now happening to both Apple and Yahoo, in two very different ways.\nApple is, of course, in a courtroom fight with the Justice Department over whether it should help the fed authorities unlock an iPhone that belonged to a terrorist. It has alreadytraded legal barbswith the government over its rights and obligations about privacy and security.\nAs Katie Bennerwrites,Apple was scheduled on Tuesday to make its case at a hearing in Riverside, Calif., in front of a particularly steely and unflappable judge. On Monday, however, the Justice Departmentwas granted a request to postpone the hearing, saying it might have found another way to get into the phone.\nEveryone involved thinks that if this case should continue, it could ultimately go before the Supreme Court, as we try to establish law in a new world of instant communications and powerful computing, but first decisions matter. Later courts, along with the lawyers on both sides, will study the way Judge Sheri Pym thinks about the arguments over corporate and federal rights.\nShould Apple lose, it could affect not just its products, but the kind of talent it employs \u2014 some engineerscould leave, rather than choose to weaken Apple\u2019s encryption. Even with all that uncertainty about the future, though, Apple is likely to remain one of the world\u2019s premier technology companies.\nYahoo could wish for such control over its fortunes, or such a near-certain profit outlook. The darling of the Internet\u2019s first generation has for years struggled to define its identity and turn that into returns. Hopes were high when Marissa Mayer came in from Google in 2012, but the stock is off 30 percent from its 2014 highs.\nMs. Mayer is exploring a sale of Yahoo, quite possibly along with selling off $1 billion and $3 billion in assets. Now, as Michael de la Merced and Vindu Goelwrite, it is also contending with an activist hedge fund, which may seek to change Yahoo\u2019s board of directors.\nThat would complicate any sale. Adding to the confusion, Ms. Mayer may also have to negotiate with SoftBank, a large Japanese tech company, about the status of Yahoo Japan, a profitable concern in which they both have shares.\nGreat tech companies may start in garages, but that is hardly where they end up."

        "title": "The iPhone Stays Locked, for Now",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department has argued that Apple has a legal responsibility to help the government unlock iPhones that may contain evidence needed in criminal investigations. A federal judge in Brooklyn argues, persuasively, that the company is not obligated to do so.\nIn an order on Monday, Magistrate Judge James Orensteinrejected an effortby the Justice Department to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone used by a Queens resident who has pleaded guilty to drug charges. The case raises some of the same issues before a federal court in California where the government wants Apple to remove an impediment to unlocking an iPhone that was used by one of the attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Apple ischallenging a decisionby the judge that it do so; a hearing is scheduled for March 22.\nIn the New York case, Judge Orenstein rejected the government\u2019s argument that theAll Writs Act of 1789can be used to compel people and businesses like Apple that are not involved in a crime to help the government unearth evidence in situations like this. The act can be used, the judge said, only when doing so is \u201cagreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d But Congress has considered and refused to adopt proposals that would require companies like Apple to help the government get access to data stored on phones and other devices.\nThe judge argued that if Congress wanted companies like Apple to help the Justice Department, it would have required them to do so through laws like theCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Actof 1994, which requires phone companies to allow the government to use their networks to conduct surveillance. But that law does not apply to companies that provide \u201cinformation services,\u201d a broad category that appears to cover most Internet businesses and hardware manufacturers.\nJudge Orenstein said that even if the All Writs Act could be interpreted in the way the Justice Department says it should be, he would have to reject the government\u2019s request for three other reasons: Apple has no involvement in the crime in question and does not own the phone that officials want unlocked. The government\u2019s request would place an undue burden on Apple by requiring it to undo the security features of its products, which would divert company resources and could, in Apple\u2019s words, \u201ctarnish the Apple brand.\u201d And the government has made contradictory statements about whether it could get access to the data on the iPhone without Apple\u2019s help.\nJudge Orenstein\u2019s decision will obviously not be the last word on this issue. The Justice Department says it will appeal the ruling. The department is seeking Apple\u2019s help in unlocking a dozen other iPhones around the country. And local prosecutors are seeking the company\u2019s help in unlocking phones in many more cases. What Judge Orenstein has said is that it is the responsibility of the courts and Congress to put sensible limits on how law enforcement collects evidence."

        "fulltext": "Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and a parade of other technology companies fileda barrage of court briefson Thursday, aiming to puncture the United States government\u2019slegal argumentsagainst Apple in a case that will test the limits of the authorities\u2019 access to personal data.\nThe extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.\nIn all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government\u2019s case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\n\u201cThese companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.\nEdward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring \u201cSupreme Court-level advocacy\u201d and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.\n\u201cThis is a show of force,\u201d said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. \u201cThis is a battle for public opinion.\u201d\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was \u201chumbled by the outpouring of support.\u201d\nThe case between Apple and the government became public last month, when a federal magistrate judge in California ordered the company to bypass the security functions on the iPhone. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,opposed the order,arguing the case could have far-reaching implications for other devices and software, with governments everywhere able to demand more access to tech companies\u2019 data.\nSeveral tech companies wereinitially careful and subdued in their support of Apple, with some privately debating whether the San Bernardino attack was the right case for challenging the government. Last week, some tech companies including Microsoft began toback Applemore forcefully, saying they planned to file briefs supporting it in court.\nA group of Internet companies submitted this court brief supporting Apple in the case in which the government is seeking Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.\nIn the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public\u2019s outrage over the \u201cheinous act of terrorism\u201d in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government\u2019s case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans\u2019 security.\nA collectionof 17 Internet companies, including Twitter, Airbnb and LinkedIn, filed a separate brief objecting to the government\u2019s use of the All Writs Act, a statute from 1789 that underlies many law enforcement requests for tech companies\u2019 data, in the San Bernardino case.AT&Tand Intel also submitted independent briefs backing Apple.\nIn the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government \u201cseeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users\u2019 data.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. \u201cThere is a global impact for these tech companies if we don\u2019t land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.\u201d\nApart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nSome echoed Apple\u2019s slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court\u2019s order could be \u201cbe applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.\u201d\nThe support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.\n\u201cBroader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,\u201d the families wrote in a brief. \u201cThis case certainly presents the conditions \u2014 a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest \u2014 where requiring Apple\u2019s technical assistance is at its apex.\u201d\nStephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand \u201cover a phone that didn\u2019t even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.\u201d The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.\n\u201cSo many of Apple\u2019s arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cThat is scaremongering and that is false.\u201d\nA handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government\u2019s position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.\nThose groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple\u2019s refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible.\n\u201cIf Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,\u201d the trade groups wrote.\nNot all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman. Mr. Kondoker said Apple\u2019s fight was about something bigger than one phone.\n\u201cThey are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI share their fear.\u201d"
