        "title": "Yes to Tech Optimism. And Pessimism.",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nI recently made a promise to myself, and I would like you to join me. When I consider something new bubbling up in technology, I have vowed not to get overly excited about either its potential benefits or its downsides.\nI know nuance is rare these days, but please join me in the vast zone of complexity between \u201cwow, cool!\u201d and \u201cthat won\u2019t work\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s evil!\u201d I want to live in those shades of gray.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this gray zone because of two things: a tweet and Elon Musk.\nSriram Krishnan, a technology executive whom I respect,tweeted a few daysago asking for more optimistic descriptions in movies and television of people building technology. He didn\u2019t put it quite this way, but I imagined he wanted less fiction like \u201cThe Circle,\u201d about a surveillance-state corporate cult, and more like \u201cIron Man,\u201d in which a tech nerd cobbles together a suit that saves his life and gives him superhero powers.\nI get what Krishnan is saying, and there\u2019s a bigger meaning behind it. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of pessimism about theharm of social media, the creepiness of digital surveillance ofour smartphonesandour facesand thenefarious power of tech giants.\nThose downers sometimes drown out the ways that we know technology has made many ofour lives immeasurably better. Both \u201cThe Circle\u201d and \u201cIron Man\u201d encompass some form of reality, but it\u2019s easy to see technology as either one or the other.\nYou could see that in reactions to Musk\u2019s flashy demonstration on Friday ofbrain-implanted computer chipsthat he hopes may someday help combat serious health conditions like strokes and spinal cord injuries.\nMusk is a master showman, and every time he does an act about anunderground car tunnel in Los Angelesorbulletproof electric pickup trucks, there is the same reaction: Some people say he is making amazing and life-changing innovations. And other people say that Musk\u2019s promises areunproven and unoriginal hype.\nI can\u2019t predict what happens with Musk\u2019s Neuralink company. Musk has repeatedly promised technology that doesn\u2019t pan out or thatseems pointless. His companies have also helped advance electric cars,enabled commercial space traveland forced the entire auto industry to rethink what cars combined with computers can do. Sometimes the doubters are right about Musk. But so are the cheerleaders.\nThat\u2019s why I want both \u201cThe Circle\u201d and \u201cIron Man.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to get the balance right, but it\u2019s worth starting by acknowledging that both sunny and grumpy people have a point.\nWe need tech optimists to shoot for the moon \u2014 literally, in Musk\u2019s case. But I sometimes think tech companies also need to give more voice to chief pessimism officers who ask, what if this technology doesn\u2019t work? Who might be harmed by this technology, and how can we prevent that? And do we need this at all? Give those Eeyores a corner office.\nThe tech downers and the \u201cIron Man\u201d-loving optimists need each other more than ever. Technology is not something that exists in a bubble; it is a phenomenon that changes how we live or how our world works in ways that help and hurt.\nThat calls for more humility and bridges across the optimism-pessimism divide from people who make technology, those of us who write about it, government officials and the public. We need to think on the bright side. And we need to consider the horribles.\nI wrotein Monday\u2019s newsletterabout some app makers\u2019 complaints that Apple has too much control over what iPhone apps people can download and charges unfairly high fees on some app purchases.\nSome readers emailed to say that they sided with Apple exerting its power to keep the App Store safe, and that app makers get a good deal for the commissions Apple charges them. Here is selection of what they said:\n\u201cI really like that Appleclosely scrutinizes apps before allowing them on the App Store. I had an Android previously and felt like it was more of the Wild West in terms of what apps might actually do or if they were in fact harmful. I therefore didn\u2019t download many at all. I hope that things that matter to us users aren\u2019t overlooked in how this squabble gets resolved.\u201d\u2014 Vicki Rundquist, McHenry, Ill.\n\u201cWhat you specifically do not talk about is the convenience Apple gives it developers for placing an app within their environment. Apple does a whole lot of work to make it easy to use the App Store. I want Apple to control what is offered to us within its App Store. They want Apple to do a whole lot of work and then not even get paid for it.\u201d \u2014Gordon Musch, Richmond, Va.\n\u201cI think Apple could resolve thedispute with Epicand avoid a possible finding that they are a monopoly by allowing users to sideload apps, but only after the users have received a series of scary warnings about how they are giving up the protection Apple gives them from malware. If the warnings are scary enough, I think most people would rather download from the App Store, even if they could sideload apps for less money.\u201d\u2014 Blaine\n(Note from Shira: \u201cSideloading\u201d refers todownloading apps outside the official Android or Apple smartphone app stores. Apple doesn\u2019t permit people to sideload apps. Android phones do, but Epicsaid that Google made it unfairly difficult.)\nPay attention to Australia\u2019s proposed law on online news:Facebook (and Google) are suggesting that they might make it harder for people to share news stories online in response to a proposed Australian bill that would require the companies to pay news organizations for articles that appear on their sites. This is essentially a negotiation in public over the details of the proposed law.\nMy colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Mike Isaac write that the Australia example shows howgovernment measures to restrain tech companies threaten to further erode the principle of a single unified internet.\nThe perfect encapsulation of the gig job market:Delivery drivers for Amazon and its Whole Foods supermarket have figured out a way to get first in line for orders. Some of them are perching smartphones from trees near grocery stores or delivery outposts,Bloomberg News found, because the software that dispatches Amazon delivery couriers doles out jobs to people who seem to be closest.\nA pioneer of online learning is worried about online learning:Salman Khan, the creator of Khan Academy online learning videos,has tips for parents and schools doing remote learning: Opt for shorter online learning sessions for younger kids with more breaks, and have open conversations with schools about whether students are being asked to do too much.\nKhan also tells The Washington Post that he\u2019s worried about children who are being left behind by remote school, and parents who are taking on too much.\nYou might need a dose of good news as much as I do.

        "title": "What\u2019s the Deal With Google Now?",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nWhy are government lawyers inWashington,Texasand beyond thinking about suingGooglefor being an illegal monopoly? Let me try to untangle what will be a confusing \u2014 butpotentially important\u2014 legal moment.\nWhat\u2019s the government suing over exactly?Uhhh \u2026 we\u2019ll see.Googleis so sprawling that the focus of possibly multiple antitrust lawsuits from the federal government and one or more groups of states is up in the air.\nWhat COULD be the problem?One longstanding issue isGoogle\u2019sevolution from a website that pointed people to the best links online to one that\u2019s swallowing the web.\nAn example: Until a few years ago, if you had searched for a hotel in Niagara Falls, a local burger restaurant or Tom Cruise\u2019s height, Google probably showed you links to Expedia, Yelp or a People magazine article.\nNow, Google is more likely toprominently show information or advertisements from its own computer systemsor scraped from other companies\u2019 websites \u2014 and keep you within Google\u2019s digital walls. Google isn\u2019t a front door to the internet anymore. It\u2019s the house.\nThis might be useful for people, maybe. But the government wants to know if Googleputs its thumb on the scale to privilege its own services, and therefore unfairly hurts other businesses and gives us worse information than we\u2019d have otherwise. (Google has said that it\u2019s trying to show people the most relevant information.)\nWhat else?Another issue is Google planting its familiar search box everywhere. It\u2019s the built-in search function oniPhones\u2014 a prime spot for whichGoogle pays Apple billions of dollars each year. And in many cases, Google has deals to ensure that its search boxhas a pole position on Android smartphones. Same question here: Do Google\u2019s actions unfairly hold back competition?\nDidn\u2019t you tell me about a different complaint about Google?I did!The government has also dug into the fairness of Google\u2019s less well-known (and boring) role as a middleman in the computerized buying and selling of internet ads. That\u2019s still of interest, maybe to the federal government and definitely to one or more states.\nWhat could happen next?The most honest answer: Dunno. It depends on the specifics of possible lawsuits. The government could narrow its scope to those search contracts, and try to require that people have a choice of a search engine when they get a new phone. (That wouldn\u2019t make a dent in Google.)\nMaybe the government wants Google to open its search results by, for example, showing listings from TripAdvisor, not Google, when you hunt for Niagara Falls hotels.\nGoogle\u2019s worst-case scenario: that the government orders the company to break into pieces.\nNormal life is over for Google.Any antitrust case or potentialnew laws taking on Google\u2019s powerwould probably take years. But even if no U.S. court declares Google an abusive monopoly, the cloud of antitrust will follow it. Google has been dealing with this for years.\nEvery time a competitor believes Google is unfairly squashing its business, there are howls. If Google wants to buy another company, it isn\u2019t smooth sailing. The unexamined life is over for Google.\nApple has an iron gripon what apps people can download on their iPhones, and some developers arecomplaining loudlyabout this arrangement as well as thefees that Apple collectsfrom some apps.\nThe makers of apps like Spotify, Fortnite and Tinder are nowsuggesting (squishy and broad) changes to how app stores workto make them more fair, my colleague Erin Griffith wrote. I\u2019ve plucked out a few oftheir pointsthat I think are worth considering:\nGive people a payment choice:Any iPhone app lets people pay for digital stuff only with their Apple account, and Apple then takes a fee from that transaction.\nThis coalition seems to be asking that Apple allow app makers to include two payment options: one that lets me sign up for or pay with my Apple account, which would obligate the app maker to pay a commission to Apple; and a second that would let me use my credit card to buy stuff directly from the app maker.\nThis is how many Android apps work, and it\u2019s sensible and fair.\nOr at least let apps tell people where to buy outside the app:On the Kindle iPhone app, peoplecan\u2019t buy an e-bookbecause Amazon doesn\u2019t want to give Apple a cut of its sales. But Apple won\u2019t let Amazon tell people in the app where to buy the e-book.The result is confusion. A web link in the app would be helpful.\nYes, Apple would lose money if it did this. Ditto for the payment choice. Apple says that it deserves to be paid for running the app store andmaking sure it\u2019s safe. But Apple brings in $28 million in revenue per hour. It will live.\nCreate a buffer between Apple and competing apps: Applepromotes its own iPhone apps, which don\u2019t have to pay the commissions that rival apps do \u2014 making it not a completely fair fight.\nSpotify, for example, competes with an Apple music service that can fling free trial offers and other pitches to every iPhone owner, and doesn\u2019t fork over up to 30 cents out of each dollar in commissions as Spotify must.\nOne app maker I spoke to suggested some kind ofindependent oversight boardthat would effectively remove Apple from app approvals or other decisions involving apps that compete with its own.\nBless those silly, blocky digital bricks:Emily Flake wrote for The New York Times\u2019s Parenting newsletter about her nearly 8-year-old daughterdeepening connections with friends through the Lego-like Roblox virtual gameat a time when the pandemic kept them from being together in real life.\nAn important Facebook monitoring tool may be flawed:Facebook suggested that U.S. state election officials use a data tool it owns called CrowdTangle to spot and report election-related misinformation that\u2019s going viral in their locales. But Bloomberg Newswrotethat a tech watchdog said CrowdTangle doesn\u2019t accurately track information that is gaining ground in some Facebook spots, including most individual accounts and private groups, which are a hub for problems like conspiracies and bullying.\nI don\u2019t understand the internet:So these 27-year-old twins got popular on TikTok because people thought they were clueless for botching the name of Leonardo da Vinci. It turned outthat\u2019s what they wanted you to think, BuzzFeed News reported. Internet culture is acomplicated set of in-jokes, and I am confused.\nThis is a very elaborate investigation intopeople cheating in a fishing contest. It involved lab tests of strontium isotopes in a part of a fish\u2019s ear. (Apparently fish have ears?)\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "Apple and Google to Make It Easier to Opt In to Virus Tracing",
        "fulltext": "Several state governments may soon send residents an alert asking them to turn on \u201cexposure notifications.\u201d\nOn Tuesday,Apple and Googlesaid they would make it easier for states to use their new technology that detects phones that come close to one another and can notify people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus.\nStates that sign on will be able to send a notice directly to smartphones asking people to opt in to the technology. Previous versions of the technology had required people to seek out a state health agency\u2019s app.\nThe new approach could spur the popularity of such virus alert technology in the United States by significantly lowering the hurdles for its use. Maryland, Virginia, Nevada and Washington, D.C., already plan to use the new system, Apple and Google said, and about 25 other states were exploring using the earlier app version.\nIn a statement, Apple and Google called the changes a \u201cnext step in our work with public health authorities.\u201d They said the shifts would help \u201cpublic health authorities to supplement their existingcontact tracingoperations with technology without compromising on the project\u2019s core tenets of user privacy and security.\u201d\nIn April, Apple and Google announced they were developingthe technology, which uses Bluetooth signals to enable iPhones and Android devices to detect nearby phones. If someone using the technology tests positive for the virus, that person can enter the positive result into the system using a unique authentication code. An automatic notification would then go to other phones that had opted in and had been in close contact.\nAs the pandemic took hold this spring, countries around the world raced to deploy virus apps to help track and quarantine people. But some of the apps weremandatory and invasive, sending users\u2019 locations and health details to their governments. Many apps were alsorife with security flaws.\nThe Apple-Google technology, by contrast, does not collect personal health details or track users\u2019 locations. That has made the system attractive in Europe and elsewhere. Germany, Denmark and Ireland have already released apps using the technology, and millions of people in Europe have downloaded them.\nIn the United States, public health agencies in Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, Alabama, North Dakota and Wyoming have also created such apps, although the uptake has been slower. The Alabama app, released in mid-August, has had about 44,000 downloads.\nTo make the virus alert apps from different U.S. states interoperable, the Association of Public Health Laboratories announced in July that it would host a national server for the data. That means users of Alabama\u2019s app may someday be able to detect nearby phones when they travel to Virginia and vice versa.\nNow, to use Apple and Google\u2019s technology, state public-health authorities simply need to provide certain parameters to the companies, such as how close people need to be to trigger an exposure notification and recommendations for those with possible exposures. Google would then create an app for the state, while Apple would enable the technology on the iPhone software. The system would then use approximate location data to send an alert to residents\u2019 phones in that state, asking if they would like to enroll. (On iPhones, enrolling requires tapping a button, while Android users are prompted to download the state\u2019s app.)\nApple and Google have said they designed their technology to protect people\u2019s privacy. The system does not share people\u2019s identities with Apple, Google or other users, the companies said, and it does not share location data with health authorities or the companies.\nGoogle initially requiredAndroid users of the virus alert apps to turn on location services, which could have allowed Google to collect their location data. After health officials in Europe complained, Google said it would stop requiring location services to be on to enable the apps.\nStill, security researchers have warned that the technology could also be misused to send false alerts, spreading unnecessary alarm. While they acknowledged the companies\u2019 desire to help stem the pandemic, a few said they were troubled by Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s power to set global standards for public health agencies.\nAshkan Soltani, an independent security researcher, also warned that the companies could at some point turn on virus notifications by default. \u201cI continue to worry about rapidly deploying a new technology to nearly everyone\u2019s device,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially when the decision to do so isn\u2019t done by policymakers but unilaterally by these platforms.\u201d"

        "title": "Google Demands 30% Cut From App Developers in Its Play Store",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Google said it would no longer allow any apps to circumvent its payment system within the Google Play store that provides the company a cut of in-app purchases.\nGoogle said ina blog poston Monday that it was providing \u201cclarity\u201d on billing policies because there was confusion among some developers about what types of transactions require use of its app store\u2019s billing system.\nGoogle has had a policy of taking a 30 percent cut of payments made within apps offered by the Google Play store, but some developers including Netflix and Spotify have bypassed the requirement by prompting users for a credit card to pay them directly. Google said companies had until Sept. 30, 2021, to integrate its billing systems.\nThe way the Google and Apple app stores collect fees has become an especially contentious issue in recent months after Epic Games, maker of the popular gameFortnite,sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules with the commissions they charge.\nOn Monday, a federal judge in California\u2019s Northern District Court in Oakland heard testimony from Epic Games and Apple to determine whether Apple can continue to ban Fortnite, Epic\u2019s popular game, from its app store. The hearing, in which each side debated the size of the app distribution market and Apple\u2019s power over it, offered a preview of the antitrust case before it goes to trial sometime next year.\nIn its lawsuit against Google, Epic Games said it tried to offer users the option of using its own billing system, which costs less than Google\u2019s version. Epic said Google rejected the app twice. When the game maker went ahead and did it anyway, Google removed Fortnite from its app store.\nAn Epic Games spokeswoman declined to comment on Google\u2019s announcement. Netflix and Spotify did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nDevelopers have bristled at the 30 percent cut demanded by Google and Apple, saying it is an inflated digital tax that hobbles their ability to compete. And because the two companies control almost all of the world\u2019s smartphones, many developers gripe that they have no option but to adhere to their policies and pay the commissions.\nLast week, a group of app developers said they had formed the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness to push for changes in the app stores and \u201cprotect the app economy.\u201d The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and Hinge.\nSarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for App Fairness, said in a statement that the group looked forward to \u201cengaging with Google\u201d to ensure that any changes fit with its principles and are \u201cin the best interest of app developers.\u201d\nGoogle said the enforcement of its billing policies would apply to a small fraction of its app developers. It said only 3 percent of app developers on Google Play offered in-app purchases and, within that group, only 3 percent were not using Google\u2019s billing system.\nGoogle is preparing for further scrutiny. The Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general are expected to bring antitrust lawsuits against the company for how it wields its dominance in web search and digital advertising technologies. Its app store policies are not expected to be covered in these suits.\nGoogle has argued that it allows other companies to operate app stores within its Android software. On Monday, the company said it would make changes in next year\u2019s version of Android to make it easier to use other app stores on its devices without compromising safety.\nIn the post, Google used Epic as an example of an app developer benefiting from Android\u2019s third-party app stores \u2014 noting the availability of Fortnite on Epic and Samsung\u2019s app stores. But Epic, in its complaint, said Google held a monopoly over app distribution, because more than 90 percent of app downloads on Android devices come through the Google Play Store.\nErin Griffith contributed reporting from San Francisco."

        "title": "What Apple\u2019s Fortnite Fee Battle Is Really About",
        "fulltext": "Like most app developers, John Botte wants his work to end up on some of the 1.5 billion active iPhones on the market. But when the software engineer did the math on a photo-sharing app he hoped to create for wedding-goers, he decided against it.\nThe impediment, said Mr. Botte, co-founder of the marketing agency Digital Natives Group, was Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission in its App Store. He said the commission would be the largest contributor to taking in barely $1 in revenue from a planned $10 monthly subscription fee. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see how we\u2019d make any money,\u201d Mr. Botte said.\nThose fees, which affect the minority of apps that charge for subscriptions or virtual goods, are at the center of a federalcourt hearingMonday that could set the stage for a protracted fight over how app stores run by both Apple and Google operate.\nMr. Botte\u2019s experience mirrors that of a number of developers I\u2019ve spoken with over the years. Smaller developers who cannot absorb losses during their first year or two on the market often shy away from Apple\u2019s digital storefront, dissuaded by its shifting rules, fixed fees and capricious approval processes. (Many refused to identify themselves publicly for fear of reprisal by Apple for any future apps or business.)\nI believe Apple when it says it wants to allow more apps in its store. But if developers aren\u2019t even applying because of the lousy economics, then the company is doing a disservice to both developers and customers.\nThe question of whether Apple wields too much power over its digital bazaar has come to a head in recent weeks after Epic Games, maker of the enormously popular role play fighting gameFortnite,sued Apple and Googleover their fees. Epic took up the battle after Apple and Google removedFortnitefrom their stores when the company encouraged users to pay for the game directly rather than through app stores where they would be subject to the levies.\nAt the hearing Monday, a judge will consider whether to compel Apple to allow Fortnite back into the App Store.\nThe Supreme Court last yearallowed to proceeda consumer-driven class-action lawsuit charging that Apple violates antitrust laws with its App Store commissions, thus inflating app prices. European officials have openedan antitrust investigationinto Apple over its App Store operations. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, along with other tech titans, washauled before Congressover the summer to talk primarily about the App Store as part of a panel on antitrust.\nApple says the fees and use of its proprietary payments system are necessary, not just to make a profit but also to pay for safeguards in the App Store that prevent bad actors from entering and compromising user security. The company has also noted that its 30 percent fee is equal to Google\u2019s and less than the fees companies were compelled to pay when software was sold in physical stores. (It said those fees wereat least 50 percent.)\nAnd the company notes that the commission gets developers access to Apple\u2019s customers. Though, of course, if no developers offered apps in the store, customers would likely eschew Apple\u2019s iPhones.\nApple has shown a willingness to adapt its fees, dropping the commission to 15 percent after a full year of subscriptions. But that raises the question of how Apple can justify the higher fee if 15 percent is enough to pay for all the things Apple says it supplies app developers.\nApple does not disclose how much it collects annually in fees from the App Store, but estimates range from$15 billionto$19 billion\u2014 it is clearly huge and hugely profitable.\nA former App Store executive told The Times last month that, \u201cwe\u2019re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,\u201d and that the commission should be closer to 3 percent.\nBy comparison, Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive, told Times Opinion that it costs the company between 5 percent and 7 percent of sales to operate its games stores, and they collect 12 percent from developers.\nI don\u2019t know what the right commission should be \u2014 Apple hadonce consideredan even higher rate of 40 percent \u2014 but as Apple has designed it, it will never face competitive pressure to change. That\u2019s where the real problem lies.\nApple could increase its commission tomorrow and there would be no competitor to jump in and offer a lower price. The free market should decide the fee. Apple notes thata small minorityof apps, 16 percent, pay the commission, but might that be higher if the fee was considered more reasonable?\nApple\u2019s central argument that it faces competitive pressure from Android loses much of its weight when you consider the cost and hassle of switching mobile operating systems \u2014 photos, passwords, text messages and video game high scores can all be lost with a new device. Consumers switching to Google will find an operating system that has mirrored Apple\u2019s fees and is facingantitrust allegationsof its own, though at least on Android other app stores are allowed to compete, and there are alternative means to downloading an app onto a device.\nBefore the congressional antitrust panel,Mr. Cook, from Apple, arguedthat \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business.\u201d But it faces no competition on its own devices.\nIt\u2019s akin to Ford designing cars so that only Exxon nozzles fit its fuel tanks. You may want the lower prices offered at the Chevron station in town, but you\u2019d have to switch to Chevrolet to get them.\nAnd there are other seemingly arbitrary rules governing the App Store. Amazon, for instance, is allowed toavoid paying the feesby directing Kindle e-book buyers to its website, the kind of workaround that raises Apple\u2019s ire against other app makers. Apple doesn\u2019t mind because e-books are digital versions of physical goods, which don\u2019t trigger the fee, an Apple official confusingly explained to me. Uber and Lyft don\u2019t pay the commission either, even though arranging rides is an entirely digital act.\u201cThe App Store has gotten too big to ignore, it\u2019s too much an integral part of our society,\u201d said Adam Cooper, a software developer who said he begrudgingly offers a paid app version of his art gallery organizing website ArtCollection.io in the App Store. \u201cI don\u2019t like the costs, but there is a group of my customers who want the app; I don\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d That means his Apple customers are worth 30 percent less to him.\nEpic\u2019sMr. Sweeney, in an interview with Times Opinion, said his $17.3 billion company can certainly afford to keep paying Apple hundreds of millions of dollars per year from the sale of digital goods within Fortnite, but he views the fight as a matter of principle. \u201cApple makes more profit from most games than the developers themselves make,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that just sucks.\u201d\nHis challenge to Apple and Google has attracted the attention of Microsoft, which argued on Epic\u2019s behalf ina court filing, as well as acoalitionannounced Thursday that includes 12 companies siding with Epic, such as Spotify and Match Group, parent company of the dating apps Tinder and Hinge.\n\u201cMarkets function properly when developers and consumers can make free choices between each of the different components they want to use in running their lives,\u201d like smartphones, apps and how they pay for things, said Mr. Sweeney. \u201cEach component of the ecosystem should be able to compete with each other freely.\u201d\nIt would be better for Apple to compete on an even playing field with other app stores and payment systems and prove that its is truly the best. That way, Mr. Botte\u2019s app might be ready in time for the post-pandemic wedding rush.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "fulltext": "Want this delivered to your inbox each day?Sign up here.\nJPMorgan Chasesent some of its workers home this weekafter an employee in its trading unit in Midtown Manhattan tested positive for the coronavirus, a person familiar with the matter told DealBook.\nThe timing isn\u2019t great.The news broke days after President Trump brought attention to the investment bank\u2019s plan to bring some of its senior workers back to the office,inaccurately tweeting, \u201cCongratulations to JPMorgan Chase for ordering everyone BACK TO OFFICE on September 21st. Will always be better than working from home!\u201d (The bank had, in fact, only asked some senior employees in its sales and trading division to return.) Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet politicized a decision that JPMorgan, and other companies, would probably like to make without such fanfare.\nJamie Dimon\u2019s reported comments about young people working from home didn\u2019t help either.JPMorgan\u2019s C.E.O. told analysts with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a private meeting that working from home \u201cseems to have impacted younger employees, and overall productivity and \u2018creative combustion\u2019 has taken a hit,\u201d one of the analysts, Brian Kleinhanzl, wrote in a note,according to Bloomberg. A spokesman for JPMorgan later clarified that the bank had noticed a productivity drop in all employees, though younger workers \u201ccould be disadvantaged by missed learning opportunities.\u201d\nThe bigger story is how it highlights the calculations that companies are making as they bring people back to the office.The worries about productivity andweakening social tiesare real, and so are the risks (including legal liability) of virus outbreaks in offices. The case numbers in New York are down, which could make people more comfortable with coming in; the same can\u2019t be saidabout London, for example. How much pressure should companies put on employees to return to the office? How will sporadic outbreaks affect workers\u2019 attitudes toward coming in? When, if ever, will workers get used to the cycle of going to the office until a new case emerges and they are told to stay home? Is it better just to deal with the consequences of remote working until there is a vaccine?\n\u2022 A JPMorgan spokesman told The Times in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019ve been managing individual cases across the firm over the course of the last few months and following appropriate protocols when they occur.\u201d\n____________________________\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut, Lauren Hirsch in New York, Ephrat Livni in Washington, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London.\n____________________________\nJudy Shelton\u2019s Fed nomination appears to have stalled. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority whip, said that the contentious Trump nomineedid not have the votes to be confirmed, suggesting that fellow Republicans still had concerns.\nA House report condemned Boeing and the F.A.A. for the 737 Max crashes.Mismanagement at the aircraft manufacturer and a \u201csevere lack of federal oversight\u201d contributed to the two fatal crashes of the jet that killed a total of 346 people,according to Democratson the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\nByteDance will keep a majority stake in TikTok.The deal to bring Oracle in as TikTok\u2019s tech partner will seeTikTok spun outas a U.S.-headquartered company in which Oracle and other American investors will own a minority stake. The proposal remains under review by U.S. national security officials, with a decisionexpected within days.\nKodak\u2019s board claimed ignorance about the timing of stock option grants.An inquiry commissioned by the company concluded that Kodak\u2019s general counsel hadfailed to properly brief directorson the legal risks of giving options to Jim Continenza, its C.E.O., the day before it announced a $765 million federal grant to make drug ingredients, which sent its share price soaring.\nU.S. poverty hit a record low before the pandemic.The share of Americans living in povertyfell to 10.5 percentlast year, according to the Census Bureau, the lowest rate since estimates were first published in 1959. Still, 26 million Americans lacked health coverage, according to the survey that serves as a snapshot of the economy just before the pandemic recession hit.\nApple announced a number of new products, includinga $30-per-month subscription bundleof its new fitness program, Apple Fitness Plus, along with its cloud storage, music, TV, gaming and news services.\nThe rollout comes as Apple is under increased antitrust scrutiny.Bundling services alongside its popular hardware products sparked different reactions from rivals old and new.\n\u2022Spotifywarned of \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if regulators don\u2019t act: The music servicesaid in a statementthat, \u201cOnce again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services.\u201d Spotify is currently suing Apple in Europe for alleged anticompetitive practices, on similar grounds toEpic Games\u2019s lawsuitin the U.S.\n\u2022Pelotonwelcomed a new competitor: \u201cFriendly competition is in our DNA. Welcome to the world of digital fitness, @Apple,\u201dit tweeted.\nIs the new bundle a threat?Apple\u2019s control of its devices and operating system give it an enviable platform to host a range of services that compete with specialized rivals like Spotify, Netflix and others. Its pricing and actions as a gatekeeper will determine whether it attracts more attention from antitrust regulators (just ask Amazon). A test will come in its foray into digital fitness, a market flooded with streaming classes featuring providers, like Peloton, that have invested in years of relationships with top-tier instructors that are central to driving demand.\nOne final question:Where\u2019s Apple\u2019s rumoredTile competitor?\nSplitting the difference \u2014 also known as compromise \u2014 is often a wise negotiation tactic. In that spirit, the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus presenteda $1.5 trillion coronavirus relief packageyesterday. It was close to what the White House indicated it might be willing to spend on stimulus, not as much as the $3 trillion House Democrats are looking for and much more than the $300 billion bill most recently backed by Senate Republicans.\nThe bill went nowhere fast,swiftly dismissedby party leaders. DealBook asked the Democratic co-chair of the 50-member Problem Solvers Caucus, Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, about the point of this doomed attempt at compromise. \u201cIdeally, you wouldn\u2019t need us,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut clearly that\u2019s not where we are.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s mission is \u201cputting country first\u201d and \u201cactually trying to govern,\u201dMr. Gottheimer said. The goal was to show areas of agreement and get negotiators back on track. The caucus presented a road map it not-so-subtly called the \u201cMarch to Common Ground\u201d for the next six to 12 months, with \u201cboosters\u201d and \u201creducers\u201d adjusting the costs of a bill, tied to circumstances (like the discovery of a vaccine).\n\u201cWe represent the voices of 50 million Americans screaming out to Congress, \u2018Do your job!\u2019\u201dsaid Representative Tom Reed of New York, the Republican co-chair of the caucus. Undeterred by the rejection of his preferred plan, he said he was heartened by the news that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had told the chamber to stay in session until there was a deal, and by signs of a \u201cthawing in the gridlock\u201d from the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. \u201cStay tuned, you\u2019re going to see more of this,\u201d Mr. Reed predicted.\nAfter George Floyd was killed by police officers in Minneapolis in May, a deluge of executivesspoke out against racial injusticeandpledged to address systemic inequality. Now, the focus is shifting internally, as boardrooms confront their own lack of racial diversity. Advisers and investors are pushing directors to back up their rhetoric with action or face financial, regulatory and reputational consequences.\nRacial diversity has become one of the most pressing agenda items in boardrooms, DealBook hears. Underrepresented ethnic and racial groups make up 40 percent of the U.S. population, but just 12.5 percent of board directors at the 3,000 largest listed companies, up from 10 percent in 2015,The Times\u2019s Peter Eavis writes. Black directors account for 4 percent of all directors, versus 13 percent of the population.\n\u201cThis is the singular topic of governance discussions,\u201dDaniel Wolf, a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, told DealBook, adding, \u201cBoards are going to try and get ahead of it.\u201d Kirkland recently sent a 19-slide PowerPoint deck to clients that highlighted the importance of diversity and inclusion amid increasing shareholder and regulatory scrutiny.\n\u201cThis seems like a fundamentally different time than the other times Black men were murdered by the police,\u201d said Ursula Burns, a former Xerox C.E.O. who is a director at Exxon, Nestl\u00e9 and Uber. She is helping to lead theBoard Diversity Action Allianceto help companies add Black directors, an organization that has Dow, Mastercard and UPS among its supporters. A similar initiative, theBoard Challenge, counts Merck, United Airlines and Verizon among its members.\n\u2022 \u201cYou cannot look your stakeholders in the eye and say, \u2018It doesn\u2019t affect us, we are color blind, we don\u2019t need to make changes,\u2019 \u201d said Rebecca Thornton, the head of director advisory services at JPMorgan. More than 40 percent of the requests for board candidates she has received from clients this year asked for people of color, she noted.\nShareholders \u2014 and regulators \u2014 are watching.When major institutions put pressure on companies to add women to their boards a few years ago, it had ameasurable impact. Now, some of those forces are turning their focus toward racial diversity, hence the warnings about the price of inaction. The evidence ofstronger financial returnsat more diverse firms also helps.\nWho is doing what:\n\u2022Californiapassed a bill last monthrequiring publicly traded companies headquartered in the state to have board members from underrepresented communities.\n\u2022New York City\u2019s comptrollercalled for companies to adopt a version of the NFL\u2019s \u201cRooney Rule,\u201d requiring companies to consider gender and racial diversity in searches for C.E.O.s and directors.\n\u2022State Streetsaid it would start to ask companies to explain their risks, goals and strategy related to racial and ethnic diversity.\n\u2022ISS, the proxy adviser, said it would begin sending letters to listed companies asking for more details on the racial diversity of board members and executives.\nThe father of Microsoft\u2019s co-founderdied on Mondayat the age of 94. Though best known in his later years as the man who oversaw his son\u2019s enormous philanthropy, he was also a successful lawyer who played a major role in the life of another future billionaire, Howard Schultz of Starbucks.\nMr. Gates Sr. laid the foundation for his son\u2019s charitable giving,starting with an $80,000 check from what was then the William H. Gates Foundation to a cancer program in the Seattle area. Mr. Gates Sr. laid out his philosophy on philanthropy in his 2009 book, \u201cShowing Up for Life,\u201d this way:\nThose who claim that the wealth they have accumulated is theirs to pass on without returning anything back to the American system show a shocking lack of appreciation for all that the system and public monies did to help them create wealth.\nAs a lawyer, he helped Mr. Schultz take control of Starbucks.Mr. Gates Sr. co-founded what became the prominent Seattle law firm K&L Gates and was president of the Washington State Bar Association. One of his career achievements was helping Mr. Schultz beat out a competitor to buy Starbucks in 1987.\n\u2022Mr. Schultz recountedMr. Gates Sr. taking him to his rival bidder\u2019s office: \u201cAll I remember him saying is: \u2018You should be ashamed of yourself that you\u2019re going to steal this kid\u2019s dream. It\u2019s not going to happen. You and I both know this is not going to happen.\u2019 \u201d The investor quickly backed down and Mr. Schultz bought Starbucks for $3.8 million.\nDeals\n\u2022 The cloud software companySnowflakeraised $3.4 billion in its I.P.O., the biggest U.S. public offering so far this year.
