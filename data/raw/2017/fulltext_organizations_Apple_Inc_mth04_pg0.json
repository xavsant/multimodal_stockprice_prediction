        "title": "Apple\u2019s Stock Races Ahead as Investors Bet on New iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 percent from its 2015 peak. Apple\u2019s once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: The number of iPhones sold was down 13 percent, and the companyposted its first revenue decline in 13 years.\nToday, Apple\u2019s business remains sluggish, but that hasn\u2019t stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren E. Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant \u2014 the most valuable company in the United States by market value \u2014 have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $143.65, up nearly 60 percent from last May\u2019s trough.\nWhat\u2019s driving the stock, say skeptics and fans alike, is hope \u2014 hope that the new iPhones due in September, on the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone\u2019s introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers.\n\u201cEveryone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,\u201d said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs.\nInvestors will get more data about Apple\u2019s performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday, when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue.\nApple declined to comment ahead of its earnings report.\nMr. Landis sold most of Firsthand\u2019s Apple position near last year\u2019s bottom, but he said he had no regrets despite the stock\u2019s recent gains. He expects Apple to continue churning out incremental improvements rather than shake up the industry. The biggest change in last fall\u2019s iPhone 7, he noted, was theelimination of the headphone jack.\nApple is expected to make more exciting updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone\u2019s entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.\nApple executives, who are fond of using the word \u201crevolutionary\u201d to describe their products, have also acknowledged some missteps. After watching iPad unit sales spiral downward for 12 quarters in a row, the company introduced a cheaper model in March to win over schools that wereflocking to Chromebooks. Apple is also likely to update its Pro models for businesses this year.\nApple also admitted that the striking cylindrical design of the Mac Pro, a personal computer that is important to its most demanding customers, turned out to be a mistake that limited its upgrade potential. A completely redesigned Mac Pro will be released next year, Apple executives said in early April duringan unusual meeting with tech journaliststo discuss the computer\u2019s shortcomings.\n\u201cWe made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said at the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we\u2019re going to come out with something great to replace it.\u201d\nInvestors appear to be relieved that Apple sales have stabilized after last year\u2019s drop, said Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the websiteAbove Avalon. \u201cThere is at least increased confidence in what Apple can do in the future,\u201d he said.\nKevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year\u2019s lows, is one of those confident investors. \u201cApple is turning into the big Caddy that\u2019s going to cruise down the freeway, and there\u2019s a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that. And we\u2019re that kind of investor,\u201d he said.\nHeavy buying of Apple shares by Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month\u2019s trading volume in the shares, according to Mr. Cybart\u2019s calculations. Berkshire is now Apple\u2019s fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 percent of the company as of Feb. 27.\nIn recent years, as United States phone carriers have stopped subsidizing the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time that Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it first introduced models with larger screens.\nExpectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. \u201cPeople are excited about a feature-rich launch,\u201d said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Company.\nBut as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Mr. Arcuri said.\nHe said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone \u2014 a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re wringing their hands,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said of Apple.\nEven if Apple\u2019s new iPhones fail to deliver a large sales increase, investors are also hoping for changes in tax law that will benefit Apple. Last week, theTrump administration proposed a broad-based cut in the corporate tax rateand hinted at a possible tax break for profits held overseas that could prompt Apple to bring back tens of billions of dollars in foreign profits and distribute them to shareholders.\nPotential breakthroughs are also in the works.\nThe company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone.\nAnd two weeks ago, Apple received a permit from California regulators tobegin testing self-driving cars on public roads.\nTechnological leaps like those would win back skeptics like Mr. Landis. \u201cHistory says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI need them to surprise me.\u201d"

Cook.\nIn 2014, Uber tried to hide from Apple that technology connected to its app was violating Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.\nYou can offend taxi unions, reporters and local regulators, but anyone whose business depends on an app that runs on an iPhone knows you can\u2019t upset Apple. As Mike writes, when confronted, Uber backed down.\nRisk-taking and a great idea helped turn Uber into the most valuable start-up in world. But the best gamblers know when to fold a hand."

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities plan to question Apple about video streaming services available over its app store within the country, in their latest move to intensify pressure on the American technology giant over the content it provides in the vast and crucial market.\nA report on China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agencylate Wednesday said that the authorities would summon Apple to urge it to \u201ctighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.\u201d The report did not say when the summoning would take place.\nThe inquiry appears to focus on third-party apps available on the company\u2019s app store in China. The report said the authorities had told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, livestreaming services and online performance. Some broadcasters, it said, offered live content forbidden by Chinese law, including pornography.\nThe authorities had already met with Apple representatives about livestreaming apps available on its app store in China, Xinhua said, without disclosing details.\nAn Apple spokesman in China declined to comment.\nThe report comes as Chinese authorities put pressure on Apple over the apps and other content it offers its users in China, which in the fiscal quarter that ended Dec. 31 accounted for about one-fifth of its revenue.\nThe moves are part of a broader Chinese effort to regulate internet content. With services like Google, Facebook and Twitter long blocked in China, Apple is a rare foreign-owned company that provides a significant amount of apps and other content through platforms it controls.\nA year ago, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movieswere shut down in China, six months after they were started there. In December 2016, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, Apple alsoremoved news apps created by The New York Timesfrom its app store in China. Apple did not specify what prompted the request.\nMore recently, Chinese authorities have also ordered app stores in China to register with the government. Because Google\u2019s app store is among that company\u2019s services that are blocked in the country, a considerable number of locally owned third-party app stores have popped up to serve phones running Google\u2019s Android mobile-operating system. That has complicated China\u2019s efforts to control the country\u2019s fast-growing mobile internet business.\nThe Xinhua report on Wednesday said that Apple had been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies. They included the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top online regulator, as well as public security officials and a cultural law enforcement group.\nThe report said three Chinese websites \u2014 toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com \u2014 had violated regulations concerning internet information services. Some potential violations, it said, would be referred to the police."

        "fulltext": "Carrie Brownstein, the actress known for the series \u201cPortlandia,\u201d wrote and directed a shortfilmlast fall that pokes fun at the exaggerated comments people post under pictures of celebrities on social media, showing what would happen if reverential remarks like \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cmarry me\u201d played out in the real world.\nThe film, just under seven minutes long, was not about clothes but was funded by the fashion brand Kenzo, in the sort of arrangement between advertisers and artists that has becomecommon enoughto command its own industry award at the Tribeca Film Festival. Ms. Brownstein\u2019s film is among 10 finalists for theTribeca X Award, along with others paid for by Apple and BMW.\nThe competition looks to reward the best \u201cstorytelling\u201d from brands working with artists and filmmakers. It drew 600 entries in its second year, triple the number from last year, showcasing the growth in a subtle type of marketing that aims to reach people who are tuning out of traditional commercials.\nRather than deliver a product pitch, this genre is focused on \u201ctelling stories that make people feel warmly about the brand,\u201d said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises. Apple, for example, sponsored a 13-minutedocumentaryabout a mountain-climbing Bangladeshi woman that happened to be shot entirely on an iPhone 6s. Another finalist: aneight-minutefilm from the mobile payments company Square, telling the story of a Syrian refugee\u2019s dreams after his move to Tennessee; the man is a small-business owner and customer.\n\u201cThe makers of these films and tellers of these stories know if this feels like overt advertising or gross product placement, people will tune out, so authenticity becomes a key metric here,\u201d Mr. Essex said. \u201cTraditional advertising tends to annoy people, and this makes the argument that you have to add value to people\u2019s lives rather than bombard them with a pitch and a hard sell, especially in a world of so much noisy content.\u201d\nA former chief executive of the creative agency Droga5, Mr. Essex helped introduce the award to encourage marketing that does not interrupt television programs or internet browsing and \u201cthat can attract an audience rather than repel an audience,\u201d he said.\nHe noted that it could be difficult to expose people to the films outside industry events, YouTube and Vimeo. This year, there will be a screening for the films at the festival, and they will appear on a special section of The Atlantic\u2019s website.\n\u201cA huge part of the reason readers come to The Atlantic is to understand, more broadly, what people are thinking about and why specific issues matter,\u201d said Hayley Romer, the publisher. \u201cBrands have the same opportunity to provide greater perspective for consumers for dramatic changes that are happening now and shaping their world.\u201d\nMs. Romer said companies were motivated to pursue such marketing because \u201cthe pinnacle of what you can be as a brand is a thought leader in the area in which you exist.\u201d\nThe Atlantic, like The New York Times, has an in-housestudiothat works with brands to develop content.\nThe jury that will select the winner this month includes figures like Jenna Lyons, the creative director of J. Crew; Joanna Coles, the chief content officer at Hearst; and Jae Goodman, the chief creative officer of CAA Marketing, a division of Creative Artists Agency.\nMr. Goodman said the same qualities that made for any great film applied to those from brands \u2014 though they do have a different goal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same elements that make it a great, great story, that touches you, that sparks the right emotion, that gives you the same great response that an Oscar-winning movie would give you,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cHowever, it also needs to drive those brand and business results. If Coca-Cola makes a great feature film and doesn\u2019t sell more Coca-Cola, then that\u2019s a failure on Coca-Cola\u2019s part.\u201d\nHe said that the subtle nature of how brands might sway customers through storytelling and films was a fine line for marketers, and that criticism of it could be overblown.\n\u201cThe idea of being misled by marketers or tricked into choosing one brand over another comes up in this conversation a lot, and for what it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s a little bit unfair as long as the brand is straightforward about its role in the creation and distribution of the content,\u201d Mr. Goodman said.\nHepointed toa children\u2019s show developed recently for Chipotle by the creators of \u201cYo Gabba Gabba!\u201d It is clear that it came from the company but is \u201ceducational entertainment to try to get kids and families to make better food choices,\u201d he said.\nFor the filmmakers and celebrities involved in such projects, the level of creative freedom and opportunity to be more than a face in a commercial can be particularly appealing, Mr. Essex said.\n\u201cThe old model was that you did an ad and you hoped no one would see it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the brands are to the point of asking, \u2018Do something more compelling and artistic,\u2019 and the talent is responding to that.\u201d\nMr. Essex said he viewed the Tribeca X Award as the early part of an evolution leading to brands pursuing programming in a bigger way, similar to initiatives in the mid-1900s from General Electric and Mutual of Omaha. He likened these efforts to the high end of a spectrum, where the low end is the automated buying of millions of online ads tailored to a person\u2019s interests and optimized for clicks and sales.\n\u201cThe brand will make the thing, not the thing that interrupts the thing, with shows and films in addition to the programmatic stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have that classic high and low but nothing in between.\u201d"

        "title": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?",
        "fulltext": "In just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.\nThey\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.\nWe have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.\nWhile Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.\nCould it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?\nConsider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.\nIn 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.\nThe solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.\nAT&T (also known as the Bell System) had its rates regulated, and was required to spend a fixed percentage of its profits on research and development. In 1925 AT&T set up Bell Labs as a separate subsidiary with the mandate to develop the next generation of communications technology, but also to do basic research in physics and other sciences. Over the next 50 years, the basics of the digital age \u2014 the transistor, the microchip, the solar cell, the microwave, the laser, cellular telephony \u2014 all came out of Bell Labs,along with eight Nobel Prizes.\nIn a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.\nTrue, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.\nWe are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.\nIt is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, newspaper publishers lostover half their employeesbetween 2001 and 2016. Billions of dollars have been reallocated from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms. All content creators dependent on advertising must negotiate with Google or Facebook as aggregator, the sole lifeline between themselves and the vast internet cloud.\nIt\u2019s not just newspapers that are hurting. In 2015 two Obama economic advisers, Peter Orszag and Jason Furman, publisheda paperarguing that the rise in \u201csupernormal returns on capital\u201d at firms with limited competition is leading to a rise in economic inequality. The M.I.T. economists Scott Stern and Jorge Guzman explained that in the presence of these giant firms, \u201cit has become increasingly advantageous to be an incumbent, and less advantageous to be a new entrant.\u201d\nThere are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.\nThe second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.\nThe third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.\nRemoving the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.\nI\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.\nWoodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple plans to start testing self-driving cars on California roads, the clearest signal yet that the world\u2019s most valuable technology company wants to design or build autonomous vehicle technology.\nOn Friday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple an official test permit that the agency said would allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h luxury hybrid sport utility vehicles. The permit authorizes six people to take control of the vehicles if necessary.\nApple has been coy about its self-driving car project, known internally as Project Titan. The iPhone maker has not officially acknowledged the existence of the project, which appeared to be adrift last year. The company laid off dozens of people in the fall andbrought in one of its top troubleshooters, Bob Mansfield, to reinvigorate the effort.\nIn October, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told investors, \u201cWe are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it\u2019s clear that there are a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience.\u201d\nNeil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the siteAbove Avalon, said the company appeared to have moved away from plans to build and sell cars in the way that Tesla does. Instead, he said, \u201cthey are working on a transportation platform.\u201d\nThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\nApple declined to comment on the California permit or on its broader automotive plans, instead referring to a statement in December, when itsubmitted comments about autonomous vehicle technologyto the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\nIn those comments, the company said: \u201cApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\u201d\nThe self-driving car segment is among the most bitterly contested areas in emerging technology, with Apple joining 29 other companies that have received test permits in California.\nThe competition for talent in the sector is intense, with top employees receiving millions of dollars in compensation a year. The ride-hailing companyUber is locked in a nasty disputewith Google\u2019s former car division, now known as Waymo, over Waymo\u2019s accusations that a former company executive stole crucial technology that was later used by Uber.\nGoogle, an early developer of the technology, considers self-driving cars to be a potential new market, while Uber hopes to eliminate the need for human drivers to shuttle its customers. And traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor view the self-driving car as a natural extension of their existing businesses.\nStart-ups are also vying to enter the market. Udacity, an online education company co-founded by a pioneer of Google\u2019s self-driving car initiative, is building an open-source autonomous car and offeringa training course to people who want to become self-driving car engineers.\n\u201cEvery company will have to have some solution for transportation,\u201d Mr. Cybart said."

        "fulltext": "Q.On my iPhone, I recently got an iMessage from a friend who had an animation of confetti playing in the background screen. How is this done?\nA.Plenty of third-party apps are available for the major mobile platforms (including iOS) that allow you to add animations and other special effects to your text messages, but Apple includes somebuilt-in tools in its iMessage app for iOS 10. While most of the special effects do not fully translate to Android or Windows-based phones overthe SMS system, iMessages sent between iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users using the same software should be able to take full advantage of the animations, sound effects, stickers and other features included in the iOS 10 version.\nTo add an effect to an outgoing iMessage, enter the note you wish to send, but then press your finger down and hold it on the blue arrow in the text field. The \u201cSend with effect\u201d screen appears. On the Bubble tab, tap the dot next to the name of an animation style (like \u201cSlam\u201d) to preview it. Selecting the \u201cInvisible Ink\u201d option scrambles your message into a mass of dots that the recipient must swipe over with a finger to read.\nTo get to the full-screen animated effects, like the confetti, fireworks, lasers or balloons, tap the Screen tab. Here, you can swipe through the available animations until you find the one you want. As with any iMessage, tap the blue arrow to send your text and selected effect to your recipient.\nThe iMessages app in iOS 10 also has a feature called Tapback that lets you quickly reply to an incoming message by double-tapping it on the screen and selecting a small graphic (like a heart or a thumbs-up sign) to send as a reply. You can also send handwritten messages by turning the iPhone sideways and composing, or send an animated GIF by tapping the gray arrow and then the App Store icon next to the text-entry field \u2014 and selecting (or searching for) a clip from the library.\nIf you have iOS 10 and screen animations are not working for you, check your iPhone settings to see if \u201cAuto-Play Message Effects\u201d is disabled in theReduce Motion area of the Accessibility controls."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Fingerprint sensors have turned modern smartphones into miracles of convenience. A touch of a finger unlocks the phone \u2014 no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a$1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows a user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars.\nWhile such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole.\nNew findingspublished Mondayby researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial \u201cMasterPrints\u201d that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time.\nThe researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it\u2019s almost certainly pretty darn bad,\u201d said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. \u201cIf all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that\u2019s not bad odds.\u201d\nFull human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google\u2019s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger \u2014 say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand.\nSince a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,\u201d said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State.\nDr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number.\nApple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches.\nGoogle declined to comment.\nThe actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google\u2019s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security.\nStephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings.\n\u201cTo really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you\u2019d have to try it on the cellphone,\u201d she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound.\nPhone makers have acknowledged that fingerprint sensors are not foolproof, but said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant that more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked \u2014 a common habit in the early days of smartphones.\nDr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. \u201cMost of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,\u201d he said.\nFor a thief or spy to turn master fingerprints into smartphone keys would require a lot of additional work. \u201cIn order to launch this attack, you still have to make fake fingers,\u201d Dr. Ross said.\nStill, the team\u2019s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government\u2019s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,\u201d Dr. Boehnen said.\nPhone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, \u201cbut the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.\u201d\nAdding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Dr. Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S8, are harder to trick. (Face recognition, another security option available on some phones, is considered less secure than fingerprints.)\nPhone users can also protect themselves by turning off fingerprint authentication for their most sensitive apps, such as mobile payments, Dr. Boehnen said.\nDr. Memon said that despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I\u2019d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it\u2019s idle for one hour.\u201d"
