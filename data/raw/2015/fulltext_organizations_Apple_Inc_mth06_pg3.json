        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Apple\u2019s iTunes has grown stale. It is difficult to use and feels dated when compared with online music services like Spotify and Pandora. Pick your critique, and Apple has heard it.\nBut an overhaul of Apple\u2019s music products, which includes an integration of the Beats music service that the Cupertino, Calif., company acquired last year for $3 billion, shows that Apple, if anything, knows it has to grab attention while playing catch-up.\nIn a thoroughly choreographed presentation at Apple\u2019sannual conferencefor software developers, celebrities including the movie director J. J. Abrams and the rapper Drake helped Apple on Monday perform the nifty trick of matching competitors like Google and Spotify while still appearing to be on the cutting edge of the tech scene.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t the first phone, we weren\u2019t the first music player. That\u2019s not where revolutions are made,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of software and Internet services, said in an interview after the event. \u201cRevolutions are about bringing it all together and having the best product that actually works.\u201d\nThe new music service was one part of a wide-ranging slate of announcements. Apple detailed new versions of its software systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs, offering features like public transit directions to its mapping software \u2014 a feature that Google and other mapping providers have supported for many years.\nFor years, Apple\u2019s strategy for selling iPhones and Macintosh computers has been to offer exclusive, high-quality software as a lure to reel people into buying its hardware. But the quality of its software started to slip last year, when the latest versions of theiPhoneand Mac operating systems shipped with major bugs, including one that disabled the cell signal for a number of iPhone users last September.\nA crowd gathered inside the Moscone Center in San Francisco before the conference began on Monday.\nA crowd gathered inside the Moscone Center in San Francisco before the conference began on Monday.\nA vendor outside the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2015 sells iCups, a toy string phone.\nMr. Cook kicking off the event.\nAttendees watched as the company made announcements about OS X, its Mac operating system.\nMr. Federighi demonstrating features in the latest Mac operating system, called El Capitan.\nA demonstration of Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite, which is using a developer version of Metal, an improvement in the Mac\u2019s graphical system.\nJennifer Bailey, vice president for Apple Pay, describes the expanded use of the company\u2019s mobile payments service.\nSusan Prescott, vice president for product marketing, demonstrating the addition of the News app to iOS 9.\nCraig Federighi, head of software engineering,\u00a0announced that the Swift 2 programming language would be open source, meaning that many different developers can contribute to its development.\nThird-party apps on the watch will be as useful as apps on the phone, according to Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive.\nJimmy Iovine introduced Apple Music.\nThe musician Drake giving Eddy Cue, head of software and Internet services, a high-five after discussing the Connect feature of the new Apple Music service.\nA performance by The Weeknd closed Monday\u2019s presentation.\nTo avoid a repeat, Apple on Monday introduced upgrades for its mobile and computer systems, iOS and OS X, with a strong focus on improving things under the hood, like stability, performance and battery life.\nThe new version of iOS, called iOS 9, expands on existing features like Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant. The updated assistant can respond to commands like \u201cShow me photos from last August\u201d to load the specific photo roll taken that month.\nWhen a user is receiving a phone call from an unfamiliar number, a user can ask \u201cWho is calling?\u201d and Siri will search emails for that phone number to identify the caller.\nApple also made changes to iOS that will significantly change the way iPads work. The company introduced a split-screen mode that allows multiple apps to run side-by-side, a big change from the current interface, which loads one app that takes up the entire screen.\nApple made the change in anticipation of releasing a jumboiPadthat it plans to market as a device for professionals, according to a person briefed on the product.\nThe new Mac system, called El Capitan, also focuses on refining existing features. Apple added a button to its Safari web browser that mutes sound that unexpectedly starts playing from a webpage. Apple also expanded its search feature, called Spotlight, to do smarter searches. Typing \u201cSF giants,\u201d for example, will bring up the game scores and games schedule for the San Francisco Giants baseball team.\nEl Capitan also emphasizes improving performance. Apple said apps would start about one and a half times as fast as in the previous version of OS X, and switching between apps would also be much snappier. The free upgrades for both the Mac and iPhone operating systems system will be available in the fall.\nMany of Apple\u2019s new features represent an effort to make iPhones smarter and more contextually aware of users\u2019 daily rhythms and needs. In doing this, the company is mimicking features that Google\u2019s Android operating system has had for years.\nGoogle Maps has long had public transit directions, for instance. Apple\u2019s new personal assistant, which would use cues like location, time of day and user patterns to suggest specific apps to use at that moment, is similar to the Google Now assistant, which is available on Android devices and can be downloaded to iPhones through the App Store.\nSiri\u2019s expanded ability to search through photos is also similar to the new Google Photos software that the search giant unveiled two weeks ago at Google I/O, its own developer conference.\n\u201cDevelopers need Apple to compete seriously with Google on these \u2018intelligent\u2019 features to keep users on the platform,\u201d said Justin Kaufman, director of engineering in the West Coast office of Raizlabs, a company that builds mobile applications for both the iOS and Android platforms.\nApple expanded Apple Pay, its mobile payments service, to include a loyalty and rewards programs for some merchants. For example, users paying with Apple Pay at Walgreens and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts can redeem points they have accrued through the retailer\u2019s rewards program.\nThe company highlighted the announcement of Apple Music, an app and music service that it developed with Beats Electronics. The new application includes features that have long been familiar to customers of subscription-based streaming services like Spotify and Pandora, but Apple executives say their offering is better because it takes a confusing torrent of different methods to listen to music and ties them together in one place.\n\u201cThe music industry is a fragmented mess,\u201d said Jimmy Iovine, the music executive who joined Apple after the Beats acquisition. The main difference with Apple\u2019s offering is that a customer\u2019s music downloads, the streaming music service and an Internet radio service can all be found inside the Apple Music app, he said.\nApple Music allows users to search for songs and stream them over the Internet, similar to Spotify. The streaming service makes recommendations for other playlists and albums for people to listen to. The service will cost $10 a month or $15 a month for up to six family members.\nThe music app, which will be available June 30, also includes an overhauled version of iTunes Radio, the Pandora-like radio service Apple released in 2013. The radio service has added a live station, called Beats 1, that is curated by major names in the music industry, like the former BBC producer Zane Lowe.\nApple has also integrated social media elements into Apple Music, enabling artists to publish posts about their albums and concerts, and allowing customers to post comments.\nJames McQuivey, a technology analyst for Forrester Research, said Apple was late to the streaming music party, but still has a chance to leapfrog the competition.\n\u201cCan Apple beat Spotify?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, it can, not because its service will be any better, but because it can build its new music service into the hundreds of millions of devices that its loyal Apple users already love.\u201d\nApple also demonstrated a news-reading mobile app called News, which will allow users to load articles from media outlets including The New York Times, ESPN and Wired. The app reformats web articles into magazinelike formats, similar to Flipboard, the popular reading app offered on Apple and Android devices."

        "fulltext": "Q.An icon appeared on my computer offering me a free upgrade to Windows 10. Is this real? And if so, should I sign up?\nA.While programs suddenly appearing on your desktop can often be suspicious (and malicious), the small notification icon shaped like a Windows logo is part of Microsoft\u2019s Get Windows 10 app that has been recently delivered as part of Windows Update. Windows 10, Microsoft\u2019s newest operating system, will be available starting July 29 for most computers running legitimate copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\nThe Get Windows 10 app checks your PC for compatibility and lets you sign up to \u201creserve\u201d your copy of the system. After you place your reservation, your computer will download some preliminary files to speed the overall upgrade process once Windows 10 is officially available. Microsoft estimates the actual installation time for the upgrade will be 20 minutes to an hour, depending on the computer.\nEven if you sign up, you can cancel your upgrade reservation before you install Windows 10. Microsoft says you will need to upgrade before July 29, 2016, to get the software free.\nAs for whether you should sign up, that is entirely up to you. Windows 10 may resolve issues some users found with the Windows 8.1 interface. Keep in mind thatmainstream support for Windows 7 has already ended, although security patches will continue until early 2020. Upgrading any operating system typically requires an adjustment period and basic troubleshooting to feel comfortable with the software, but new features and better security are the rewards.\nTo help you decide, a prompt on theMicrosoft.comhome page will direct you to more information about Windows 10, including afrequently asked questions section,demonstration videosand details aboutthe upgrade process. You can also find a complete list ofthe hardware requirementsthat your PC must meet to run the system.\nEditing the Apple TV Screen\nQ.Is there a way to ditch some of the channel apps on the Apple TV home screen so the kids can\u2019t see them?\nA.You canhide Apple TV channelsin a couple of ways. With the remote, select an unwanted icon and hold down the center select button. When the icon begins to wiggle, press the remote\u2019s play/pause button and choose Hide This Item from the menu.\nAnother method is to open the settings icon on the Apple TV screen. Choose Main Menu and then go down the list of channel apps. Select a channel and press the remote\u2019s select button to either hide it or show it.\nTIP OF THE WEEKTwitter continues to adjust its service and is introducing a new feature to better display exchanges between users. The company is also adding a new way to easilyblock accountsthat have a reputation for abuse.\nAs announced recently on its company blog, Twitter has started to group conversations (replies to a particular post) on an tweet\u2019s details page by connecting them with a line that highlights the dialogue between users; to delve more deeply into a specific tweet\u2019s responses, a button that reveals more replies is available. The new conversation groupings for Tweet pages arrived first forTwitter.comwebsite users, but users of Twitter\u2019s mobile apps will get the feature, too.\nThe company is also furthering its efforts to help stop abuse and trolling on its service by letting usersshare their personal lists of blocked accounts\u2014 which could be useful among friends or organizations targeted by the same harassers. For those who want more information, the Twitter Help Center has detailed instructions for exporting and importing \u201cblocked lists\u201d atsupport.twitter.com/articles/20172663."

        "fulltext": "Appleis recalling about 233,000 of its Beats Pill XL speakers in the United States and Canada after receiving complaints that the products can overheat.\nThe company received eight reports of problems with the Beats Pill XL portable wireless speakers, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The agency said one report involved a burn injury to someone\u2019s finger and another said a desk was damaged.\nThe development of the speakers predated Apple\u2019s purchase of Beats for $3 billion last year. Customers can request a refund or store credit for $325, slightly more than the speakers\u2019 $300 price tag.\nApple has suspended sales of the speakers \u201cfor the time being,\u201d according to a company spokesman, Tom Neumayr.\nWednesday\u2019s recall affects all of the Beats Pill XL speakers sold worldwide since January 2014. About 222,000 units were sold in the United States and 11,000 were sold in Canada. Apple did not disclose how many units it has sold worldwide, although the United States is largely seen as the company\u2019s biggest global market.\n\u201cCustomer safety is always a top priority at both Apple and Beats, and we have voluntarily decided to recall this product,\u201d the company said in astatement on its website.\nCustomers seeking to turn in their speakers must first submit a request online. Apple will pay for return shipping and process refunds and credit within three weeks, according to the company\u2019s statement.\nOverheating is not a new issue for Apple products. Last year, the company offered replacements for a potentially faulty power adapter for several of its iPhone models.\nIn 2006, Apple recalled more than a million batteries used in some of its iBook and PowerBook computers because they posed a fire hazard. That recall followed two smaller recalls of batteries for similar issues in 2004 and 2005."

        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s get one thing straight: That rubbery, straplike thing that holds the newRolex Oyster Perpetual Yacht-MasterEverose gold to your wrist is not, according to Rolex, \u201crubber.\u201d Nor is it a \u201cstrap.\u201d\nIt is, in the company\u2019s description, an Oysterflex, a \u201ctechnical bracelet\u201d consisting of a titanium and nickel-alloy blade covered with \u201chigh-performance black elastomer,\u201d featuring a \u201cpatented longitudinal cushion system.\u201d\nUnveiled with fanfare at the Baselworld watch fair in March, Rolex\u2019s foray into rubber was greeted as a feat of engineering to rival some futuristic iPhone with a holographic screen. \u201cOne of the most overengineered, overly complicated, and probably unnecessary watch accessories ever,\u201dBloomberg\u2019sStephen Pulvirent wrote. \u201cBut that\u2019s kind of why it\u2019s so awesome.\u201d\nAs the he-man sports watch continues its ascent into luxe territory, the go-anywhere rubber strap (in some minds, the province of $100 Swatch watches and Fitbits) has evolved into a haute fashion statement, embodying stealth wealth at its finest. Elegant yet sporty and unpretentious, it is the horological equivalent of wearing a Thom Browne suit with sneakers.\nAs a strap material, rubber has at least one obvious advantage over traditional metals and hides: It can be rendered in any color or shape.\nConsider the rainbow on display at Baselworld. Tudor unveiled aPelagosdiver\u2019s watch (about $4,400) with a rubber strap in a blue as inviting as the Aegean, and Oris countered with itsAquis Depth Gaugewatch ($3,500), with a yellow rubber strap seemingly bright enough to read by. Sinn showed off a limited editionEZM 7, designed for fire brigades, featuring a rubber strap in three-alarm red ($2,730).\nWatch geeks looking to take a further spin around the color wheel may explore the fashion possibilities of theApple Watch Sport($349 to $399), whose aggressively futurist fluoroelastomer Sport Band (in pink, green and blue, besides black and white) is a form of Jetsons-esque jewelry, as well as a gym-friendly timepiece accessory.\nWhether the watch in question is a high-end Swiss mechanical or a Silicon Valley smartwatch, the insouciant addition of rubber carries appeal for today\u2019s young-at-any-age executive who would rather Instagram himself diving the Great Blue Hole near Belize than sipping Cristal at Claridge\u2019s. When paired with a luxury watch, rubber is a way of hinting at business-class privilege without looking as if you\u2019re trying too hard.\nWhich is not to say that rubber straps need be an exercise in understatement.\nHublot has long practiced what it calls the \u201cart of fusion,\u201d combining utilitarian materials like rubber with precious metals like gold and platinum. Its new aluminum-coated carbon-fiberBig Bang Unico Italia Independent($28,600) features a rubber strap coated with blue denim and metal studs. The avant-garde piece looks like something ABBA might have worn if teleported to the 23rd century.\nWhile contemporary watch aficionados may associate rubber with high-tech futurism, this lightweight and water-resistant material has been a familiar feature on sports watches, particularly diver\u2019s watches, going back to the Tropic-style straps that were popular in the 1960s.\nBut these days, a \u201csports watch\u201d need not be taken literally. The aforementioned Rolex Yacht-Master, with its 18-karat Everose case and $24,950 price, may technically be a sailing watch, but its main competitive function seems to be sartorial.\nAs such, it is little wonder that rubber can be found on a multitude of current pieces that have nothing to do with sweat or snorkels.\nHamilton, for example, recently introduced the VenturaElvis80 Auto, a homage to the classic midcentury model Elvis Presley wore 54 years ago in the movie \u201cBlue Hawaii.\u201d It comes with a sleek rubber strap as an option.\nA sports watch? Hardly. This is an 80th-birthday tribute to a performer whose athletic legacy largely consists of hoisting fried-banana-and-peanut-butter sandwiches, after all.\nBut as the watch makes clear, rubber has assumed an undeniable perch in the watch world: a material befitting the wrist of a King."

But just wait awhile.\nHere\u2019s my haiku:\nWe tend to recognize and give weight to agents of change mainly if they operate within our frame of reference, an attention span calibrated to the rhythms of human life\u2014to hours and days, maybe years, rarely\n                                            decades.\nWaves are no such thing. They are fed by forces as near perpetual as the sun\u2019s rays and the Earth\u2019s spin. They know nothing of time, despite their metronomic manner. They roll until impeded.\nIt is the waves that break when surging seas collide with rocky shores. Thus is born the impression that water is weak and rock a bastion. But it is the human eye, of course, that is weak. Handicapped, really. Shortsighted\n                                            in the most profound way.\nWith human perception of time and environmental change in mind, I hope you\u2019ll read the invaluable essay on \u201cExistential Risks\u201d\n                                        contributed byMartin J.

        "title": "What Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Overlooked in His Defense of Privacy",
        "fulltext": "Timothy D. Cook,Apple\u2019s chief executive,delivered a speechlast week that raised some eyebrows in the technology industry.\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,\u201d said Mr. Cook, who was being honored by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy watchdog group.\nHis blistering defense of privacy, which he and other Apple executives repeated at the company\u2019sdeveloper conferencethis week, was notable. It isn\u2019t every day that you hear a tech executive admit there is an opaque trade-off at the heart of his industry. We users give digital giants access to our most private information, and they shower us with technology we can\u2019t do without. It is an arrangement baked into every decision made in every boardroom in Silicon Valley, and it is a bargain thatmany of us are uneasy about. Now, finally, here was the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful company asking whether that deal is worth the trouble.\nBut while Mr. Cook raised awareness for digital privacy, his speech glossed over two main issues. For one, he neglected to mention that Apple also collects a great deal of data about how we use technology. While it has more protections for that data than many rivals, the companyplainly states in its privacy policythat it does use private data in many ways, including to build and market its own products, and to build its own advertising network. Apple\u2019s most profitable devices sit at the center of a tech ecosystem teeming with businesses that collect our data \u2014 and if those social networks, search engines and other free apps didn\u2019t exist, Apple\u2019s products would be far less useful.\nMr. Cook also failed to fairly explore the substantial benefits that free, ad-supported services have brought to consumers worldwide. Many hundreds of millions of people now have access to more information and communication technologies because of such services.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThe fact that Apple goes out of its way to include free services like Google search in its iPhones and iPads suggests that it agrees with the rest of the tech industry \u2014 and many users \u2014 that ad-supported services can, on balance, be good for the world. The question to ask is not whether we should ever use those free services, but rather whether, when we do use them, we are given enough information and disclosure to be able to make those decisions rationally.\n\u201cThere are timeless principles around fair dealings with consumers,\u201d said Nuala O\u2019Connor, the president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech-focused think tank. \u201cAnd the first and main thing is, does the customer know what\u2019s happening to them?\u201d She argued that if companies were transparent and honest about how they use people\u2019s data, customers could freely weigh the benefits and costs of online services.\nIn his speech to EPIC, Mr. Cook offered a much starker, and less practical, view of privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should ever have to trade it for a service that you think is free but actually comes at a very high cost.\u201d\nThat bold pronouncement got me wondering whether Mr. Cook uses a differentiPhonefrom every iPhone that Apple has ever sold me. On my iPhone, Google is right there in the search bar, by default. Microsoft\u2019s Bing is built into Siri, and Facebook and Twitter beckon me from the sharing menu.\nIf Apple really didn\u2019t think that its customers should trade their data for free services, you\u2019d guess that it would build its own ad-free web search engine for its devices. But Apple does not do so. Instead, it sells off the search bar to ad-supported search companies. Analysts at Goldman Sachssaythat Apple\u2019s current deal with Google is worth billions; at least indirectly, then, Apple benefits financially from Google\u2019s ad-gotten gains.\nAnd that\u2019s not all. When I go to Apple\u2019s App Store, I\u2019m presented with a bevy of free apps that are supported either in whole or in part by ads. This vibrant marketplace works in Apple\u2019s favor \u2014 the more free apps there are, the more useful the iPhone becomes. That dynamic explains why, in 2010, Apple created iAd, its own advertising network meant to foster the ad-supported app marketplace. IAd lets marketers target users of Apple\u2019s devices based on their purchases from the iTunes store, purchases that Apple of course tracks by default. (You can use an ad-supported search engine like Google to find instructions foropting out.)\nThere\u2019s nothing terribly wrong with any of this. Yes, there are downsides to the ad-supported tech industry, and, yes, privacy advocates and tech insiders like Mr. Cook should continue to push the entire industry to more stringently protect our data. But it would be insane to argue that we haven\u2019t seen benefits in return for this data. Anyone who uses devices like the ones Apple makes can see that ad-driven businesses like Google, Facebook and Twitter have improved people\u2019s lives in major ways.\nAmong other things, ad-supported services give us instant access to more information than was ever stored in the entirety of the world\u2019s libraries just a few decades ago. They also create systems that allow for instant communication and organization between more than a billion people. Theyare helpingto provide life-changing miniature computers, also known as phones, to people in developing nations for about $50 each. They\u2019ve given us artificial-intelligence supercomputers that can instantly translate languages or recognize speech. And, indirectly, they\u2019re creating upcoming wonders like self-driving cars and balloons that wire up the globe in Internet access.\nMr. Cookis fond of arguingthat \u201cwhen an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product.\u201d That view is simplistic because it overlooks the economic logic of these services, especially the idea that many of them would never work without a business model like advertising. Services like social networks and search engines get substantially better as more people use them \u2014 which means that the more they cost to users, the worse they are. They work best when they\u2019re free, and the best way to make them free is to pay for them with another business that depends on scale \u2014 and advertising is among the best such businesses.\nMr. Cook is right to promote Apple\u2019s privacy policies. Apple places more restrictions on the use of data than other tech companies. This has been especially true recently after Apple moved toinstitute more rigorous security measuresafter an embarrassing hacking last fall in whichfemale celebrities\u2019 photos were stolen from their iCloud accounts.\nApple\u2019s newer privacy and security initiatives \u2014 including its decision toencrypt your iPhone data by defaultin a way that makes itvirtually inaccessible to the government\u2014 are laudable. At its developer conference this week, executives made the case that they could create services based on data about how you use your phone without sending that data into the cloud for analysis. This, they argued, was far safer than Google\u2019s practice of combining all your activities into a single dossier housed online that could be used to create more services but also to help advertisers.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying Apple is perfect, but I think on privacy Apple does compare favorably with Google,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of EPIC, the group that honored Mr. Cook. Mr. Rotenberg pointed to a number of areas in which ad-supported Internet companies have played loose with users\u2019 privacy; Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Myspace haveall signed settlementswith the Federal Trade Commission after misbehaving with data.\nBut it is also worth noting that Google and Facebook do not actually sell people\u2019s data to advertisers, as Mr. Cook suggested they did in his EPIC speech. (As with Apple\u2019s ad system, they allow marketers to target you based on your profile.) In many areas of security and transparency, Google has been ahead of Apple. For instance, Google offered two-factor authentication of cloud-bound data before Apple did.\nApple\u2019s business model also comes at a cost. Services that are sold as part of its hardware are usually hampered by lock-in and limits of reach. IMessage and FaceTime promise end-to-end encryption, which will prevent anyone from ever snooping on your conversations. But iMessage and FaceTime work only with other Apple devices because Apple has little business interest in building encrypted chat for people who can\u2019t afford iPhones.\nSo what to do if your friends can\u2019t afford privacy? You\u2019re not out of luck. Apple has made it easy for you. If you\u2019re O.K. taking the risk, download an ad-supported messaging app from the iPhone\u2019s App Store."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a ruling that determinedAppleto be the leader of an industrywide conspiracy among book publishers to raise prices of digital books.\nBy a 2-to-1 vote, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said it agreed with the conclusions of Judge Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, who rendered the decision in 2013.\n\u201cWe conclude that the district court\u2019s decision that Apple orchestrated a horizontal conspiracy among the publisher defendants to raise e-book prices is amply supported and well reasoned, and that the agreement unreasonably restrained trade,\u201d the appeals court wrote in its decision.\nIn the case, brought in 2012, the Justice Department accused Apple and five book publishers of conspiring to raise e-book prices above Amazon\u2019s standard price of $9.99 for new e-book titles. The idea, the government said, was to allow publishers to set their own prices rather than letting retailers do so. The five book publishers settled the case before the trial.\nWhen Apple entered the e-book market, it changed the way publishers sold books by introducing a model called agency pricing, in which the publisher \u2014 not the retailer \u2014 set the price, and Apple took a cut of each sale. The Justice Department argued that left Amazon.com, the other big e-books retailer, no choice other than to raise prices.\nApple fought the accusation in 2013 and lost after a monthlong trial. The words ofSteven P. Jobs, the company\u2019s co-founder, who died in 2011, proved damaging.\nAn email written by Mr. Jobs that referred to the agency model was frequently brought up at the trial. In the email, sent to Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, Mr. Jobs wrote of the contracts negotiated with publishers: \u201cI can live with this, as long as they move Amazon to the agent model too for new releases for the first year. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure we can be competitive.\u201d\nIn her ruling, Judge Cote said emails and spoken statements by Mr. Jobs made clear he knew that publishers were unhappy with Amazon\u2019s price of $9.99 for e-books and that Apple\u2019s entry would drive up prices across the industry.\n\u201cApple has struggled mightily to reinterpret Jobs\u2019s statements in a way that will eliminate their bite,\u201d Judge Cote wrote. \u201cIts efforts have proven fruitless.\u201d\nThe Justice Department said it was gratified by the court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThe decision confirms that it is unlawful for a company to knowingly participate in a price-fixing conspiracy, whatever its specific role in the conspiracy or reason for joining it,\u201d William J. Baer, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, said in a statement.\nTimothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s current chief executive, called the e-book case \u201cbizarre,\u201d and the company fought to overturn the judge\u2019s ruling. The company on Tuesday reiterated its disappointment in the decision in a statement.\n\u201cApple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing and this ruling does nothing to change the facts,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. \u201cWe are disappointed the court does not recognize the innovation and choice the iBooks Store brought for consumers. While we want to put this behind us, the case is about principles and values. We know we did nothing wrong back in 2010 and are assessing next steps.\u201d"
