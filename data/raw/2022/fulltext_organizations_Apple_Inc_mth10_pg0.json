        "title": "Apple Store in Oklahoma City Becomes Second to Unionize",
        "fulltext": "Apple employees at a store in Oklahoma City have voted to unionize, becoming the second of the company\u2019s roughly 270 U.S. retail stores to do so.\nThe result, announced by the National Labor Relations Board on Friday night, suggests that aninitial victoryby a union at a store in Towson, Md., in June was not an isolated development in an organizing campaign that dates back to last year.\nAccording to the labor board, 56 employees voted in favor of the union and 32 voted against. The workers will be represented by the Communications Workers of America, which has members at AT&T Mobility, Verizon and media companies like The New York Times, and has sought to represent tech-industry workers in recent years.\nSara Steffens, the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer, said in a statement that workers at the store, known as the Penn Square location, had faced an aggressive anti-union campaign, but she predicted that \u201cApple retail workers across the country will continue to organize, especially after this momentous victory.\u201d\nApple said in a statement that \u201cwe believe the open, direct and collaborative relationship we have with our valued team members is the best way to provide an excellent experience for our customers, and for our teams.\u201d\nIn interviews, employees at the store said that they received solid benefits, like health care, stock grants and paid family leave, and that their pay had improved over the past several months. The companyrecently raisedthe minimum starting wage at its stores to $22 an hour and said it had increased starting wages by 45 percent in the United States since 2018.\nBut workers complained that supervisors\u2019 decisions about hiring, pay and job assignments were often opaque and said a union would bring greater transparency to their store.\nLeigha Briscoe, an employee involved in the organizing who works in sales, said employees were given very different tasks during the first year of the pandemic, when they often worked from home, with little explanation for the disparities.\n\u201cSome people were at home making posters, doing drawing projects, and others were on the phone taking calls eight hours a day,\u201d Ms. Briscoe said. \u201cThere was a lack of clarity as to what the plan was.\u201d\nWorkers also cited confusion over how to earn promotions at the store.\n\u201cSome people have been in their current roles for years trying to get promoted and are not really getting anywhere, but whenever they get feedback on an interview for a promotion what they get is very subjective goals,\u201d said Michael Forsythe, another employee involved in the organizing, who helps oversee the repair room at the store.\nMr. Forsythe said workers were sometimes told to work on their \u201ccustomer focus,\u201d but were not given more concrete suggestions like \u201cI want you to have a three-week average of 80 percent customer satisfaction score.\u201d\nMr. Forsythe said the idea of unionizing first occurred to him late last year, after employees across the company had begun to protest management\u2019s plans to bring them back to the office. The protestballooned into a broader campaign, known as #AppleToo, that sought to highlight a variety of workplace problems, including harassment and pay disparities, and caught Mr. Forsythe\u2019s attention.\nIn April, a store in Atlanta filed a petition for a union election, and Mr. Forsythe and other employees at the Oklahoma City store began to discuss unionization.\nThe Atlanta store later withdrew its petition, as the company announced a raise and highlighted the benefits it offered and the potential costs of unionizing,denting support for the union.\nBut by then, the Oklahoma City store had formed an organizing committee and more employees were expressing interest in a union. The Oklahoma City workers filed their petition inearly September.\nEmployees said supervisors had responded to their campaign by holding round-table discussions and one-on-one conversations in which they emphasized the downsides of a union, including the dues that workers would have to pay and the possibility that they could lose benefits during the bargaining process. Supervisors also said having a union would make it harder to change workplace arrangements when they were in need of updating, like during the pandemic, according to these employees.\nWorkers at the Oklahoma City store said their market leader, a manager who oversees several locations, was in their store regularly during the campaign, even though they would typically see him no more than a few times a year.\nPatrick Hart, an employee at the store who helps customers resolve issues with products, said the impact of the company\u2019s response was limited because many employees did their own research about how joining a union would affect them.\n\u201cWe are all extremely educated people \u2014 Apple hires a certain kind of person,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cWe know how to look into things.\u201d\nTripp Micklecontributed reporting."

        "title": "Who Gets the Last Word on Steve Jobs? He Might.",
        "fulltext": "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis meticulously curated the memory of her husband after he was assassinated, reimagining President John F. Kennedy as a fallen King Arthur in a modern-day Camelot.\nNow some historians wonder if Laurene Powell Jobs is also trying to frame the legacy of her late husband, Steve Jobs, a complicated and transformational figure who was shadowed by his flaws as a father and belligerence as a boss.\nLast month, Ms. Powell Jobs introduced the Steve Jobs Archive. It aspires to reinvent the personal archive much as Mr. Jobs, in his years running Apple, remade music with the iPod and communication with the iPhone.\nRather than offering up a repository of personal correspondence, notes and items for public research and inquiry, as other influential figures have done, Ms. Powell Jobs, who did not respond to requests for comments, said at a conference last month that the Steve Jobs Archive would be devoted to \u201cideas.\u201d Those ideas are primarily Mr. Jobs\u2019s philosophies about life and work.\nThe result, for now, is more of a tribute website than an archive. More than a dozen archivists and scholars who spoke to The New York Times questioned even calling it an archive. It has worried historians who fear it may inspire other wealthy and influential figures to curate the historical record about them just as ordinary people curate their lives on Instagram.\n\u201cOne of the things that excites me about archives is the warts and all,\u201d said Courtney Chartier, an archivist at Columbia University who has worked on Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s archive and the papers of Tony Kushner, the playwright. \u201cPeople are complicated, and that\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t shy away from.\u201d\nThe Steve Jobs Archive deviates from the repositories of other famous business leaders who largely left their material to corporate or library archives. About half ofHarvard Business School\u2019s 25 greatest business leaders of the 20th centuryleft behind personal archives that are open to the public in libraries or museums, including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Asa Candler, who built Coca-Cola.\nOther iconic business founders such as Walt Disney, Sam Walton and Ray Kroc entrusted their papers to the companies they built, allowing those collections to become the cornerstone of corporate archives.\nMuch of that corporate archive material is closed to the public, but some companies, such as theWalt Disney Company, make personal correspondence, notes, speeches and other items available to authors for research.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t censor,\u201d said Becky Cline, director of the Walt Disney archives. \u201cWe just vet.\u201d\nThe new Jobs archive debuted witha minimalist websitecontaining eight pieces of video, audio and writing that express what the archive calls Mr. Jobs\u2019s \u201cdriving motivations in his own words.\u201d The items, three-quarters of which were already public, can be accessed by clicking through maxims made famous by Mr. Jobs, including \u201cmake something wonderful and put it out there\u201d and \u201cpursue different paths.\u201d\nThe next steps for the archive are shrouded in the kind of mystery associated with the way Mr. Jobs ran Apple. About all that\u2019s been publicly disclosed is that Ms. Powell Jobs hired a documentary filmmaker to gather hundreds of oral histories about Mr. Jobs from former colleagues. Where that material will be stored and who will have access to it has not been revealed.\nIn an interview, Leslie Berlin, the archive\u2019s director, declined to say whether the collection would be open to researchers or include any contentious material about Mr. Jobs. The author Walter Isaacson, who did about 40 interviews with Mr. Jobs before writing a best-selling book about him, said in an email that he didn\u2019t know much about the archive and declined to comment further.\nMs. Powell Jobs has been the driving force behind the project.She married Mr. Jobs in 1991, two years after meeting him as a graduate student at Stanford. Since his death, she has used herestimated $16 billion fortuneto fund the Emerson Collective, a philanthropic and commercial operation that owns The Atlantic magazine and funds an organization trying to reduce gun violence in Chicago.\nDuring his life, Mr. Jobs admired and encouraged historians to preserve the history of his Silicon Valley predecessors such as Robert Noyce, who co-founded the chip maker Intel. But he put little value on his own history, and Apple has seldom commemorated product anniversaries, saying it focuses on the future, not the past.\nWhen Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, a dozen years after he was forced out, one of the first things he did was offer Stanford University the company\u2019s corporate archives, said Henry Lowood, the curator of Stanford libraries\u2019 History of Science & Technology Collections. Stanford had a signed document from Apple\u2019s legal department within 24 hours, allowing it to transport some 800 boxes from the company\u2019s campus to the university.\nStanford spent years cataloging itemssuch as photos of a barefoot Mr. Jobs at work, advertising campaigns and an Apple II computer. That material can be reviewed by students and researchers interested in learning more about the company.\nSilicon Valley leaders have a tradition of leaving their material with Stanford, which has collections of letters, slides and notes fromWilliam Hewlett, who founded Hewlett-Packard, andAndy Grove, the former chief executive of Intel.\nMr. Lowood said that he uses the Silicon Valley archives to teach students about the value of discovery. \u201cUnlike a book, which is the gospel and all true, a mix of materials in a box introduces uncertainty,\u201d he said.\nAfter Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011, Mr. Isaacson, the author, published a biography of Mr. Jobs. Some at Applecomplained that the book, a best seller, misrepresented Mr. Jobs and commercialized his death.\nMr. Isaacson declined to comment about those complaints.\nFour years later, the book became the basis for a film. The 2015 movie, written by Aaron Sorkin and starring Michael Fassbender, focused on Mr. Jobs being ousted from Apple and denying paternity of his eldest daughter.\nMs. Powell Jobs lobbied to stop the film,according to emails made publicafter a hack of Sony Pictures, which held rights to the film. She and others who were close to Mr. Jobs thought any movie based on the book would be inaccurate.\n\u201cI was outraged, and he was my friend,\u201d said Mike Slade, a marketing executive who worked as an adviser to Mr. Jobs from 1998 to 2004. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how outraged Laurene was.\u201d\nIn November 2015, a month after the movie\u2019s release, Ms. Powell Jobs had representatives register the Steve Jobs Archive as a limited liability company in Delaware and California. She later hired the documentary filmmaker, Davis Guggenheim, to gather oral histories about Mr. Jobs from former colleagues and friends. She also hired Ms. Berlin, who was Stanford\u2019s project historian for its Apple archives, to be the Jobs Archive\u2019s executive director.\nMr. Guggenheim gathered material about Mr. Jobs while also working on a Netflix documentary about Bill Gates, \u201cInside Bill\u2019s Brain.\u201d Mr. Slade, who worked for both Mr. Jobs and Mr. Gates, said he sat for an interview about one executive, stopped to change shirts and returned to discuss the other one.\nMs. Berlin assisted Ms. Powell Jobs in gathering material. They collected items such as audio of interviews done by reporters and early company records, including a 1976 document that Mr. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Apple\u2019s co-founder, called their declaration of independence. It outlined what the company would stand for, said Regis McKenna, who unearthed the document in his personal collection gathered during his decades as a pioneer of Silicon Valley marketing and adviser to Mr. Jobs.\nMs. Powell Jobs also assembled a group of advisers to inform what the archive would be, including Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive; Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s former chief design officer; and Bob Iger, the former chief executive of Walt Disney and a former Apple board member.\nMr. Cook, Mr. Ive and Mr. Iger declined to comment.\nApple, which has its own corporate archive and archivist, is a contributor to the Jobs effort, said Ms. Berlin, who declined to say how she works with the company to gain access to material left by Mr. Jobs.\nThe archive\u2019s resulting website opens with an email that Mr. Jobs sent himself at Apple. It reads like a journal entry, outlining all the things that he depends on others to provide, from the food he eats to the music he enjoys.\n\u201cI love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being,\u201d he wrote.\nThe email is followed by a previously undisclosed audio clip from a 1984 interview that Mr. Jobs did with Michael Moritz, the journalist turned venture capitalist at Sequoia. During it, Mr. Jobs says that refinement comes from mistakes, a platitude that captures how Apple used trial and error to develop devices.\n\u201cIt was just lying in the drawer gathering dust,\u201d Mr. Moritz said of the recording.\nIt\u2019s clear to those who have contributed material that the archive is about safeguarding Mr. Jobs\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s a goal that many of them support.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much distortion about who Steve was,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cThere needed to be something more factual.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The recent rally in technology stocks could come to a screeching halt at the opening bell on Wednesday. Overnight, investors dumped portions of their tech portfolios after disappointing results from Alphabet, Microsoft and Texas Instruments, with the trio reporting that a slowing global economy continues to batter demand for digital advertising, cloud computing and chips.\nOver the past seven trading sessions, investors piled back into tech stocks, pushing the Nasdaq up 8.5 percent on hopes the tech giants would show that the worst of the downturn was behind them.\nThose investors were greatly disappointed.Microsoft\u2019s salesrose at their slowest ratein five years, as rising energy costs and a strong dollar ate into profits. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google,missed analyst expectationsand said growth in its core advertising business had slowed to its weakest point since 2013 (apart from a short period at the start of the pandemic), as companies slashed marketing budgets.\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s C.E.O., told analysts that it would be \u201cresponsive to the economic environment.\u201d Translation: Expect more cost cuts and layoffs. \u201cWe are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there,\u201dPichai said, \u201cand, based on that, the right resourcing, and making course corrections.\u201d\nThe global chip market continues to look turbulent, too.Texas Instruments downgraded its full-year outlook as demand softens for its microprocessors, which power consumer products and industrial machinery.\nThe weak results point to the challenges facing Big Tech, which thrived during an era of low interest rates, low energy prices and low inflation. Investors will be looking for further signs of the sector\u2019s health when Facebook\u2019s owner Meta reports earnings on Wednesday; Apple and Amazon are scheduled for Thursday.\nSome big-name investors have been losing patience,even before the latest quarterly results rolled in. Brad Gerstner, head of the hedge fund Altimeter and a large investor in Meta, publishedan open letterearlier this week to Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s C.E.O., calling for the company to reduce spending by $5 billion annually, limit its investment in metaverse-related projects at $5 billion each year, and cut staff by at least 20 percent.\n\u201cMeta needs to rebuild confidence with investors, employees and the tech community in order to attract, inspire, and retain the best people in the world. In short, Meta needs to get fit and focused,\u201d Gerstner wrote.\nBritain moves back its fiscal budget announcement to Nov. 17.The two-week delaycomes a day after Rishi Sunak was appointed prime minister, and is meant to give him and his new-ish chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, time to review their plans.

Mobileye will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MBLY.\nApple will follow an E.U. order to switch iPhone chargers.Greg Joswiak, the tech giant\u2019s marketing chief, said at a Wall Street Journal conference that the company would beginusing USB-C technologyinstead of its proprietary Lightning connector. E.U. officials say the directive will reduce electronic waste; Apple has argued it would stifle innovation.\nAdidas\u2019s move on Tuesday toimmediately cut ties with Kanye West, now known as Ye, was a key moment in businesses wrangling with too-hot-to-handle provocateurs. New estimates show how much the rapper and designer\u2019s recent behavior, including antisemitic remarks and publicly wearing a shirt with a slogan tied to white supremacy, will cost him financially.\nHere are three calculations of how much Ye stands to lose:\nThe Morningstar analyst David Swartz estimated that the Adidas-Yeezy partnership likely paid Ye in excess of$100 million a year.Overall, Swartz put the collaboration\u2019s value at up to $2 billion.\nForbes reckonedthat Adidas-Yeezy accounted for$1.5 billion of Ye\u2019s net worth, and that its demise knocked his wealth down to $400 million.\nBloomberg reportedthat Adidas-Yeezy earned Ye over$500 million in royalty payments and marketing feesduring the first four full years of the deal, through 2020.\nAdidas is now indicating that it will sell existing Yeezy merchandise \u2014only without the Yeezy branding. (The German sportswear giant said yesterday that it was the \u201csole owner\u201d of all design rights to existing products that came out of the partnership.)\nMore shoes have dropped for Ye.Gap, whose partnership with him ended last month, said it was taking \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to remove Yeezy Gap products from its stores and had shut down an affiliated website.\nAnd two pro athletes \u2014 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAaron Donaldof the Los Angeles Rams andJaylen Brownof the Boston Celtics \u2014 tweeted that they were cutting ties with Donda Sports, Ye\u2019s marketing agency.\nReports that Elon Musk has told his bankers he plans to close his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter by Friday is giving the social network\u2019s shares a boost in premarket trading this morning, and they are outperforming most tech stocks. But for Musk, it\u2019s becoming clearer he\u2019ll have a load of problems to solve if he gets to the finish line.\nTwitter\u2019s shares closed at $52.78 yesterday,up 2.4 percent and close to Musk\u2019s deal price of $54.20 a share. The reason for investor optimism: Musk is said to have told the bankers helping to finance his takeover that he willmeet a court-set deadlineto seal the transaction by Friday. (Another potentially positive development: The banks are also said to havesent paperwork to equity investorsinvolved in the deal.)\nIf Musk doesn\u2019t meet that deadline, he\u2019ll have to finally go through with a trial that could compel him to close on the transaction. DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch takes a look atJudge Kathaleen St. J.

A Twitter representative indeed noted that the company\u2019s \u201coverall audience has continued to grow.\u201d\nBut that growth may not be enough to boost the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cEven without any Musk-related drama, Twitter will face challenges. The company rarely turns a profit, and growth has been slow for years,\u201dwrites The Times\u2019s Kevin Roose, who notes that all of the big social media apps are struggling after a decade of dominance.\nAshton Carter, a secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, died on Monday at 68. Though perhaps best known for further opening the U.S. military to women and transgender service members, Carter also focused on building a bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley.\nCarter was uniquely qualified to do so.He trained as a theoretical physicist, but gained an interest in policy during his time as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University. He first joined the Pentagon during the Clinton administration, rising through the ranks as a weapons-buying official and expert in nuclear matters, before being nominated as defense secretary by Obama in 2014.\nHe came to believe that the Pentagon needed Big Tech,particularly to bolster the military\u2019s expertise in artificial intelligence and other advances. \u201cWhen I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially the Defense Department,\u201d he said in a 2015 speech. \u201cToday, much more technology is commercial.\u201d\nIn his first two years as defense secretary, Cartervisited Silicon Valley more timesthan his predecessors had over two decades. He invoked ideas like \u201ccentaur warfighting,\u201d where A.I. augments human capabilities, and sought to convince younger generations of tech executives to partner with the Pentagon.

        "title": "Lufthansa Says Passengers Can\u2019t Use Apple AirTags to Track Checked Bags",
        "fulltext": "Update:Lufthansa says Apple AirTags are once again allowed in checked bags.\nLufthansa, a German airline, set off confusion recently after telling passengers that they could not use trackers like Apple AirTags in checked baggage because of international guidelines for personal electronic devices. Apple rejected that interpretation on Tuesday, saying its trackers comply with all regulations.\nIt does not appear that any other airlines are requiring passengers to turn off the trackers, which have become popular as a way to find lost baggage. Lufthansa found itself in the middle of the issue when reports surfacedin the German news mediathat the devices were prohibited.\nThough Lufthansa said it has no desire to prohibit the devices that it deemed safe, the airline seems to have stepped in a mess based on the reading of obscure international guidelines and regulations, with no clear consensus on what is and is not allowed in Europe.\nRegulators in the United States have said the trackers, which use Bluetooth technology and do not interfere with the airplanes\u2019 communications equipment, are permitted in carry-on or checked baggage. A variety of other companies sell similar trackers,including Tile, which is popular with users of Android phones.\nLufthansasaid on Sundayon Twitter that the trackers must be deactivated in checked baggage on its flights, citing the International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s guidelines for dangerous goods as well as the trackers\u2019 \u201ctransmission function.\u201d Shutting off the trackers renders them useless.\nThe airline has not issued a specific policy prohibiting baggage trackers. Rather, it says it is at the mercy of the rules. On Tuesday, the airline said it was \u201cin close contact with the respective institutions to find a solution as quickly as possible.\u201d It also indicated its own examination saw no danger from their use.\n\u201cThe Lufthansa Group has conducted its own risk assessment with the result that tracking devices with very low battery and transmission power in checked luggage do not pose a safety risk,\u201d said Martin Leutke, a Lufthansa spokesman. \u201cWe have never issued a ban on devices like that. It is on the authorities to adapt regulations that right now limit the use of these devices for airline passengers in checked luggage.\u201d\nIn its statement, Apple said that AirTags are \u201ccompliant with international airline travel safety regulations for carry-on and checked baggage.\u201d\nThe devices use Bluetooth Low Energy, the same technology commonly used by wireless headphones, which are permitted on flights. They are tracked by sharing their last location via a secure signal to nearby Apple devices.\nApple said the international aviation body does not have specific standards for cargo tracking devices, and its definition of personal consumer electronic devices is focused on larger devices, including phones, cameras and laptops. These tend to have larger lithium batteries.\nApple said AirTags use CR2032 coin cell batteries, which are commonly used in watches and key fobs. Apple said those batteries have been approved for all baggage by the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the International Air Transport Association, an airlines trade group.\nAnF.A.A. advisory from 2017 allows devicesto use low-powered wireless communication like Bluetooth on board planes in the United States. In a statement on Monday, the Transportation Security Administration confirmed Apple\u2019s view that \u201ctracking devices are allowed in both carry-on and checked bags.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said that its regulation \u201cdoes not in itself ban or allow devices such as the Apple AirTags.\u201d But the E.A.S.A. seemed to kick the matter back to Lufthansa, saying, \u201cIt is the responsibility of operators to prohibit the use of devices which could adversely affect the flight safety or the aircraft\u2019s systems.\u201d\nThe specification on dangerous goods from the International Civil Aviation Organization says that \u201cbatteries contained in portable electronic devices should be carried as carry-on baggage,\u201d but that if checked \u201cthe devices must be completely switched off (not in sleep or hibernation mode).\u201d It was not immediately clear how the guidelines address the issue of Bluetooth Low Energy transmissions.\nBut the organization also said in a statement that it is not a regulator and \u201cdoes not play an oversight role\u201d over the airlines. Rather, its guidelines on what passengers may and may not do, and similar advice from the international trade group, trickle down to the regulators and airlines, which set policy."

        "title": "New Crack in Apple\u2019s Armor as Dozens Strike at Its Stores in Australia",
        "fulltext": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Dozens of Apple workers in Australia walked off the job on Tuesday after negotiations over pay and working conditions stalled, the latest crack in the armor of the tech giant as it contends with a burgeoning unionization movement in the United States and Europe.\nThe action itself is small. About 150 retail workers, out of the company\u2019s nearly 4,000 Australian employees, voted to strike for an hour. Then, starting on Wednesday, they will refuse to do a variety of work, including installing screen protectors, repairing AirPods and handling deliveries.\nBut the strike is symbolically significant. After years of labor harmony, Apple retail workers in the United States have overcome resistance from the company to mobilize in a pandemic-era wave of employee unrest, part of a broader flourishing of labor organizing at retailers, restaurants and tech companies.\nIn June, a store in Towson, Md., became Apple\u2019sfirst U.S. outlet to unionize, with employees saying they wanted a greater voice over compensation, scheduling and career advancement. That same month, an Apple store in Britain was unionized for the first time. A second U.S. store, in Oklahoma City,voted to unionizeon Friday, and union leaders say workers at more than two dozen other stores in the country have expressed interest in unionizing.\nOutside an Apple store in the Australian state of Queensland on Tuesday, about two dozen workers waved a banner saying, \u201cGive workers what they deserve,\u201d and chanting \u201cunion power\u201d and \u201cApple power.\u201d In New South Wales, workers marched through a shopping mall containing an Apple store while holding signs saying, \u201cGive us our weekends\u201d and \u201cAbove record profits, below minimum conditions.\u201d\nUnion leaders in Australia, where strikes in the retail sector are rare, said they had been energized by the American labor activity.\nThe strike is \u201can important example of unions establishing a presence in an industry or workplace setting like a tech giant where that just hasn\u2019t happened before, here or in the U.S.,\u201d said Anthony Forsyth, a workplace law professor at R.M.I.T. University in Melbourne.\nIt is noteworthy that in Australia \u201cthere is a union that\u2019s pushing Apple a lot harder and getting a little further,\u201d he added, \u201cthan what\u2019s happening in the U.S.\u201d\nIn Australia, Apple offered workers a minimum wage that is 17 percent above the industry minimum, amounting to hourly pay of at least $17.35 (27.64 Australian dollars).\nThe three unions involved in negotiations have opposed the deal and accused Apple of attempting to rush the agreement to a vote.\nThe deal would equate to a \u201creal wage cut\u201d because of inflation,according toone of the unions, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. It also accused Apple of obstructing union organizers when they sought to survey workers in preparation for negotiations, a tactic common in the United States but less so in Australia.\nAlthough all three unions are negotiating with Apple, only the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union has decided to strike, after its members voted in favor of the action last week.\nThe union is demanding a minimum hourly wage of 31 Australian dollars, in line with what U.S. employees receive. It is also seeking guarantees that workers will receive two consecutive days off per week, as well as the right for part-time workers to have set working days and times.\nEmployees have little say over when they\u2019re scheduled to work, which makes it difficult to have a life outside the job, said Josh Cullinan, the union\u2019s national secretary.\nApple has rejected the claim that it tried to rush an agreement through. It says its part-time workers are able to specify four days or more of availability a week and are given two weeks\u2019 notice for schedules.\nA spokesman for the company said in an emailed statement that Apple was \u201cproud to reward our valued team members in Australia with strong compensation and exceptional benefits.\u201d\n\u201cApple is among the highest-paying employers in Australia,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we\u2019ve made many significant enhancements to our industry-leading benefits, including new educational and health and wellness programs.\u201d\nIn the United States, Apple has tried to beat back the uprising at its stores by raising pay and telling workers that unionizing willresult in fewer promotions and inflexible hours. Labor leaders said Apple\u2019s efforts had contributed to the recent suspension of a planned union vote in Atlanta.\nThe National Labor Relations Board has alsoissued a complaintsaying Apple interrogated retail workers and prevented them from posting union materials in the break room, as they were entitled to do.\nThe U.S. action has been a significant factor in how negotiations have played out in Australia, said Mr. Cullinan, the union secretary, adding that it had \u201cinfluenced and encouraged and excited\u201d Australian workers.\nHe said he believed that Apple had tried to rush through a new agreement in an attempt to \u201clock in conditions and lock out unions\u201d and head off any potential further union mobilization.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s being driven by that experience in America and a deep fear of workers\u2019 taking back a tiny amount of power in their workplace,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cullinan acknowledged that the number of striking workers was modest, but noted that of the three unions involved, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union represented the largest number of Apple workers. The action will have symbolic resonance, he added, because it is \u201cthe biggest of its sort in Apple\u2019s history in Australia.\u201d\nThe union\u2019s members have also voted in favor of striking for 24 hours if Apple tries to take the agreement to a vote without the union\u2019s approval.\nIn Australia, the unionization of Apple workers has been a relatively recent development. When the company\u2019s last agreement with employees was negotiated, in 2014, there was no union involvement. What has changed since then is the creation of a new union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union.\nThe retail sector in Australia has never been a labor stronghold, said Andrew Stewart, an employment law expert at the University of Adelaide, both because of the insecure, casual nature of the work force and because of the tactics of the union that has historically dominated the sector, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. That union focused on being able to reach agreements with employers, sometimes at the cost of achieving the best outcomes for workers, according to critics.\nThe Retail and Fast Food Workers Union was founded in 2016 over discontentment with the larger union, positioning itself as a more activist and militant alternative. Because Australia aims to avoid having multiple unions in the same sectors, the new union was set up as an unregistered trade union. While it is still able to bargain on behalf of employees and organize strikes, it does not have the same extensive rights and obligations of registered trade unions.\nThe challenge for unions contending with multinational corporations is twofold, Professor Stewart said. On a local level in Australia, they have to buck a trend of declining union interest and membership. On a global level, they also need to \u201cfind methods of trying to work across borders to develop an effective collective voice,\u201d he said.\nTripp Micklecontributed reporting from San Francisco."

        "fulltext": "The National Labor Relations Board has issued a complaint against Apple over accusations that it interrogated its retail workers about their union support and prevented pro-labor fliers in a store break room.\nThe Communications Workers of America told the N.L.R.B. in May that Apple had violated several labor laws in an attempt to stymie labor organizers at its World Trade Center store in New York. The union accused Apple of interrogating and surveilling staff, requiring workers to attend anti-union speeches and restricting placement of union fliers.\nThe agency found merit in two of those claims.\nSara Steffens, the secretary-treasurer for the Communications Workers of America, praised the N.L.R.B. on Tuesday for holding Apple accountable. \u201cApple has a choice,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cDoes it want to be known for intimidating its workers and creating a culture of fear, or does it want to live up to its stated values and welcome true collaboration with all of its employees?\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman said the company disagreed with the union\u2019s claims and looked \u201cforward to presenting the facts.\u201d He added that the company valued the work of its retail staff.\nAn N.L.R.B. judge will hold a hearing about the matter on Dec. 13, unless the parties settle, an agency spokeswoman said.\nThe accusations against Apple have been at the heart of a dispute between the union and the company over tactics that Apple deployed last spring at three stores in New York, Atlanta and Towson, Md., that began to organize. The company equipped store managers with talking points that emphasized that joining a union could result in fewer promotions and inflexible hours. It also said it would increase wages to $22 an hour from $20.\nIn the face of Apple\u2019s efforts, union drives stalled at the World Trade Center store and the Cumberland Mall store in Atlanta. Employees at the World Trade Center have yet to hold an election, andthose at the Atlanta store abandoned their planned election.\nIn May, the Communications Workers of America also filed a charge that employees in Atlanta were required to listen to anti-union propaganda during mandatory meetings. The N.L.R.B. has not yet weighed in on that charge.\nIn June, employees at the Towson store became the first to unionize at Apple, withtwo-thirds voting to join the union. Apple employees in Oklahoma City will vote next week on whether their store will become the second."

        "fulltext": "The Will Smith film \u201cEmancipation\u201d \u2014 the actor\u2019s first since his infamous slap at the Oscars this year \u2014 will be released in December, making it eligible for the upcoming awards season.\nWhile releasing atrailerfor the film on Monday, Apple said \u201cEmancipation\u201d will have a limited theatrical release on Dec. 2 before becoming available on the company\u2019s streaming service on Dec. 9. The announcement followeda long discussionof whether Apple would release the film this year or delay it until 2023, considering the controversy surrounding Mr. Smith afterhe slappedthe comedian Chris Rock during the Academy Awards ceremony in March. Apple had declined to comment on its plans for the film.\nAfter the incident with Mr. Rock, Mr. Smith won the best actor Oscar that night for his performance in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d It was his first Academy Award, but shortly afterward heresignedfrom the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, saying he had \u201cbetrayed\u201d its trust. The academy thenbarred himfrom the organization and all of its events for the next decade.\nThat punishment does not preclude the actor from being nominated for his work, though it did not augur well for \u201cEmancipation,\u201d which had been considered an awards candidate before Mr. Smith slapped Mr. Rock. The decision to release the film in a limited number theaters ahead of its debut on the service suggests that Apple is planning to push it for award consideration this year.\nThat could backfire. The academy has signaled that it is ready to move on from the slap. Bill Kramer, the organization\u2019s chief executive, said it would not even be joked about at the next Academy Awards ceremony.\n\u201cEmancipation\u201d stars Mr. Smith as Peter, a real-life figure from the 1800s who escaped slavery and fought for the Union Army. Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by William N. Collage, the film had its first public screening in Washington on Saturday night, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s 51st Annual Legislative Conference. The event was followed by a question-and-answer session featuring Mr. Fuqua and Mr. Smith, who has remained largely out of the public eye since the Oscars.\nMr. Smith issueda public apologyon his YouTube channel on July 29. It has been viewed close to 3.9 million times."

        "title": "Elon Musk Faces Another Big Decision at Twitter",
        "fulltext": "Elon Musk closes his purchase of Twitter and fires several top executives.Follow for the latest news updates.\nIt\u2019s official:Elon Musk owns Twitter. Shortly after closing his $44 billion takeover of the social network, Musk, who changed his Twitter bio to read \u201cChief Twit,\u201dtweetedthat \u201cthe bird is freed,\u201d ushering in the Musk era of social media.\nBut the mood at Twitter isn\u2019t exactly celebratory right now. The company\u2019s 7,500 employees are afraid they may lose out on compensation Musk pledged to pay, while questions are arising about whether Tesla employees should be walking through Twitter\u2019s halls.\nTwitter\u2019s employee compensation program is what everyone\u2019s talking about.The program just happens to vest on Tuesday, and employees could be due total payouts well exceeding $100 million. As part of his deal with the social network, Musk agreed to make those payouts in cash. But the fear among employees, DealBook has learned, is that he may race to lay them off before they get their money.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Musk would be a good corporate citizen and pay out fired employees anyway \u2014 or whether he will stick to his word for those he chooses to keep. If Musk reneges on his pledge, expect to see former workers taking him to court.\nMeanwhile, Musk is already bringing in employees from his other companies,includingasking engineers from Teslato meet with Twitter product managers. Corporate governance experts would likely question whether it\u2019s acceptable practice to use resources from a public company to benefit what\u2019s, at least in theory, an entirely different one.\nMusk has been accused of conflicts of interest related to his ownership of multiple companies before, notably during Tesla\u2019sacquisition of the solar panel company SolarCity.\nTwitter is also relatively leaderless at the moment.In a widely anticipated move, Musk fired Twitter\u2019s four top executives \u2014 Parag Agrawal, its C.E.O.; Ned Segal, its C.F.O.; Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal policy; and Sean Edgett, its general counsel \u2014 shortly after closing his deal. \u201cGolden parachute\u201d provisions in their contracts mean they may be owedmore than $200 million, though it\u2019s unclear whether Musk will pay them out.\nFor now, Musk is Twitter\u2019s C.E.O., but given that he also holds that role at Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company, he\u2019ll have to quickly fill out the social network\u2019s C-suite to keep it functioning. (As an aside, it\u2019s worth noting that Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder and former C.E.O. who encouraged Musk to buy the company, has remained silent on all of this.)\nAnd all eyes are on how Musk will handle moderation.In anopen letter to advertisersyesterday, Musk said he wants the social network to be a digital town square where a \u201cwide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence\u201d \u2014 without becoming a \u201cfree-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences!\u201d\nBut Musk has also saidhe would lift banson the likes of Donald Trump. (Supporters of the former president are waiting with bated breath: \u201cThe bird is free,now free the GOAT,\u201d tweeted Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado.)\nThat could have broad implications for Twitter, beyond its ability to hold onto advertisers: \u201cTo the extent that world leaders see they have this space and it\u2019s unmoderated, they could push to see how far they can go,\u201d David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, told The Times.\nU.S. mortgage rates surpass 7 percent.Rates for the average 30-year fixed mortgage have now reachedtheir highest level since 2002, according to a survey by Freddie Mac. That\u2019s likely to put further pressure on the housing market, which is already in the midst of a slowdown.\nThe Bank of Japan keeps rates ultralow.Japan\u2019s central bankleft rates unchanged, making it an outlier in not moving them higher to curb inflation. The yen continued to weaken against the dollar; analysts think it couldreach a three-decade lowdespite interventions by the Japanese government.\nBritain weighs $57 billion in tax increases and spending cuts.The country\u2019s new (andwealthy) prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is exploring ways toraise 50 billion poundsto help fill a hole in public finances. That figure could come down if the Bank of England persuades markets that it can fight inflation while raising interest rates byless than expected, The Financial Times reports.\nKanye West\u2019s law firms cut ties with him, too.Cadwalader and Greenberg Traurig both said they had eitherstopped representing the rapper and designeror plan to, joining the likes of Adidas and CAA. Ye, as he\u2019s now known, posted on Instagram that helost $2 billion in one day, as corporate partners dropped him.\nPeloton\u2019s co-founder pledges nearly half his shares to cover margin calls.John Foley, who resigned as executive chairman last month, haspledged 6.7 million shares\u2014 or 41 percent of his holdings \u2014 to cover margin loans, according to a regulatory filing. That\u2019s nearly double what he had pledged a year ago, as Peloton\u2019s stock price has cratered.\nIt\u2019s shaping up to be a rough Christmas \u2014 and even rougher trading session on Friday \u2014 for Amazon. Its shares plunged more than 13 percent in premarket trading, wiping $150 billion off its market capitalization, after the e-commerce giant forecast itsslowest holiday sales growth in years.\nAmazon reported disappointing results, too.Sales were up, but all of the company\u2019s profits came from Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division. The rest of the company, including its core retailing operations, lost nearly $3 billion in the quarter.\nIt\u2019s been a brutal week for Big Tech.Yesterday, shares in Facebook\u2019s owner, Meta, lost nearly a quarter of their market value, about $85 billion, reinforcing how pessimistic investors are about the prospects for big portions of the FAMG \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\u2019s Google \u2014 grouping of mega-cap tech stocks. Amazon is set to open trading this morning at a price last seen in April 2020; investors have knocked nearly $1 trillion in market value off the stock since last November.\nThe U.S. consumer is cutting back.Earlier in the day,the government reported that G.D.P. rose 2.6 percentin the third quarter on an annualized basis. That was faster than analysts were expecting, but the data also signaled that U.S. consumers, the engine of the economy, aren\u2019t spending like they were during the pandemic.\nAmazon signaled that it was likely to follow the advice of its founder Jeff Bezos,who tweeted last weekthat it was time to \u201cbatten down the hatches.\u201d Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., Brian Olsavsky, said on a call with analysts that consumers\u2019 budgets had tightened and that Amazon, like other companies, was preparing for a \u201cslower growth period.\u201d\nApple, though, provided a bit of rosy news.Profits at the company,which also reported its earnings yesterday, were up slightly versus a year ago, bucking the drop at most of its tech rivals. Sales in nearly all of the company\u2019s segments were up, including in China, which had dipped in the last quarter.\nNonetheless, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., signaled that the company was facing inflationary pressures and a stronger dollar, which is making its products more expensive overseas.\n\u2014Jim Cramer, the CNBC commentator and host of the \u201cMad Money\u201d stock-picking program, on Meta\u2019s big uptick in spending. Cramer said in June that Meta shares had \u201cnowhere else to go but up.\u201d\nOf all the parts ofCredit Suisse\u2019s big reorganizationthat was announced on Thursday, the plan to spin out the Swiss bank\u2019s advisory and capital markets business stood out. That\u2019s not only because the move will resurrect the First Boston name after 16 years, but also because it heralds the return of a storied independent investment bank.\nBut how does CS First Boston, as the new business will be known, stack up to its competitors?\nThe back story:Credit Suisse first partnered with First Boston \u2014 one of the bluest of blue-chip Wall Street firms \u2014 in the late 1970s. Envious of the fat profits that American investment banks were generating during the 1980s deal boom, Credit Suisse moved toeventually take controlof First Boston by 1990. By 2006, the Swiss firm finallyretired the First Boston name.\nCredit Suisse got what it wanted, sort of.Its investment bank maintained a strong presence in businesses like advising on mergers and I.P.O.s. But despite its pedigree, it has largely operated in Wall Street\u2019s middle tier since the mid-1990s:\nIt cracked the top three in the M.&A. advisory and equity capital markets categories just once since 1996, according to rankings by Refinitiv. It has had better luck in advising on I.P.O.s and debt capital markets, including leading on I.P.O.s in 2005.\nBy comparison, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ranked in the top three for those businesses for nearly that entire period.\nAnd CS First Boston faces plenty of challenges.Credit Suisse executives were eager yesterday to point out the firm\u2019s advantages over rivals, including longstanding expertise in capital markets. \u201cWe are convinced that we can create a unique, independent enterprise that will grow and create value over time,\u201d Ulrich K\u00f6rner, Credit Suisse\u2019s C.E.O., told analysts.\nBut there\u2019s more competition now on Wall Street than ever. First Boston\u2019s traditional rivals are still around, while newer advisory firms like BDT, Centerview Partners (which advised Credit Suisse on its strategic review), Moelis and PJT Partners have emerged.\nCS First Boston may be preparing to step out amid much fanfare, and potentially with plenty of financial backing from new investors. But a rich history is no guarantee of success.\nDeals\nThe U.S. investment firm Nuveenagreed to buy Arcmont, one of Europe\u2019s biggest private lenders, for over $1 billion.
