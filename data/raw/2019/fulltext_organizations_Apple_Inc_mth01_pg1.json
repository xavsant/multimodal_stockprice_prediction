        "fulltext": "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 A new law in Australia gives law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech-industry giants like Apple to create tools that would circumvent the encryption built into their products.\nThe law, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018, applies only to tech products used or sold in Australia. But its impact could be global: If Apple were to build a so-called back door for iPhones sold in Australia, the authorities in other countries, including the United States, could force the company to use that same tool to assist their investigations.\nThe Australian lawwent into effect last month. It is one of the most assertive efforts by lawmakers to rein in tech companies, which have argued for decades that unbreakable encryption is an imperative part of protecting the private communications of their customers.\nIn recent years, law enforcement officials have complained that tough encryption has made it impossible for them to gain access to the online discussions of crime suspects, particularly in time-sensitive terror investigations.\nThe tension between tech and law enforcement came to a head about four years ago whenApple resisted a federal requestto help investigators gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a man who took part in a shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually found a way around the iPhone\u2019s security without Apple\u2019s help. But if Apple had already created a workaround \u2014 a back door, in industry terms \u2014 to sell phones in Australia, the American authorities could have simply ordered Apple to use the tool.\n\u201cThis may be an encryption back door for the U.S.,\u201d said Sharon Bradford Franklin, director of surveillance and cybersecurity policy for the New America think tank\u2019s Open Technology Institute. \u201cA back door to an encryption back door.\u201d\nThe Australian law has limited oversight mechanisms. A notice sent to a company must be \u201creasonable and proportionate,\u201d and the authorities must have a warrant to gain access to a phone or service. But the agency issuing the notice decides what is reasonable.\nThere is an appeals process if a company is asked to build a new interception capability. A firm can ask an independent assessment panel consisting of a technical expert and a former judicial officer to review the notice.\nThe law says the Australian authorities cannot ask a company to build universal decryption capabilities or introduce systemwide weaknesses. But security experts and tech companies like Apple said that did not reflect what they would have to do to comply with an order. It is impossible, for example, to create a workaround for one iPhone\u2019s encryption without potentially introducing something that could work for all of them, they said.\n\u201cAll of Australian technology is tarnished by it,\u201d said Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of the founders of Atlassian, a business software company that is among Australia\u2019s biggest tech companies.\nAustralia is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and it is not the only country in the alliance with a law like this. Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act in 2016. For British law enforcement to gain access to data, it must first ask a judicial approver.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the first,\u201d said Michelle Price, chief executive of the nonprofit Australian Cyber Security Growth Network. \u201cBut Australia\u2019s version has gone much further.\u201d\nApple officials called the law \u201cdangerously ambiguous\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d\n\u201cEncryption is simply math,\u201d Apple wrote in a statement submitted to the Australian Parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on Oct. 12. \u201cAny process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.\u201d\nBut politicians said the risk of encryption technology\u2019s being used by terrorists was too significant. Prime MinisterMalcolm Turnbull of Australia saidin July, \u201cThe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\u201d\nTechnology companies in the United States have argued that they cannot be compelled to create tools for breaking the encryption in their products because computer code is a kind of free speech protected under the First Amendment. But building tools to satisfy the Australian authorities would essentially make that argument moot. Countries around the world could demand access to the tool.\nApple is hardly the only tech company that could feel the impact of the Australian law. Anyone with a website is considered a communications provider, subject to the law. Any company that \u201cprovides an electronic service that has one or more end-users in Australia\u201d is required to comply.\nA long list of companies meets that description, such as smartphone makers and Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.\n\u201cOnce WhatsApp, for example, builds a system at the behest of the Australians, everyone gets to use it,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, the senior information security counsel on the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s legal team, who has studied the new law.\nThe law allows government agencies like the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or the Australian Federal Police to compel tech companies to install software on a user\u2019s device to get around encryption. It can also compel the company not to alert the user.\n\u201cSo if WhatsApp gets one of these notices and does not comply, they\u2019re subject to asset seizure and even hypothetically having executives hauled into jail for contempt if they refuse to do so,\u201d Mr. Cardozo said.\nThere is confusion about other secrecy requirements of the law. For example, would it require employees who received requests to keep them secret from their employers? The Australian Department of Home Affairs, which coordinates strategy and leadership of the country\u2019s national security policy, says it would not. But security experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and at companies like the password manager 1Password say it is actually unclear.\nAustralia does not have a strong tech industry, but it is growing, with investors and start-ups and a few established companies. And in the tightknit tech community that does exist, the new law has been a gut punch.\n\u201cWe never thought it would pass,\u201d said Alan Jones, chief executive of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney. \u201cWe all just figured that Australia\u2019s political leaders would consider the expert advice that told them this was nuts.\u201d\nSarah Moran, the chief executive of Girl Geek Academy, which teaches young women to code, said she had planned to begin tech start-ups in Australia until the law passed.\n\u201cI was looking to found two tech companies, but why would you build tech here now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government understands how drastically it impacts not just the tech that\u2019s built here but also the enthusiasm and entrepreneurial investment that Australians will be willing to make.\u201d\nMs. Moran, who is based in Melbourne, said she was questioning even the program she currently runs. \u201cWhy would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there\u2019s not going to be any tech industry?\u201d she asked.\nCasey Ellis, 37, was raised in Sydney but lives in San Francisco, where he runs a cybersecurity firm called Bugcrowd. He has already heard about companies that have become wary of hiring Australian firms, he said.\n\u201cPeople are factoring it in as a risk when you\u2019re looking at hiring an Australian now,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing a chilling effect around Australian companies.\u201d"

        "title": "Maybe Only Tim Cook Can Fix Facebook\u2019s Privacy Problem",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s nowhere in his job description, but Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has recently taken a moonlight gig as Facebook\u2019s privacy watchdog.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cook and his lieutenants took aim at Facebook for violating Apple\u2019s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users\u2019 online activity. Facebook promoted the app through an Apple program that gives trusted developers the ability to install apps for testing without going through the App Store\u2019s normal approval process. Apple responded by cutting off Facebook\u2019s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, causing chaos among the company\u2019s software engineers.\nThe move is the clearest sign yet that the cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up.\nMr. Cook, who has called privacy a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and taken Facebook and Googleto taskfor the misuse of user data in the past, could effectively become a technology regulator of last resort \u2014 using the power of Apple\u2019s iOS operating system as a cudgel to force software companies to respect user privacy and play by the rules, or risk losing access to millions of iPhone users.\nThe latest battle came on Wednesday, afterTechCrunch reportedon a Facebook program, known as Project Atlas, that paid users $20 in exchange for installing an app for Apple devices called Facebook Research. The program, offered to teenagers as well as adults, gave Facebook the ability to track app use, the websites users visited, the Amazon purchases they made and other intimate data.\nThe problem is that Facebook loaded the app onto users\u2019 devices using a kind of fast-track installation that bypasses Apple\u2019s normal App Store download process. This ability, known as side-loading, is available only to companies that are enrolled in Apple\u2019s enterprise developer program, and that agree to side-load apps only for internal testing, not for public use.\nApple was not happy, and cut off Facebook\u2019s enterprise developer access for all of its apps, not just the offending research app.\n\u201cWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization,\u201d an Apple spokesman said. \u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.\u201d\nFacebook, which reported strong earnings on Wednesday despite the missteps, is negotiating with Apple to restore its developer access. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.\n(On Wednesday, TechCrunchreportedthat Google had a similar research app, called Screenwise Meter. In a statement, Google said it was disabling the app, which it said \u201cshould not have operated under Apple\u2019s developer enterprise program.\u201d)\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Apple took a firm stand here. But if Mr. Cook truly wants to protect Apple users from privacy-violating apps, he could remove all of Facebook\u2019s products \u2014 including Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 from the App Store until the company can prove, in a real and measurable way, that it cares about its users\u2019 privacy.\nShutting off Facebook\u2019s access to Apple devices would be a radical step, tantamount to declaring war on a major competitor. But Apple hasbanneddevelopers for smaller infractions in the past. And in the absence of government regulation, there may be no other option for bringing the company to heel on privacy.\nWould temporarily cutting off Facebook\u2019s Apple apps be an effective deterrent? Absolutely. In less than a day, Apple\u2019s move to revoke Facebook\u2019s developer certificate has reportedly become a \u201ccritical problem\u201d for the company\u2019s developers. Hundreds of millions of people use Facebook through their iPhones, and without access to Apple\u2019s App Store, Facebook would see an immediate and devastating hit to its bottom line. The ban would quickly become an existential threat, and improving privacy on its apps would become an all-hands-on-deck project for the company\u2019s leadership.\nWould it be fair? Yes. Facebook\u2019s privacy violations over the years have been appalling, and its executives have blatantly evaded the rules that Google and Apple, the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, have put in place to protect their users from being exploited by data-hungry app developers. In emailsreleasedlate last year, Facebook executives were shown plotting to snoop on Android users\u2019 call and text logs without triggering a permission pop-up. And Facebook\u2019s Onavo VPN app waspulled fromApple\u2019s App Store last year for excessive data collection.\nWould cracking down on Facebook backfire on Apple? Possibly. Facebook\u2019s apps are some of the most popular offerings on Apple devices, and without access to their Instagram and Facebook feeds, some iPhone users might get frustrated and switch to Android. But this abandonment would happen slowly, not all at once. (IPhone users could still access Facebook\u2019s products through their mobile web browsers.) And more likely, given how heavily Facebook relies on Apple\u2019s platform, Facebook would almost certainly blink first, and make the necessary changes to get back into Apple\u2019s good graces.\nIs such a big crackdown necessary? It probably is, if Apple is truly serious about protecting privacy. Time and time again, Facebook has shown that it cannot be trusted to protect users\u2019 privacy unless it is forced to do so. And while regulators have fined Facebook for privacy violations, those punishments rarely amount to anything truly meaningful \u2014 at most, the company pays a few million dollars, promises to do better next time, and goes right back to work.\nWould punishing Facebook be an abuse of Apple\u2019s power? Arguably, yes. It\u2019s problematic that by virtue of their strangleholds on the Apple and Android operating systems, Apple and Google have control over huge swaths of the tech industry. And Apple\u2019s own record on privacy is hardly spotless \u2014 just this week, the company was forced to shut down the FaceTime feature because ofa bug that let users snoopon one another\u2019s phones.\nBut aggressive behavior among tech companies, for much less noble motives, is business as usual \u2014 Facebook, for example, routinely cuts off data access to rival apps likeTwitter,Vine, andPrisma. And until government regulators impose rules on the tech giants, the most effective regulation on tech industry excesses may need to happen between companies.\nIt\u2019s bizarre and somewhat troubling that Apple could unilaterally punish a competitor for its privacy sins. (Imagine if McDonald\u2019s could shut down Burger King franchises for health code violations, with little explanation and no recourse for appeal.) But it\u2019s hard to argue with Apple\u2019s decision here. It made rules governing what developers for Apple products were allowed to do, Facebook broke them, and it\u2019s now paying a price.\nApple\u2019s defense of user privacy, while certainly self-interested, is a boon to its users and a lever for change within the tech industry. And if Mr. Cook wants to take a strong stand against app developers that routinely violate users\u2019 trust, he could start with the biggest privacy violator of all. Facebook won\u2019t change on its own, but a chastening from Apple might be what the company needs to get its act together."

        "title": "Apple Was Slow to Act on FaceTime Bug That Allows Spying on iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Jan. 19, Grant Thompson, a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected discovery: Using FaceTime, Apple\u2019s video chatting software, he could eavesdrop on his friend\u2019s phone before his friend had even answered the call.\nHis mother, Michele Thompson, sent a video of the hack to Apple the next day, warning the company of a \u201cmajor security flaw\u201d that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didn\u2019t hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing and faxing Apple\u2019s security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Apple\u2019s product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on9to5mac.com, a news site for Apple fans, in an article that went viral.\nThe bug, and Apple\u2019s slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company\u2019s commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple\u2019s statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive,tweetedthat \u201cwe all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\u201d\nThe FaceTime problem has already been branded \u201cFacePalm\u201d by security researchers, who say Apple\u2019s security team should have known better. Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before that person answers the phone, or even if the person never answers.\n\u201cIf these kinds of bugs are slipping through,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, \u201cyou have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.\u201d\n[Read how to disable FaceTime to avoid the eavesdropping bug.]\nOn Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had \u201cidentified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.\u201d\nBut the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Ms. Thompson\u2019s urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.\nA bug this easy to exploit is every company\u2019s worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker\u2019s dream. In emails to Apple\u2019s product security team, Ms. Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.\n\u201cMy fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes,\u201d she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. \u201cAlthough this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw.\u201d\nUnknown to Ms. Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponize them, which allow governments, defense contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on people\u2019s devices without their knowledge, capturing everything from their locations to information caught on their microphones and cameras. The FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever higher sums to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.\nThe only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.\nThe market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker and security firm, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to $2 million.\nIn part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty program in 2016 \u2014 the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.\nAt a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as $200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty program has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.\nThe FacePalm bug is a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.\n\u201cThis is a bug that Apple\u2019s Q.A., should have caught,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s almost always fire.\u201d\nBug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.\nBugs that fetch $2 million or $3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 percent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive ofNetragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.\nIn this case, Mr. Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone\u2019s location, turn on that person\u2019s camera and capture video without a trace.\nBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s pretty good for a high schooler.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 For years, no matter what was happening elsewhere, global companies bet billions upon billions of dollars that China\u2019s consumers would keep spending money.\nNow, just when the world economy could use their financial firepower, they are holding back, worried about the country\u2019s slowing growth,a trade warwith the United States andrising amounts of personal debt.\nZhao Zheng, 26, is among thecost-conscious consumers.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Zhao, a real estate agent, was browsing smartphones made byXiaomi, aChinese rival to Applethat prices its handsets at a fraction of what the American tech giant charges for iPhones. He said the success in China of Xiaomi and Miniso, a chain of low-cost variety stores, suggested that Chinese consumers were looking to get more for their money.\n\u201cThe economy,\u201d Mr. Zhao said, \u201cis definitely very bad.\u201d\nA significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China\u2019s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.\nStock markets stumbled again on Thursday, in part over concerns that American companies and manufacturers are starting to feel the effects from the slowdown in China and the trade war. The S&P 500 sank 2.5 percent, while shares of Apple dropped nearly 10 percent after the company unexpectedly slashed its financial forecast, citingdisappointing iPhones sales in the country.\nThe rise of the Chinese consumer is not over yet, and Apple\u2019s disappointing numbers stem in part from the company\u2019s own decisions. But the weakness at Apple followed reams of other data \u2014declining car sales, faltering retail sales,a slumping property market, a tougher job market \u2014 that signal Chinese consumers may be losing their once unshakable confidence.\nThe sagging confidence could undermine China\u2019s efforts to redirect its economy and spur growth.\nThe Chinese government hopes consumers will become a greater source of economic growth as the country\u2019s longtime reliance on government-sponsored infrastructure projects and old-line industries like steel and cementpays ever-smaller dividends. In recent years, Beijing has rolled out ahuge social safety net, tax breaks and other incentives to get people to spend more of their own money on the trappings of middle-class life.\nThe spending slowdown in China could be a worrying sign for many of America\u2019s biggest companies, too, at a time when their profits and stock prices are under pressure.\nGreater China \u2014 a region that includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 is Apple\u2019s third-largest market after the United States and Europe, accounting for $52 billion in annual sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year. General Motors, through local joint ventures, sells more cars in China than it does in the United States.Eight percent of Procter & Gamble\u2019s total sales in 2017came from Greater China.\nOther companies are also feeling the pinch. China\u2019s auto market, the biggest in the world, saw sales fall during the first 11 months of last year. Sales of all smartphones fell by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2018.\nChinese consumers continued to spend relatively briskly during other recent slowdowns, and they could still help get the country\u2019s economy back on track. But they have reasons to be reticent now.\nBy many measures, the country\u2019s growth has slowed because of government efforts towean the economy off a heavy reliance on borrowingas well as other policies that have shaken theconfidence of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs.\n\u201cChina is at a turning point in its economy,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically been on a debt-fueled binge for a decade.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to turn the ship from industry to consumer at a time of rough waters.\u201d\nFor many people, circumstances have changed.\nChina has too many apartments that home buyers do not want,depressing a property marketthat is the largest source of wealth for Chinese households. The stock market lost around a quarter of its value in 2018.\nAnd although theyhave a long way to go to catch upto Americans, Chinese households are laboringunder growing amounts of debt. Unorthodox Chinese lenders like theonline shadow-banking networksknown as peer-to-peer lenders are stumbling, giving consumers fewer places to borrow more.\nDeclining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States also appear to be hurting the job market.\nChina does not disclose reliable unemployment data. But a recent survey by Mr. Collier of job postings, recruitment ads, numbers of applicants on recruitment websites and interviews with corporate managers suggested labor demand had weakened significantly. Hiring demand in import and export industries has been hit especially hard, falling 53 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, the survey found.\nAgainst that backdrop, it is not surprising that many consumers are looking for ways to spend less.\nWang Xiaochuan, who made about $145,000 a year as a pharmaceutical sales representative in Yantai in 2015, now makes less than a third of that thanks to a tightening of regulations on the drug industry. He has cut back his spending, buying Clarks shoes instead of the more expensive Ecco brand, or Coach goods rather than Louis Vuitton.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot more bad news about the economy than good news now,\u201d he said.\nIn a country with an aspirational culture that for decades has encouraged people to get rich, Apple has long held a special place. Having a new iPhone meant its owner had made it. Seven years ago, the release of a new iPhone set off scuffles in front of an Apple store in Beijing.\nBut price increases have put the iPhone beyond the reach of more and more Chinese buyers. An iPhone XR starts at 6,499 yuan, or about $950, just over two and a half months\u2019 worth of disposable income for the average Chinese person.\nRumors once circulated about young people selling kidneys to buy an iPhone. Now, the online joke goes, it would cost two kidneys.\nOn the last day of 2018, William Tan, a 30-year-old university teacher in the southern city of Nanning, replaced his iPhone 7 with a phone made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Although the Huawei phone cost more than $700, about a month\u2019s salary for him, it was still more than $200 cheaper than the base iPhone XR. He had used an iPhone 5, 6 and 7. But when his iPhone 7 broke down, he found he could no longer afford the latest iPhone.\nThe Huawei phone, he said, works fairly smoothly and takes better photos than the iPhone.\n\u201cI won\u2019t choose Apple again at this price range,\u201d he said.\nChinese consumers are by no means done with certain discretionary purchases. Spending on movie tickets and services remains strong, economists said.\nBut the consumer slowdown could worsen if Beijing does not address its economic problems.\n\u201cThe question is whether China can stabilize economic growth when it is facing economic headwinds,\u201d said Wei Li, senior China economist at Standard Chartered.\n\u201cIf the labor market does worsen in 2019 or if financial conditions don\u2019t improve, if the stock market remains low, all this could weigh on consumer confidence,\u201d Mr. Li said.\nGiven the uncertainty, many Chinese spenders will most likely continue to scrimp.\nWu Yan, a tech company worker who was looking at Xiaomi phones on Thursday afternoon, said he had also tried Apple and Huawei phones and had decided they were not much different from one another. What matters, he said, was the apps, and they work the same from phone to phone.\nBut Mr. Wu, 40, also said many middle-class Chinese people like him had reached a stage where their work was stable, their income was secure and they no longer needed to show off their spending power. His computer at home? It\u2019s four or five years old now, but it still works fine.\n\u201cNow we spend just to fulfill our needs,\u201d he said."

She\u2019s a relatively tech-savvy retiree and a longtime Apple fan who has used many of the company\u2019s products over the years. I learned to type on an Apple IIGS at her office, and she was an early adopter of the original turquoise iMac.

She also has a first-generation Apple Watch and a several-versions-ago MacBook Air, neither of which she\u2019s planning to replace anytime soon.\n\u201cThe phone I have does just about everything I need,\u201d she said when I called her to ask why she hadn\u2019t upgraded to one of the newer models. \u201cWhy pay $800 for a new one just to be up to date? My needs aren\u2019t that complicated.\u201d\nMost of the journalists who write about tech for a living (including me) are early adopters \u2014 power users who like having the latest gadgets, and who are willing to fork over money for a slightly better experience. For some of these people, Apple\u2019s announcement has come as a shock that portends potential disaster for the company.\nBut for my mom, and the many people who are probably in her situation, the company\u2019s slowing iPhone sales aren\u2019t at all a disaster. In fact, they make total sense, and they don\u2019t have much to do with China.\nIn aletter to investorsexplaining the lower forecast, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, nodded to smaller-than-expected demand for iPhone upgrades, saying that consumers were \u201cadapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies\u201d and \u201ctaking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.\u201d The company declined to comment for this column.\nApple is also facing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei, which have flooded international markets with lower-cost Androids that are, in many cases, just as functional as iPhones. And, yes, there are issues related to President Trump\u2019s trade war with China, and an overall economic slowdown in the country.\nBut the most consequential hit to Apple\u2019s bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replacedafter roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to move to longer replacement cycles, principally because the cost is higher,\u201d said Chris Caso, a tech analyst with Raymond James.\nMany of Apple\u2019s issues are common to smartphone makers. The components inside newer phones, such as added memory and improved screen technology, are more expensive than older components. Refurbished and used phones are alsomore easily available, and carriers like Verizon and AT&T aren\u2019t subsidizing new phone purchases as heavily as they once did, meaning that the up-front cost to the customer is higher.\n\u201cIt used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,\u201d Mr. Caso said. \u201cNow, to put more features in the phone, it costs money.\u201d\nThere are Apple-specific variables, too. The newest version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating systems, iOS 12, was designed toimprove the performanceof older devices. (This was a refreshing change from previous iOS updates, which tended to grind older models to a halt.) With better water resistance and sturdier screens, iPhones are more physically resilient than they used to be. And the list of must-have new features has shrunk. With a few exceptions \u2014 like Face ID and animated emojis \u2014 there is nothing you can do on a new iPhone that you can\u2019t do on one from several years ago.\nApple has also taken a hit from its battery replacement program, which offered steep discounts to many customers after the company wasaccusedof slowing down older iPhones. That led some users to replace their batteries rather than their entire iPhone.\nAll of this is worrying short-term investors, who want people to buy as many new iPhones as possible. But it\u2019s great for people like my mom, who get to keep phones they\u2019re happy with and replace them less frequently. It\u2019s great for the environment \u2014 according to Apple\u2019slatest sustainability report, each new Apple device produced generates an average of 90 kilograms of carbon emissions.\nA more durable iPhone could even be great for Apple\u2019s long-term profitability. As Brian Barrettpoints outat Wired, \u201cAn iPhone that lasts longer keeps customers in the iOS ecosystem longer,\u201d and more willing to keep their paid subscriptions to Apple Music, iCloud and other Apple services.\nApple\u2019s longer replacement cycle may be a temporary phenomenon, if newer technologies \u2014 such as compatibility with 5G mobile networks, which is expected to arrive in iPhones in 2020 \u2014 lead to popular apps that don\u2019t run on older phones.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an app \u2014 maybe it\u2019s Fortnite 2 \u2014 that I can\u2019t run on my existing iPhone, a new iPhone will be on every teenage boy\u2019s shopping list,\u201d Mr. Caso said.\nBut for now, while investors might be unhappy with the company\u2019s short-term sales, the rest of us should cheer it as a sign of progress in giving customers what they want: sturdy, reliable phones that don\u2019t become obsolete as soon as a new model arrives.\nWhen I asked my mom what would get her to upgrade to a newer iPhone, she said she might do it if a new, killer feature came along, or if her favorite apps no longer worked. But in the end, she admitted that wasn\u2019t likely.\n\u201cUntil I drop it and break it, I\u2019ll probably keep it,\u201d she said."

        "title": "How to Disable FaceTime to Avoid Eavesdropping Bug",
        "fulltext": "Amajor bug in Apple\u2019s FaceTime appsurfaced on Monday that allows anyone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer to eavesdrop on other users without their knowledge. Apple said Monday evening that it was aware of the glitch, was working on a fix and would release it in a software update later this week.\nIn the meantime, Apple hasturned off Group FaceTime, the feature that allowed for surreptitious listening, which should temporarily resolve the issue. But for those who want an extra layer of security, follow these steps to turn off FaceTime on your devices.\nBefore you do anything, you need to make sure your Apple device was affected by the glitch. It exists on iOS devices with the most recent software updates, starting with iOS 12.1, which was released in October. That release introduced the Group FaceTime feature.\nTo check your iOS version, open the \u201cSettings\u201d app, scroll down and select \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then click on \u201cAbout.\u201d In the following list, you\u2019ll see a line titled \u201cVersion\u201d followed by the operating system on your device. It may say 12.1.3, the latest iOS update.\nIf your iOS is 12.1 or newer, such as 12.1.3, your device could be at risk. If it is 12.0 or older, you\u2019re in the clear.\nOn Macs, the Group FaceTime feature was introduced in October, starting with MacOS 10.14.1. Check your MacOS version by selecting the Apple icon in the top left of your screen and clicking on \u201cAbout This Mac.\u201d The latest version is MacOS 10.14.3.\nOn an iOS device, open \u201cSettings\u201d again. Scroll down a bit until you see \u201cFaceTime\u201d and select it. This part is simple: Tap the green button on the top row, which will toggle FaceTime off. The button should turn gray and everything that had been below, such as your app settings, should disappear.\nApple says there\u2019s no need to delete the app on your home screen after following this step, but nothing\u2019s stopping you.\nJust note that if you disable FaceTime, your phone will not receive any kind of FaceTime call, including video, audio or group chat. Regular phone calls won\u2019t be affected.\nTo turn off FaceTime on Macs, open the app, which may be in your dock or in your Applications folder, select \u201cFaceTime\u201d at the top left of the app, and then select \u201cPreferences.\u201d Click on \u201cSign Out.\u201d\nApple said that a software update scheduled for release later this week should resolve the Group FaceTime bug. When it is announced, make sure to update your devices by going to \u201cSettings,\u201d then \u201cGeneral\u201d and selecting \u201cSoftware Update.\u201d On the Mac, download the update by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left of your screen, selecting \u201cSystem Preferences\u201d and clicking on \u201cSoftware Update.\u201d\nAfter that, re-enable the FaceTime app by following Step 2. On iOS devices, toggle the FaceTime button in \u201cSettings\u201d until it turns green again. It may take a bit of time for your old settings and account information to reappear. On a Mac, open the app again and sign back in under \u201cPreferences.\u201d\nAnd if you deleted the app on your iPhone or iPad, you can re-download it through the App Store."

        "title": "The Week in Tech: Amazon\u2019s Burning Problems",
        "fulltext": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m David Streitfeld, reporting from a very quiet week in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalists were at their vacation homes or exotic resorts,dreaming of riches to come. Entrepreneurs also must have taken time off, because I made it to San Jose in less than two hours, a personal record. There wasn\u2019t evena new data privacy scandalto occupy the pundits.\nAmazon, however, never lets up. Chances are, something under your family Christmas tree or at your Hanukkah or Kwanzaa celebration was from the retailer. Perhaps everything was. Amazon\u2019s210th and final press releaseof the year summarized the company\u2019s holiday season: best ever. If history is any guide, more than half those sales were made by third parties \u2014 shops big and small that are in essence renting a stall in the Amazon bazaar.\nWith millions of marketplace sellers battling for a piece of the lucrative Amazon action, competition is fierce. Exactly how tough I didn\u2019t realize until I read a piece called \u201cPrime and Punishment: Dirty Dealing in the $175 Billion Amazon Marketplace,\u201d by Josh Dzieza on the tech site the Verge. Almost as an aside, the article mentions that some unscrupulous sellers were taking an established competitor\u2019s product, setting it on fire and then posting photos saying it exploded. Amazon would go nuts and pull the product as a safety hazard, leaving a clear field for the shady new arrival.\nAnother common move, the article says, is to get a competitor\u2019s product reclassified as a sex toy, suppressing it from ordinary search results. This happened to a seller of childproof locks and outlet covers, whose sales dwindled to zero because absolutely no one was searching for \u201csexual childproof door lock.\u201d\nAt Amazon, the customer reigns supreme, which means sellers who are accused of doing something wrong need to confess to something, anything, even if they are the victim of another seller\u2019s sabotage. It\u2019s so difficult to mount a successful appeal that many merchants hire professional advisers to get them out of Amazon jail.\n(I asked Amazon how often sellers took the arson route. In a statement, the retailer replied, \u201cThere are bad actors who attempt to undermine our store, but they do not reflect the flourishing community of honest entrepreneurs that make up the vast majority of our seller community.\u201d)\nAmazon also turns up in a new story in Wired, which asks:Whatever happened to the Future Book?That is the writer Craig Mod\u2019s term for the immersive, interactive, highly connected thrill ride that would finally kill off the traditional boring physical book by, oh, 2015.\nIt didn\u2019t happen. \u201cMy Kindle Oasis \u2014 one of the most svelte, elegant and expensive digital book containers you can buy in 2018 \u2014 is about as interactive as a potato,\u201d Mr. Mod writes. One possible reason: Amazon had little competition for the Kindle, so innovation in e-readers ground to a halt.\nBoth the Wired and the Verge stories might seem to be about how Amazon is overextended, can\u2019t be all things to all people and needs to do what it already does better rather than keep expanding into new fields. But they\u2019re really about how Amazon wins even when it loses.\nMr. Mod\u2019s point is that while Kindles never killed physical books, there has nevertheless been an explosion of activityaroundthe book. For instance, it is much simpler and much cheaper to publish yourself than it was 20 years ago. There has also been an explosion in recorded books that will only grow as smart speakers in the home become ubiquitous.\nAnd who owns the leading home speaker company, the leading recorded books company and the biggest \u2014 by far \u2014 physical and digital bookstore? You guessed it.\nAs for the Amazon Marketplace sellers who are undermined by bad guys, Amazon has an answer: protection, for a price.\n\u201cWhen sellers get in trouble for customer complaints or attacks from counterfeiters,\u201d Mr. Dzieza writes, \u201cthe solution is often to more fully meld with Amazon \u2014 to enroll in its fulfillment program, to purchaseAmazon\u2019s labelsto make sure product isn\u2019t being diverted or even make their brandexclusiveto Amazon, which brings special protections.\u201d\nA wrinkle about the third-party sellers that the Verge doesn\u2019t tackle is the way Amazon makes them sign what is called a most-favored-nation or M.F.N. clause, which stipulates they cannot sell on another site cheaper than they sell on Amazon. British and German regulators investigated the retailer\u2019s use of these clauses a few years ago, with the result that Amazon dropped the practice in Europe. But they\u2019re still in use in the United States.\nIn May, two law professors detailed the case against the M.F.N. restrictions as harmful to consumers in a Yale Law Journal article,\u201cAntitrust Enforcement Against Platform MFNs.\u201dA few days before Christmas, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut picked up on the issue andwrote a four-page letterto the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that Amazon\u2019s M.F.N. contracts could stifle market competition and artificially inflate prices.\nFor instance, Mr. Blumenthal wrote, a competitor to Amazon might try to gain an edge by charging merchants a smaller commission. If those merchants also sell on Amazon, however, they could not pass along those savings to their customers, because of the M.F.N. clause. That would be bad for consumers while reinforcing Amazon\u2019s dominance. Amazon declined to comment.\n\u25a0 It used to be that only a few cranks criticized Amazon, but that is rapidly shifting. Still, I was surprised at the take-no-prisoners tone of David Heinemeier Hansson, the programmer who writes and tweets as DHH, inan open letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, on Medium.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re currently making bad decisions that you\u2019re going to regret. Maybe even decisions that we as a whole society will come to regret,\u201d DHH wrote. He added that Mr. Bezos still had time to shape his legacy \u201cinto something more than the man who killed retail, extracted the greatest loot from its HQ cities, and who expanded the most monopoly holdings the fastest.\u201d\nDHH wrote his piece in November, but Medium surfaced it in its daily digest just last week. What makes his criticism especially noteworthy is that Mr. Bezos is a shareholder in DHH\u2019s software development company, Basecamp. DHH notes that he and his co-founder have not talked to Mr. Bezos for at least seven years but that \u201cif we get another chance, this would be the most pressing topic.\u201d\n\u25a0 One last new Amazon development, which might be the biggest of all: unionization. Workers at Amazon\u2019s biggest warehouse in Spain begana two-day strikeon Thursday. Warehouse employees on Staten Island are calling for unionization, following the lead of colleagues in Minnesota.Here is a good wrap-upfrom the Guardian. Amazon has successfully stymied unionization efforts since the company began, so this shift is momentous.\n\u25a0 In non-Amazon news, it appears that the answer to the eternal question of whether the world can have too many iPhones is:Quite likely.\n\u25a0 Thanks to Apple\u2019s news, the stock market as I write is again plunging. But there\u2019s a silver lining for tech companies:They are big, and getting bigger, and a recession might only help them against the competition."

        "title": "Apple Says Profits Were Flat, Citing Slump in China",
        "fulltext": "Apple said on Tuesday that profits were flat and revenues were down in its most recent quarter, indicating a difficult road ahead for a company that five months ago became the first American firm to be valued above $1 trillion.\nThe disappointing financial performance had been expected since Jan. 2, when Apple, for the first time in 16 years, revised its forecast for the quarter because of an economic slowdown in China and diminishing demand for new iPhones.\nNow, after years of expansion and record-setting profits, Apple appears to be entering a period of vulnerability. While it has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, the company has not found another product with the global impact of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago. Apple is also uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.\nApple\u2019s stock price is down a third since its peak last summer, and now it is worth less than several of its longtime rivals in the tech industry.\nApple could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration placestariffs on phones made in China\u2014 something President Trump has threatened to do. The bulk of Apple\u2019s products aremade in Chinese factories.\nThere are also new concerns about a security flaw in the iPhone. On Monday, Apple customers said aniPhone user could call someone else who had an iPhoneand listen in on that person\u2019s conversations through the device\u2019s microphone \u2014 even if the recipient did not answer the call. The problem was the result of a bug involving Apple\u2019s FaceTime app. The company promised to have a fix by the end of the week.\nApple\u2019s total revenue for the quarter was $84.3 billion, a 5 percent drop from a year earlier and in line with the revised forecast earlier this month.\nSales of iPhones, following a global trend for smartphones, have been leveling off for several years. Their revenue was $51.98 billion, a 15 percent drop from a year earlier. It\u2019s harder now to offer more specifics on iPhone sales because Apple recently stopped disclosing how many units it sells each quarter.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that sales had slumped largely because current iPhone owners were waiting longer to upgrade their devices, a trend that has continued into the current quarter. He blamed fewer subsidies from wireless carriers, a strengthening United States dollar and cheaper battery upgrades that consumers have used to extend the lives of their old phones.\nApple has attributed some of its issues in China to a trade war with the United States. And there is concern that some Chinese customers are shying away from Apple products out of national pride, particularly since the authorities in the United Statesbrought chargesagainst the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Prosecutors cited a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran.\n\u201cWe did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said this month.\nBut some data suggest Apple faces more fundamental problems with its business in China. Chinese consumersappear to be optingfor less expensive but similar smartphones from Chinese makers, particularly Huawei. Some of Apple\u2019s latest phones top $1,000, far above the typical cost for its Chinese competitors.\nTotal sales in the region that includes China were down 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. Outside China, revenues increased slightly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually seen the economic situation in China continue to deteriorate over the course of the quarter,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. \u201cFrom mid-November onwards, we\u2019ve seen a deceleration of economic activity in China.\u201d\nBut he added that Apple had recovered some business by cutting prices in China for the iPhone XR, the lowest-priced new iPhone, to offset the strengthening dollar. Apple declined to disclose the exact size of the price cut.\nMr. Cook said in a call with financial analysts that he believed the iPhone\u2019s high price had hurt sales in emerging markets, and that Apple had dropped prices in a number of them.\nApple made up for tepid iPhone sales in the quarter with 19 percent revenue growth in other areas. The wearables category, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, led the way with a 33 percent increase to $7.3 billion.\nApple\u2019s earnings per share were $4.18 in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by a penny. Apple\u2019s overall profit was down 0.5 percent to $19.97 billion.\nApple\u2019s struggles appear to be continuing. The company said it expected between $55 billion and $59 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below analysts\u2019 expectations for $59 billion.\nApple\u2019s share price was up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading after its results were announced on Tuesday."

        "fulltext": "Everyone who works atBen & Jerry\u2019sheadquarters in Burlington, Vt., is entitled to three free pints of ice cream for each day of work. At theAmerican Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, employees are treated daily to an elaborate buffet with appropriately white-shoe fare like prime rib, crab cakes and housemade beignets.\nAnd at the offices of thePerkins Eastmanarchitecture firm, with locations on three continents, staff members can enjoy all manner of free snacks \u2014 just as long as they are orange, the color of the company\u2019s logo. In New York, that means a lot ofCheetos, Goldfish and Nacho Cheese Doritos.\nFree food has been a formidable presence in the American workplace since the 1990s, when Bloomberg and tech start-ups likeGooglebegan to put out snacks in hopes of making employees happier or healthier, more productive and less likely to stray far from the task at hand.\nBut today, the practice is almost obligatory, as businesses go to extraordinary lengths to provide food without charge, or at a sharp discount. The offerings have grown in size, scope and specificity \u2014 some tailored to a company\u2019s mission, others unwittingly reflective of it and still others that seem oddly random.\nThe dating appHingeuses edible perks strategically: Employees in its New York office get $200 a month to spend on dates, which often involve food. The company\u2019s founder, Justin McLeod, said his favorite use of the benefit was a cat-themed date that one employee planned.\n\u201cThey started at a cat cafe,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey went to Katz\u2019s and got Reubens, they went to the grocery store and tried to find cat-themed food, and then tried to make cat-shaped stuff on a plate while watching \u2018Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\u2019\u201d\nHinge also gives away nutritious snacks like yogurt and nuts, because Mr. McLeod, 34, sees his company as the health-food version of online dating, providing more information about each potential date than rival apps where users swipe quickly though photos. \u201cWith the fast-food approach, the whole experience feels good in the moment, but not so good in the end,\u201d he said.\nThere are workplaceswhere the food gifts have a competitive feel.Zappos, the online shoe retailer, holds periodic eating contests in its main plaza in Las Vegas. More than 300 employees show up to cheer.\nBig Ass Fans, a fan producer in Lexington, Ky., has a beer refrigerator that is unlocked only if the day\u2019s sales goals have been met. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk through other departments, and they will ask: \u2018How close are we? Are we going to hit it?\u2019\u201d said John Nunnelley, 29, who works in sales.\nFidelity, the financial services company, also dangles food as an incentive. The items aren\u2019t free, but can come with a significant price break, determined by its perceived healthfulness. A grilled Buffalo chicken wrap might be half the price of the breaded and fried version.\nA spokeswoman said the strategy has been successful: Nearly two-thirds of the food items purchased every month are what the company deems healthy, a 140 percent increase since the program was introduced in 2012.\nMany food businessesoffer employees only their own products. Rachel Drori, 36, the founder of the subscription food-delivery companyDaily Harvest, said that filling the office refrigerators with free Daily Harvest smoothies and soups is a convenient way to gauge the popularity of new items.\n\u201cWe just launched a kelp pad thai, and yesterday we didn\u2019t have enough for everybody,\u201d Ms. Drori said. \u201cIt was anarchy.\u201d\nAt Ben & Jerry\u2019s, in addition to three daily pints of ice cream, employees have an on-site gym to work off what they have come to call the \u201cBen 10.\u201d\nAre they bothered that the only choice for satisfying afternoon hunger pangs is a high-calorie dessert, rather than something more nutritious? \u201cNot really,\u201d said Sean Slattery, 28, a social and digital insight analyst who gained those 10 pounds in his first few months at the company. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really expectthat.\u201d\nThe ice cream is available to anyone who wants it, in an unlocked refrigerator governed by the honor system. Still, some workers resist the three-pint temptation.\u201cOnly the newbies take them every day,\u201d said Laura Peterson, a public relations manager.\u201cYou soon learn to space it out a bit.\u201d\nNot every company\u2019s offerings are as goal-oriented.Thrillist, an internet guide to food, travel and entertainment, suppliesunlimited cinnamon-raisin breadto workers in its New York office \u2014 simply because it was put out once, about five years ago, and proved immensely popular. Six toasters are on standby, so no one has to compete for a warm snack.\nThe media companySlateis well-known for the sheer glut of junk foods served in its Brooklyn office; among the most popular are Pop-Tarts and Slim Jims. There is fruit in the pantry, but it \u201cwill stay and rot,\u201d said Jayson De Leon, 27, a senior producer of Slate\u2019s podcasts. \u201cIt\u2019s such a sad depiction of our diets in the office: the apple rotting.\u201d\nStill, he added: \u201cI like a Pop-Tart. I like a Slim Jim. Something salty and something sugary. An apple is not going to help me get through this.\u201d There\u2019s even a special emoji on the company Slack channel that is sent out when the office manager restocks the pantry.\nBox, a file-hosting platform, serves locally made snacks, likeIt\u2019s It ice cream sandwichesin its headquarters in Redwood City, Calif., and beer from the popularJester King Breweryin its Austin office. (Notably missing from the Austin branch is the cult favoritesparkling waterTopo Chico, despite repeated employee requests, said Michelle Mattern, 33, a senior implementations consultant.)\nAirbnbhas what it calls a \u201csimple station\u201d in its San Francisco headquarters with plain, unseasoned meats, grains and vegetables. The company would not explain the starkness of the food, but a spokesman forLinkedIn, which has similar stations in its offices in San Francisco and Sunnyvale, Calif., said it appealed to the many people with dietary restrictions.\nLinkedIn, which doesn\u2019t charge for food even in its cafeterias, also provides several halal-meat options to cater to Muslim employees at its Bay Area campuses. For Eid al-Adha last summer, one cafeteria served a Middle Eastern spread.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I have been at LinkedIn for four years,\u201d said Omar Al-Ghwairi, 34, a senior technical services manager.\nThe prime rib and beignets at the American Enterprise Institute may seem inevitable for a research group that extols the rewards of a free market, but there also less fancy choices like deli meats and eggs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it elaborate,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cI would call it everyday food.\u201d\nRosemary Newsome, 22, a development intern, is thrilled with the spread. \u201cI do kind of joke that now that I have this, I can\u2019t go back to anything less,\u201d she said.\nSome company food policieshave drawn mixed reviews. In July, amedia uproarensued after the shared-workspace company WeWork announced that it wouldno longer serve meatat its offices and events, and wouldn\u2019t let employees expense meals that included red meat, poultry or pork.\nA similar policy proved untenable at Google; after the company tried to establish meatless Mondays at its cafeterias in 2010, employees rebelled by tossing out silverware and holding protest barbecues.\nAmazon, which prides itself on its culture of frugality, doesn\u2019t offer any free food in its Seattle home base. But a spokeswoman said the reason the company has refrained is its desire to encourage workers to patronize local food businesses. The company says it will follow a similar policy at the new campus it plans to build in Long Island City, Queens.\nAt the companies thatdogive freebies, there are countless challenges for the people charged with producing them. Tilak Gurung, 49, who was a chef atDropbox\u2019s San Francisco headquarters from 2012 to 2017, said he wasn\u2019t allowed to repeat the same menu twice.\nMr. Gurung also lamented having to participate in corporate culture. \u201cYou have to write your own reviews about your weaknesses \u2014 the manager writes about me and submits it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am a cook! I have to cook!\u201d He eventually left to start a restaurant, Tilak, in the city.\nCorporate kitchens also have to deal with \u201cskyrocketing\u201d dietary restrictions and highly critical consumers, said Amelia Ekus, 29, a manager for New York and New Jersey at the corporate food supplierGuckenheimer, and formerly a general manager of the cafeteria in Twitter\u2019s New York offices.\n\u201cWith restaurants, people vote with their wallets,\u201d she said. But when the office cafeteria is the only food option, \u201cif they don\u2019t like what you do, they will tell you every day how they think you should get better.\u201d\nStill, Ms. Ekus added, she understands why companies are going all in on food: Compared with other benefits, it\u2019s a small investment, \u201cand the return on the investment is huge,\u201d she said. \u201cYou reduce turnover because you have happier employees. It\u2019s how you stay competitive for a certain sector of companies.\u201d\nThe designer Brunello Cucinellidoesn\u2019t understand all the fuss. He has been feeding his employees in Italy for a nominal fee (currently 3.20 euros) since he foundedhis labelin 1978.\nAt the company\u2019s hilltop headquarters in the ancient hamlet of Solomeo, Italy, the roughly 1,000 employees enjoy a multicourse lunch that might include pasta with tomatoes and basil, and bread topped with fresh mozzarella. They sit at long tables in a high-ceilinged courtyard with sweeping vistas of the city.\nBy taking time for a midday meal, \u201cyou can better focus your thoughts and your life,\u201d Mr. Cucinelli said. \u201cIt makes people more productive.\u201d\nHe recently visited the cafeteria at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \u201cIt was a very nice experience,\u201d he said, from the design of the wooden tables to the freshness of the sushi.\nBut there was one big difference from his lunches in Italy: Most of the employees were on their phones.\nFollowNYT Food on TwitterandNYT Cooking on Instagram,FacebookandPinterest.Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice."

        "title": "5 Reasons You Wouldn\u2019t Want to Be in Tim Cook\u2019s Shoes Right Now",
        "fulltext": "Do not pityTimothy D. Cook. He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apple\u2019s chief executive. He is regarded as one of business\u2019s best bosses, and runs a company with a beloved brand and $130 billion in cash.\nEven so, he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple\u2019s corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons:\nThe signature innovation of Apple\u2019s late co-founder, Mr. Jobs, was the iPhone. Mr. Cook\u2019s has beenhis ability to crack the Chinese market. That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass $1 trillion in market valueby August last year.\nBut now it might be backfiring. The Chinese economy is sputtering, and the trade war between the United States and China isn\u2019t getting much better. With most adults \u2014 even children \u2014 in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones, Apple has relied on China to keep growing.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cook announceda potential drop of 25 percent in salesin China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests thatChinese consumers are following a trendin other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apple\u2019s competitors.\nApple\u2019s share price dropped nearly 10 percent on Thursday, but bounced back about 4 percent on Friday.\nPeople aren\u2019t buying iPhones the way they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors.\nThe problem is, many people aren\u2019t.\nMr. Cook said this week that customers were waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fueled that trend when itcut the price of battery swapsto $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.\nThat presents a dilemma for Mr. Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apple\u2019s business.\nBut the ugly truth might be: Longer-lasting iPhones are bad for business.\nApple\u2019s sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of history\u2019s most popular products. And Mr. Cook, who was Apple\u2019s operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.\nBut it soon might be in the cross hairs of President Trump. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China \u2014 and Mr. Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying he\u2019d force it to start making its products closer to home. While president,he has said Apple plans\u201cto build a lot of plants\u201d in the United States \u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t announced plans to do so. (Mr. Cook hasn\u2019t publicly corrected him.)\nWhile Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Mr. Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China\u2019s scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world\u2019s most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.\nCozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple\u2019s employees in liberal Silicon Valley \u2014 even some of its customers. So far,Mr. Cook has walked a fine line, holding cordial private meetings with Mr. Trump while alsopublicly criticizing his policies, without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employees.\nOn Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United States.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget this: Apple makes their product in China,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot: \u2018Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.\u2019\u201d\nHe went on to say China, not the United States, gets the biggest benefit from Apple. \u201cThey build their product mostly in China.\u201d\nTwo months ago, Mr. Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apple\u2019s earnings call: The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sold. \u201cThe number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,\u201d he reasoned.\nApple had reported the metric for years, highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales. But those sales have leveled off over the last two quarters. In an earnings call at the end of January, Mr. Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing. How much? That will be up to people outside the company to figure out.\nInvestors were displeased \u2014 even before the surprise news about sales in China. Apple\u2019s shares have since dropped more than 30 percent, shaving $380 billion off its market value. The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than longtime rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.\nMr. Jobs presided over a historic run of innovation in his second tour at Apple, from the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. In his seven years as chief executive, Mr. Cook has announced the Apple Watch and AirPods, which have done well but have been far from iPhone-like industry changers.\nSo what\u2019s next? That is Mr. Cook\u2019s biggest challenge.\nApple has been working on artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology \u2014 but most industry insiders believe it is way behind competitors like Alphabet. Then there is the world of digital health, where Apple would face intense regulations and bureaucracy.\nOr maybe Apple will try to build glasses that overlay a digital interface on what people see. That technology, called augmented reality, faces enormous technical hurdles \u2014 as well as the challenge of getting people to wear a computer on their face. Think of a (hopefully) stylish version of Google\u2019s oft-mocked Google Glass.\nWhatever he does, Mr. Cook faces enormous expectations. It takes a lot to fuel growth at a company that had $265.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.\nThe Apple Watch dominates the market for wearable technology and would be a smash hit for any other company. For Apple? Watches have been counted in the \u201cother products\u201d category in financial results."
