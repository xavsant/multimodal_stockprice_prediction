        "title": "The Week in Tech: Algorithmic Bias Is Bad. Uncovering It Is Good.",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nI\u2019m about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it\u2019s good that we keep discovering biased algorithms?\nLet\u2019s rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias.\nFirst, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple\u2019s new credit cardmay give higher limits to menthan to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were \u201cbased on a customer\u2019s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.\u201d\nAnd my colleague Cade Metzreportedthat artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word \u201chers\u201d as a pronoun, but correctly identified \u201chis.\u201d Other, similar algorithms \u201cgenerally don\u2019t give women enough credit\u201d when analyzing text, he added.\nThis isn\u2019t surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased \u2014 and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences.\n\u201cWhat algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror,\u201d Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. \u201cThey reflect the inequalities of our society.\u201d\nThat we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively.\nThe problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. \u201cHow many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?\u201d Professor Wachter asked. \u201cI often don\u2019t know that I\u2019m being treated unfairly.\u201d\nIn that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it\u2019s more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem.\nNot that that\u2019s easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It\u2019s a slog, but it is happening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to assume that we\u2019ll ever have a neutral system,\u201d Professor Wachter said. \u201cBut with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases.\u201d\nWith that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech\u2019s push into personal finance.\nGoogle announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a \u201csmart checking\u201d account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers \u201cbenefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,\u201d via its Pay app.\nAlso, Facebook unveileda digital payment system, called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That\u2019s alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra.\nThis is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it.\nRegulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they wouldinvestigatethe potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides becausepeople don\u2019t trust it. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google\u2019s banking effort to CNBC: \u201cThere ought to be very strict scrutiny.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There\u2019s a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it\u2019s a high bar.\nNews surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company\u2019s patients \u2014 50 million in total \u2014 to beuploaded to Google\u2019s cloud-computing platform. Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded.\nAscension said it was exploring \u201cmachine-learning applicationsthat will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality\u201d through the deal. Google said it would provide \u201ctools that Ascension could useto support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.\u201d\nThis may all be totally O.K. It\u2019s perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients\u2019 medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plansto seek more informationabout whether it complies with the law anyway.\nNonetheless, many people found it unnerving. That\u2019s probably because of Google\u2019s motivations:According to The Wall Street Journal, Google hasn\u2019t charged Ascension for the work because it hopes to develop systems based on what it learns. It would eventually sell those systems to other health care providers.\nAgain, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But it comes off as a little tone deaf to slurp up data as intimate as health care records without informing patients, at a time when data privacy concerns are more heightened than ever.\nApple plans to sell an augmented-reality headset by 2022and augmented-reality glasses in 2023, according toa report by The Information.\nMicrosoft willhonor California\u2019s new privacy lawacross the United States.It means all of its American users should enjoy the rules, meant to protect consumer data, after Jan. 1.\nJuul plans tocut $1 billion in costsnext year, including the elimination of 650 jobs, as the e-cigarette maker struggles against regulatory and public concern about the risks of vaping.\nUber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi,drew backlashby calling the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a \u201cmistake\u201d by the Saudi government. He quickly backtracked.\nTesla plans to build its first European car factorynear Berlin.It will also set up an engineering and design center in the area.\nIntel fixed a security flaw that it first said had been repaired six months ago,and still hasn\u2019t totally fixed the issue in its chips.

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Toughest Opponent Says She\u2019s Just Getting Started",
        "fulltext": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Margrethe Vestager spent the past five years developing a well-earned reputation as the world\u2019s top tech industry watchdog. From her perchoverseeing Europe\u2019s competitionrules, she fined Google more than $9 billion for breaking antitrust laws, and forced Apple to pay about $14.5 billion for dodging taxes.\nNow she says that work, which made her ahero among tech critics, did not go far enough. The biggest tech companies continue to test the limits of antitrust laws, behave unethically and push back against government intervention, she said.\nBut she said the public\u2019s growing skepticism about technology has given her an opportunity for a tougher approach.\n\u201cIn the last five years,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an extended interview, \u201csome of the darker sides of digital technologies have become visible.\u201d\nSo Ms. Vestager, a 51-year-old former Danish lawmaker, is doubling down. She has signed on for a rare second five-year term as the head of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust division, and assumedexpanded responsibility over digital policyacross the 28-nation bloc.\nWith the new power, she has outlined anagendathat squarely targets the tech giants. She\u2019s weighing whether to remove some protections that shield large internet platforms from liability for content posted by users. She is also working on policies to make companies pay more taxes in Europe and investigating how the companies use data to box out competitors.\nMs. Vestager has pledged to create the world\u2019s first regulations around artificial intelligence and called for giving collective bargaining rights to so-called gig economy workers like Uber drivers. The push comes on top of an investigation intoAmazon\u2019s use of datato gain an edge on competitors that had already started, and her look into accusations of unfair business practices by Facebook and Apple.\n\u201cShe has these accomplishments, but she didn\u2019t get as much as she wanted,\u201d said David Balto, a former lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division whose clients now include large tech companies. \u201cNow she can be more aggressive.\u201d\nBut Ms. Vestager\u2019s agenda amounts to a wish list. Her success will depend on support and collaboration from other European officials who are already grappling with challenges like Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, the rise of populism and fraying diplomatic relations with the United States.\nIt will require standing up to relentless resistance from the tech companies, too.\n\u201cOne of the important things is, of course, to prioritize because otherwise you will be in the process of back and forth for a very, very long time,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\nIn person, Ms. Vestager\u2019s manner defies her tough enforcer reputation. She is unfailingly polite, meeting guests by offering tea and apologizing for a lingering cold.(She assured everyone that she had just washed her hands.)\nShe is a challenging interview subject, prone to filibuster and rarely veering from oft-repeated talking points. A skilled politician, she projects modesty while not exactly turning away from the spotlight.A sign in the hallway outside her office says, in Danish, \u201cVestager Street.\u201d\nShe is also fast to shrug off criticism, including by numerous tech executives and President Trump, that she has been unfair to American tech companies.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called thepenalty against his company in 2016 for skirting Irish taxes\u201ctotal political crap.\u201dGoogle is appealing her three decisions against thecompany.\n\u201cShe hates the United States,\u201d President Trump said in atelevision interview in June, \u201cperhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nMs. Vestager feigns to hardly remember the president\u2019s comment. \u201cSince I know the very good relationship I have with the United States, thenhemust only meet people who really like the States if I am the one who likes you the least,\u201d she said.\nIf anything, American authorities are coming around to share her tech skepticism. Federal, state and congressional investigators arescrutinizing the tech industryover unfair business practices. Ms. Vestager said she saw opportunities to collaborate, but was waiting to see how the inquiries unfolded.\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s very interesting to see what will come of it,\u201d she said.\nAs the United States begins to investigate Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, some American officials are trying to learn lessons from Europe\u2019s efforts. The investigations of Google and otherstook years to complete, giving the companies extra time to solidify their dominance. And once the inquiries were completed, critics said, the penalties focused on large fines that the companies could easily afford, rather than enforcing structural changes that would restore competition.\nLuther Lowe, the head of public policy at Yelp, the reviews website that has been a frequent critic of Google\u2019s behavior, praised Ms. Vestager\u2019s efforts. But he said companies like Yelp \u201chave to date still not seen a shred of practical relief, despite having prevailed in concept.\u201d\nMs. Vestager needs to use all powers at her disposal, he said, \u201cor be granted new ones.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said some of the criticism was valid. She is taking steps to speed up investigations and is applying a rarely used rule known as\u201cinterim measures,\u201dthat acts as a cease-and-desist order for companies to stop acting a certain way while an investigation can be conducted.\nShe will play a leading role in the European Union\u2019s debate overa new Digital Services Act, which could bring sweeping reforms to how the internet operates, including forcing online platforms to remove illegal content or risk fines and other penalties. Facebook, she said, must be quicker to stop the spread of false and misleading information, violent material and hate speech.\n\u201cYou have to take it down because it spreads like a virus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s not fast enough, of course, eventually we will have to regulate this.\u201d\nAnd she remains focused on whether the largest technology companies squeezed out businesses that rely on them to reach customers. Amazon is under investigation for mistreating third-party sellers that offer products similar to what it sells. Apple is being questioned over accusations that it uses the App Store to harm rivals such as Spotify.\n\u201cSome of these platforms, they have the role both as player and referee, and how can that be fair?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou would never accept a football match where the one team was also being the referee.\u201d\nIn Europe, a broader debate is underway about a lack of homegrown tech giants. President Emmanuel Macron of France, for instance, has called for more government support of European companies. Ursula von der Leyen, the new head of the European Commission, who appointed Ms. Vestager, has called for Europe to achieve \u201ctechnological sovereignty.\u201d\nThe companies facing Ms. Vestager\u2019s scrutiny are warning about taking regulation too far.\nChristian Borggreen, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association in Brussels, a trade group representing Apple, Google and other companies, warned that new laws could put Europe at a disadvantage.\n\u201cWe hope future E.U. legislation will be evidence-based and never become an excuse for protectionism,\u201d he said.\nMs. Vestager has said that European companies must compete on their merits.\n\u201cOne of the main reasons that U.S. tech companies are popular in Europe is that their products are good,\u201d she said. Her job, she added, has been to step in when companies \u201ccut corners.\u201d\nMs. Vestager said Europe had a different view of technology than the wide-open policies of the United States and government control of China. Europe, she said, must forge its own approach.\n\u201cMarket forces are more than welcome, but we do not leave it to market forces to have the final say,\u201d she said. \u201cMarkets are not perfect.\u201d"

        "title": "With a Laser, Researchers Say They Can Hack Alexa, Google Home or Siri",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since voice-controlled digital assistants were introduced a few years ago, security experts have fretted that systems like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa were a privacy threat and could be easily hacked.\nBut the risk presented by a cleverly pointed light was probably not on anyone\u2019s radar.\nResearchers in Japan and at the University of Michigan said Monday that they had found a way to take over Google Home, Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri devices from hundreds of feet away by shining laser pointers, and even flashlights, at the devices\u2019 microphones.\nIn one case, they said, they opened a garage door by shining a laser beam at a voice assistant that was connected to it. They also climbed 140 feet to the top of a bell tower at the University of Michigan and successfully controlled a Google Home device on the fourth floor of an office building 230 feet away. And by focusing their lasers using a telephoto lens, they said, they were able to hijack a voice assistant more than 350 feet away.\nOpening the garage door was easy, the researchers said. With the light commands, the researchers could have hijacked any digital smart systems attached to the voice-controlled assistants.\nThey said they could have easily switched light switches on and off, made online purchases or opened a front door protected by a smart lock. They even could have remotely unlocked or started a car that was connected to the device.\n\u201cThis opens up an entirely new class of vulnerabilities,\u201d said Kevin Fu, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know how many products are affected, because this is so basic.\u201d\nThe computer science and electrical engineering researchers \u2014 Takeshi Sugawara at the University of Electro-Communications in Japan and Mr. Fu, Daniel Genkin, Sara Rampazzi and Benjamin Cyr at the University of Michigan \u2014 released theirfindings in a paper on Monday.\nMr. Genkin was also one of the researchers responsible for discovering two major security flaws,known as Meltdown and Spectre, in the microprocessors inside nearly all the world\u2019s computers last year. Shares of the chip-maker Intel briefly dropped 5 percent onnews of their discovery.\nThe researchers, who studied the light flaw for seven months, said they had discovered that the microphones in the devices would respond to light as if it were sound. Inside each microphone is a small plate called a diaphragm that moves when sound hits it.\nThat movement can be replicated by focusing a laser or a flashlight at the diaphragm, which converts it into electric signals, they said. The rest of the system then responds the way it would to sound.\nThe researchers said they had notified Tesla, Ford, Amazon, Apple and Google to the light vulnerability. The companies all said they were studying the conclusions in the paper released on Monday.\nThe researchers said most microphones would need to be redesigned to remedy the problem. And simply covering the microphone with a piece of tape wouldn\u2019t solve it. Mr. Fu said the microphones on several digital assistants had dirt shields that didn\u2019t block their commands.\nSecurity researchers have a long history of revealing stunning vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices. Experts have often cautioned that while those weaknesses can be surprising, they are often worst-case scenarios that can be exploited only in the rarest circumstances. And there is no clear indication that the light vulnerability detailed on Monday has been used by hackers.\nThis is not the first discovery of a surprising vulnerability in digital assistants. Researchers in China and the United States have demonstrated that they cansend hidden commandsthat are undetectable to the human ear.\nWith a tsunami of internet-connected devices coming onto the market, however, the researchers said the discovery was a reminder to consumers to remain vigilant about security.\n\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Mr. Fu said. \u201cThere is this wide gap between what computers are supposed to do and what they actually do. With the internet of things, they can do unadvertised behaviors, and this is just one example.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokeswoman said that the company had not heard of anyone other than the researchers using the light-command hack, and that its digital assistant customers could rely on a few easy safety measures. For one, they can set up voice PINs for Alexa shopping or other sensitive smart-home requests. They can also use the mute button to disconnect power to the microphones.\nThere is also a common-sense solution to the light vulnerability: If you have a voice assistant in your home, keep it out of the line of sight from outside, Mr. Genkin said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give it access to anything you don\u2019t want someone else to access,\u201d he added."

        "title": "The Great Streaming Space-Time Warp Is Coming",
        "fulltext": "This may be TV\u2019s biggest fall ever. It could also be its last.\nBy \u201cbiggest,\u201d I mean as measured by volume. In addition to the usual slate of broadcast premieres \u2014 still operating on a back-to-school schedule like half a century ago \u2014 and the cable premieres, and the Netflix season drops, two entire new streaming services from Apple and Disneyarrivethis month with full payloads of new series.\nAnd by \u201clast,\u201d I mean it may be the final curtain for \u201cfall TV\u201d as a concept and a landmark. The more that streaming becomes the default way people watch, the less that the concepts of time on which TV has operated \u2014 seasons, schedules, time slots \u2014 will matter. And with those customs will change the very culture of America\u2019s essential medium, even if we can\u2019t yet know exactly how.\nSo many of the ways that we\u2019re used to experiencing TV are artifacts of technology and business. September became TV\u2019s New Year because that was when thenew car modelscame out. TV episodes developed their multi-act structure to make room for commercials. Weekly schedules were set because you had to broadcast shows to everyone at once (a practice we may someday look back upon as a medieval ritual, like baking your bread in the village communal oven).\nThis television system has changed gradually \u2014 cable channels began premiering their marquee shows year-round, for instance \u2014 but in general, it has repeated its orbital cycle, like planets revolving around the sun, since the mid 20th-century.\nNow, heading straight toward this solar system are two giant Death Stars made of money. (Actually, since the Death Star is now the exclusive intellectual property of Disney, maybe you should think of them as two asteroids, one wearing mouse ears.)\nDisney and Apple\u2019s original series are only a tiny chunk of the cosmic shower about to rain down. There\u2019s also the archival content, particularly onDisney Plus, which will have the company\u2019s Scrooge McDuck vault of movies, the Marvel and Star Wars libraries and much more. There are the other streaming services arriving in 2020, fromWarnerMediaand NBC Universal, who\u2019ve divvied up Harry Potter and Big Bird and Michael Scott like teams choosing sides for kickball.\nIn a way, all the syndication and rerun deals may matter more to the new TV universe than the new series. Certainly theprice tag for \u201cFriends\u201dsuggests that. One of the biggest time-warping effects of the arrival of streaming, after all, is that TV\u2019s past is more immediately and conveniently present than it ever used to be. (At least, unless a given show has no deal with a streaming service, in which case it might as well never have existed.)\nThe effect of streaming on the culture of TV watching is almost science-fiction-like: Audiences suddenly exist at every point in TV history and no particular moment in TV time. The entire run of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is as readily accessible as the new season of \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d A departed series can become as zeitgeisty as a brand-new one: See the proliferation ofGIFs from \u201cThe Office\u201don social media.\nTo a TV critic \u2014 that is, someone who believes that television is the nervous system through which our culture sends signals to itself \u2014 this is all exciting and unnerving. On the one hand, there will be more of everything: more old TV, more new TV, more opportunities, at least theoretically, for representation and risk-taking.\nOn the other hand, big money can be risk-averse. The same economic forces that have turned the movie season into a battle of the franchises may drive streamers to focus on bringing us new versions of old things we\u2019ve already proven we like: \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel series on Disney Plus, DC Comics brand extensions on Warner\u2019s HBO Max. If no content ever truly dies in the streaming era, it may also bring us the curse of eternal life: a few immortal megabrands keeping a lock on the culture at the expense of new voices and ideas.\nIt\u2019s not as if giving the people what they want is a new concept in TV, of course. What\u2019s changing is the means of giving it to them. On the one hand, massive corporations are tying their streaming platforms to their billion-dollar intellectual-property holdings; on the other, the granular viewer data available to streaming algorithms makes them more efficient at serving up good-enough versions of things you loved.\nTV may be overrun, not by bad content, but by unexciting competence.\nEven if you take the optimistic view, that artists will always find space somewhere to innovate, the discussion around their work will inevitably change. The same-time-next-week TV schedule made the \u201cDid you see it last night?\u201d conversation possible. But on streaming, where you can binge a show in a weekend or sample it over a month, it\u2019s always last night somewhere.\nStreaming could have the effect of making TV both more ubiquitous and more submerged in the culture. The show that \u201ceveryone\u201d talks about on Monday morning will be replaced by shows that different sectors of the audience start humming about days or weeks after they\u2019re released. (Even the Disney and Apple series that follow a weekly release schedule won\u2019t be tied to particular time slots.)\nThis kind of experience is nothing new in other art forms, of course; it\u2019s how we\u2019re used to talking about books. But TV\u2019s simultaneous audience of tens of millions, all seeing the same thing at the same time, was what made it a mass, communal phenomenon.\nIn one sense, as some have argued, streamers like Netflix represent areturn of the monoculturethat TV was in its earliest days: they\u2019re widely available, they carry a big-tent variety of programming and they\u2019re capable of drawing big (if unverifiable) audiences.\nBut they\u2019re also the ultimate expression of fragmented culture. Not only do viewers not watch streaming shows at the same time, not only do they choose different shows from the vast libraries, but the services\u2019 data-hungry algorithms serve them each up different menu choices, evendifferent title-screen imagesfor the same shows. Millions of us watch Netflix, yes, but in a way we all watch millions of different, bespoke Netflixes. Streaming has made TV simultaneously bigger and smaller than ever.\nThe new, dispersed dialogue around TV could be worse or it could be better. It might mean, for instance, more opportunities for great shows to develop organic buzz, the way, say, Netflix series like\u201cUnbelievable\u201dand\u201cI Think You Should Leave\u201dpercolated on social media. But either way, one of the last remaining mass-culture experiences we have will dissipate that much more \u2014 especially since so much of it will now live behind the tollgates of monthly subscription services.\nTo some extent, the way streaming changes TV culture will depend on individual consumers\u2019 watching and spending decisions. Maybe the future will divide us into Disney households and Amazon households and Apple households, like religious sects that share a country but each maintain their own customs and mythologies.\nOr maybe most of us will sign up for everything and get our new, inexhaustible 21st-century entertainments from a few megabusinesses, kind of like we did in the 20th century. We could even come up with a fancy name for them, like \u201cnetworks.\u201d\nThis is one more theory of the unknown quantum universe we about to enter: Even as it expands, it could also contract."

        "title": "The Apple Watch Series 5. A Love or Hate Relationship.",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014Applecame crashing into the smartwatch marketin 2015with its unambiguously named \u201cWatch.\u201d\nDesigned by Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of design at the time, and the industrial designer Marc Newson, it received mixed reviews. Techies loved it, as did younger buyers, many of whom were introduced to the whole idea of wristwatches by it. But watch critics largely wrote it off, saying it was not a watch, but a computer.\nThe Series 5 landed this fall. Has Apple finally cracked it, or is the latest just more of the same?\nHere, two watch critics exchange their views. Robin Swithinbank has been writing about watches for The Times\u2019s international edition for the past four years. Timothy Barber is a freelance watch journalist, contributing to newspapers and magazines in Britain and other countries.\nThe conversation has been edited and condensed.\nROBIN SWITHINBANK: You and I have discussed Apple Watch a lot over the years, and, if I may, while you\u2019ve resisted its empty stare and broad un-watchiness, I\u2019ve fallen in with the cult.\nI\u2019ll admit Series 1 to 4 had major drawbacks, notably that they did a horrible job of being a watch, but as always with Apple, they energized the category. Now, with the always-on functionality, I\u2019m prostrate at the altar. All hail Series 5.\nTIMOTHY BARBER: Well, yes, at least it doesn\u2019t blink anymore. With the first Apple Watch, once I\u2019d got past marveling at its exotic, cornerless beauty \u2014 so sleek! so Marc Newson! \u2014 and at the sheer ingenuity involved, it was the incessant, slow-footed blinking on and off that accompanied my wrist movements that I found infuriating.\nR.S.: Perfectly put. The launch $10,000 Edition was also a massive misstep, and woefully mistimed given the seismic consumer shift towards responsible consumption and sustainability. Maybe they got unlucky there, but surely all those consultancy fees should have bought the sense that nothing could be right about a watch of that value that would be outmoded in a year?\nT.B.: Absolutely, but there was more to it than that for me, and I\u2019ll admit it comes down to proud and finely considered snobbery.\nThe beautiful Newson-designed objet has, in its ubiquity, become plain and neutered. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad taste, it\u2019s just no taste \u2014 unlike a traditional watch, it expresses nothing of its wearer, other than that the wearer has nothing to express. There\u2019s something about allowing it onto your wrist, in place of a \u201creal\u201d watch, that is at the very least a failure of ambition.\nThe watchmaking great Dr. George Daniels said that a watch should be \u201chistorical, technical, intellectual, aesthetic, amusing and useful.\u201d I\u2019m not saying the Apple Watch should be judged on such enlightened terms, but I\u2019d still rather plump for something that can be.\nR.S.: If you\u2019re going to trouble yourself with intellectualizing your wristwatch, consider this then: Apple\u2019s rapidly advancing health apps, irritating though their incessant notifications may be, are changing the way we behave.\nMaybe entering my 40s is the root here, but suddenly I\u2019m a little more receptive to being told to end a period of sustained inertia. Every decade older, more and more consumers are looking at Apple Watch and saying, \u201cThat could save my life\u201d \u2014 or at least add years to it. There are examples of Apple\u2019s fall detection technology doing that in real time. Swiss watch execs from brands in the below-$1,500 price bracket are terrified of it for this reason: Do I want a preppy Tissot, or a guardian angel?\nAnd the stats don\u2019t lie. Analysts have said this year Applewill sell more unitsthan the entire Swiss watch industry. From zero to 100. IN. FOUR. YEARS.\nT.B.: I\u2019m not arguing with that. The health and activity apps are undoubtedly the area where the watch comes into its own compared to anything traditional, but it\u2019s also where it ceases to be a watch at all. If I only needed it for the gym, there\u2019s no shortage of cheaper devices.\nAs with everything Apple does, the health apps are wonderfully designed and insidiously guilt-inducing, and the ability to carry out an ad hoc ECG trace is both remarkable and utterly terrifying.\nR.S.: O.K., so I\u2019ve no rebuttal to the vagaries of whether it\u2019s a watch or not, because for me that\u2019s a nonissue. My Apple Watch and my mechanicals are only exclusive products in the sense I don\u2019t wear them at the same time, although we\u2019ve all seen it done.\nA mechanical watch is a superior style statement, no question. But really that\u2019s just sartorial semantics. Strip it back, and like any watch the Apple Watch is a tool \u2014 and an exceptional one at that. I miss its functionality when I switch. Whether it\u2019s a credit card, a kitchen timer, a remote control for a podcast I\u2019m listening to or simply a smartphone vortex bypass, it\u2019s always offering me something. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say that because it\u2019s not a content-first device, it\u2019s a conduit for a smartphone detox. Who doesn\u2019t need that?\nT.B.: Oh, it certainly has its uses, and these can be seductive. Being able to operate whatever I\u2019m listening to via my watch, and to make calls on the move without touching my phone, have been truly refreshing for me.\nBut much of the Apple Watch\u2019s bolt-on functionality seems like pure froth. Ultimately, it\u2019s made me miss the distinctiveness of my \u201cproper\u201d watches more than it\u2019s made me rely on its usefulness. The choice I make each day over which watch to wear can hardly be replaced by the choice of which Apple strap to put on, even though I might yearn to put the ever-growing strap range on traditional watches.\nR.S.: Interesting you mention straps. Four years ago, you wouldn\u2019t have found a top-level luxury Swiss watch brand anywhere near a quick-change strap system (think of the after-sales hit!), and yet Vacheron Constantin and Cartier have now delivered their own solutions.\nThe grandes dames of watchmaking have a point in saying Apple Watch is no threat to their business \u2014 no one buys an Apple Watch instead of a $50,000 grande complication \u2014 but they saw what Apple had done and realized they needed to up their game.\nWhether it\u2019s stealing market share, or feeding it ideas, Apple has shaken the luxury watch industry out of a slumber at every level. Kool-Aid or no, I\u2019m in awe of that.\nT.B.: I think you\u2019re over-crediting Apple for the Swiss upping their strap game \u2014 it was happening anyway.\nEither way, I just feel bullied by the Apple Watch. Its ultimate, unquestionable aim is to make me its dependant \u2014 it claims to aid my autonomy, but I think it just wants to defeat it. It shudders and winks when I\u2019m not paying it enough attention, guilting me, challenging me and asking me to set endless goals, like a boorish life coach I didn\u2019t ask for. It even has an app, supposedly to help me relax, that tells me how and when to breathe, with a soft, cloudy blob that grows and fades on the screen to breathe along to.\nHanding my timekeeping and my diary over to a computer is one thing; asking it to breathe for me is quite another. I do so much more easily, as it turns out, when I take the thing off."

        "title": "Steve Jobs Was Right: Smartphones and Tablets Killed the P.C.",
        "fulltext": "I got an iPad Pro recently, and I\u2019ve fallen madly in love with it.\nThis was unexpected. I\u2019ve had iPads before, but like a lot of people, I hadn\u2019t found them to be very useful. Tablets were good for surfing the Web and watching Netflix, but they\u2019ve always been dogged by the charge thatyou couldn\u2019t get a lot of work done on them.\nApple\u2019s latest iPads are different. Not only can you get work done on them; in many ways they\u2019re productivity dream machines. Today\u2019s iPads are powered by custom-designedprocessors that are fasterthan the chips on some of the Macs Apple makes, and the iPad\u2019s separately sold keyboard is better and more durable than theaccursed, falling-apart messof a keyboard that Apple is shipping on itsmuch-malignedcurrent line of laptops.\nApple unveiled anew 16-inch MacBook with a revamped keyboardon Wednesday, good news for the many Apple lovers who\u2019ve beengrumblingabout the company\u2019s lackluster slate of recent Macs. But I think the iPad is already beginning to eclipse the traditional personal computer. In the four months I\u2019ve had this latest model, the iPad Pro has eaten into the time I spend on my phone and my old-school laptop and desktop. Among other things, I now research and write just about every column using an iPad (I still compose many first draftsby speakinginto my headphones, but I\u2019m an odd duck).\nI thought I hadgotten out of the gadget-reviewing businessfor good last year. Since the smartphone had gobbled up everything from cameras to music players to portable gaming systems, Ideclaredthe whole field of gadgetry dead. But just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.\nThe history of the iPad is a story about consolidation, focus and the power of scale in the tech business. It\u2019s a story about how thoroughly one company, Apple, has dominated the entire hardware business this decade. And it is also, really, a story about the only thing that mattered in tech in the 2010s \u2014 the smartphone \u2014 and the way that one device became the gravitational center of the entire tech business, shaping every market in the industry, and much of the non-tech world beyond it.\nThe iPad has always been freighted with great expectations. Although the iPad was unveiled in 2010, three years after the iPhone,development of the iPad predateddevelopment of the phone, and Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, always seemed to have his heart in the tablet.\nIn one of his last interviews before his death in 2011, Jobs declared the iPad to be the future of computing. \u201cPCs are going to be like trucks,\u201dhe toldthe journalists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg \u2014 meaning the traditional Mac and Windows machines would still be around, but like big rigs, they\u2019d be used by a small set of power users for a dwindling set of specific, high-power tasks. The \u201ccars\u201d of the tech industry, as Jobs saw it, would be phones and tablets.\nFor a while, he was only partially right. The iPad sold well at launch, but after a few years it hit some hurdles. After Jobs\u2019s death, Appleleft the iPad to languish, anddid something similar with the Mac.\nMeanwhile, something amazing happened with the iPhone and the many Android-based copycat phones it inspired. In the 2010s, smartphones became more popular, more powerful and more profitable than anyone in the tech industry thought possible. Within a few years,their salesandusageeclipsed that of PCs, and for much of the decade they were the fountain of most new consumer innovations across the technology industry. Smartphones made Uber and Instagram and Snapchat and TikTok possible. Smartphone cameras began tosurpass stand-alone cameras, turning much of culture and society into a meme-soaked playgroundwhere visual media matters more than text.\nThe smartphone also altered the business dynamics of the tech industry. When the iPhone came out, Apple was just one of many successful hardware companies in the world. But the smartphone decimated a host of phone brands (remember Nokia? Motorola?), and as smartphones gained more power, they began making life impossible for a slate of hardware start-ups, from GoPro to Jawbone.\nOn the strength of the iPhone, Apple began capturing a greater and greater slice of the tech hardware business; although it didn\u2019t sell a majority of units, its commitment to the high end of the market allowed it to make the bulk of profits.In the last quarter of 2017,according to one estimate, Apple made86 percent of profits in the smartphone industry.\nApple\u2019s dominance came despite the fact that the company made some big mistakes and was late to many big innovations. Samsung, not Apple, invented huge-screen phones. Apple\u2019s Mac line was plagued by delays and dead ends, including a 2013 redesign of the Mac Pro thatlooked like a trash can and proved just as useful. And on the iPad, for many years, Apple just seemed to fall asleep. The iPad\u2019s stylus and keyboard-forward design? Microsoft did it first on the Surface.\nYet none of this mattered. Because of its hold on the smartphone business and a very sticky software ecosystem that users found hard to leave, Apple has been able to incorporate many innovations pioneered elsewhere and sell its customers on a series of peripheral billion-dollar businesses, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nAnd ultimately, it\u2019s the ecosystem that explains why I can\u2019t stop raving about the iPad. When it came out, the big knock on the iPad was that it was just a big phone; today, that\u2019s what I love about it \u2014 like the Watch or AirPods, the iPad feels intuitive and natural to me because it works just like the device I use most often, my phone.\nLike a phone, in most scenarios I find the iPad to be faster, more portable and easier to use and maintain than any traditional P.C. I\u2019ve ever owned. The iPad\u2019s limited screen space and emphasis on full-screen apps also makes for fewer distractions than on a traditional personal computer. The iPad, like my phone, lets me log in to my bank using my face; the Mac, in 2019, doesn\u2019t even have a touch screen.\nThe iPad still can\u2019t do everything a laptop can, and I still have to log in to a \u201creal\u201d computer sometimes. I had a long chat recently with Dan Seifert, the deputy editor of the Verge, who uses an iPad every day on the subway but often finds the device infuriating.\n\u201cFor someone like me, who\u2019s been using a desktop operating system for a long time, there\u2019s a lot of built-in conventions that I\u2019m used to that can be frustrating,\u201d Seifert said. In particular, the iPad doesn\u2019t work with antiquated work flows that are built for PCs. Say you need to log into your company\u2019s bespoke publishing system or expense program? It\u2019s possible those won\u2019t work on your iPad \u2014 at least not yet \u2014\u00a0because they were built for much older devices.\nBut Seifert agreed with me that many of these uses are a special case. He still uses P.C.s because often, in Jobs\u2019s parlance, he needs a truck. Most people, however, don\u2019t need trucks, and few of us will need them in the future. Seifert isn\u2019t teaching his kids how to use desktop operating systems like the Mac or Windows, and neither am I.\nIt took longer than he expected, but Steve Jobs was right. Over the past decade, for most people, in most use cases, phones killed the P.C. To get work done, now you just use a big phone \u2014 which Apple happens to call an iPad.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "Don\u2019t Blame Tech Bros for the Housing Crisis",
        "fulltext": "Can Big Tech solve the housing crisis? That\u2019s the hope behind recent announcements byApple,FacebookandGoogle, which together total $4.5 billion in grants and loans to remedy the affordable-housing crunch in California and the Bay Area.Microsoftlast year pledged $500 million to relieve Seattle\u2019s similarly stressed market. WhileAmazon\u2019s opposition torpedoed Seattle\u2019s attempt in2018to raise revenue for homelessness services, the company has embarked on a range of philanthropic housing ventures, including turning over a large chunk of one of its office buildings for use as a shelter for homeless families.\nThese moves, and the public reaction to them, reflect a common presumption: Tech broke the system, so it\u2019s time for tech to fix it.\nBut don\u2019t blame this economic crisis on the tech bros.\nThe spiraling housing costs in West Coast tech hubs are the result of 40 years of tax and land use policy \u2014 a period that mirrored the explosive growth of the tax-averse tech industry. This was also a time of continuedactivism by homeowners against higher-density zoning. Together, this has severely limited housing construction, particularly lower-cost houses and apartments. It is a chronic condition, inflamed by the current tech boom.\nCalifornia\u2019s saga began in the 1970s, when sprawling growth and spiking taxes seemed to threaten the quality of life so many came to the Golden State to find. Citizen activists created \u201curban growth boundaries\u201d and land trusts to preserve open space and delicate coastal habitats. Yet these important moves also limited where developers could build new homes. Meanwhile, homebuilders chafed under what they saw as burdensome state rules about how many approvals they needed to build new housing.\nThen came Proposition 13, a ballot initiative that passed in the summer of 1978 to slash property taxes. It has altered the way California has grown. By keeping property taxes low for longtime homeowners, Proposition 13 created clear winners and losers in the California housing market. \u201cThere has been a huge shift in the tax burden to young families from older homeowners and owners of businesses,\u201dthe Times noted in 1988. Cash-hungry cities opted to zone for commercial uses, which would generate sales taxes, instead of affordable housing. When houses got built, steep \u201cimpact fees\u201d drove builders toward more expensive homes, whose buyers could absorb the costs.\nThrough all of this, California\u2019s political leaders raised the alarm about housing affordability. In 1980, Gov. Jerry Brown formed an Affordable Housing Task Force, declaring that 60 percent of Californians were priced out of the market. By 1991,two-thirds of the 25 least affordable cities in the nation were in California.\nThere was some substantive action: In 1994, two of the state\u2019s largest pension funds announced more than $340 million in construction loans for affordable development. But 25 years later, distressingly little has changed. California is America\u2019s largest economy; but when its politicians have pushed to diversify its housing mix, they have been batted back by homeowners who resist new development in their neighborhoods.\nBut Proposition 13 has meant that city governments have few fiscal incentives to encourage private companies to build more housing. An important part of Apple\u2019s housing plan, for example, involves developing land that it owns in San Jose. That property is zoned as industrial, so if it shifts to residential use, which generates limited property taxes, San Jose stands to lose tax revenue. This is a Catch-22 for a city desperate for both tax revenue and new, more affordable housing.\nSeattle also has an affordable-housing shortage that predates the tech boom. Since its firstzoning restrictionsin 1923, the city has steadily expanded single-family residential zoning in ways that have limited housing supply and preserved racial and economic segregation. Today\u2019s Seattle is larger, richer and more crowded, but remains overwhelmingly a city of single-family homes. The city abandoned plans to increase housing density in some neighborhoods after pressure. Washington State capped property taxes in 2001, creating a resource squeeze in even its wealthiest suburbs.\nWhile tech is not responsible for this state of affairs, it has helped maintain it. Research has indicated that tax cuts have little effect on overall tech investment, yet industry leaders have consistently lobbied for them. They seek low-tax environments and have taken full advantage of deductions and incentivesto effectively zero out their federal tax bills. Their billion-dollar housing promises are only a fraction of the taxes they might otherwise pay.\nUntil recently, tech workers haven\u2019t had to worry too much about state and local politics. Their suburban campuses were comfortable bubbles. Company buses zoomed through traffic-choked highways; generous pay packages covered high rents and hefty mortgages.\nNow, tech companies are increasingly moving into large cities where housing challenges can\u2019t be ignored. Their suburban outposts are getting crowded, too. A decade ago, it would have been hard to imagine that companies like Facebook and Google would get into the housing development business. Now it\u2019s hard to imagine how they could not.\nYet years of diminished faith in government and increased faith in tech have left things out of balance. We look to Big Tech to solve the housing crisis, when the solution involves things only government \u2014 and voters \u2014 can do, like changing land use rules and tax laws. And tech\u2019s billions will mean little if homeowners continue to oppose new development.\nThe only way the status quo will truly shift is if the voices calling for more density and affordability become stronger than those against it.\nHere is where tech workers again come in. They are disproportionately young and highly educated, and they often have a strong preference for dense, walkable neighborhoods. They care about making cities more livable and affordable for everyone. And theyvote.\nWhat might Seattle and San Francisco look like if more tech workers became engaged instate and local politics? What if companies didn\u2019t only put up money, but worked to change laws constraining the housing supply? What if tech leaders and workers were willing to pay more taxes for better urban infrastructure and a higher quality of public services?\nThe tech bros did not create the housing crisis. But they can help fix it.\nMargaret O\u2019Mara (@margaretomara) is a professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of\u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "What Is End-to-End Encryption? Another Bull\u2019s-Eye on Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A Justice Department official hinted on Monday that a yearslong fight over encrypted communications could become part of a sweeping investigation of big tech companies.\nWhile a department spokesman declined to discuss specifics,a speech Monday by the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, pointed toward heightened interest in technology called end-to-end encryption, which makes it nearly impossible for law enforcement and spy agencies to getaccessto people\u2019s digital communications.\nLaw enforcement and technologists have been arguing over encryption controls for more than two decades. On one side are privacy advocates and tech bosses like Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, who believe people should be able to have online communications free of snooping. On the other side are law enforcement and some lawmakers, who believe tough encryption makes it impossible to track child predators, terrorists and other criminals.\nAttorney General William P. Barr, joined by his British and Australian counterparts, recently pressed Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to abandon plans to embed end-to-end encryption in services like Messenger and Instagram. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already provides that tougher encryption.\n\u201cCompanies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes,\u201d Mr. Barr wrote in a letter last month.\nHere is an explanation of the technology and the stakes.\nEnd-to-end encryption scrambles messages in such a way that they can be deciphered only by the sender and the intended recipient. As the label implies, end-to-end encryption takes place on either end of a communication. A message is encrypted on a sender\u2019s device, sent to the recipient\u2019s device in an unreadable format, then decoded for the recipient.\nThere are several ways to do this, but the most popular works like this: A program on your device mathematically generates two cryptographic keys \u2014 a public key and a private key.\nThe public key can be shared with anyone who wants to encrypt a message to you. The private key, or secret key, decrypts messages sent to you and never leaves your device. Think of it as a locked mailbox. Anyone with a public key can put something in your box and lock it, but only you have the private key to unlock it.\nA more common form of encryption, known as transport layer encryption, relies on a third party, like a tech company, to encrypt messages as they move across the web.\nWith this type of encryption, law enforcement and intelligence agencies can get access to encrypted messages by presenting technology companies with a warrant or national security letter. The sender and recipient would not have to know about it.\nEnd-to-end encryption ensures that no one can eavesdrop on the contents of a message while it is in transit. It forces spies or snoops to go directly to the sender or recipient to read the content of the encrypted message. Or they must hack directly into the sender\u2019s or recipient\u2019s device, something that can be harder to do \u201cat scale\u201d and makes mass surveillance much more difficult.\nPrivacy activists, libertarians, security experts and human rights activists argue that end-to-end encryption steers governments away from mass surveillance and toward a more targeted, constitutional form of intelligence gathering. But intelligence and law enforcement agencies argue that end-to-end encryption makes itmuch harder to track terrorists, pedophiles and human traffickers.\nWhen Mr. Zuckerberg announced in March that Facebook would move all three of its messaging services to end-to-end encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for \u201ctruly terrible things like child exploitation.\u201d\n\u201cEncryption is a powerful tool for privacy, but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things,\u201d he said.\nThedebate over end-to-end encryption has had several iterations,beginning in the 1990s with the spread of Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, software, an end-to-end encryption scheme designed by a programmer named Phil Zimmermann. As a result, the Clinton administration proposed a \u201cClipper Chip,\u201d a back door for law enforcement and security agencies.\nBut the Clipper Chip provoked a backlash from a coalition of unlikely bedfellows, including the American Civil Liberties Union; the televangelist Pat Robertson; and Senators John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, and John Ashcroft, the Missouri Republican. The White House backed down in 1996.\nEnd-to-end encryption gained more traction in 2013, after data leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden appeared to show the extent to which the N.S.A. and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies were gaining access to users\u2019 communications through companies like Yahoo, Microsoft, Google and Facebook without their knowledge.\nEncrypted messaging apps like Signal and Wicker gained in popularity, and tech giants like Apple and Facebook started wrapping user data in end-to-end encryption.\nGoogle, which pledged to add an end-to-end encryption option for Gmail users several years ago, has not made this the default option for email. But the company does offer a video-calling app, Duo, that is end-to-end encrypted.\nAs more communications moved to these end-to-end encrypted services, law enforcement and intelligence services around the world started to complain about data\u2019s \u201cgoing dark.\u201d\nGovernment agencies have tried to force technology companies to roll back end-to-end encryption, or build back doors, like the Clipper Chip of the 1990s, into their encrypted products to facilitate government surveillance.\nIn the most aggressive of these efforts,the F.B.I. tried in 2016 to compel Applein federal court to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\nMr. Cook of Apple called the F.B.I.\u2019s effort\u201cthe software equivalent of cancer.\u201d He said complying with the request would open the door to more invasive government interception down the road.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an operating system for surveillance, maybe the ability for the law enforcement to turn on the camera,\u201d Mr. Cook told ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it stops.\u201d\nPrivacy activists and security experts noted that any back door created for United States law enforcement agencies would inevitably become a target for foreign adversaries, cybercriminals and terrorists.\nAlex Stamos, the chief security officer of Yahoo at the time, likened the creation of an encryption back door to \u201cdrilling a hole in the windshield.\u201d By trying to provide an entry point for one government, you end up cracking the structural integrity of the entire encryption shield.\nThe F.B.I. eventually backed down. Instead of forcing Apple to create a back door, the agency said it hadpaid an outside partyto hack into the phone of the San Bernardino gunman.\nGovernments have stepped up their calls for an encryption back door.\nLast year, Australian lawmakers passed a bill requiring technology companiesto provide law enforcement and security agencieswith access to encrypted communications. The bill gave the government the ability to get a court order allowing it to secretly order technology companies and technologists to re-engineer software and hardware so that it can be used to spy on users.\nAustralia\u2019s law is based on Britain\u2019s 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, which compels British companies to hand over the keys to unscramble encrypted data to law enforcement agencies. The Australian law could apply to overseas companies like Facebook and Apple.\nAustralia\u2019s new law applies to network administrators, developers and other tech employees, forcing them to comply with secret government demands without notifying their employers.\nOther governments are also considering new encryption laws. In India, Facebook\u2019s biggest market, officialstold the country\u2019s Supreme Courtin October thatIndian lawrequires Facebook to decrypt messages and supply them to law enforcement upon request.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t come into the country and say, \u2018We will establish a non-decryptable system,\u2019\u201d India\u2019s attorney general,K.K. Venugopal, told the court, referring to Facebook and other big tech platforms. India\u2019s Supreme Court has said it will reconvene on the issue in January."

        "title": "Trump Gives U.S. Business the Ukraine Treatment",
        "fulltext": "The story that has emerged in the impeachment hearings is one of extortion and bribery. Donald Trump withheld crucial aid \u2014 aid Ukraine needed to defend itself against Russian aggression \u2014 and refused to release it unless Ukraine publicly said it was investigating one of his political rivals. Even Republicans understand this; they just think it\u2019s O.K.\nAnd remember, the Ukraine scandal made it into the public eye only because a single whistle-blower set an investigation in motion. I know I\u2019m not alone in wondering how many other comparable scandals haven\u2019t come to light.\nNor need these scandals involve foreign governments. What I haven\u2019t seen pointed out is that Trump is quietly applying a Ukraine-type extortion-and-bribery strategy to U.S. corporations. Many businesses are being threatened with policies that would hurt their bottom lines \u2014 especially, but not only, tariffs on imported goods crucial to their operations. But they are also being offered the possibility of exemptions from these policies.\nAnd the implicit quid pro quo for such exemptions is that corporations support Donald Trump, or at least refrain from criticizing his actions.\nConsider, for example, what happened last week, when Trump toured an Apple manufacturing plant together with Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Trump used the occasion to make a political speech, attacking impeachment proceedings and falsely claiming that Nancy Pelosi has \u201cclosed Congress.\u201d He also asserted that the plant, which has been operating since 2013, hadjust opened.\nAnd Cook, far from correcting these falsehoods, expressed support, declaring that America has the \u201cstrongest economy in the world.\u201d\nCook\u2019s incentive to play along was obvious. Apple assembles many of its products in China; it\u2019s seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s China tariffs. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that the allocation of such exemptions is driven by politics, not the national interest.\nFor example, in 2018 a company owned by Oleg Deripaska \u2014 an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, who is supposed to beunder U.S. sanctionsfor activities that include interference in foreign elections \u2014 received awaiverfrom aluminum tariffs. The waiver was withdrawn only after Democrats in Congress noticed it, with the Commerce Department claiming that it had been granted as a result of a \u201cclerical error.\u201dUh-huh.\nBy the way, if you\u2019re wondering why the Trump administration has the power to play favorites, it\u2019s because U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretion in setting tariffs. The purpose of that discretion was to diminish the power of special interests in Congress, based on the assumption that the president would be better at serving the national interest. But then came Trump.\nAnd tariff policy isn\u2019t the only area in which the administration seems to be using its power to punish corporations if they don\u2019t show proper political fealty.\nRecently the Pentagon granted the hugeJoint Enterprise Defense Infrastructurecontract for cloud computing (yes, JEDI) to Microsoft, shocking observers who expected it to go to Amazon. Amazon is challenging the decision, claiming that it was punishment for critical reporting in The Washington Post, now owned by Jeff Bezos \u2014 a claim that is entirely plausible, given Trump\u2019s own repeated declarations that he was going to give Bezos \u201cproblems.\u201d\nTrump officials claim, of course, that the decision process wassqueaky-clean, based on expert judgment untainted by any political influence. But seriously, isanythingclean in this administration? Are we really supposed to accept on faith that people who are willing to politicizeweather forecastswere totally hands-off when it came to awarding a huge, lucrative contract to a company Trump considers an enemy?\nWhen I and others point out the ways in which Trump is using crony capitalism to lock in political advantage, we tend to get two kinds of pushback. First, we\u2019re told that we shouldn\u2019t feel sympathy for wealthy corporations. Second, we\u2019re told that progressive Democrats also criticize some corporations, like Facebook, and have proposed a crackdown on some kinds of corporate behavior. So what\u2019s the difference?\nWell, these critiques (willfully, one suspects) miss the point. What progressives are proposing are rules for corporate behavior that would apply equally to all companies, not be imposed selectively on corporations depending on their political orientation.\nAnd the trouble with Trump\u2019s selective doling out of punishment isn\u2019t the harm it inflicts on corporations, it\u2019s the incentives this regime creates for political sycophancy. American voters and American democracy, not Apple and Amazon \u2014 which are, as it happens, notorious examples oftaxavoidance\u2014 are the victims we care about.\nPut it this way: By using his political power to punish businesses that don\u2019t support him while rewarding those that do, Trump is taking us along the same path already followed by countries likeHungary, which remains a democracy on paper but has become a one-party authoritarian state in practice. And we\u2019re already much further down that road than many people realize.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "fulltext": "Charles Schwab isreportedly in talksto buy TD Ameritrade in a $26 billion deal that could be announced as early as today. (Want this by email?Sign up here.)\nPresident Trump toured a Texas plant that makes high-end Apple computers yesterday, and inaccurately played up the six-year-old factory asevidence of success for his three-year-old presidency, Jack Nicas of the NYT reports. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, didn\u2019t correct the president, raising questions about whether he may be compromised over his company\u2019s desires to skirt tariffs.\n\u201cFor me, this is a very special day,\u201dMr. Trump said during the visit. \u201cI said, \u2018Someday we\u2019re going to see Apple building plants in our country, not in China. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u2019 \u201d Later he posted on Twitter \u201cToday I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plantin Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.\u201d\nBut the plant opened in 2013.It\u2019s owned and run by a company called Flextronics, and builds devices on Apple\u2019s behalf.\nMr. Cook spoke immediately after Mr. Trump but did not correct him.Instead, he thanked the president and his staff. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for their support in pulling today off and getting us to this far. It would not be possible without them,\u201d he said.\nPerhaps tariffs were in Mr. Cook\u2019s mind.Apple pays the trade levies on Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war, and has sought waivers. When Mr. Trump was asked yesterday if he would exempt Apple from tariffs, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that.\u201d\n\u201cIt illustrated the complicated position that Mr. Cookand other corporate executives find themselves in with this president, forced to stand silently by while he sometimes misleads about their businesses,\u201d Mr. Nicas writes. But if Apple succeeds in wriggling its way out of tariffs, Mr. Cook\u2019s spot could become even tighter \u2014 especially if the president speaks out on topics such as immigration, on which Mr. Cook has disagreed with him in the past.\nEven if the world\u2019s two biggest economies reach a truce,their relationship is likely to worsen, Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, tells Andrew for his latest DealBook column.\nAnimosity between the two countrieshas merged \u201cmilitary prisms and ideas into economic policies,\u201d Mr. Paulson said in a preview of a speech he planned to make today at a Bloomberg event on the economy in Beijing.\n\u2022 \u201cIt should concern every one of us who cares about the state of the global economy that the positive-sum metaphors of healthy economic competition are giving way to the zero-sum metaphors of military competition,\u201d he planned to say.\nMore worrisome: the U.S. could close off its financial marketsto Chinese investment, Mr. Paulson said. \u201cIt would eventually threaten U.S. leadership in finance, as well as New York City\u2019s role as the world\u2019s financial center,\u201d he said.\nHe also raised a worst-case scenario.China, which owns more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt, could decide to sell Treasury bonds, potentially sending their value down and pushing interest rates much higher, a worry that Andrew raisedin a previous column.\nNegotiators are said to be making progress on a first trade deal with China, but reports suggest that hopes of an agreement being reached before the end of the year are beginning to evaporate.\n\u201cTrade negotiators from the U.S. and China are making progressin key areas even as concerns grow that efforts to nail down the first phase of a broader deal are stalling,\u201d Bloomberg News reports. It adds that \u201csome people close to the talksdescribe them as being in a sensitive, make-or-break stageand caution that what President Donald Trump proclaimed as a done deal a month ago, sending U.S. stocks soaring to records, could still easily fall apart.\u201d\n\u2022 Separately, Bloomberg News reported that China\u2019s chief trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, has said that he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reaching a \u201cPhase 1\u201d deal with the U.S.\nBut the timeline for a deal remains unclear.Reuters, citing trade experts and people close to the White House, reports that the \u201ccompletion of a \u2018Phase 1\u2019 U.S.-China trade dealcould slide into next year,\u201d as \u201cBeijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.\u201d\n\u2022 When Mr. Trump was asked yesterday if he would secure a deal by the end of the year, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted to do it yet. Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re stepping up to the level that I want.\u201d\nAnd some people doubt further progresswill be made any time soon after a preliminary deal is signed.\n\u2022 \u201cOur base case is that the Phase 1 trade deal gets done andthat might be about as good as it gets, that Phase 2 and Phase 3 remain distant next year,\u201d Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC.\nMore:China may berunning out of economic ammunitionto use against the U.S.\nGeneral Motors sued Fiat Chrysler yesterday,claiming that it bribedUnited Automobile Workers officials in contract negotiations to get a leg up on G.M. over the course of a decade, the NYT\u2019s Neal Boudette reports.\nThe corruption went far beyond garden-variety embezzlementand personal enrichment, G.M. claimed in its lawsuit. The company contends that:\n\u2022 The illegal activity was authorized by Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive at the time, Sergio Marchionne, and helped Fiat Chrysler win union acceptance of cost concessions that were denied to G.M. in labor contracts in 2011 and 2015.\n\u2022 Fiat Chrysler executives bribed union leaders to win support for Fiat Chrysler\u2019s highly public effort to pressure G.M. into a merger in 2015.\nThe union\u2019s president, Gary Jones, resignedhours after G.M. filed the lawsuit.\n\u2022 \u201cThe day\u2019s events embroiled two of the country\u2019s three biggest automakers and the union that represents their workers, a controversy the likes of which the industry has rarely experienced,\u201d Mr. Boudette writes.\nGoogle has hiredan anti-union consulting firm to advise its managementas it deals with widespread worker unrest, Noam Scheiber and Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT write.\nThe company has grappled with internal striferecently, including accusations that it has retaliated against organizers of a global walkout and cracked down on dissent inside the company. The newly hired firm, IRI Consultants, promotes its anti-union success on its website.\nThe move \u201cis the latest evidence of escalation in a feudbetween a group of activist workers at Google and management that has tested the limits of the company\u2019s traditionally transparent, worker-friendly culture,\u201d the reporters write.\nBut hiring IRI was a surprising turn.\u201cUnion organization \u2014 even labor unrest \u2014 has traditionally been rare among big tech companies because their employees have usually been treated and paid well,\u201d Mr. Scheiber and Mr. Wakabayashi write.\nAt this stage, no one needs reminding that many Democratic nominee hopefuls want to tax the wealthy, with Senator Elizabeth Warren in particular looking to disincentivize the accumulation of fortunes above $1 billion. But in his latest column, Greg Ip of the WSJwonders what it might mean for entrepreneurs.\n\u2022 Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax of up to 6 percent a year, along with other levies, are intended to shrink the fortunes of billionaires and multimillionaires.\n\u2022 But, Mr. Ip writes, research shows that \u201ccountries with a lot of billionaires per capita had higher incomes per capita,\u201d and a country\u2019s share of the world\u2019s billionaires also \u201ccorresponded closely to its share of the world\u2019s largest, most successful companies.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhile this doesn\u2019t mean billionaires make an economy successful, it does show the two go hand in hand,\u201d he adds.\n\u2022 For most billionaires, Ms. Warren\u2019s tax proposal could easily eat up most if not all of their returns. \u201cFounders would have to steadily sell off their holdings to pay their taxes, shrinking their stake,\u201d Mr. Ip writes.\n\u2022 That could disincentivize many entrepreneurs from growing huge and successful companies.\n\u2022 \u201cThis isn\u2019t a reason not to tax billionaires; it\u2019s a reason to be careful about how it\u2019s done.\u201d\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the E.U., told the impeachment inquiry yesterday that he wasfollowing President Trump\u2019s orderswhen he pressured Ukraine to conduct investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals, Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt write in the NYT.\nHe said he reluctantly followed Mr. Trump\u2019s directive,in what Mr. Sondland claimed was a clear \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d He added, \u201cWe followed the president\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Sondland linked the most senior members of the Trump administration to the effort\u2014 including the vice president, the secretary of state, the acting chief of staff and others,\u201d Mr. Fandos and Mr. Schmidt write. \u201cHe said they were informed of it at key moments, an account that severely undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent claims that he never pressured Ukraine.\u201d\nUkrainian officials may have known as early as late Julythat a $391 million package of security assistance was being withheld by the Trump administration, a Defense Department official, Laura Cooper, testified later.\nMr. Sondland\u2019s testimony may bea career-endangering blowfor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has long tried to portray himself as balancing loyalty to Mr. Trump with defending the traditional security interests of the U.S., write David E. Sanger and Edward Wong in the NYT. But the testimony undercut any notion that Mr. Pompeo was not a participant in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine.\nMore:Mr. Sondland had not even finished his testimony before it was called the\u201cJohn Dean moment\u201dof the impeachment drama. The F.B.I. tried tointerview the anonymous whistle-blowerwho helped ignite the inquiry, several people familiar with the matter said, but the interview never took place.\nHSBC is reportedly planning to replaceSamir Assaf, the long-serving head of its investment bank. He is expected to bemoved to a non-executive role.\nDeals\n\u2022 Alibaba\u2019s $13 billion I.P.O. in Hong Kong and Saudi Aramco\u2019s anticipated $26 billion I.P.O. in Riyadh willreportedly deliver only modest feesfor the banks that are advising the companies.
