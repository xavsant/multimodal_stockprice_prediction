        "title": "Swiping a Screen Rather Than Flip a Page in Baseball",
        "fulltext": "If a major league coach or player is scrolling through an iPad in the dugout, he is probably not perusing Facebook but rather accessing his scouting reports.\nThrough a partnership with Apple, each team in Major League Baseball has been given eight iPads to use in the dugout and bullpen during games. They are loaded with M.L.B. Dugout, an app that displays scouting reports and other information as well as videos of their opponents.\n\u201cI think we wanted to kind of make sure that we were able to continue to support and allow our clubs to stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology, and analytics and using statistics to help the sport be a better sport,\u201d said Chris Marinak, M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president for league economics and strategy.\nFor the most part, the iPads offer information that teams already use, but in a way that is faster and easier to access.\nThe San Francisco Giants have embraced the iPads, and the Giants\u2019 bench coach, Ron Wotus, said that he had eliminated the binders he previously used.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had it in books,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cI\u2019d have to carry two big binders, and you have to flip through papers. So it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201d\nWotus said he checked the iPad more often during the first games of series against teams outside the Giants\u2019 division.\n\u201cYou can prepare all day, and you get in the game, we don\u2019t know these clubs as well,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else that you can look at. So it\u2019s available if I want it, but I would say I\u2019m looking at that more than I was the binders.\u201d\nTeams were able to test the program at the end of last season. Then, after some enhancements to the app, it became standard at the start of this season. An updated version was released after the All-Star break, allowing coaches to make handwritten notes and look at files side by side.\nThe iPads are different from the ones consumers use. Dugout is the only app clubs can access. Even the camera is disabled.\nSean True, the senior director for club services and baseball technology at the commissioner\u2019s office, said the clubs\u2019 top concern was data protection and security.\nSupport staff members load the information that the Giants\u2019 coaches want. For Wotus, that includes scouting reports and spray charts, because he also manages the infield defense. He also uses the video of an opposing player.\n\u201cYou can look at plots on paper, like a spray chart, and that doesn\u2019t tell you the story,\u201d Wotus said.\nThe Giants\u2019 hitting coach, Hensley Meulens, has players study opposing pitchers in the video room on the first day of a series. But then, when a reliever comes into the game, he will pull up his report on an iPad to provide a refresher.\nHe also keeps a simple sheet of paper on a clipboard with information on the opposing team\u2019s pitchers. A few Giants players look at the paper, but most use an iPad, Meulens said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker to get to the player you want to get to, because you just click on him and it opens up,\u201d Meulens said. \u201cOtherwise, you have to try to find the guy as time is running.\u201d\nFor Mets Manager Terry Collins, turning a page is still quicker, although he also said the iPads were useful.\n\u201cI know people that are a lot more familiar using them are glad they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said.\nMeulens said he still kept a binder for backup in case of an iPad malfunction. And when several players are trying to look up information at the same time, it can be helpful to have three options: the iPad, the binder and the cheat sheet on the clipboard.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals are one club that has not quite fully adopted the iPads. Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman said much of the team\u2019s bullpen information was relayed orally. And if he has a question, he will refer back to the bullpen coach, Blaise Ilsley.\n\u201cSo he\u2019s sort of our iPad in that sense,\u201d Bowman said.\nBaltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said he would check an iPad in the dugout occasionally, sometimes when a new pitcher entered the game. But perhaps memory, at least Showalter\u2019s, is one thing the iPads can\u2019t trump.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that a lot when you\u2019re out here, you haven\u2019t done your homework,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cI usually have it, believe it or not, stored upstairs.\u201d\n"

        "title": "Apple Is Said to Owe Back Taxes to Irish Government",
        "fulltext": "The European Union\u2019s competition authorities are poised to announce a major tax ruling against Apple\u2019s tax dealings with the Irish government on Tuesday, a decision that will likely increase trans-Atlantic tension over how some of the world\u2019s largest companies pay taxes on their global operations.\nThe ruling, expected to be announced early Tuesday in Brussels, will result in Apple having to pay back taxes to the Irish government, according to three people briefed on the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The amount is anticipated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one of these people said.\nThe decision is set to further stoke tensions between American officials and their European counterparts, with Europe claiming the right to oversee tax policies for companies like Apple and Amazon, among others, that have used complicated tax structures in nations like Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce the amount of corporate tax they pay in other countries.\nThe Obama administration and Congress have strenuously fought to defend Apple, the company that made the iPod music player and iPhone global bywords for American prowess in technology. They have accused the European Commission of leading a campaign against American corporate success and suggested that it would be overstepping its authority by issuing a formal tax order. American officials have said reforms to corporate taxation first needto be agreed to internationally.\n\u201cThis will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThat overreaction will make it a lot more difficult to police companies\u2019 international tax structures.\u201d\nApple, Irish authorities and European competition authorities declined to comment. The tax decision was earlier reported by RTE, the Irish broadcaster.\nMargrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official, is expected to say on Tuesday that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local tax arrangements. These deals, related to agreements from 1991 and 2007, gave Apple an unfair advantage over other companies, and broke Europe\u2019s so-called state-aid rules that forbid any government from providing unfair assistance to certain companies over others, she is expected to say.\nIreland can appeal any judgment by suing in the Court of Justice of the European Union to stop any resulting penalty, and Apple could seek to support such an appeal. Such appeals are likely to take years.\nFor Apple, the potential tax clawback would be a blow to the company\u2019s approximately 30 years of activity in Ireland, where it currently employs around 5,500 people, mostly in Cork, a city in the south of the country.\nThe tech giant has repeatedly denied that it received unfair tax treatment from Irish authorities, saying that it complies with all tax laws wherever it operates. While Apple has a large operation in Ireland, the company said its main corporate tax liabilities remain within the United States where it is based and conducts the majority of its research and development.\nIn aninterview last weekwith The Washington Post, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that he hoped his company would get a fair hearing in Europe on the tax issue and that \u201cif we don\u2019t, then we would obviously appeal it.\u201d\nThe European Commission has been seeking a greater say over tax issues for decades. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis amid complaints that prosperous corporations were enjoying tax breaks while citizens faced mounting tax demands and cuts to their public services.\nMs. Vestager has already ordered Luxembourg to claw back 30 million euros, or $33 million, from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and the Netherlands to recover a similar amount from Starbucks. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands have appealed those decisions. She still is investigating similar cases in Luxembourg affecting Amazon and McDonald\u2019s.\nLast year, in another case, Ms. Vestager ordered France to recover \u20ac1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion, from state-controlled \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France for failing to pay enough corporation tax in 1997. At the time, E.D.F. said it would make the reimbursement but was considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\u201cOur aim is very simple,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cProfits should be taxed where profits are made.\u201d\nThe European Union\u2019s investigation into the Irish treatment of Apple began under Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. It was prompted in part by a United States Senate investigation in 2013 that found that Apple, the world\u2019s largest public company by market capitalization, sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profit from tax in offshore entities including in Ireland. The European Commission opened a formal investigation in June 2014 into whether the tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland amounted to illegal state support.\nAt the time Mr. Almunia indicated that austerity measures as a result of the European debt crisis made it even more important for large multinational corporations topay fair taxesto cash-starved governments.\nIreland strongly objected to the investigation. The ruling is likely to be a hard pill to swallow for the country, which has spent decades championing its low corporate tax rate and other tax breaks to entice American companies to its shores.\nThe Irish government has said that it will appeal any tax decision announced by European officials, putting the country in the somewhat odd position of turning down potentially billions of dollars of extra revenue from Apple.\n\u201cThe decision by the Irish government to fight this case is bizarre,\u201d said James Stewart, a professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThe Irish government is opposed to any global tax harmonization because it will harm its ability to attract foreign direct investment.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Apple, which has been criticized in recent years for failing to pay outside hackers who report bugs in its products, said on Thursday that it would begin offering a so-called bug bounty to technologists who alert the company to flaws.\nAt the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple\u2019s digital compartments and into its customers\u2019 data, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data, and $200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s firmware \u2014 the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine.\nApple said that if hackers donated their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. \u201cWe want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,\u201d said Ivan Krstic, Apple\u2019s head of security engineering and architecture.\nFor six years, nearly every company in Silicon Valley has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs \u2014 a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion \u2014 in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.\nBut Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.\nThe lack of an Apple bug bounty programmade headlinesearlier this year whenthe F.B.I. announced that it had paid hackersmore than $1 million for a backdoor into Apple\u2019s iPhone.\nThe annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.\nDan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\n\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.\nNotably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700. According to the event organizers, the fund-raiser focused on \u201ccyber policy issues the next administration faces.\u201d\nSecurity experts at the conference, echoing earlier reports, maintained that Russia was behind the hack. A number of organizations citedresearchsuggesting thatthe D.N.C. was hacked by two Russian intelligence groups in what they believed was a campaign aimed at hurting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy."

        "title": "Should You Charge Your Phone Overnight?",
        "fulltext": "Chances are, you plug in your phone before you go to bed at night, thinking it\u2019s best to greet the morning with a fully charged device.\nIs this a good idea?\nHere\u2019s the thing. Many people don\u2019t expect to keep their phones for much longer than two years.\nFor the most part, experts say, those people are not going to notice much damage to their phone batteries before they start hankering for a new device.\nIf that sounds like you, feel free to charge every night, and as often as you like in between.\nBut frequent charging takes a toll on the lithium-ion batteries in our phones. And it\u2019s not because they can be overcharged, said Edo Campos, a spokesman for Anker, which produces phone chargers.\n\u201cSmartphones are, in fact, smart,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cThey know when to stop charging.\u201d\nAndroid phones and iPhones are equipped with chips that protect them from absorbing excess electrical current once they are fully charged.\nSo in theory, any damage from charging your phone overnight with an official charger, or a trustworthy off-brand charger, should be negligible.\nBut the act of charging is itself bad for your phone\u2019s battery.\nMost phones make use of a technology that allows their batteries to accept more current faster. Hatem Zeine, the founder, chief scientist and chief technical officer of the wireless charging company Ossia, says the technology enables phones to adjust to the amount of charge that a charger is capable of supplying.\nThe technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other and causing the battery to charge more quickly.\nBut this process also leads lithium-ion (and lithium-polymer) batteries to corrode faster thanthey otherwise would.\n\u201cWhen you charge fast all the time, you limit the life span of the battery,\u201d Mr. Zeine said.\nIf you\u2019re intent on preserving a lithium-ion battery beyond the lifetime of the typical phone or tablet, Mr. Zeine suggested using a charger meant for a less powerful device, though he couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would work.\n\u201cFor example, if you used an iPhone charger on an iPad Pro, it\u2019s going to charge very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zeine said. \u201cIf the electronics are right, they can actually preserve the battery because you\u2019re always charging it slowly.\u201d\nPeople looking to preserve their batteries should make sure their phones don\u2019t become overheated, Mr. Campos advised, because high temperatures further excite the lithium-ion in batteries, leading to even quicker deterioration.\nApple\u2019s websitesays temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 35 Celsius) can \u201cpermanently damage battery capacity.\u201d\nBoth Mr. Zeine and Mr. Campos noted that given the constant demand for new cellphones, charging overnight might not be a point of great concern for many people.\n\u201cAll this actually doesn\u2019t make a huge difference for consumers,\u201d Mr. Campos said, citing a 2015Gallup surveyshowing that 44 percent of smartphone users planned to upgrade their devices as soon as their providers allowed it \u2014 usually after two years, about the length of time it takes for batteries to start showing signs of wear."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of the world\u2019s most evasive digital arms dealers is believed to have been taking advantage of three security vulnerabilities in popular Apple products in its efforts to spy on dissidents and journalists.\nInvestigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target\u2019s mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group\u2019s software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user.\nIn response, Apple on Thursday released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update.\nApple fixed the holes 10 days after a tip from two researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company.\n\u201cWe advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,\u201d said Fred Sainz, a company spokesman.\nIn interviews and manuals, the NSO Group\u2019s executives have long boasted that their spyware worked like a \u201cghost,\u201d tracking the moves and keystrokes of its targets, without leaving a trace. But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring.\nA clearer picture began to emerge on Aug. 10, when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been tracked by surveillance softwareseveral times,began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages purported to contain information about the torture of U.A.E. citizens.\nMr. Mansoor passed the messages to researchers at the Citizen Lab, who confirmed they were an attempt to track him through his iPhone.\nThis latest effort was far more sophisticated than what was found aimed at his devices before. The researchers found it was connecting to 200 servers, several of them registered to the NSO Group. Strewn throughout the spyware code were references to Pegasus, the name of an NSO Group spyware product.\nCitizen Lab brought in Lookout to help examine the code. Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities \u2014 called \u201czero days\u201d because Apple didn\u2019t know about them and had zero days to patch them.\nIn many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers.\n\u201cNSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,\u201d said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout.\nIn recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices.\nFlaws in Apple\u2019s iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar zero-day exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of zero-days, for $1 million.\nEarlier this year, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced that his agency had paid hackers who found a way for the F.B.I. to crack into an iPhone used by one of the shooters in last year\u2019s mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif.Neither the hackers nor the F.B.I.have told Apple how this was accomplished.\nApple\u2019s software update patches the NSO Group\u2019s exploits, but it is unclear whether the company has patched the vulnerabilities used by the F.B.I. to crack into its iPhone. Apple recently began a\u201cbug bounty\u201d program to pay hackers who report vulnerabilities in its systems.\nAmong the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico\u2019s ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group\u2019s tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U.A.E.\nZamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, \u201cThe company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.\u201d\nMr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a \u201clawful manner.\u201d \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he said, \u201cthe products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\u201d\nHe would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U.A.E. or Mexico.\nIn 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million. Francisco Partners declined to comment.\nMr. Mansoor said in an interview that the discoveries were a sad reminder that no matter what he does to protect his devices and digital security, he will continue to be a target for companies that provide this sort of spying technology.\n\u201cI guess I am their regular customer,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the guinea pig.\u201d\nBill Marczak, the researcher at Citizen Lab who has been helping Mr. Mansoor protect his digital security, said that the surveillance experienced by Mr. Mansoor is likely to expand.\n\u201cThe targeting of these activists and dissidents is a taste of what\u2019s to come,\u201d Mr. Marczak said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re facing today will be faced by ordinary users tomorrow.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 American lawmakers have for years been assailing companies for dodging taxes with overseas maneuvers. But now that the European Union has done something about it bytrying to wrest billions of dollars from Apple, those officials have offered a response viewed by many as rife with hypocrisy: collective outrage.\nTax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority.\nDespite all that, Apple \u2014 a company long accused of being overly creative at avoiding taxes \u2014 now has the federal government standing up for it after theEuropean Union\u2019s executive commissionordered Ireland on Tuesday to collect $14.5 billion in taxes from the company.\nAnd for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to think that the administration has been flying over to Brussels on taxpayers\u2019 dollars to lobby the European Union against collecting taxes owed in Europe when they\u2019re not collecting the taxes owed here,\u201d saidClark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly ironic.\u201d\nMost lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism.\nThe Treasury Department said the ruling was \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America\u2019s largest companies,called the movea \u201creckless and dramatic overreach\u201d and an \u201cact of aggression\u201d against a company and a sovereign government.\nIn Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe.\nThe European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.\nHe pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.\u201d\nThe European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate.\n\u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill \u2014 years after the fact \u2014 sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d\nMr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure.\nThe action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation.\n\u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U.S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U.S., not in Ireland and not in the E.U.\u201d\nThe bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash.\n\u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U.S. anyway.\u201d\nReuven S. Avi-Yonah, who directs the international taxation program at the University of Michigan Law School, said that the European Union had a strong case for collecting the taxes from Apple and that if the situation were reversed, Americans would be clamoring to collect taxes from a foreign company.\n\u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Avi-Yonah said.\nWhile most lawmakers condemned the treatment of Apple, one prominent former senator said he was pleased to see Europe take action. Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when itexamined Apple\u2019s use of tax havens in 2013, said the European Commission should fill the vacuum left by lackadaisical tax enforcement in the United States.\n\u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.\u201d\nBlaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility.\nMrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent so-called corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States.\nThe news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of back-room deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Frank Ocean is taking delayed gratification to a new level with the extended release of his new album.\nOn Thursday night, two weeks after the expected on-sale date for this experimental R&B singer\u2019s second LP \u2014 and more than a year after a previously teased release date for the album, thought to be called \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d \u2014 Mr. Ocean proved once again to be unpredictable: Instead of a standard digital drop of new songs, he released \u201cEndless,\u201d a 45-minute \u201cvisual album\u201davailable for streamingexclusively via Apple Music.\nThe extended video \u2014 reminiscent of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d in length \u2014 features multiple likenesses of Mr. Ocean, in black and white, undertaking a construction project in what appears to be a warehouse. It is scored by previously unheard music from him, and he proceeds to build a spiral staircase in the middle of the room. The finished video resembles a stream that has played on and off for weeks onboysdontcry.co, a website affiliated with Mr. Ocean\u2019s new album.\nThe credit sequence for \u201cEndless\u201d lists 18 songs, including two ambient interludes and a cover of \u201cAt Your Best (You Are Love)\u201d by the Isley Brothers. Other song titles include \u201cAlabama,\u201d U-N-I-T-Y,\u201d \u201cCommes Des Garcons,\u201d \u201cWither,\u201d \u201cIn Here Somewhere,\u201d \u201cSideways,\u201d \u201cMine,\u201d \u201cHublots,\u201d \u201cSlide on Me,\u201d \u201cFlorida,\u201d \u201cDeathwish (ASR),\u201d \u201cRushes,\u201d \u201cRushes To\u201d and \u201cHiggs.\u201d Mr. Ocean is listed as the director, executive producer and creative director.\nFeatured artists include Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, who provided string orchestration, the producer Arca, the singer-songwriter Alex G, and the vocalists Jazmine Sullivan and Sampha.\nThose expecting a conventional album may have a bit more waiting to do \u2014 a representative for Apple Music said in a statement that fans should \u201ckeep an eye out this weekend for more from Frank.\u201d The release is also expected to include a printed publication called \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry.\u201d\nMr. Ocean has not released an album since his widely hailed debut,\u201cChannel Orange,\u201din 2012. He first announced the title for his follow-up three years ago and has surfaced in song only intermittently since, appearing as a vocalist or songwriter on albums by Kanye West and James Blake."

        "title": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?",
        "fulltext": "Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.\nThey became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\n\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.\nBut no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.\nFirst, consider the prosaic but consequential details leading to the Aug. 1 market shift. Tech companies have been moving upward in the rankings since the start of the bull market in March 2009, but recent earnings reports have accelerated matters. On July 28, Amazon issueda very strong report, which provided the impetus for its rise, in market cap, past two venerable companies, which regained their fourth and fifth place berths on Friday afternoon.\nOne of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.\nThe three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.\nVirtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.\nIn fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.\nBut the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.\nLast on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\n\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201d\nIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.\nBut this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.\nOn the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.\nIt\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.\nThese days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future."
