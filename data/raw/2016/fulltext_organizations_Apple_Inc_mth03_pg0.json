        "fulltext": "If you\u2019re looking for a sign of how widespread the debate between Apple and the F.B.I. about privacy has become, Tuesday delivered.\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill had their best shot yet to explore their views, addressing both the bureau and the company at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. Lawmakers at the hearing lobbed questions at two of the main figures in the debate: James B. Comey Jr., the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel.\nAnd asCecilia Kang and Eric Lichtblau reported, many lawmakers seemed torn over where to draw the line on privacy.\n\u201cThe big question for our country is how much privacy are we going to give up in the name of security,\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Mr. Comey, \u201cand there\u2019s no easy answer to that.\u201d\nAcross the country, in San Francisco, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and other administration officials visited the RSA Conference, arguably the world\u2019s largest gathering of computer security experts. In a speech at the event,Nicole Perlroth reported, Ms. Lynch emphasized the need to find common ground.\nLater in an interview on stage, Ms. Lynch said that the middle ground is to do \u201cwhat the law requires.\u201d The crowd responded with a smattering of laughter and hisses \u2014 suggesting, once again, that while the debate is widespread, it is far from settled."

Trump,told The Washington Posteditorial board that the United States should rethink its role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a proposition Mrs. Clinton said would be a \u201cgrave error.\u201d\n\u201cWe need steady, strong, smart minds and hands in the White House and the Situation Room to deal with the problems that we face around the world,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, without directing\n                                                mentioning Mr. Trump. \u201cI believe I have the track record, the experience and the temperament to do just that.\u201d\nShe did not directly respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism that she is \u201clow energy\u201d and lacks the stamina to be commander in chief. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to respond to his constant\n                                                stream of insults,\u201d she told CNN before she began a day of campaigning around Seattle on Tuesday. \u201cI find it really, at this point absurd.\u201d\nOn the day that Arizona, Idaho and Utah hold their Democratic nominating contests, Mrs. Clinton had to address foreign policy with a strong response to the deadly blasts at the Brussels airport and metro stations,\n                                                an event that was altering the conversation of the presidential campaign, which has morphed in recent days to feel more like a contest between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump.\n\u201cThe terrorists are trying to undermine the democratic values that are at the root of our way of life,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe cannot let them succeed. So we have to, you know, intensify\n                                                our efforts to keep America safe and to work with our friends and allies to help them be safe as well from these threats.\u201d\nBut she also cautioned against tactics like waterboarding (Mr. Trump has spoken in favor of such barred interrogation techniques). \u201cOur country\u2019s most experienced and bravest military leaders will\n                                                tell you that torture is not effective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does put our own soldiers, and increasingly our own civilians, at risk.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton will arrive in Silicon Valley later on Tuesday for fund-raisers and a campaign event on Wednesday, when she will inevitably face questions about the conflict between Apple and the F.B.I. after the\n                                                San Bernardino, Calif., shootings last year and whether law enforcement officials should have access to the attacker\u2019s iPhone.\nShe told CNN there was \u201cno getting around\u201d the toughening of \u201cour surveillance, surveillance and soft targets with greater police presence,\u201d but declined to say definitively if that\n                                                meant allowing additional surveillance of private communications.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that we can\u2019t find a reasonable path forward here,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cBoth to follow up on attacks and most importantly to protect them \u2014 and\n                                                that, you know, the privacy and safety of people who can lose their lives or be injured in an attack has to be weighed against the privacy and safety of our information.\u201d\nFind out what you need to know about the2016 presidential racetoday, and get politics news updates viaFacebook,Twitterandthe First Draft newsletter."

        "title": "Hunting the Genetic Signs of Postpartum Depression With an iPhone App",
        "fulltext": "With mothers and medical providers clamoring for answers about postpartum depression, scientists are beginning a major effort to understand the genetic underpinnings of mood disorders that afflict millions of women during and afterpregnancy.\nResearchers led by aUniversity of North Carolinateam will usea new iPhone appto recruit women who have hadpostpartum depression. The goal is to collect about 100,000 DNA samples and compare them with DNA from women who have never experienced depression in hopes of discovering genetic factors that could lead to better prediction, diagnosis and treatment for maternal mental illness.\nAttempts to find clear genetic clues to depression in the general population have yielded few results so far, and some experts questioned whether the new effort, announced Monday, would be any more promising. But the team\u2019s theory is that postpartum depression may be distinct, involving genes with more identifiable effects because they act during or soon after pregnancy.\n\u201cFrom a genetic standpoint, this is the right time biologically to do this,\u201d said Dr. Patrick F. Sullivan, director of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Center for Psychiatric Genomics, who will lead the project\u2019s genetic analysis.\nThe free app,PPD ACT, will be offered in the United States, Australia and Britain, and is likely to be extended to other countries, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the University of North Carolina\u2019s perinatal psychiatry program and the project\u2019s leader. \u201cTo make sure this is not just a study of iPhone-using people,\u201d Dr. Meltzer-Brody said, iPad versions of the app will be available in some urban and rural clinics, and patients who want to provide their DNA will \u201cright then and there be offered a spit kit.\u201d\nThe app, to bepromotedbyAppleas an expansion of its ResearchKit software for medical data collection, poses questions about sadness, anxiety or panic after childbirth in an effort to assess whether women have experienced serious postpartum depression. Women with high scores are asked if they want to submit DNA; if so, they will be mailed a kit to donate their saliva. Names and email addresses will be required, Dr. Meltzer-Brody said, but the project will encrypt personal data.\nOnce enough samples are collected, \u201ceach will be individually genotyped for something like 600,000genetic markersscattered throughout the genome,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said. The comparison group will be demographically similar women who have been pregnant at least twice but never experienced depression. \u201cAre there regions of the genome where women with postpartum depression differ systematically from women without?\u201d Dr. Sullivan asked.\nAnjene Addington, chief of the genomics research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, which is providing the kits to collect saliva, said the project aimed to collect thousands of DNA samples from a diverse group of women.\nAnswers to questions about depression screening and maternal mental illness, following new recommendations saying that women should be screened for depression during pregnancy and after childbirth.\n\u201cAs we learn more about genetic research on psychiatric disorders, we know that we need huge, huge numbers of participants,\u201d she said.\nCompared with many physical illnesses, the genetics of psychiatric disorders have so far proved complex and elusive to understand. Even one of the most heritable disorders,schizophrenia, appears linked to small variations in more than a hundred genetic regions. Recently, though, a genetic variant has been identified that seems to ignite excessive pruning of synapses in a key brain area in people with schizophrenia.\nDepression has been one of the toughest to figure out, partly because it affects different people in different ways.\n\u201cYou might have an 18-year-old woman who is doing self-cutting and she\u2019s got depression,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said, \u201cand a 64-year-old woman withhypertensionandType 2 diabetesand she\u2019s got depression.\u201d\nBecause postpartum depression afflicts a narrower group of women who have recently given birth, it may be easier to study, Dr. Sullivan said. He said he and some colleagues had recently conducted a study that suggested postpartum depression was more heritable than general depression. Dr. Addington said there might be genes that specifically influence a woman\u2019s sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations in pregnancy.\nBut David Goldstein, director of Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Genomic Medicine, who is not involved in the project, said another possibility was that postpartum depression\u2019s links to hormonal fluctuations, in addition to emotional and other stresses that can accompany having children, might indicate it was \u201cless likely to be genetic.\u201d\nHe said he had no objection to the project\u2019s goal, but \u201cit\u2019s possible that you can collect information from tens of thousands of individuals and not find anything.\u201d\nDr. Kenneth S. Kendler, director of psychiatric genetics research at Virginia Commonwealth University, who is not involved in the project, said some evidence suggested that genes involved in postpartum depression differed somewhat from those in general depression. Ideally, the project will find \u201cfewer gene variants involved and they are bigger in effect size,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable bet,\u201d Dr. Kendler added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a slam dunk.\u201d"

        "title": "U.S. Says It May Not Need Apple\u2019s Help to Unlock iPhone",
        "fulltext": "RIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 The Justice Department said on Monday that it might no longer need Apple\u2019s assistance in opening an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year.\nThe disclosure led a judge to postpone a court hearing over the issue and temporarily sidesteps what has become a bitter clash with the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company.\nIn a new court filing, the government said an outside party had demonstrated a way for the F.B.I. to possibly unlock the phone used by the gunman, Syed Rizwan Farook. The hearing in the contentious case \u2014 Apple has loudly opposed opening the iPhone, citing privacy concerns and igniting a heated debate \u2014 was originally set for Tuesday.\nWhile the Justice Department must test this method, if it works \u201cit should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple,\u201d it said in its filing. The Justice Department added that it would file a status report by April 5 on its progress.\nThe change is a reprieve in the clash that has erupted over how and when the authorities should use the troves of digital data collected and stored by tech companies. The two sides have traded barbs over the issue since last month, when Apple received a court order demanding that the company weaken the security of the iPhone so law enforcement officials could gain access to the data in it.\nThe case has been viewed as a watershed moment inthe debate over privacy and security.\nApplehad opposed the court order,arguing that it would be a slippery slope that could force the company to open many iPhones, thus compromising the privacy of its customers and the strength of its product security. President Obama said this month that the law enforcement authorities must be able to legally collect information from smartphones and other devices, adding that he opposed the stance on encryption taken by tech companies like Apple.\ntranscript\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) APPLE CEO TIM COOK, SAYING:\n\n\u201cWe built the iPhone for you - our customers and we know that it is a deeply personal device. For many of us, the iPhone is an extension of ourselves. About a month ago we asked Americans across the country to join in a conversation - we need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy. I\u2019ve been humbled and deeply grateful for the outpouring of support that we\u2019ve received from Americans across the country, from all walks of life. We did not expect to be in this position at odds with our own government but we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country. This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201d\nLate on Monday,Judge Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California who was set to hold the hearing, agreed to grant the Justice Department\u2019s motion to postpone the hearing.\nThe emergence of a potential third-party method to open the iPhone was a surprise, as the government said more than a dozen times in court filings that it could open the phone only with Apple\u2019s help. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., also reiterated that point several times during a hearing before Congress on March 1.\nThe new method could forestall, but is unlikely to entirely head off, a showdown between Silicon Valley and the Justice Department over encryption.\n\u201cThis will only delay an inevitable fight over whether the government can force Apple to break the security of its devices,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group.\nFor the Justice Department, cracking the iPhone would be a mixed blessing. While it would give investigators access to data that they see as crucial to a terrorism investigation, it would cut short the encryption debate that the F.B.I. had been trying to start for years before the Apple case came along.\nWhile contentious, the Apple case neatly crystallized that debate in a way that abstract discussions never had. The court fight, regardless of its outcome, would have increased the likelihood that Congress took up legislation to address the issue. Shelving the San Bernardino case could remove a sense of immediacy on the topic.\nThe case could flare anew in court if the third-party method for opening the iPhone falters. In a conference call late Monday, a federal law enforcement official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the government legally had to explore all outside methods of opening up the iPhone. If the government exhausted those options, then it could turn back to the courts to compel Apple to help open the device.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nThe law enforcement official declined to name the outside party that approached investigators with a possible method for opening the phone. He said that investigators were cautiously optimistic about getting data from the phone, but that further testing is required.\nThe government has been using the All Writs Act, a legal statute that dates to 1789, as a key underpinning of its case.\n\u201cThe issue at hand is whether the government can use the All Writs Act to force an unwilling third party, Apple, to create what it claims is a back door,\u201d said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who filed a brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department in this case. \u201c But if it can find a willing third party to break into the phone, then the All Writs Act argument is moot.\u201d\nIn a statement, Melanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the F.B.I. had continued to work on ways to gain access to the contents of the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, even as the fight between Apple and the government was unfolding.\nA senior Apple executive, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity late Monday, said should the government fail to unlock the phone and continue its fight with the company, Apple would want to know more about the outside party that has claimed it can break into the iPhone, in order to learn what methods could circumvent the company\u2019s security features. The executive said that Apple had no knowledge of what capability the government might soon have and that it learned about it on Monday.\nIn the meantime, Apple has continued to repeat its message of privacy.At a product event on Mondayat the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, emphasized a philosophy of helping to protect users\u2019 data.\n\u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility,\u201d Mr. Cook said."

        "title": "These Apps Promise to Encrypt Your Smartphone Communications",
        "fulltext": "THE topic of smartphone security and secure communication is front and center these days, thanks tothe battle between Apple and the F.B.I.over opening up an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., mass attackers.\nThe case has raised questions about what means people might have to protect their mobile data, shining the spotlight on the many apps that promise secure emailing, messaging and more.\nSignal, one of the best known private messaging apps, isfree on iOSandAndroid. Its makers promote it with the slogan \u201cprivacy is possible,\u201d and it uses end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the recipient of the communications can read them. Its encryption and privacy protections are highly rated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\nSignal\u2019s users can send secure messages and make Internet voice calls with their existing phone number, and there\u2019s no need to set up an account. The app is straightforward to use, with large icons and controls and large, easy-to-read text.\nTo talk, both parties must have Signal installed. And for an extra level of protection, which takes a little getting used to, both parties are shown a random pair of words that allows them to double-check that the other user is the right person. The technique brings spy movies to mind, but it\u2019s a strong reminder that you are taking part in a secure call.\nThreema delivers a similar service with a few more features. It also has end-to-end encryption, which is applied to all communication including text messages and files and images sent via the service. There\u2019s no voice call capability, but users can send voice messages. Both sender and recipient must have Threema installed.\nAdditionally, Threema allows users to hold group chats and to pose a question as a poll to group members. There\u2019s no need to open an account to use the app, because each user is assigned a random ID that isn\u2019t necessarily connected to an email address or phone number.\nThere\u2019s more to learn within Threema in terms of controls and menus, but they\u2019re relatively easy to master. The app is availableon iOS,AndroidandWindows Phone,and costs $3 ($2 on Windows).\nWickr Me, which isfree on iOSandAndroid, is something of a celebrity in this class of apps because it was featured in an Iggy Azalea music video. It also has fun touches, including the ability to add stickers, graffiti and filters to photos.\nBut at its heart, Wickr Me is a secure messaging app. Users can set an expiration time for messages, and it offers encryption for voice, text and video messages. A \u201cshredder\u201d function promises to securely erase all deleted messages and media from your device. Wickr Me also allows for anonymous use, so not even Wickr\u2019s makers know who its users are.\nFor a more traditional secure email app, check out ProtonMail.Free on iOSandAndroid, ProtonMail looks like a typical email app \u2014 except that all emails sent and received through it are encrypted. When you sign up for a free account, it\u2019s emphasized that if you forget your passwords, there\u2019s no way you can retrieve your emails.\nThe app\u2019s single purpose of delivering secure emails means ProtonMail is not the fanciest app in the world, but it\u2019s easy to use. The app works best when the sender and receiver both have ProtonMail, but there is a way to send encrypted messages from inside the app to more standard email addresses.\nAll of these apps help augment the encryption that may already be built into your device. (It\u2019s worth checking through your phone\u2019s settings to familiarize yourself with its privacy and security features.)\nSome secure messaging apps may be misused, which is why many of them ask upon sign-up that you won\u2019t use them for illegal purposes. And remember \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing as perfect security, particularly if you lose your phone.\nCola is a new messaging app (not one that promotes itself for its encryption) with the aim of simplifying the business of sending texts. As well as traditional message chats, Cola has \u201cbubbles\u201d that give people access to extras like polls, a friend locator and a neat \u201cWhen can we meet?\u201d system for quickly arranging group meet-ups. It\u2019s fun to use andfree on iOS, but is available only in the United States for now."

        "fulltext": "Because of a Trappist monk, Apple computer displays look the way they do today.\nThe monk was the Rev. Robert Palladino, who died on Feb. 26 at 83. A Roman Catholic priest who began his vocation in a monastic order, Father Palladino was alsoa world-renowned master of calligraphy.\n\u201cPriest and calligrapher,\u201d his business card read, in his unimpeachableRenaissance italic, and he long plied both trades at once. For years, babies he baptized received baptismal certificates in his flawless hand. In Oregon, where he made his home, Father Palladino hand-lettered the state medical licenses for generations of newly minted doctors.\nAs a Trappist brother, Father Palladino learned his art in silence, honed it over years of study and eventually, on leaving his order, taught it to others.\nTo his students, he brought a world of genteel scholarship and quiet contemplation; a world whose modus operandi \u2014by hand, with ink, on paper, parchment and vellum\u2014 was little changed for centuries; a world of classical music (an accomplished singer, he liked to ply his calligraphy to Beethoven), Gregorian chant and the Latin Mass, which he continued celebrating in discreet defiance long after Vatican II.\nInto that world burst a young college dropout named Steve Jobs.\nIt is a coincidence no less exquisite than Father Palladino\u2019s finest calligraphy that \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s future most famous screamer studied with a monk who spent years taking a vow of silence,\u201d as The Hollywood Reporter wrote shortly after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011.\nA character based on Father Palladino, played by the strapping young actor William Mapother, appears in \u201cJobs,\u201d the 2013 Hollywood film starring Ashton Kutcher. To reporters who asked Father Palladino whether he planned to see the film, he replied, characteristically, that he saw few movies of any kind.\nAn authority on the history, structure and aesthetics of scripts from antiquity to the present, Father Palladino taught calligraphy at Reed College in Portland, Ore., from 1969 until his retirement, in 1984.\nThe college\u2019s calligraphy program, which flourished from 1938 until Father Palladino\u2019s retirement, was widely regarded as the foremost in the country, training many respected artists, typographers and graphic designers. For decades, nearly every sign and poster on campus was the graceful fruit of its labor.\nMr. Jobs briefly attended Reed in 1972 before dropping out for economic reasons, but hung around campus for more than a year afterward; during that time, he audited Father Palladino\u2019s class. After helping to found Apple in 1976, he often creditedthe company\u2019s elegant onscreen fonts\u2014 and his larger interest in the design of computers as physical objects \u2014 to what he had been taught there.\n\u201cI learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great,\u201d Mr. Jobs said ina 2005 commencement address at Stanford. \u201cIt was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\u2019t capture, and I found it fascinating.\u201d He continued:\n\u201cTen years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it\u2019s likely that no personal computer would have them.\u201d\nAsked about his famous charge in a 2013 interview with The Catholic Sentinel, an Oregon publication, Father Palladino recalled, \u201cHe was most pleasant.\u201d\nThe word \u201ccalligraphy\u201d is born of Classical Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (kallos, \u201cbeautiful\u201d) and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9 (grapho, \u201cwrite\u201d). Though he was by all accounts too courtly to have said so, it would doubtless have pained Father Palladino \u2014 whom Mr. Jobs consulted on the design of the Mac\u2019s Greek letters \u2014 to see the flagrant unloveliness of the only Greek font at this newspaper\u2019s disposal.\nIn Father Palladino\u2019s hands, however, calligraphy was about far more than mere beautiful letters: It was about the ways those letters can be coaxed to nestle companionably together to make words, and how those words in turn can be assembled to form a meaningful text.\nWhether he was writing inthe Phoenician alphabet, the Hebrew, the Greek or the Roman \u2014 encompassing myriad forms, includingthe elegant square capitalscut into Roman monuments orthe curvaceous uncial scriptused by early medieval scribes \u2014 every stroke of Father Palladino\u2019s pen entailed meditative deliberation, historical fealty and not a single wasted movement.\nThe work was, for him, the logical culmination of a fascination with the art of the written word that had begun in boyhood.\nRobert Joseph Palladino was born in Albuquerque on Nov. 5, 1932. His paternal grandfather, Gaetano Palladino, was an Italian stonemason and architect who settled in New Mexico after he was engaged to build theSt. Francis Cathedralin Santa Fe.\nThe youngest of eight children, Robert had the opportunity to observe the handwriting of seven siblings before him, and he saw that it was good. He grew fascinated, he later said, by the sublime marriage of form and function that writing embodied, especially when it came to communicating the word of God.\nIn 1950, at 17, he joined a Trappist order in Pecos, N.M. He received his early calligraphic training under the monastery\u2019s scribe.\nIn 1955, after years of farming the unforthcoming New Mexico soil, the monastery moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. There, besides tending its orchards, Brother Robert served as the monastery\u2019s choirmaster, ran its book bindery and became its principal scribe.\n\u201cIn a silent monastery, signs do come in handy,\u201d hetold The Catholic Sentinel in 2011.\nHe was ordained a priest in 1958. But the reforms of Vatican II (1962-65) \u2014 including the dissolution of monastic silence, the supplanting of Gregorian chant by vernacular music and the replacement of Latin by modern languages \u2014 discomforted him, and in 1968 he left the monastery.\n\u201cYou cannot like that way of life unless you are completely enamored of it,\u201d Father Palladino, recalling his Trappist days, said in an unpublished memoir, written \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 entirely by hand. \u201cWhen it changed, I could no longer dedicate myself to it. It no longer satisfied my longing for union with God.\u201d\nSettling in Portland, he joined the Reed faculty the next year. In 1969 he traveled to Davenport, Iowa, for advanced study in calligraphy, stonecutting, art history, brush writing and lettering at St. Ambrose College, where he was a student ofFather Edward Catich, an eminent calligrapher and paleographer (< Greek \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9,palai, \u201clong ago,\u201d + \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9).\nDispensed from his priestly vows by Pope Paul VI, Mr. Palladino married Catherine Halverson, the principal clarinetist of the Portland Symphony, in 1969.\nTheir son, Eric, is his only immediate survivor. Father Palladino\u2019s death, at his home in Sandy, Ore., was announced by Reed College.\nCatherine Palladino died in 1987. In 1995 Father Palladino was readmitted to the priesthood, serving in Oregon parishes. He also taught calligraphy at Portland State University, the Pacific Northwest College of Art and elsewhere.\nThough Father Palladino demonstrably influenced Mr. Jobs, the converse cannot be said. To the end of his life, Father Palladino never owned, or even once used, a computer.\n\u201cI have my hand,\u201d he would say, \u201cand I have my pen. That\u2019s it.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch joined a parade of Obama administration officials to tech\u2019s home turf on Tuesday. Their message: National security depends on the industry\u2019s cooperation.\nThe heavyweights from Washington arrived against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone and a growing fissure between Washington and Silicon Valley.\nThe F.B.I. is trying to force Apple to write software to help it break into the phone of one of the gunmen in December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone is protected by a security scheme that would wipe its data after a series of incorrect password attempts. Apple has so far refused to cooperate, and the company is fighting a court order requiring it to aid investigators.\nIn a speech Tuesday at the RSA Conference, arguably the world\u2019s largest gathering of computer security experts, Ms. Lynch avoided directly addressing the fight with Apple, and emphasized the need to find middle ground.\n\u201cI know that neither our technology companies nor their leaders have any sympathy for terrorists or criminals who target Americans,\u201d Ms. Lynch told an audience at the city\u2019s Moscone Center. \u201cAnd the Department of Justice will never sacrifice the safety of the American people or the ideals we all cherish.\u201d\nBut in a stage interview with a Bloomberg journalist, Emily Chang, after her speech, Ms. Lynch was asked what the middle ground would be between the F.B.I. and Apple.\n\u201cFor me, the middle ground\u201d is to do \u201cwhat the law requires,\u201d Ms. Lynch responded, which drew a smattering of laughter and hisses from the audience. She said law enforcement has for years had Apple\u2019s help getting access to iPhones without controversy, and that \u201chaving the inability to obtain evidence that could save lives is a real risk.\u201d\nThough it is focused on a tough password mechanism, the Apple controversy is an extension of a decades-long fight between the tech industry and the federal government over the use of encryption technology. Once considered a carefully regulated munition, not unlike a tank, encryption came into wide use with the advent of the commercial Internet and was the key to modern e-commerce.\nThe encryption fight was considered by many in Silicon Valley to have been settled in the 1990s, but the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic revealed in documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, in 2013 led to the renewal of industry efforts to toughen security.\nApple\u2019s fight with the F.B.I. has added to that tension, and a number of other tech companies are expected in the coming days to file court briefs in support of Apple. Among their fears is that creating the software to break into the iPhone could create a backdoor that could be used repeatedly by law enforcement or the spy agencies of other countries.\nThe director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, also attempted a conciliatory tone at the RSA event. Admiral Rogers did not speak to the Apple case, or even mention the word encryption, but repeatedly emphasized the need for partnership and dialogue to fight cyberthreats. \u201cI implore all of us to be part of that constructive dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop talking past each other.\u201d\nIn a speech made nearby at San Francisco\u2019s Commonwealth Club, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter acknowledged that encryption had been a \u201chot topic here in the Bay Area,\u201d but said he could not address the Apple case because of the ongoing litigation. Instead, he noted that the Pentagon had a vested interest in strong encryption and that the Defense Department is \u201cthe largest user of encryption in the world.\u201d\nSecurity experts in the tech industry may not be so quick to embrace conciliation. \u201cYou\u2019re opening a can of worms,\u201d Ron Rivest, a cryptographer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a separate RSA audience.\n\u201cThe systems we have are so fragile that trying to have extra keys, or extra ways in, or ways to take them apart is asking for all kinds of trouble,\u201d Mr. Rivest said. \u201cThe good of the country depends on having strong security.\u201d\nOther cryptographers on the panel with Mr. Rivest agreed, with one notable exception: Adi Shamir, an Israeli cryptographer and co-inventor, with Mr. Rivest and Len Adleman, of the RSA encryption algorithm that became the namesake of the annual security conference.\nMr. Shamir argued that Apple had \u201cgoofed\u201d by not complying in the San Bernardino case and for not anticipating that the F.B.I. would ask for help to crack the shooter\u2019s iPhone password.\n\u201cEven though Apple helped in countless numbers of previous cases, they decided not to comply this time,\u201d Mr. Shamir said. \u201cMy advice would have been, comply this time, and wait for a better test case when the case is not so clearly in favor of the F.B.I.\u201d"

        "title": "To Woo Apple, Foxconn Bets $3.5 Billion on Sharp",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 The Apple iPhone transformed the technology industry by popularizing the smartphone and blazing a path to a mobile future. But to do it, the company needed an important ally: a penny-pinching Taiwan-based factory operator named Foxconn.\nEmploying hundreds of thousands of workers at vast facilities in mainland China, Foxconn figured out a way to assemble the iPhone at a cost low enough that middle-class Americans could afford it. The business offered low profit margins, but the work buffed Foxconn\u2019s financial results and cemented its status as the world\u2019s largest maker of hardware for companies like Apple and Sony.\nThose relationships are now shifting \u2014 and Foxconn is betting heavily to keep up.\nOn Wednesday, Foxconn said it had struck a deal to acquire control of the Japanese screen maker Sharp for $3.5 billion, after weeks of negotiations and high-profile setbacks.\nThe deal, for a 66 percent stake in Sharp, is intended to make Foxconn a more attractive partner for Apple. The American technology company uses Sharp screens, which could give Foxconn added leverage in dealings between the two.\nThe screen is an especially lucrative piece of the smartphone, costing as much as $54 each, according to estimates by the research firm IHS. Sharp provides roughly 25 percent of the iPhone displays, IHS said.\nStill, the Sharp purchase will saddle Foxconn with an ailing business that will take considerable money and effort to turn around, some analysts say. Reflecting those problems, the purchase price is $2 billion lower than a deal the two sides struck just last month, after Sharp disclosed the potential for costly problems \u2014 nearly $3 billion in potential liabilities \u2014 down the road.\nBut Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, giving some production contracts to other assemblers and component makers. And Foxconn is grappling with China\u2019s rising labor costs and a slowdown in the global smartphone market.\nThe deal highlights the huge pressure that the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics are placing on Foxconn.\n\u201cOn the one hand, you can see why Foxconn is trying to do it. It\u2019s not clear the economics make sense, but it\u2019s that they need to control more and more of the supply chain,\u201d said Willy C. Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. He noted that Apple might soon switch to screens made by other producers.\nThe deal follows months of back-and-forth talks about the terms, including the surprise disclosure last month of billions of dollars\u2019 worth ofpotential problemson Sharp\u2019s books. Acknowledging Sharp\u2019s poor performance, Terry Gou, Foxconn\u2019s founder and chairman, said in the news release that he was \u201cconfident that we will unlock Sharp\u2019s true potential.\u201d\nThe deal is a return to form for Foxconn \u2014 formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry \u2014 in its emphasis on scale. The company has been looking in recent years for ways to further cut costs, including investment in automation. It has also expanded into businesses potentially more lucrative than unskilled-work manufacturing, opening factories producing new technology like batteries for electric cars. It even created incubators to help hardware start-ups.\nFoxconn, most of whose factories are in China, is emblematic of the challenges facing the Chinese economy at large. Even while it tries to maintain the huge scale and efficiency of its production base, it is trying to climb the value chain to find new, more profitable streams of revenue.\nNear Beijing, Foxconn operates a hardware incubator called Innoconn, which helps start-ups with production management while looking for investment targets.\nLiu Haoyang, a founder of Noitom, a company that makes motion-capture sensors and hardware, said Foxconn had approached Noitom when it was seeking crowdfunding for a sample product in 2014. Ultimately, Foxconn gave Noitom advice, and it now helps Noitom produce, Mr. Liu said.\n\u201cThey make parts of high complexity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAverage factories aren\u2019t able to make this type of thing, never mind in small batches.\u201d\nFoxconn, founded in Taiwan as a maker of television knobs in 1974 by Mr. Gou, became a company with more than $100 billion in annual revenue by making things for other companies. Starting in the 1990s, as orders poured in to make personal computers, Mr. Gou built new and larger factories in China, culminating in the city-size Longhua plant in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.\nAt the Longhua complex, Foxconn coordinates more than 100,000 workers assembling devices \u2014 including the iPhone \u2014 in daily and nightly shifts, and the feeding, clothing and planning for the turnover of workers are gargantuan challenges. The company developed recreation facilities for the campus and designed a kitchen able to churn out the huge amounts of food necessary to feed tens of thousands of workers each day.\nA marvel of modern manufacturing, the Longhua plant is the most extreme example of Foxconn\u2019s philosophy of maximizing efficiency through enormous scale, though in some ways the Longhua plant has proved too large. It was there in 2010 that a series of worker suicides drew international scrutiny from workers\u2019 rights groups and the news media. The company put nets on the sides of buildings to catch would-be jumpers. On many buildings the nets still sag today.\nFoxconn\u2019s sales growth has slowed to single-digit percentages in the last two years from the double-digit growth it posted in the past, although profit growth has picked up recently, thanks in part to consumers buying bigger, more expensive phones with bigger screens.\nWhile Foxconn\u2019s revenue has been padded by booming orders for less-expensive Chinese-branded smartphones, increased competition from China-based suppliers has been a concern highlighted by analysts. Also, Apple, as part of its efforts to diversify its supply chain, has given orders for iPhone assembly to Pegatron, another Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, which operates a huge factory near Shanghai.\nFoxconn\u2019s previous takeovers of screen makers have not played out well. In 2010, it took over a Taiwan screen maker, Chimei Innolux, for nearly $10 billion; analysts say the acquisition has failed to produce the efficiencies and profitability hoped for.\nIn Sharp, Foxconn picks up screen-making operations that have long been unprofitable and costlier than those of its rivals in China. Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the Sharp acquisition would probably distract Foxconn from more important ventures, while also proving difficult to integrate and turn into a profitable business.\n\u201cTerry Gou is going to have to do some serious restructuring, spinouts, carve-outs, reduced head counts, centralizing things, and he\u2019ll have to do it at a distance, across a sea with management he doesn\u2019t really control,\u201d Mr. Moel said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d"
