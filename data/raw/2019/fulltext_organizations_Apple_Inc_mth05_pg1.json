        "title": "Trump Wants Your Tales of Social Media Censorship. And Your Contact Info.",
        "fulltext": "The Trump administration escalated its conflict with the tech industry on Wednesday, unveiling a website that asks people who think their viewpoints have been censored by social media platforms to share their stories \u2014 and their contact information.\nPresident Trump, who seems to relish little more than a tweet storm, has repeatedly attacked Google, Facebook and Twitter for what he alleges is their bias against and suppression of conservative users. The companies have repeatedly denied those accusations.\nThe website published by the White House on Wednesday took those complaints to a new level, marrying the president\u2019s online grievances to a data-gathering operation that could help him mobilize potential supporters during his re-election campaign.\nThe website\u2019s opening pagebegins with a caps-lock proclamation that sounds like an applause line from one of the president\u2019s raucous rallies: \u201cSOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS should advance FREEDOM OF SPEECH.\u201d\n\u201cToo many Americans have seen their accounts suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear \u2018violations\u2019 of user policies,\u201d the site tells visitors. \u201cNo matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with President Trump.\u201d\nIt then asks for a veritable wealth of personal data \u2014 including a visitor\u2019s first and last name, age, ZIP code, phone number and citizenship status \u2014 before ending with a disclaimer one might find in the packaging of a new tech gadget.\n\u201cPlease confirm that you accept the user agreement (which you can view at 45.wh.gov/8kk5X2) and that you understand this form is for information gathering only,\u201d the site tells visitors. \u201cThe White House cannot guarantee a response to submissions.\u201d\nConservatives have increasingly focused on the tech industry as a battleground in the culture wars, accusing companies like Google, Apple and Facebook of mistreating users who express conservative views or voice support for Mr. Trump.\nSeveral tech executives, including Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, have testified on Capitol Hill or met with Mr. Trump about those accusations.\n\u201cWe enforce the Twitter Rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation,\u201d a Twitter spokeswoman said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\u201d\nFacebook and YouTube declined to comment on the new White House site, which also asks visitors to share the URL of their social media accounts and a screenshot of any post they believe was censored by a tech company.\nThe president often credits Twitter with his political success, but he has eagerly attacked the tech industry and said Congress should exercise greater oversight of its activities.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t treat me well as a Republican,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in April, just before an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Dorsey. \u201cVery discriminatory, hard for people to sign on. Constantly taking people off list.\u201d\nMr. Trump attacked Twitterlast July, accusing the company (in a tweet, of course) of manipulating conservatives\u2019 posts so they were essentially invisible to other people on the platform, a practice called \u201cshadow banning.\u201d The company rejected that assertion, saying it does not shadow ban anyone.\nOne month later, in a series of early morning tweets,Mr. Trump attacked Google. He accused the company of intentionally burying positive stories about his administration in its search results, which the company denied. Later that day, he warned Google, Facebook and Twitter that they \u201chave to be careful.\u201d\nAnd in March, Dan Scavino, the White House social media director,accused Facebook of biasafter it temporarily blocked him from replying to comments on his personal Facebook page. Mr. Trump announced that he would look into the block, which Facebook said happened because its systems had mistakenly flagged Mr. Scavino as a bot.\nThe conservative campaign against the internet industry became more heated last summer after Apple, Google and Facebookremoved content from Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist who runs the site Infowars.\nMr. Jones interviewed Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign (Mr. Trump told Mr. Jones, \u201cYour reputation is amazing\u201d) and has been a vocal supporter of his administration.\nThis month, Facebook banned seven controversial accounts \u2014 most of the individuals are conservatives, including Mr. Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart News editor \u2014 from its platform, provoking a new round of bias accusations from conservatives.\nMr. Trump, who has resisted all efforts from advisers and lawyers to limit his Twitter use, views the social media platform as a critical tool in his presidency.\nHe routinely credits Twitter for his political success, calling it a \u201ctremendous platform\u201d that allows him to circumvent what he deems to be unfair media coverage and speak directly to his base of supporters.\n\u201cI doubt I would be here if it weren\u2019t for social media, to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview in 2017."

        "title": "We Are Drowning in Data",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of a limited-run newsletter. You cansign up here.\nSince the start of theThe Privacy Project, I\u2019ve spent hours talking to researchers, privacy professionals, think tankers, and government and tech company workers. I\u2019ve listened to heady discussions aboutdigital privacy, artificial intelligence and free will; consulted lawyers who\u2019ve explained the thorny way in whichthe law can seem inadequatein the face of rapid technological progress; and played out endless nightmare scenarios in which the glut of data we create might be used against us. I\u2019ve even combed through the brain-numbing legalese ofdozens of tech company privacy policies. This, I\u2019d hoped, might bring about some sense of clarity on the subject.\nWishful thinking! The conversations and stories mapped constellations of technical problems, horror stories and ethical quandaries, some with no clear answer. Far from clarifying anything, every issue seemed to crash into the one before it, rendering it more complex.\nYou can worry about government data collection and dream up solutions to rein it in only to learn of the challenge of the thousands ofprivate companies that outsourcetheirdata sets to the government. Then there\u2019s the online advertising industry, which runs on the obsessivegathering of our personal information both online and offline. Just to understand how it works requires making senseof this byzantinechartabove, which maps the 7,040 companies thatslice, track,re-target and bid on yourdata to make ads appear on your screens\u2014 also known as \u201cmarketing technology landscape.\u201d\nIn the privacy world, the good and bad actors are often difficult to separate. Governments and law enforcement are ramping up smart-city and facial-recognition infrastructure to keep citizens safe and might be installing thearchitecture for a powerful, always-on surveillancestate. One biometrics and facial recognition company executive \u2014 whose products are used by both governments and retailers \u2014 described his industry to me recently as tiptoeing \u201ca gray line\u201d between security and snooping. \u201cIt is difficult \u2014 I can\u2019t always say if it is intrusive surveillance or not,\u201d he said.\nIn China, thereis no gray line\u2014 the country has fully embraced a \u201cvast surveilled and censored domestic market\u201d that it hasbegun to exportto other countries.\nTo make matters more difficult, innovation continues to outpace both legislation and our ability to have important conversations about the future we\u2019re building. New technologies,like 5G wireless, have the potential to add trillions of dollars and millions of jobs to our economy. It\u2019s also, as arecent New Yorker piece warned, \u201ca system built on millions of cell relays, antennas, and sensors\u201d that \u201coffers previously unthinkable surveillance potential.\u201d\nAt afacial-recognitionconference last week, I watched vendors pitch and sell easy-to-use technology that would allow anyone with enough money and a camera to record, identify, track and store every individual who passes by, complete with customizable \u201cwatch lists.\u201d And while the vendors I spoke with stressed that they\u2019ve baked privacy safeguards into their products, one confessed \u201cwe can vet our clients but can\u2019t always control how they use it once it\u2019s in their hands.\u201d\nSpend enough time in this world and it\u2019s clear that we are drowning in unfathomable amounts of data. Most of it is invisible to the naked eye and yet likely to shape our lives. It\u2019s all quite overwhelming. As one reader, an activist in the Catskills who recently led a successful campaign to bring broadband internet to her rural region, emailed me recently, our privacy crisis is enough to make us rethink the promise of the technology in the first place.\n\u201cWe fear (know) identities will be stolen, data compromised, retirement accounts hacked, and innocence utterly violated nearly on a daily basis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd to think I worked so hard to bring broadband to town. Sometimes I think it will be the singular reason I\u2019ll miss out on heaven.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy and understandable to despair like this. Just as it\u2019s easy for critics to suggest that those overwhelmed by the current privacy landscape are alarmists or doomsayers. I see it as something more productive and empowering; that sinking feeling isn\u2019t an admission of defeat but an acknowledgment that taking control of our data matters. It\u2019s the first step in a true digital privacy reckoning.\nThis week\u2019s pick is an investigative reportpublished in The Times in September 1997with the juicy tag line \u201cElectronic Eyes: What the Computer Knows.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a great yarn with plenty of corporate intrigue, including \u201cData Moles!\u201d But more important, it details how our personal information was leaky even on the earliest iterations of the commercial internet. For example:\n\u201cNow it isn't just retired F.B.I. agents or ex-cops,\u201d said Mr. Schweitzer, who pleaded guilty to buying earnings information from a Social Security Administration databank. \u201cNow every Tom, Dick and Harry has a web page offering this stuff.\u201d\nAnd as always, the archive piece is a great reminder that the more things change, the more they stay the same:\nEven if the targets of such scrutiny find out, redress is an uphill fight under laws that sometimes seem better designed to protect the privacy of corporations than of individuals.\nThis tip comes from our colleagues at The Wirecutter. It\u2019s an excerpt from their fantastic privacy tips column, which you canread in full here.\nWhy:Phone and computer operating systems, Web browsers, popular apps and even smart-home devices receive frequent updates with new features and security improvements. These security updates are typically far better than antivirus software at thwarting hackers.\nHow:All three major operating systems can update automatically, but you should take a moment to double-check that you have automatic updates enabled for your OS of choice:Windows,MacOSorChrome OS. Although it\u2019s frustrating to turn your computer on and have to wait out an update thatmight break the software you use, thesecurity benefits are worth the trouble. These updates include new versions of Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser and Apple\u2019s Safari. Most third-party web browsers, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, also update automatically. If you tend to leave your browser open all the time, remember to reboot it now and again to get those updates. Your phone also has automatic-update options. On Apple\u2019s iPhone, enable automatic updates under Settings > General > Software Update. On Google\u2019s Android operating system, security updates should happen automatically, but you can double-check by opening up Settings > System > Advanced > System Update.\nFor third-party software and apps, you may need to find and enable a \u201ccheck for updates\u201d option in the software\u2019s settings. Smart-home devices such as cameras, thermostats and light bulbs can receive updates to the app as well as to the hardware itself. Check the settings using the device\u2019s app to make sure these updates happen automatically; if you don\u2019t find an automatic-update option, you may have to manually reboot the device on occasion (a monthly calendar reminder might help).\nThe following question has been edited for length and clarity.\nQ:For the past year or two, I have been a sort of ghost on social media. At 23 years old, my behavior is pretty rare.\nOne of my greatest anxieties going into any family gathering is about how it will lead to my unwilling presence on Facebook. I always come across as a jerk when I ask my mother not to take pictures or beg for us to \u201cstay in the moment.\u201d No one listens to me! After all, how could I, the baby, know more about social media\u2019s effects on the brain and our privacy than my 60+-year-old folks? Do you have any suggestions for content I could share with my folks to try and show them that my getting moody every time the phone is taken out (usually 20-30 times per gathering) is not just a restaging of my rebellious teen phase? I don\u2019t want to be so resentful about this valuable quality time anymore. And I don\u2019t want my mom\u2019s last words on her deathbed to be \u201cOoh, let\u2019s take a picture!\u201d\nA:I chose this question because it hits on a traditional understanding of privacy \u2014 one that has less to do with data and more to do with feeling as if the performative, public world of social media has crept into private spaces.\nThere\u2019s no easy answer here. If your family members take great pleasure in being constantly connected, that\u2019s their choice. But you can talk to them about how it affects youas well as the way in which you feel they might not be present when you\u2019re together. Try not to be too judgmental but communicate what you miss about spending time with them in an era before constant smartphone use. Maybe suggest activities during family gatherings that are more active (maybe outside excursions) where people will be less likely or even unable to check their phones.\nLast, there are a few great books written recently about the way we interact with our phones and technology \u2014 what it might be doing to our brains and relationships as well as how to amend those habits. One is Cal Newport\u2019s \u201cDigital Minimalism,\u201d which works off the premise that Steve Jobs designed the iPhone to be a tool, not the dominant force in our lives. Another is Catherine Price\u2019s \u201cHow to Break Up With Your Phone,\u201d which details how to find a healthy way to manage the black mirror in our pockets.\nA year ago Europe passed sweeping privacy legislation.CNBC took a look at where it has fallen short.\nI loved this piece on Facebook\u2019s messaging \u201cpivot\u201d and how the company is\u201ctrying to make the word \u2018private\u2019 meaningless.\u201d\nHere\u2019s an interesting (and imperfect) argument:Should tech companies be taxed for using our data?\nAneye-opening story about a facial-recognition company(backed by Mark Cuban) and how it attempted to work with police.\nFollow@privacyprojecton Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section onFacebookandInstagram."
