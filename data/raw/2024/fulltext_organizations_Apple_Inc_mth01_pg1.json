        "title": "I Was Addicted to My Smartphone, So I Switched to a Flip Phone for a Month",
        "fulltext": "This time of year, everyone asks what you like least about your life, but they phrase it as, \u201cWhat\u2019s your New Year\u2019s resolution?\u201d\nMy biggest regret of 2023 was my relationship to my smartphone, or my \u201ctech appendage\u201d as I\u2019ve named it in my iPhone settings. My AppleScreen Timereports regularly clocked in at more than five hours a day.\nThat\u2019s only an hour more than theaverage American, but I still found it staggering to think that I spent the equivalent of January, February and half of March looking at that tiny screen (April too, if we only count waking hours).\nSure, some (much?) of that time was gainfully spent on activities that enrich my life or are unavoidable: work, family text threads, reading the news and keeping up with far-flung friends. But I reached for the device more than 100 times each day according to my report. And that grasping was increasingly accompanied by the kind of queasy regret that I associate with unhealthy behavior \u2014 that feeling I get after I drink too many glasses of wine, finish the whole bag of sour gummies or stay at the poker table when I\u2019m on tilt.\nSo this December, I made a radical change. I ditched my $1,300 iPhone 15 for a $108 Orbic Journey \u2014 a flip phone. It makes phone calls and texts and that was about it. It didn\u2019t even have Snake on it.\nIt may seem strange to go retro in the age of ChatGPT,artificial intelligence-powered personal stylistsandNeuralink brain implants. But with advanced technology poised to embed itself more deeply in my life (not my brain, though \u2014 please, never my actual brain), it seemed a perfect time to correct course with the existing tech that already felt out of my control.\nMaking the switch was neither easy nor fast. The decision to \u201cupgrade\u201d to the Journey was apparently so preposterous that my carrier wouldn\u2019t allow me to do it over the phone. I had to go to the store.\nMy 7-year-old stared in disbelief at the technological relic on display beside a collection of sleeker devices with touch screens. \u201cThat\u2019s the phone you want? Are you joking?\u201d she asked, rubbing her fingers over the Orbic Journey\u2019s plastic keys.\nIt wasn\u2019t my first choice. The Journey has beenpannedby \u201cdumbphone\u201d connoisseurs. Not only is the battery life laughably short, it loses service when it\u2019s on the move and has to be rebooted to reconnect. But it was the only so-called minimalist phone that mylow-budget carriersupported. (Ask your own carrier about what models it will support if you embark on a similar journey.)\nThere are superior options with reliable service available, and some even have mapping capabilities, music players and voice to text. The minimalist market has expanded in recent years, said Jose Briones, who created a \u201cdumbphone finder\u201d to help people choose from 98 models he has tried. (The Journey did not make the list.)\n\u201cPeople are digitally fatigued after the pandemic, after having to be online all the time,\u201d said Mr. Briones, 28, who is still online enough to manage theDumbphone subredditand regularly post reviews of the devices on YouTube.\nMr. Briones still uses a smartphone during work hours, but at night, on weekends and during vacations, he switches to a $299 Light Phone II.\nThat device was \u201cdesigned to be used as little as possible\u201d by two founders put off by tech developers who measure success by how many hours users spend glued to their apps. The credit card-size phone can text, make calls, keep a calendar, play music and podcasts, but doesn\u2019t do much more than that.\nBoth the Light Phone and Mr. Briones\u2019s smartphone, the $480Hisense A9, have e-ink screens, like a Kindle\u2019s.\n\u201cI have found personally that the more boring the screen,\u201d Mr. Briones said, \u201cthe easier it is to not be addicted to it.\u201d\n(Research bears that out. Simply switching a smartphone to grayscale mode helped people reduce their screen time by 18 percent inone study.)\nThe Journey\u2019s level of boringness was reassuring. Its main screen was tiny and dull; a smaller one on the outside displayed the time. When I got it home, I had trouble switching my service from the iPhone\u2019s eSIM to the flip phone\u2019s physical one. But soon, I was slowly typing out texts and emoticons using just 9 keys. :-/\nTexting anything longer than two sentences involved an excruciating amount of button pushing, so I started to call people instead. This was a problem because most people don\u2019t want their phone to function as a phone.\nOn my first afternoon, I needed to ask a parent friend for a complicated logistical favor, so I called her and explained the situation to her voice mail. I didn\u2019t hear back and realized why when I opened my personal MacBook that evening. She had texted me, but Apple had routed it to my iMessages rather than my phone. (Clawing back my communications from Apple required signing out of FaceTime on every one of its devices.)\nAt least she had listened to my voice mail. Others I left were never acknowledged. It was nearly as reliable a method of communication as putting a message in a bottle and throwing it out to sea.\nWhen friends and family did pick up the phone, the conversations went far deeper than a text exchange would have. I had a heart-to-heart with a college friend one morning while walking my dog. She sent me a lengthy text afterward thanking me for some advice I had given her.\nI replied with a simple <3. On a dumbphone, your emotions are all straightforward \u2014 no complicated emoji shrimp-meets-smirk-meets-crown to decipher.\nColleagues, friends, and loved ones who saw the device in my hand or noticed my text bubbles go green were equal parts skeptical and envious. \u201cI wish I could do that,\u201d was a refrain I heard so often that I now think Dry January should be followed by Flip Phone February.\nMy black clamshell of a phone had the effect of a clerical collar, inducing people to confess their screen time sins to me. They hated that they looked at their phone so much around their children, that they watched TikTok at night instead of sleeping, that they looked at it while they were driving, that they started and ended their days with it.\nIn a 2021 Pew Research survey, 31 percent of adults reported being \u201calmost constantly online\" \u2014 a feat possible only because of the existence of the smartphone.\nThis was the most striking aspect of switching to the flip. It meant the digital universe and its infinite pleasures, efficiencies and annoyances were confined to my computer. That was the source of people\u2019s skepticism: They thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to function without Uber, not to mention the world\u2019s knowledge, at my beck and call. (I grew up in the \u201990s. It wasn\u2019t that bad. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af)\n\u201cDo you feel less well-informed?\u201d one colleague asked.\nNot really. Information made its way to me, just slightly less instantly. My computer still offered news sites, newsletters and social media rubbernecking.\nTrue, being deprived of the smartphone and its apps was sometimes highly inconvenient:\nI\u2019ve got an electric vehicle, and upon pulling into a public charger, low on miles, realized that I could not log into the charger without a smartphone app.\nPlanning ahead was a necessity without Google Maps because I typically use it to get anywhere more than 15 minutes away. I had to look up routes in advance and memorize the directions, reinvigorating a navigational part of my brain that had long been neglected.\nI received a robot vacuum for Christmas \u2026 which could only be set up with an iPhone app.\nMidway through the month, I got an \u201calert\u201d email from my bank: I\u2019d overdrawn my checking account. I usually monitor my balance on the bank\u2019s smartphone app, and move money from a high-yield savings account when it\u2019s getting low. I\u2019d forgotten about this, and had also been procrastinating on a trip to the bank to deposit a paper check \u2014 something I usually do by snapping a photo of it in the mobile app. Whoops!\nMany of my online accounts, including the New York Times one that allows me to sign into its content management system to draft stories, require two-factor authentication via a smartphone app. Since you are reading this story, I clearly cheated on this one by turning on my smartphone and using it on Wi-Fi to get the code I needed.\nDespite these challenges, I survived, even thrived during the month. It was a relief to unplug my brain from the internet on a regular basis and for hours at a time. I read four books. I did a very cool,\u201cmagic\u201d jigsaw puzzle. I went on long runs with my husband, during which we talked, rather than retreating into separate audio universes with AirPods. I felt that I had more time, and more control over what to do with it.\nAfter about two weeks, I noticed I\u2019d lost my \u201cthumb twitch\u201d \u2014 a physical urge to check my phone in the morning, at red lights, waiting for an elevator or at any other moment when my mind had a brief opportunity to wander.\n\u201cYour face looks less stressed,\u201d my husband observed, when I asked him if he\u2019d noticed any changes in me.\nI struggle with middle of the night wake-ups. The night before the switch to the flip phone, I woke up at 1 a.m. and reached for my iPhone. I was then up until 4 a.m. holiday shopping and readinga long yarnabout the mysterious deaths of two mountaineers in 1973.\nBut the Journey held no midnight enticements and my sleep improved dramatically. I still woke up but regularly fell back asleep within a few minutes.\n\u201cOur health is competing with many of these services and companies that are vying for our time and our energy and our attention,\u201d said Matthew Buman, a professor of movement sciences at Arizona State University.\nDr. Buman just completed astudyfunded by the National Institutes of Health into strategies to get people off screens and moving more, from motivational messages when they\u2019ve been on the screen too long (\u201cYou\u2019re close to your goal. You can do this!\u201d) to awarding screen time based on hitting exercise goals.\nHe hopes that the smartphone giants Apple and Google will make their screen time and well-being apps more effective by incorporating strategies that are proved to work. Dr. Buman\u2019s program helped reduce the screen time of the 110 people in the two-year study, but he\u2019s still assessing the findings to figure out which strategies were the most effective.\nI told Dr. Buman about my own strategy \u2014 the flip phone. He said it probably made my mind feel more free and feel as if I had more time (both true), but that \u201cin our society, it\u2019s hard to sustain that in the long term.\u201d\nDr. Buman, meet Logan Lane, 19. She first got an iPhone when she was 11, but came to hate how it made her feel so she switched to a flip phone. In 2021, when she was in high school in Brooklyn, she foundedthe Luddite Clubfor fellow students who wanted to distance themselves from technology and social media. Now a freshman at Oberlin College in Ohio, she is still a proud owner of a TCL FLIP. She told me that she hoped to remain smartphone-free for the rest of her life and to one day be a \u201cmom with a flip phone.\u201d\nI asked my 7-year-old what she thought of this \u201cflip phone mom.\u201d\n\u201cI like it better. You don\u2019t look at your phone as much and you spend more time playing with me,\u201d she said, making me feel both wonderful and terrible.\nThe part of my brain that wanted to Instagram every cute moment with my daughters withered away over the course of the month. I could just enjoy those moments rather than trying to capture them for others. I did take a handful of low-resolution, often-blurry photos with the Journey\u2019s subpar camera. In this way, it reminded me of my own childhood. I have four good photos from Christmas this year rather than 100 or so.\nMy social circle shrank for the month. I didn\u2019t send a blast of \u201cHappy New Year\u201d texts (too hard via flip) and I disappeared from Instagram (causing one friend to send me an \u201care you OK?\u201d message). You might think I would have FOMO, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 maybe because all the interactions Iwashaving felt richer.\nAs much as I loved my flip phone life and the mental reset it provided, I think I might get fired if I failed to respond in a timely manner to Slack messages and emails as often as I did in the month. (Editor\u2019s note: This is unfounded projection, clearly masking a deep and uncontrollable desire to return to the smartphone.)So I do plan to return to my iPhone in 2024, but in grayscale and with more mindfulness about how I use it.\nWhat doesn\u2019t help people control their screen time issimply keeping track of it, Laura Zimmermann, an assistant professor at IE Business School in Madrid, told me. She does research on consumer technology interaction and has been studying Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s tools since they came out five years ago. Beyond tracking, the tools allow users to set time limits on particular apps, but these limits are easily overridden.\nSo much of our smartphone use is mindless, she said. We open the phone to do one thing, and then wind up checking five apps in a loop \u2014 and then do it all again a few minutes later.\n\u201cYou really want to tackle the habit formation process,\u201d she said.\nWith that in mind, I created a designated spot for my phone at home \u2014 a little coffee table with a plant and a charger. I\u2019ll keep it there when I\u2019m not working, so that it\u2019s not on my person all the time and I can\u2019t thoughtlessly paw at it. That\u2019s where it will live at night, too, so it\u2019s not by my bedside disrupting my sleep. I hope the sense of well-being this brings suffices as an enforcement mechanism.\nSome tech critics, however, are skeptical thatindividual strategiesare the way forward.\n\u201cMore and more people are starting to see that these platforms, these products are intentionally designed to be addictive,\u201d said Camille Carlton, a policy manager at the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit in California founded by former tech employees to raise awareness about the negative effects of the kinds of products they worked on.\nMs. Carlton compared smartphones and social media apps to junk food and tobacco, and suggested that lawmakers should regulate the design of these products to protect our health.Britain\u2019s rulesfor tech products aimed at children, discouraging the use of infinite scroll, autoplay and addictive design features such as Snapchat streaks, were \u201cfantastic,\u201d she said. (Similar laws in the United States have been challenged by tech companiesas unconstitutional.)\nFor now, though, it\u2019s up to us.\nAnd if you decide to do a February Flip Phone detox, I\u2019d love to hear about it: kashmir.hill@nytimes.com. :-)\nAudio produced byTally Abecassis."

        "title": "Microsoft Tops Apple to Become Most Valuable Public Company",
        "fulltext": "For more than a decade, Apple was the stock market\u2019s undisputed king. It first overtook Exxon Mobil as the world\u2019s most valuable public company in 2011 and held the title almost without interruption.\nBut a transfer of power has begun.\nOn Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple, claiming the crown after its market value surged by more than $1 trillion over the past year. Microsoft finished the day at $2.89 trillion, higher than Apple\u2019s $2.87 trillion, according to Bloomberg.\nThe change is part of a reordering of the stock market that was set in motion by the advent of generativeartificial intelligence. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value.\nWhen Apple replaced Exxon, it ushered in an era of tech supremacy. The values of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google dwarfed former market leaders like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and General Motors.\nThe tech industry still dominates the top of the list, but the companies with the most momentum have put generative A.I. at the forefront of their future business plans. The combined value of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, increased by $2.5 trillion last year. Their performances outshined Apple, which posted a smaller share price increase in 2023.\n\u201cIt simply comes down to gen A.I.,\u201d said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. Generative A.I. will have an impact on all of Microsoft\u2019s businesses, including its largest, he said, while \u201cApple doesn\u2019t have much of an A.I. story yet.\u201d\nMicrosoft and Apple declined to comment.\nMicrosoft has not led a technology transition since the personal computing era, when its Windows operating system dominated sales. It was late to the internet, mobile phone and social media.\nWhen Satya Nadella became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive in 2014, the company was floundering. He refocused it on the growing cloud computing business, turning it into a strong challenger to Amazon, the pioneer in the field. Then Mr. Nadella pushed the company forward again, making an aggressive bet on generative A.I.\nIn 2019, Mr. Nadella made Microsoft\u2019s first of several investments in OpenAI, the start-up that would build the A.I.-powered ChatGPT chatbot. In the end of the summer of 2022, he was impressed by a preview of OpenAI\u2019s underlying technology, known as GPT-4, andsoon began proddingMicrosoft to add generative A.I. to its products at what he called a \u201cfrantic pace.\u201d\nHe started with adding a chatbot to the Bing search engine, but then began pushing A.I. into the Windows operating system and productive applications like Excel and Outlook, and offering OpenAI\u2019s systems to customers of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s flagship cloud computing product.\nThe revenue hasonly just started to show upin Microsoft\u2019s financial results. Generative A.I. accounted for about three percentage points of growth to Azure in the three months that ended in September, and the $30-a-month offering inside Microsoft\u2019s productivity software began a general release only in November.\n(The New York Times hassuedOpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement.)\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Microsoft has pulled ahead of Apple in recent years. It did so in 2018, as its cloud-computing business began to flourish, and in 2021, when the pandemic disrupted Apple\u2019s iPhone operations. But this change could be more indicative of a fundamental shift in the tech industry.\n\u201cThe question is: Who has the better mouse trap to go to the next level of $3.5 trillion?\u201d said Dan Morgan, portfolio manager and analyst at Synovus Trust, a bank in the Southeast. \u201cYou can make the case that Microsoft is in the better position. Apple has been struggling for the next big thing.\u201d\nThe iPhone, which debuted in 2007, catapulted Apple to the top of the stock market. Between 2009 and 2015, the company went from selling 20 million iPhones a year to more than 200 million.\nWhen device sales slowed in recent years, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, shifted the company\u2019s focus from selling more iPhones to selling people more apps and services on their existing iPhones. The strategy helped Apple\u2019s annual revenue soar to $383 billion, a nearly fourfold increase from the end of 2011, the year that Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, died.\nMr. Cook\u2019s strategy has shown signs of fatigue. The iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s revenue, has become known more for its incremental improvements each year than its noteworthy innovations. Purchases of iPads and Macs have declined. And the sales growth of its services such as Apple Music are slowing.\nLast year, the company\u2019s sales fell for four consecutive quarters. But shares of Apple still rose around 50 percent last year, and investors lifted its market value to nearly $3 trillion because of their belief that demand for the iPhone would continue.\nWall Street analysts have predicted that this year\u2019s iPhone sales will be weak. The company is facing challenges in China, where Huawei has released a new phone and the government is restricting the use of foreign smartphones.\nWhile Microsoft and others have been building new generative A.I. businesses, Apple has been absent from the conversation. During a call with analysts last year, Mr. Cook said Apple had work \u201cgoing on\u201d connected to A.I., but he declined to elaborate.\nLast year, Apple engineers weretesting a large language model, which can power a chatbot, The Times reported. The company has alsoheld discussions with publishersabout acquiring material to train generative A.I. systems. But it has yet to release anything publicly.\n\u201cApple needs to take note that if they want to maintain their spot as one of the most innovative tech companies, they have to get behind A.I. in a big way,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\nApple has been focused on the release of an augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. The device, which will ship Feb. 2, is the first major new product category that the company has released since the Apple Watch in 2014. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units."

        "title": "Apple Takes Messaging Crackdown to Customers\u2019 Macs",
        "fulltext": "When Appleblocked the Beeper Mini app last monthfrom giving Android users access to the tech giant\u2019s messaging service, Beeper encouraged customers to use their Mac computers instead to connect and continue sending messages.\nBut in recent days, dozens of Beeper customers have reported that they no longer have access to Apple\u2019s messaging service on their Android phones or their Mac computers. Several have called Apple\u2019s customer support and been told that the company had revoked their Mac\u2019s access to iMessage because of irregular activity. None had been warned that they would be losing the service.\nFor Beeper customers, many of whom prefer Android devices to iPhones but favor Mac computers over PCs, Apple\u2019s move shows just how far the company will go to maintain control over its services. In these instances, Apple cut off one of the services that it provided with its computers because it had objected to the way its customers used it.\n\u201cLegally, they\u2019re probably in the clear because of their terms of service, but it\u2019s still kind of crappy,\u201d said Matvei Vevitsis, who noticed this month that he could no longer send his mother iMessages through his 12-inch MacBook.\nApple declined to comment. After The New York Times contacted Apple, some Beeper customers began reporting that they had been unblocked in recent days.\nThe maneuver is the latest in a tit-for-tat between Apple and Beeper that has gotten the attention of antitrust regulators. Last year,the Justice Department met with Beeper\u2019s leadership team about Apple\u2019s actions, and the Federal Trade Commission said in a blog that it would scrutinize \u201cdominant\u201d players that \u201cuse privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability\u201d between services.\nBeeper Mini debuted on Dec. 5 as an app that offered Android phone users the ability to send encrypted messages to iPhones. It made it possible for people with Samsung and Google devices to send high-resolution videos and use perks like animations, which had previously been reserved for iPhone customers. Within three days, the app had added 100,000 customers.\nBut Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created security and privacy risks.\nBeeper then came up with a solution to maintain its service. It asked customers to use their Mac computers to get a registration code for iMessage and to use that to log into Beeper on an Android device.\nMr. Vevitsis, 31, said he had used a MacBook from around 2015 to connect Beeper to Apple\u2019s messaging service on his Samsung Galaxy phone. A self-proclaimed tech tinkerer, he prefers using Android phones because the system is more customizable than an iPhone. But his mother has an iPhone, and he wanted to be able to send her high-quality photos and videos.\nEarly this year, Beeper stopped working, and Mr. Vevitsis was no longer able to send his mother messages. He opened his MacBook and tried to message her directly but had the same problem, so he called Apple support.\n\u201cApple told me my iMessage had been flagged for spam,\u201d he said. The Apple support representative had offered to unblock him, but that didn\u2019t solve the problem. Ultimately, he downloaded an app that allowed him to create an alternative serial number for his MacBook and was able to begin using iMessages again.\nBeeper said more than two dozen of some 3,500 customers had reported similar outages on their Macs. Several of those customers spoke with The Times and provided records and details of their conversations with Apple support.\nGhazi Shami,the founder of Empire, an independent music company in San Francisco, said he had run into similar trouble. Like Mr. Vevitsis, Mr. Shami prefers using a Galaxy to an iPhone, but many musicians send audio recordings with iMessage. Mr. Shami would connect to Beeper using his iMac Pro desktop so that he could send and receive those recordings from his phone.\nBut late last year, he said, Beeper stopped working and iMessage shut down on his iMac, which Apple priced at $5,000 when it was released in 2017.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the spirit of Silicon Valley to block someone\u2019s serial number because they were testing beta software,\u201d Mr. Shami said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re reprimanding schoolchildren.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Applesaid on Wednesday that it would begin selling its flagship smartwatches without the ability to detect people\u2019s blood-oxygen levels.\nThe tech giant will drop the feature starting Thursday afterlosing a patent caseover its blood-oxygen measurement technology two months ago. The court ordered Apple to stop selling its Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 devices. Rather than discontinue sales, the company sought permission to continue selling the devices after removing the infringing technology.\nPeople who buy a new watch in the United States will still see Apple\u2019s Blood Oxygen app on the devices, the company said. But if they tap the app, it will say the feature is no longer available.\nThe change won\u2019t affect smartwatches currently in use. People with Apple watches capable of detecting their blood-oxygen levels can continue to use that feature, Apple said. The Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 will also continue to offer an array of other features, including the ability to track runs, set timers, and detect falls and irregular heartbeats.\nThe International Trade Commission found in October that several Apple Watches had infringed on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, Calif., that helped pioneer some pulse oximeter technology. It issued a ban on the import of Apple\u2019s watches, which are made in Asia.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.\nApple appealed the ruling but on Wednesday lost its effort in court to delay a ban on sales of its watches until the appeals court rules on the dispute. As a contingency, it had received approval from U.S. Customs to continue selling the watch after making technical changes to remove the infringing technology.\nThe compromise would be a temporary blow to Apple\u2019s efforts to increase the utility of its watches by adding health features. In 2018, the company won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its watches to begin to measure heart rates through electrocardiogram tests. It subsequently added abilities to detect falls, crashes and blood oxygen levels .\nThe new features pushed Apple deeper into the world of medical devices that is dominated by companies like Medtronic and Abbott. Masimo had secured several patents over pulse oximeter technology, which measures the percentage of oxygen that red blood cells carry from the lungs to the body.\nIn court, Masimo said Apple had discussed acquiring the medical device company but instead chose to poach top Masimo executives and employees. In 2020, Apple introduced its first watch with pulse oximetry.\nThe next year, Masimo took its complaints that Apple stole its technology to the International Trade Commission. The appeals court is expected to make a ruling this year."

During the later months of 2022, their relatively weak showing dragged the S&P 500 down. Over the last twelve months, their gains have accounted for more than 60 percent of the return in the S&P 500. Tesla remains lower than it was when the S&P hit its trough in October 2022, but over the last twelve months, the company has surged more than 64 percent, responsible for nearly 3 percent of the S&P 500 rally on its own.\nIndeed, based on price alone, the seven big tech stocks were not the best performing in the S&P 500. Royal Caribbean, the cruise line, rose 212 percent, for example, and General Electric has risen over 160 percent since October 2022. However, these companies hold less weight in the index because they are much smaller, and each is responsible for less than 1 percent of the index\u2019s move since then.\nAnd some of the Magnificent Seven have done better than others. Nvidia, the chipmaker, rose a startling 417 percent, while Amazon gained just 38 percent. Microsoft has risen about 79 percent since the S&P\u2019s low, but because it\u2019s the largest stock in the index, its move still outweighed Meta\u2019s 198 percent gain over the same period.\nChange in prices since Oct. 12, 2022\n+450\n%\n+400\nNvidia\n+350\n+300\n+250\n+200\nMeta\nOct. 12, 2022:\nS&P 500\u2019s most recent low\n+150\nMicrosoft\n+100\nAlphabet\nApple\nAmazon\n+50\nS&P 500\n0\nTesla\n\u201350\n\u201922\n\u201923\n\u201924\n+450\n%\n+400\nNvidia\n+350\n+300\n+250\n+200\nMeta\nOct. 12, 2022:\nS&P 500\u2019s most recent low\n+150\nMicrosoft\n+100\nAlphabet\nApple\nAmazon\n+50\nS&P 500\n0\nTesla\n\u201350\nO\nN\nD\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\nJ\n2022\n2023\n2024\n+450\n%\n+400\nNvidia\n+350\n+300\n+250\n+200\nMeta\nOct. 12, 2022:\nS&P 500\u2019s most recent low\n+150\n+100\nMicrosoft\nAlphabet\nApple\n+50\nAmazon\nS&P 500\n0\nTesla\n\u201350\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\nJan.\n2022\n2023\n2024\nSource: FactSet\nNote: Data is as of market close on Jan. 19.\nUnderstanding the dominance of Big Tech on the S&P 500 is important for understanding the signal the index is sending about the market, companies and the economy. A rising S&P 500 is usually seen as a good thing, but when an index is led higher by just a small number of companies, it can mask turbulence beneath the surface. In other words, the index can rise even when a majority of companies fall.\nThis has always been the case. In the 1980s, companies like IBM, Exxon and General Electric dominated, but never quite to the degree that the new breed of tech behemoths has in recent years.\nLast March, acrisis among the nation\u2019s bankssent many individual stock prices tumbling. But the S&P 500 finished the month 3 percent higher,largely because of the furor surrounding advancements in artificial intelligenceand what they could mean for the tech giants\u2019 profitability.\nThis dynamic has begun to subside in recent months, as more companies have joined the rally. More than half the companies in the index are higher than they were when the S&P reached its previous peak in January 2022.\nSome analysts say this is a sign that the rally has more room to run as those stocks that have lagged behind begin to catch up, bolstered by greater optimism over the outlook for the economy.\nOthers warn that it may simply be the rise before a fall, especially as the economy continues to slow, weighing on those same companies.\nAdditional work by Mohammed Hadi and K.K.

        "fulltext": "Shop Talk\nByJoe RennisonJan. 27, 2024\nForget the long list of companies that pushed theS&P 500 to a new high this month. All investors needed to mint bumper returnswere the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what that means \u2192\nThe group\u2019s name, an allusion to a 1960s western starring Steve McQueen, was coined by the Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett early last year.\nIt consists of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet; Amazon; Apple; Facebook\u2019s parent, Meta; Microsoft; Nvidia; and Tesla.\nThesestocks rose an average of 105 percent in 2023, led by Nvidia.\nThe chip company, up more than 200 percent last year, is a key partner of Microsoft in that company\u2019s efforts to capitalize on developments in artificial intelligence. Microsoft itself rose 57 percent.\nThe S&P 500 index also had a good run in 2023, much better than was expected at the start of the year, when inflation and higher interest ratesclouded the outlook.\nThe index rose more than 23 percent, compared with a plunge of 20 percent in 2022 and a gain of around 15 percent in 2021. This month, the index clocked a record high.\nButroughly 60 percent of the S&P\u2019s gain last year was driven by those seven tech-focused stocks, meaning that without them, the index would have risen just 15 percent, and would not have reached its current level.\nCuriously, none were among the best-performing stocks in the index, but they still generated the most returns for it. Sounds odd, right?\nIt\u2019s because the S&P is weighted to company size;a small move in a very big company will have a greater impact than a big move in a much smaller company. And all the companies in the Magnificent Seven are very big.\nApple, among the world\u2019s largest companies, is worth over $3 trillion. To the index, its 50 percent rise last year was worth roughly 90 times Carnival\u2019s 130 percent rise, because Carnival is worth only $20 billion.\nThis means the unexpected rally last year was less a product of widespread enthusiasm over the outlook for corporate America than the result of soaring gains for just a handful of stocks.\nIn recent months, however, more stocks joined the rally \u2014 a positive sign for the broader market, especially asthe Magnificent Seven\u2019s performance has become more mixed since the start of the new year.\nStill, the dynamic points to the need to dig deeper than the broad performance of major indexes to understand what the market is communicating about the economy.\nShop Talkexplores idioms of the business world.
