        "title": "Apple Says Sales of iPhones Have Slowed",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 TheiPhonefueledApple\u2019s ascendance into the world\u2019s most valuable company. But even iPhone sales have their limits.\nApple on Tuesdayreported resultsfor its fiscal first quarterthat showed iPhone sales rose less than 1 percent from a year earlier, the slowest year-over-year growth rate ever for the device, which accounts for about two-thirds of the company\u2019s revenue. Apple also issued a sales forecast that signaled that the sluggishness would continue, with the company projecting its first revenue decline in more than a decade.\nThe results and guidance reflect how Apple, under its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, is grappling with becoming a maturing tech company and is now entering a period of slow growth. While Apple once delivered high double-digit revenue gains on the back of soaring sales of the iPhone and other devices, that has decelerated as the iPhone has begun saturating the market and the company has not introduced a new blockbuster device.\nThe performances raise questions about what Apple will do to satisfy investors who want growth and consumers who want new, cutting-edge technology. Some investors are alreadytreating Apple more like a value stockthan a growth stock, associating the company with predictable business results and a reliable dividend rather than runaway revenue growth.\nIn a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Mr. Cook said that the slowdown at Apple was indicative of greater global economic and financial market uncertainty.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing extreme conditions, unlike anything we\u2019ve experienced before, just about everywhere we look,\u201d Mr. Cook said, calling the global macroeconomic environment \u201cchallenging.\u201d\nShares of Apple, which are down more than 11 percent over the last year, fell 2.6 percent in after-hours trading after the results were announced.\nFor the quarter that ended Dec. 26, Apple said it sold 74.8 million iPhones, essentially flat from the 74.5 million sold a year ago. In total, revenue was $75.9 billion, up 1.7 percent from a year ago, and lower than Wall Street forecasts of $76.6 billion. Net profit was $18.4 billion, up from $18 billion a year earlier.\nFor the current quarter, which ends in March, Apple projected revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion. That would be down from $58 billion from a year earlier and lower than the $55.4 billion forecast by Wall Street, according to S&P Capital IQ.\nIn the period leading up to the earnings announcement, investors had lowered expectations for the quarter based on the belief that demand forApple\u2019s latest iPhones, the 6S and 6S Plus, had been weak. Several companies that supply iPhone parts to Apple recently blamed a lack of demand for their lower-than-expected financial results.\n\u201cThere will be some speed bumps ahead until we get to the iPhone 7 mega-product cycle later this year,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the results were affected by the strengthening United States dollar.\n\u201cIn the December quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was $5 billion to our revenue line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take $100 of the business that we did outside of the U.S. in September 2014, when we launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the same level of business today translates to only $85.\u201d\nOther growth areas that Apple has relied upon are also starting to experience a slowdown. Sales in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, rose 14 percent in the quarter from a year ago \u2014 yet annual revenue growth from the region has hovered at around 70 percent or more in the last four quarters.\nWith the iPhone\u2019s sales growth flattening, other products did not pick up the slack. Sales of theiPadtablet dropped 25 percent from a year earlier in terms of units, while Mac computers declined 4 percent.\nThe company did see growth in services, where revenue rose 26 percent, while revenue from a category known as other products \u2014 which include the Apple Watch \u2014 increased 62 percent.\nMr. Maestri said that Apple would continue to raise money in debt markets in the United States and abroad to continue to return money to investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Because Apple houses the majority of its $216 billion in cash overseas, it has borrowed money over the last three years to pay out more than $9 billion to investors.\nAs Apple matures, Mr. Maestri said, the company could also become a business that delivers steady financial advances through its huge installed base of one billion active devices currently used by consumers. He pointed in particular to the potential of the services business, which includes the iTunes Store, the App Store and Apple Music.\n\u201cThe market has not fully understood that we have a portion of our business directly tied to our incredible installed base that\u2019s not driven by quarterly results,\u201d Mr. Maestri said.\nMr. Cook echoed that sentiment. \u201cEspecially during periods of economic uncertainty, it\u2019s important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple\u2019s revenue occurs over time,\u201d he said. He added that the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201d"

        "title": "Alphabet Close to Overtaking Apple as Most Valuable Company",
        "fulltext": "Alphabet could soon become the most valuable company in the world.\nThe Google powerhouse traded on Friday morning with an equity value above $500 billion, less than 10 percent shy of Apple\u2019s value. Investors value the search firm\u2019s earnings from rapidly growing digital advertising more than twice as highly as Apple\u2019s in a saturating smartphone market. Wall Street, however, may be overlooking Alphabet\u2019s risks.\nGlobal smartphone sales growth slowed to 10 percent last year, according to the consulting firm IDC. Reports of cutbacks at Apple suppliers suggest tepid demand for its latest phones. Analysts fear that the company may struggle this year to match the 230 million or so iPhones sold in the last fiscal year to September.\nAn oversupplied market could bring price wars, which could hurt margins \u2014 and the iPhone accounts for about 60 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue and a bigger chunk of its profit. As a result, investors expect little growth in the company\u2019s top line this year and are paying only about 10 times estimated 2016 earnings for the stock.\nThe mobile digital advertising market, meanwhile, should almost triple to nearly $200 billion globally by 2019, consultants at eMarketer reckon. Alphabet\u2019s sales are forecast to grow about 15 percent this year. This wind at Alphabet\u2019s back and the possibility that its self-driving cars, robots or medical endeavors will pay off help explain why it commands a price-to-earnings multiple above 20.\nA subpar earnings report from Apple next week, or a strong one from Alphabet the week after, could bring a new name to the top of the world\u2019s most valuable companies list.\nInvestors are, however, prone to overconfidence in technology trends. Facebook is snagging more and more ad dollars. European antitrust authorities are circling. Moreover, some of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes courtesy of iPhone users: it cost Google $1 billion in 2014 to keep its search bar on the Apple device, Bloomberg reports based on transcripts of a court case.\nAlphabet is far more reliant on Internet advertising than Apple is on the iPhone. Ads bring in about 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Any hint of investor skepticism about that market could keep Apple at the top of the list.\nDealBook readers:The Reuters Breakingviews predictions book, \u201cStairway to Heaven, Highway to Hell,\u201d offers smart financial ideas for the 2016 playbook.

Is there a version of the program (or something similar) for the Android tablet community that isn\u2019t expensive and is also simple enough for normal people to use?\nA.While it may get the most attention, Apple\u2019sGarageBandprogram is not the only tool for those who want to create and edit their own music and audio projects; comparable apps for Android and Windows devices do exist. For instance,Stagelight by Open Labsprovides step-by-step lessons for creating your own songs andincludesa set of digital instruments and a library of audio loops. The basic app is free, but you can buy and download additional content to use with it.Stagelight works withAndroid 4.4, as well as with Windows 7 and later on a PC.\nThe basic version ofMagix Music Maker Jamis also free and comes in versions forAndroid,iOSandWindows 8 and Windows 10 computers. For a few dollars, in-app purchases bring extra content and features. Another Android-compatible music app,FL Studio Mobile, costs about $16.50 at the Google Play store, but it hasvideo tutorials on YouTubeto give you an idea of the app\u2019s range and capabilities; a Windows variation calledFL Studio Grooveis $10.\nYou can find other music-mixing apps to sample in theGoogle Play store. Keep in mind that some programs come with hefty audio libraries and may need some significant space on your tablet, though they many not be as demanding as theiOS version of Apple\u2019s GarageBand app, which consumes at least a gigabyte of room on the device."
