        "fulltext": "THE UNSETTLING ACQUISITIVENESS OF ANBANG|Anbang\u2019s spending spree is a sign that deal-making has gone awry,Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.\nStrategic bidders typically triumph over financial bidders in takeover battles because the strategic buyer is an operating company and can almost always pay more.The strategic buyer can expect to earn more through cost savings.The last time financial buyers regularly beat strategic buyers was before the financial crisis as the credit bubble drove a huge feeding frenzy in private equity.\nAnbang appears to be trying to build itself into a conglomerate along the lines of Berkshire Hathaway and, like Berkshire, is using insurance reserves to buy assets in businesses such as banking and real\n                                                    estate. It spent over $2 billion on insurers in Belgium and South Korea in 2015.\nThe funding comes from selling high-yield investment products to Chinese citizens.If this type of company existed in the United States, there would be an outcry, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. An insurance\n                                                    company that appears out of nowhere to become a giant after 10 years before buying noncore assets abundantly?We\u2019ve seen this story before and it typically doesn\u2019t end well.\nAnd who would manage Starwood?None of the investors in Anbang\u2019s consortium have much hotel experience. Anbang could keep on the Starwood team, but Anbang has already had trouble managing its\n                                                    new subsidiaries. The management team at its Belgian acquisition left after a few months amid complaints about Anbang\u2019s management style.\nAnbang may already have pushed too far.China\u2019s insurance regulator is set to reject its takeover plansbecause the deals would break rules banning insurers from investing more than 15 percent\n                                                    of their assets abroad, according tothe financial magazine Caixin.\nThe Financial Timesreported that people close to the deal played down the report, saying that Anbang\n                                                    believes the regulator would only become involved if the hotel chain purchases were funded with insurance premiums.\nNonetheless, if Anbang were to pursue the deals, there remains the question of whether Anbang could capably run Starwood. There is too much risk here and the deal raises issues about takeovers andthe responsibility to look out for the company itself.\n\nGOLDMAN BANKER IN DOCUMENT LEAK CASE AVOIDS PRISON|A former Goldman Sachs banker who pleaded guilty to taking confidential documents\n                                                    from a source at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was sentenced to probation on Tuesday,Ben Protess reports in DealBook.\nThe banker, Rohit Bansal, faced up to a year in prison after pleading guilty, but Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced him totwo years\u2019 probation, 300 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine.\nGoldman settled with New York State\u2019s financial regulator, paying $50 million and agreeing to new restrictions on how it handles sensitive regulatory information. It also acknowledged that it failed\n                                                    to \u201ceffectively supervise its employee.\u201d\nThe case has highlighted the blurred lines between Goldman and the New York Fed and raised more questions about the so-called revolving door on Wall Street.Mr. Bansal spent several years as a\n                                                    regulator at the New York Fed before joining Goldman and being assigned to advise one of the banks he previously regulated. That was when he received confidential government information on that bank\n                                                    from someone still at the New York Fed.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The keynote speech atGoogle\u2019s cloud platform conferencestarts at 9 a.m. The annualStarbucksshareholder meeting starts at 1 p.m.Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will give remarks at the University of Pennsylvania Law School\u2019s women\u2019s\n                                                    summit meeting at 11:45 a.m.Patrick T. Harker, president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, will speak at the Penn Institute for Urban Research at 5:30 p.m.\n\nPUERTO RICO FIGHTS FOR CHAPTER 9 BANKRUPTCY IN SUPREME COURT|Puerto Rico argued on Tuesday that it has been wrongly locked out\n                                                    of bankruptcy courts, the only place it can reasonably expect to restructure its crushing debt,Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook.Hanging\n                                                    on the outcome, said Puerto Rico\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Landau, were questions likewhether people in a village in Puerto Rico would be able to get clean water.\nFor more than a year, Puerto Rico has been pushing to restructure its $72 billion in debt under Chapter 9, the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments. Chapter 9 specifically excludes the commonwealth,\n                                                    although it is unclear why.\nThe justices raised questions about rationales for tying Puerto Rico\u2019s hands as Congress had done in 1984.\u201cWhy would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never-never land?\u201d asked\n                                                    Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nMatthew D. McGill, the lawyer representing Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors, offered that the 1984 amendment was not all that mysterious considering Congress had a long history of micromanaging Puerto Rico\u2019s\n                                                    indebtedness. He also said that Congress had tacitly encouraged the purchasing of Puerto Rican debt and that Puerto Rico had ahistory of indebtedness.\nMr. Landau, on the other hand, argued that the legal provisions were being misread and thatCongress had not intended to shut Puerto Rico out of bankruptcy.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nLeon H.

        "title": "Morning Agenda: Hedge Funds Make a Poor Start to the Year",
        "fulltext": "HEDGE FUNDS MAKE A POOR START TO THE YEAR|Last year was tough for hedge fund managers, but this year is starting to look just\n                                                    as bad andinvestors are finding it hard to stomach,Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson report in DealBook.\nThe University of California\u2019s endowment fund said it would cut the number of hedge funds in which it invests to about 10 from 32. Some brand-name managers who have recorded big losses for months\n                                                    are facingpressure from investors to redeem their money. The industry\u2019s underperformance has also raised questions about what investors are getting in return for the hefty fees they pay.\nInvestors are expected to withdraw $25 billion from hedge funds in the first three months of this year, according to a Goldman Sachs Prime Brokerage Services survey of hedge fund investors representing\n                                                    about $425 billion in investments.More than three-quarters of those who planned to redeem money said they would reinvest in other hedge funds.\nWell-known firms that bucked the negative trend last year are getting punished this year.Some of this is because of the underwhelming performance in stocks.The basket of 50 stocks, including Apple\n                                                    and Valeant, that Goldman Sachs says hedge funds like most is down 5.6 percent as of March 4.\nSome people running funds, like Larry Robbins and William A. Ackman, have fared worse. Positions in companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals and Monsanto have created headaches for Mr. Robbins, while Mr. Ackman\n                                                    is bedeviled by his bet against Herbalife.\nStill, it\u2019s not all red ink.Greenlight Capital is up 3.3 percent after losing 20.4 percent. Horseman Capital Management, based in London, is up 9.7 percent this year. And Saba Capital Management\n                                                    is up a little more than 14 percent so far this year.\n\nA NIGHTMARE WITH NO ESCAPE|Energy Transfer Equity\u2019s acquisition of a rival pipeline company, Williams Companies, has turned\n                                                    into a nightmare, butit has only itself to blame,\nSteven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor.\nEnergy Transfer is not actually buying Williams. A newly created affiliate, Energy Transfer Corporation, is making the acquisition.\nEnergy Transfer will pay up to $6 billion in cash and the remainder in stock of the new affiliate. Williams\u2019s shareholders will own stock in Transfer Corporation, a publicly traded entity whose only\n                                                    asset is Energy Transfer stock.\nEnergy Transfer will be at the center of an orbit of six publicly traded companies \u2014 different pipelines that Energy Transfer manages.\nThis is a Frankenstein creature created only for tax purposes and it is locking Energy Transfer into the transaction.It wanted to avoid a shareholder vote so it structured that deal so that Energy\n                                                    Transfer would issue only about 19 percent of its outstanding stock and pay the rest of the consideration using cash. That cash has become a problem in a down market because it will leave Energy Transfer\n                                                    overleveraged.\nThe elimination of the shareholder vote means Energy Transfer\u2019s shareholders cannot veto the deal. The acquirer has no way to back out unless it has a shareholder vote or specifically negotiates a\n                                                    termination right \u2014 which Energy Transfer did not do.\nNor did it negotiate other protections from a steep decline in its stock price and the industry in general.The deal is legally required to close and if Energy Transfer breaches, it can be sued in\n                                                    a Delaware court.\nStill, during the financial crisis, there were seemingly airtight agreements that were settled or renegotiated. Either way, don\u2019t shed any tears for Energy Transfer, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes.It got itself into this mess in the first place.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Stephanie Avakian, deputy director of enforcement at theSecurities and Exchange Commission, and Mark Flannery,\n                                                    director of economic risk analysis, will take part in a question-and-answer session with the Investment Adviser Association at 11:45 a.m.\n\nCHINESE BANKS SWAP DEBT FOR EQUITY|A new approach to managing China\u2019s corporate debt burden offers temporary relief for\n                                                    banks, butspells difficulties for the country\u2019s economy,\nKeith Bradsher reports in DealBook.\nDeeply troubled companies are using stock to pay for overdue loans.On Thursday, a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilder disclosed that it would issue equity to its creditors, instead of repaying $2.17\n                                                    billion in bank loans.\nBanks with stakes in indebted companies are likely to be even more reluctant to shut them down, leaving China with enormous overcapacity in sectors like shipbuilding, steel and cement, hampering growth\n                                                    for years to come.\nThe strategy has advantages \u2014 it would allow companies to cut their debt loads. This could help their credit profiles and keep their businesses running. Bank loan books will also appear healthier,\n                                                    since they can reduce the amount of past-due loans.\nHowever, it could make problems more pernicious as the companies are putting off hard choices like laying off employees or closing operations.\nIt is still unclear how widespread the strategy has come.The shipbuilder, China Huarong Energy Company, had to disclose the move only because it is listed on the Hong Kong stock market.

        "fulltext": "TRANSCANADA TO BUY COLUMBIA PIPELINE GROUP|TransCanada will buy the Columbia Pipeline Groupfor $10.2 billionafter failing\n                                                    to obtain approval for its Keystone XL oil sands pipeline,Ian Austen reports in DealBook.\nRuss Girling, the chief executive of TransCanada, said that the all-cash deal was \u201ca rare, attractive opportunity thatwill create one of North America\u2019s largest natural gas businesses.\u201d\n                                                    The completed deal would leave TransCanada with ownership of about 57,000 miles of gas pipelines.\nColumbia, which is based in Houston, is regulated, eliminating the possibility of sharp growth during expansionary times, but alsoeasing pressure to cut fees in a depressed energy market. Mr. Girling\n                                                    said the combined company would have contracts or revenue of 23 billion Canadian dollars guaranteed by regulations.\nTransCanada has been hurt by the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to grant a permit for Keystone XL, which was intended to bring oil sands production to refineries on the Gulf Coast. It has a backup\n                                                    plan for its oil sands business in an all-Canadian pipeline called Energy East. But like Keystone XL, Energy East has become a politically volatile project.\nGas recovered in the Northeast through fracking has been taking some markets from Canadian natural gasthat TransCanada delivers to North American customers. As natural gas from fracking has grown\n                                                    more important, Columbia has reversed a pipeline that traditionally moved gas from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. That line will now carry gas south from the Northeast.\n\nPUBLIC PENSION PROMISES EXCEED ABILITY TO PAY|Researchers at Citigroup say that across the developed world, governments have promised\n                                                    much more than they are likely to be able to pay to current and future retirees,Mary Williams Walsh writes in DealBook.They also have not revealed the disparity to investors who bought government bondsand whose investments could be at risk, according to the Citigroup report.\nTwenty countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development havepromised their retirees $78 trillion and much of it is unfunded, according to the study. The total is close to twice\n                                                    the national debt of those 20 countries and the pension obligations are \u201cnot on government balance sheets,\u201d Citigroup said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be, for most cities and states, some enormous collision or explosion,\u201d said Charles E. F. Millard, head of pension relations at Citigroup.He expects many of these\n                                                    countries to keep struggling, cutting services and raising taxes.\nThe report recommends that governments disclose the amounts promised to retirees, but officials are loath to do that because they believe it will harm their credit ratings and drive up borrowing costs.\nThe issue of disclosure is particularly contentious in Washington where Republican members of Congress are planning to introduce a bill that would require states and local governments to measure their pension\n                                                    obligations using the method used to price municipal bonds, rather than actuarial numbers.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s conference onsupervising large and complex financial institutionswill start at 9 a.m.James B.

After this the robot initiative\n                                                    was plagued by leadership changes, failed collaborations and an unsuccessful search for a new leader. Boston Dynamics executives were reluctant to work with Google\u2019s other robot engineers, according\n                                                    to a person familiar with the group.\nThe tensions spilled into recorded meetings and emails published on a Google worker forum.The documents were made available to Bloomberg News, which reported that Aaron Edsinger, director of robotics\n                                                    at Google in San Francisco, said he had been trying to create a low-cost electric quadruped robot with Boston Dynamics, but there was \u201ca bit of a brick wall around the division.\u201d\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nDelaware\u2019s Chief Justice Speaks Out on Big Mergers and Investors|The justice, Leo Strine Jr., is critical of the pending\n                                                    merger-and-breakup of Dow Chemical and DuPont.NYT \u00bb\n\nTribune Publishing Wins Auction for Orange County Register|Shortly after the results were announced, the Justice Department said\n                                                    it would seek to block the sale on monopoly grounds.NYT \u00bb\n\nLi Ka-shing\u2019s Hutchison May Sell Stake in Phone Carrier Three|In a regulatory filing, CK Hutchison said that if such a\n                                                    sale occurred, proceeds would help fund its $15 billion purchase of another British phone operator, O2, which regulators are reviewing.the wall street journal\n\nSFR Said to Pay Up to $4.5 Billion for Bouygues Telecom Assets|The French billionaire Patrick Drahi is set to pay as much as \u20ac4\n                                                    billion, or about $4.5 billion, as part of a deal that will carve up Bouygues\u2019s telecommunications unit, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.the wall street journal\n\nTime for Credit Suisse to Rethink Its Strategy|Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of the Swiss bank, had a grand plan to change\n                                                    the bank\u2019s focus, but events have overtaken him, Dominic Elliott writes in Breakingviews.NYT \u00bb\n\nDespite Turbulence, Shareholder Activism Is Forecast to Stay Strong|Roger C.
