        "title": "Apple Sues Israeli Spyware Maker, Seeking to Block Its Access to iPhones",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Applesued the NSO Group, the Israeli surveillance company, in federal court on Tuesday, another setback for the beleaguered firm and the unregulated spyware industry.\nThe lawsuit is the second of its kind \u2014 Facebooksued NSO in 2019 for targeting its WhatsApp users\u2014 and another consequential move by a private company to curb invasive spyware by governments and the companies that provide their spy tools.\nApple, for the first time, seeks to hold NSO accountable for what it says was the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. Apple also wants to permanently prevent NSO from using any Apple software, services or devices, a move that could render the company\u2019s Pegasus spyware product worthless, given that its core business is to give government clients full access to a target\u2019s iPhone or Android smartphone.\nApple is also asking for unspecified damages for the time and cost to deal with what the company argues is NSO\u2019s abuse of its products. Apple said it would donate the proceeds from those damages to organizations that exposed spyware.\nSince NSO\u2019s founding in 2010, its executives have said they sell spyware to governments only for lawful interception, but a series of revelations by journalists and private researchers have shown the extent to which governments have deployed NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware against journalists, activists and dissidents.\nApple executives described the lawsuit as a warning shot to NSO and other spyware makers. \u201cThis is Apple saying: If you do this, if you weaponize our software against innocent users, researchers, dissidents, activists or journalists, Apple will give you no quarter,\u201d Ivan Krstic, head of Apple security engineering and architecture, said in an interview on Monday.\n\u201cThousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group\u2019s technologies used by its customers,\u201d an NSO representative said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cPedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it.\u201d\nThe NSO Group has dealt with a series of critical setbacks. This month, the Biden administration, in a notable breach with Israel, blacklisted NSO and Candiru, another Israeli surveillance company, saying they supplied spyware to foreign governments that used it to target the phones of journalists, dissidents, human rights activists and others.\nThe ban, which means that no American organization can work with NSO, is the strongest step any American administration has taken to bring the global marketplace for spyware to heel.\nThe Israeli government, which approves any sale of NSO\u2019s software to foreign governments andconsiders the software a critical foreign policy tool, is lobbying the United States to remove the ban on NSO\u2019s behalf. NSO has said it would fight the ban, but the executive set to take over NSO Group quit after the business was blacklisted, the company said.\nOne week after the federal ban, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected NSO\u2019s motion to dismiss Facebook\u2019s lawsuit. The Israeli firm had argued that it \u201ccould claim foreign sovereign immunity.\u201d A 3-to-0 decision by the court rejected NSO\u2019s argument and allowed Facebook\u2019s lawsuit to proceed.\nThose developments helped pave the way for Apple\u2019s lawsuit against NSO on Tuesday. Apple first found itself in NSO\u2019s cross hairs in 2016, when researchers at Citizen Lab, a research institute of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, and Lookout, the San Francisco cybersecurity company, discovered that NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware wastaking advantage of three security vulnerabilities in Apple productsto spy on dissidents, activists and journalists.\nAnd the company is at risk of default, Moody\u2019s, the ratings agency, warned. Moody\u2019s downgraded NSO by two levels, eight levels below investment grade, citing its $500 million of debt and severe cash flow problems.\nNSO\u2019s spyware gave its government clients access to the full contents of a target\u2019s phone, allowing agents to read a target\u2019s text messages and emails, record phone calls, capture sounds and footage off their cameras, and trace the person\u2019s whereabouts.\nInternal NSO documents,leaked to The New York Timesin 2016, showed that the company charged government agencies $650,000 to spy on 10 iPhone users \u2014 along with a half-million-dollar setup fee. Government agencies in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico were among NSO\u2019s early customers, the documents showed.\nThose revelations led to the discovery of NSO\u2019s spyware on the phones of human rights activists in the Emirates and journalists, activists and human rights lawyers in Mexico \u2014 even their teenage children living in the United States.\nNSO said it would investigate any accusations of abuse, but further revelations showed that itdid not stop those governmentsfrom continuing to misuse NSO\u2019s spyware.\nAn opening for Apple\u2019s lawsuit emerged in March, after NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware was discovered on the iPhone of a Saudi activist. Citizen Lab discovered that the spyware had infected the iPhonewithout so much as a click. The spyware could invisibly infect iPhones, Mac computers and Apple Watches, then siphon their data back to government servers, without the target\u2019s knowing about it.\nCitizen Lab called the zero-click infection scheme \u201cForced Entry\u201d and passed a sample of it to Apple in September. The discovery compelled Apple to issue emergency software updates for its iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Mac computers.\nThe sample of Pegasus gave Apple a forensic understanding of how Pegasus worked. The company found that NSO\u2019s engineers had created more than 100 fake Apple IDs to carry out their attacks. In the process of creating those accounts, NSO\u2019s engineers would have had to agree to Apple\u2019s iCloud Terms and Conditions, which expressly require that iCloud users\u2019 engagement with Apple \u201cbe governed by the laws of the state of California.\u201d\nThe clause helped Apple bring its lawsuit against NSO in the Northern District of California.\n\u201cThis was in flagrant violation of our terms of service and our customers\u2019 privacy,\u201d said Heather Grenier, Apple\u2019s senior director of commercial litigation. \u201cThis is our stake in the ground, to send a clear signal that we are not going to allow this type of abuse of our users.\u201d\nAfter filing its lawsuit Tuesday, Apple said it would offer free technical, threat intelligence and engineering assistance to Citizen Lab and other organizations engaged in rooting out digital surveillance. Apple also said it would donate $10 million, and any damages, to those organizations.\nDigital rights experts said Apple\u2019s suit threatened NSO\u2019s survival. \u201cNSO is now poison,\u201d said Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab. \u201cNo one in their right mind will want to touch that company. But it\u2019s not just one company. This is an industrywide problem.\u201d\nHe added that the suit could be a step toward more oversight of the unregulated spyware industry.\n\u201cSteps like this are useful, but incomplete,\u201d Mr. Deibert said. \u201cWe need more action by governments.\u201d"

        "title": "Judge denies Apple\u2019s request to delay App Store changes.",
        "fulltext": "A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Apple could not delay making changes to its App Store, a move that could soon allow app developers to directly communicate with customers about ways to pay for services outside Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\nCalling Apple\u2019s request for a delay \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California warned in her ruling that the company\u2019s strict App Store rules were building toward \u201cantitrust conduct.\u201d\nThe judge wrote that she would not let Apple punt on making changes to the App Store, where many developers are barred from directing customers elsewhere. She wrote that Apple was enforcing that rule \u201cto harm competition\u201d while it collected fees on developers\u2019 sales.\nApple has been trying to blunt Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s September verdict in a yearlong lawsuit brought by Epic Games, the creator of the video game Fortnite. Now Apple may have to rewrite its policies to allow app developers to point users to alternative payment methods as soon as December.\nIn its original lawsuit, Epic wanted Apple to be labeled a monopolist. Epic argued that the strict App Store rules and the fees that Apple charges developers that distribute apps in the store were harming customers and developers and tamping down competition.\nAfter a trial that concluded in May,Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Appleon most counts in September. But she said the company was violating California\u2019s anticompetition law by stifling app developers from communicating directly with customers about ways to pay for services outside the App Store. That would allow the developers to avoid paying Apple\u2019s standard fee of up to 30 percent of their sales.\nThe judge banned these so-called anti-steering rules starting in December. In October, Apple appealed the verdict and requested a stay of her injunction until the appeals process was completed.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple\u2019s request after a hearing Tuesday. From the start of the hearing, which was held by videoconference, she appeared skeptical of Apple\u2019s request.\nWhen Mark Perry, a lawyer for Apple, argued that allowing developers to include links to outside websites within their apps would take months to figure out, the judge interrupted him to point out that the company had not asked for simply a short delay to work out the logistics.\n\u201cYou did not ask for a few months,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did not ask for six months. You didn\u2019t ask for a limited amount of time. You asked for an across-the-board stay, which could take three, four, five years.\u201d\nHer written decision poked holes in Apple\u2019s arguments that it would be difficult, time-consuming and potentially perilous to allow app developers to link to their own websites.\n\u201cOther than, perhaps, needing time to establish guidelines, Apple has provided no credible reason for the court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,\u201d Judge Gonzalez Rogers wrote. \u201cUsers can open browsers and retype links to the same effect; it is merely inconvenient, which then only works to the advantage of Apple.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s ruling is not the final word. Apple said it would seek a reversal of the judge\u2019s decision with a federal appeals court.\n\u201cApple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved,\u201d a company spokeswoman said in a statement.\nThe specifics of what Apple would have to alter if an injunction was upheld are unclear. Some have speculated that developers could offer their own competing payment methods within the App Store, but Apple has disagreed with those interpretations of the judge\u2019s ruling."

        "title": "On Podcasts and Radio, Misleading Covid-19 Talk Goes Unchecked",
        "fulltext": "On a recent episode of his podcast, Rick Wiles, a pastor and self-described \u201ccitizen reporter,\u201d endorsed a conspiracy theory:that Covid-19 vaccineswere the product of a \u201cglobal coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by the most evil cabal of people in the history of mankind.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an egg that hatches into a synthetic parasite and grows inside your body,\u201d Mr. Wiles said on his Oct. 13 episode. \u201cThis is like a sci-fi nightmare, and it\u2019s happening in front of us.\u201d\nMr. Wiles belongs to a group of hosts who have made false or misleading statements aboutCovid-19 and effective treatmentsfor it. Like many of them, he has access to much of his listening audience because his show appears on a platform provided by a large media corporation.\nMr. Wiles\u2019s podcast is available throughiHeart Media, an audio company based in San Antonio that says it reaches nine out of 10 Americans each month. Spotify and Apple are other major companies that provide significant audio platforms for hosts who have shared similar views with their listeners about Covid-19 and vaccination efforts, or have had guests on their shows who promoted such notions.\nScientific studies have shown that vaccines willprotect people against the coronavirusfor long periods and have significantly reduced the spread of Covid-19. As the global death toll related to Covid-19exceeds five million\u2014 and at a time when more than 40 percent of Americans arenot fully vaccinated\u2014 iHeart, Spotify, Apple and many smaller audio companies have done little to rein in what radio hosts and podcasters say about the virus and vaccination efforts.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no curb on it,\u201d said Jason Loviglio, an associate professor of media and communication studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. \u201cThere\u2019s no real mechanism to push back, other than advertisers boycotting and corporate executives saying we need a culture change.\u201d\nAudio industry executives appear less likely than their counterparts in social media to try to check dangerous speech.TruNews, a conservative Christian media outlet founded by Mr. Wiles, who used the phrase \u201cJew coup\u201d to describe efforts to impeach former President Donald J. Trump, has been banned by YouTube. His podcast remains available on iHeart.\nAsked about his false statements concerning Covid-19 vaccines, Mr. Wiles described pandemic mitigation efforts as \u201cglobal communism.\u201d \u201cIf the Needle Nazis win, freedom is over for generations, maybe forever,\u201d he said in an email.\nThe reach of radio shows and podcasts is great, especially among young people: A recent survey from the National Research Group, a consulting firm, found that 60 percent of listeners under 40 get their news primarily through audio, a type of media they say they trust more than print or video.\n\u201cPeople develop really close relationships with podcasts,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, a senior research fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Knight First Amendment Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a parasocial medium. There\u2019s something about voice that humans really relate to.\u201d\nMarc Bernier, a talk radio host in Daytona Beach, Fla., whose show is available for download or streaming on iHeart\u2019s and Apple\u2019s digital platforms, was among the talk radio hosts who died of Covid-19 complications after expressing anti-vaccination views on their programs. The deaths made national news and set off a cascade of commentary on social media. What drew less attention was the industry that helped give them an audience.\nOn a June episode, Mr. Bernier said, after referring to unvaccinated people: \u201cI\u2019m one of them. Judge me if you want.\u201d The next month, he cited anunfounded claimthat \u201c45,000 peoplehave died from taking the vaccine.\u201d In his final Twitter post, on July 30, Mr. Bernier accused the government of \u201cacting like Nazis\u201d for encouraging Covid-19 vaccines.\nJimmy DeYoung Sr., whose program was available on iHeart, Apple and Spotify, died of Covid-19 complications after making his show a venue for false or misleading statements about vaccines. One of his frequent guests was Sam Rohrer, a former Pennsylvania state representative who likened the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines to Nazi tactics and made a sweeping false statement. \u201cThis is not a vaccine, by definition,\u201d Mr. Rohrer said on an April episode. \u201cIt is a permanent altering of my immune system, which God created to handle the kinds of things that are coming that way.\u201d Mr. DeYoung thanked his guest for his \u201cinsight.\u201d Mr. DeYoung died four months later.\nBuck Sexton, the host of a program syndicated by Premiere Networks, an iHeart subsidiary, recently floated the theory that mass Covid-19 vaccinations could speed the virus\u2019s mutation into more dangerous strains. He made this suggestion while appearing on another Premiere Networks program, \u201cThe Jesse Kelly Show.\u201d\nThe theory appears to have its roots in a 2015 paper about vaccines for a chicken ailment called Marek\u2019s disease. Its author, Andrew Read, a professor of biology and entomology at Penn State University,has saidhis research has been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d by anti-vaccine activists. He added that Covid-19 vaccines have been found to reduce transmissions substantially, whereas chickens inoculated with the Marek\u2019s disease vaccine were still able to transmit the disease. Mr. Sexton did not reply to a request for comment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing lots of public radio stations doing amazing local work to spread good health information,\u201d Mr. Loviglio, the media professor, said. \u201cOn the other side, you\u2019re seeing mostly the AM radio dial and their podcast counterparts being the Wild West of the airwaves.\u201d\niHeart \u2014 which owns more than 860 radio stations, publishesmore than 600 podcastsand operates a vast online archive of audio programs \u2014 hasrulesfor the podcasters on its platform prohibiting them from making statements that incite hate, promote Nazi propaganda or are defamatory. It would not say whether it has a policy concerning false statements on Covid-19 or vaccination efforts.\nApple\u2019scontent guidelines for podcastsprohibit \u201ccontent that may lead to harmful or dangerous outcomes, or content that is obscene or gratuitous.\u201d Apple did not reply to requests for comment for this article.\nSpotify, whichsays its podcast platformhas 299 million monthly listeners,prohibitshate speech in its guidelines. In a response to inquiries, the company said in a written statement that it also prohibits content \u201cthat promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive content about Covid-19, which may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.\u201d The company added that it had removed content that violated its policies. But the episode with Mr. DeYoung\u2019s conversation with Mr. Rohrer wasstill availablevia Spotify.\nDawn Ostroff, Spotify\u2019s content and advertising business officer, said at aconferencelast month that the company was making \u201cvery aggressive moves\u201d to invest more in content moderation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the content that we make and the content that we license and the content that\u2019s on the platform,\u201d she said, \u201cbut our policies are the same no matter what type of content is on our platform. We will not allow any content that infringes or that in any way is inaccurate.\u201d\nThe audio industry has not drawn the same scrutiny as large social media companies, whose executives have been questioned incongressional hearingsabout the platforms\u2019 role in spreading false or misleading information.\nThe social media giants have made efforts over the last year to stop the flow of false reports related to the pandemic. In September,YouTubesaid it was banning the accounts of several prominent anti-vaccine activists. It also removes or de-emphasizes content it deems to be misinformation or close to it. Late last year,Twitterannounced that it would remove posts and ads withfalse claims about coronavirus vaccines.Facebookfollowed suit in February, saying it would remove false claims about vaccines generally.\nSylvia Chan-Olmsted, a media professor at the University of Florida, said that podcasts may be more effective in spreading false information than social media. \u201cPeople who go to podcasts have much more active engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, I went on Facebook and I scrolled through and saw this misinformation.\u2019 It\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re engaged, you\u2019re interested in this host, you actively seek this person out and listen to what he or she has to say.\u201d\nAudio media has grown more popular during the pandemic, according to the iHeart chief executive Robert W. Pittman, a former head of MTV and AOL. At a recent media industry conference, he noted a change in listening habits over the last 20 months: \u201cThe consumer before the pandemic, because of social and a lot of other things, was feeling disconnected, and they value media that feels like a companion. There are two of those: radio, andnow there\u2019s podcasting.\u201d\nThe Federal Communications Commission, which grants licenses to companies using the public airwaves, has oversight over radio operators, but not podcasts or online audio, which do not make use of the public airwaves.\nThe F.C.C. is barred from violating American citizens\u2019 right to free speech. When it takes action against a media company over programming, it is typically in response to complaints about content considered obscene or indecent, as when it fined a Virginia television station in 2015 for a newscast that included a segment on a pornographic film star.\nIn a statement, an F.C.C. spokesman said the agency \u201creviews all complaints and determines what is actionable under the Constitution and the law.\u201d It added that the main responsibility for what goes on the air lies with radio station owners, saying that \u201cbroadcast licensees have a duty to act in the public interest.\u201d\nThe world of talk radio and podcasting is huge, and anti-vaccine sentiment is a small part of it. iHeart offersan educational podcast seriesabout Covid-19 vaccines, and Spotify createda hub for podcasts about Covid-19from news outlets including ABC and Bloomberg.\nThere has been at least one turnaround among hosts once skeptical of the pandemic and efforts to counter it. Bill Cunningham, who has a radio show in Cincinnati that is syndicated by iHeart\u2019s Premiere Networks and available on Apple, spent the early part of the pandemic claiming that Covid-19 was overhyped. He revised his viewon the airthis year, describing his decision to get vaccinated and encouraging his listeners to do the same.\nRecently, he expressed his eagerness to get a booster shot and mentioned that he had picked up a new nickname: \u201cThe Vaxxinator.\u201d"

Here are some of the highlights:\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., revealed for the first time that he hasinvested some of his own money into cryptocurrencies. \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to own it as part of a diversified portfolio,\u201d Cook told Andrew, quickly adding that he wasn\u2019t giving investment advice. As for Apple, Cook said the company had \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to either put a portion of its cash in crypto, or to start accepting digital currencies in the App Store. But he added, cryptically, \u201cThere are other things that we are definitely looking at.\u201d\nCook also defended Apple\u2019s policyofengaging with China\u2019s government, technology\u2019s effect on mental health, the rumor that Elon Musk once tried to get him to acquire Tesla and more.\nWatch the full interview with Tim Cook\nAdam Neumann,in his first public interviewsince his ouster from WeWork in 2019, said, \u201cI have had a lot of time to think, and there have been multiple lessons and multiple regrets.\u201d Neumann, who founded the co-working company, also tried to revise the record about what led to his departure and the company\u2019s subsequent woes.\nThe things Neumann regrets include believing the hype when bullish bankers said that his company was worth even more than its peak $47 billion valuation: \u201cIt went to my head,\u201d he said. The things Neuman thinks others got wrong include that he walked away from the company with a generous golden parachute: \u201cThis perception that as the company went from $47 billion valuation down to $9 billion, and I profited somehow while the company is going down, is completely false,\u201d he said.\nNeumann also told the story about how Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chasehelped persuade him to step downfrom WeWork and explained what he\u2019s doing now with his family investment office (he\u2019s \u201cpretty excited about crypto,\u201d he said).\nWatch the full interview with Adam Neumann\nMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, said it was time for America toguarantee paid family leavefor all workers. She said she had been calling members of Congress to press the issue, which may be part of President Biden\u2019s sweeping climate and social policy spending bill. \u201cIt is not just about the mom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes strong men, modern men, to really understand they benefit from it as well.\u201d\nMellody Hobsonof Ariel Investments, who joined Meghan virtually at the summit (pictured above), discussed the limitations of diversity efforts in the workplace. \u201cThe No. 1 beneficiary of diversity initiatives in this country has been white women,\u201d Hobson said. \u201cI think the problem is that there is this scenario that is created, and it is a zero-sum game \u2014 and it is not.\u201d\nWatch the full interview with Mellody Hobson and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex\nThe actor and author Matthew McConaughey may or may not berunning for governor of Texas, he said. He isn\u2019t sure he is the person for the job, despiteriding high in the polls, but he is examining his \u201cmind, heart and spirit\u201d as he considers it. McConaughey said he knows what he is for and against \u2014 opportunities over obligations, choice over legislation andjoy over happiness.\nHe also said he was wary of coronavirus vaccine mandates for children 5 to 11. The actor is vaccinated, as are his wife, mother and older child, buthe said he would waitto inoculate his two younger children, who recently became eligible for shots. \u201cI couldn\u2019t mandate having to vaccinate the younger kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI still want to find out more information.\u201d Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general,later weighed in, telling CNN that the vaccines are effective and \u201cremarkably safe\u201d for young children.\nWatch the full interview with Matthew McConaughey\nAlbert Bourla, the C.E.O. of Pfizer, said that for a certain share of the population, the push to overcome vaccine hesitancy may never be won. \u201cThey are wrong, and I would urge them to get the vaccine,\u201d he said, but \u201cit\u2019s very hard to change their mind.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Bourla says he believes that antiviral drugs, like Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid, could be a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Pfizer\u2019s trial data showed that its pill not onlyreduces deathsbut also cuts how many people end up in the hospital. He rebutted criticism that antivirals, which can cost about $700 per treatment, are a more expensive way to combat the coronavirus than vaccines (and therefore more profitable for drug companies).

        "title": "America Loves Choices. Not in Phones.",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nAmerica\u2019s smartphone market is stuck.\nMore than 70 percent of the smartphones that Americans bought this year have been either an iPhone or a Samsung device. Smartphone brands other than those two are selling less each year, according to data that the research firm IDC compiled for me.\nMany other countries are dominated by some mix of the Coke and Pepsi of smartphones, too, but analysts told me that the U.S. is a bit odd for the lack of a relatively strong third or fourth competitor.\n2021 figures are for the first half of the year.\nSource: IDC Mobile Phone Tracker\nBy The New York Times\nIt\u2019s a cornerstone idea in America that it\u2019s good to have more choices. In principle, when multiple strong car manufacturers or grocery stores are fighting for our business, we get better products or services for less money.\nSo why do we have just two popular smartphone brands in the U.S.? Samsung and Apple make great phones, but so do other companies. Some of them sell pretty well, too \u2014 just not in the U.S.\nYes, many product categories tend to be dominated by two or three big companies. Until recently, most Americans bought razors or mattresses from a tiny number of dominant companies. Then upstarts likeDollar Shave Clubandbed-in-a-box companieslike Casper helped shake things up.\nI\u2019ll talk over the peculiarities of smartphones in the U.S., the benefits and drawbacks of how it works here, and whether there could ever be a smartphone Dollar Shave Club.\nThe American smartphone market is weird.\nGlobally, roughly 80 percent of smartphones are powered by Google\u2019s Android operating system, and Apple sells pretty much all the rest. But the U.S. has been more like a 50-50 split. Samsung is by far the top seller of Android phones.\nMany other countries where most people own smartphones \u2014 including Britain and South Korea \u2014 are ruled by Apple and Samsung, too. But in other places, there tends to be more choice and competition in smartphone shopping, often from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Realme and (until recently) Huawei.\nWhy is the U.S. like this?\nIt\u2019s complicated, but I\u2019ll offer two explanations: America\u2019s wireless providers like AT&T are the kingmakers of which phones win in the U.S., and they\u2019re fine with the status quo. Second, smartphone sellers other than Apple and Samsung aren\u2019t trying very hard, sometimes because they know it\u2019s tough to break through in the U.S.\nWireless carriers sell about three-quarters of the phones that Americans buy, and they have a good thing going with Apple and Samsung.\nApple and Samsung pay phone service providers huge sums to help advertise their new devices. Sometimes they offer commissions so that the salesperson in a Verizon store will push their models to shoppers. Phone companies also require extensive testing of new phones and technical requirements specific to the U.S.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily nefarious or unusual. But this system favors the established smartphone makers, which can afford the costs and rigmarole of teaming up with the wireless providers. It\u2019s also a risk to buy a smartphone from a brand we\u2019re unfamiliar with, and many Americans who buy a new device stick with whatever smartphone they\u2019re used to.\nSome potential smartphone challengers are also pretty meh. LG, which had been a solid No. 3 in the U.S., recentlygave up on smartphones. Chinese smartphone brands have an extra hard time in the U.S. at times because ofgovernment sanctionsandfears by U.S. officialsthat their phones might be gateways to Chinese spying.\nGoogle is (maybe) starting toput more oomph into hawkingits five-year-oldline of Pixel smartphoneswith wireless carriers, and the company slashed prices to far less than comparable iPhones. (Did you know that Google makes smartphones? Yeah, exactly.)\nIs having two dominant smartphone makers good or bad for Americans?\nYes.\nTwo strong options may be plenty. Samsung and Apple make good phones at a range of features and prices. Americans are also benefiting froma customer war among the U.S. phone companies, which are dangling steep discounts on expensive devices. (Prices for mobile service, however, are higher in the U.S. than in most other rich countries.)\nWhat I wonder is what fresh ideas don\u2019t have a chance because the U.S. smartphone market is frozen. Dollar Shave Club didn\u2019t necessarily make better razors than Gillette, but it did make buying them far more pleasant and cheaper. Casper and its peers let people skip mattress stores and made foam mattresses massively popular.\nWhat\u2019s the equivalent in smartphones that we might be missing?\nGoogle wants to work with the Pentagon, again:Three years after protests by employees stopped Google from selling technology to the U.S. military, the company is trying again bypursuing the Pentagon\u2019s multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract, my colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Kate Conger report.\nThe online information war in Myanmar:Reuterswritesabout the military in Myanmar using social media to monitor soldiers to prevent defections, spread false claims of election fraud and denounce citizens who are opposed to military rule.\nGoogle Street View is memories:A writer in The Observer explores the ways that Google\u2019s Street View feature gives us aunique glimpse of places and loved ones from our past. \u201cOn Street View, we have a panoptical view of the world and all the mysteries, non sequiturs and idiocies that are part of everyday life,\u201d Sirin Kale writes.\nI know that Halloween was days ago, but I\u2019m a sucker for videos of animals munching on pumpkins.

        "title": "Another Apple Worker Says the Company Retaliated Against Her",
        "fulltext": "Apple and its activist employees have edged toward open confrontation in recent months, as workers have gone public with criticisms of how the company treats them and have prodded federal agencies to investigate.\nOn Tuesday, that conflict escalated as one of the leaders of an activist movement at the company, who said she had been fired in October, said in a charge to the National Labor Relations Board that Apple had retaliated against her.\nJanneke Parrish, a former Apple Maps program manager, accused Apple and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, of violating federal labor law by firing her in retaliation for forming the employee group, known as #AppleToo.\nMs. Parrish\u2019s complaint, in a legal filing with the N.L.R.B., is the latest in a series made by Apple employees. One former Apple employee, Ashley Gjovik, has made at least 10 complaints to state and federal agencies claiming misconduct by her former employer. Cher Scarlett, another leader of #AppleToo, has been on leave and has been talking to federal regulators about whether Apple prohibits its workers from speaking out.\nThe confrontation with employeeshas been a surprising turn at Apple, which has long had a reputation for a buttoned-up, top-down culture. While other big tech companies likeGooglehave long dealt with worker unrest, Apple had until recently largely avoided such conflicts.\nA common theme among the Apple workers\u2019 complaints is that the company\u2019s secrecy and aggressive efforts to avoid leaks about new products have permeated the rest of its corporate culture, causing a chilling effect that discourages people from talking about wages, discrimination and workplace harassment.\nNow the workers who have spoken out say they have been punished for it. Ms. Parrish said in her complaint to the N.L.R.B. that Apple had fired her to \u201cnip in the bud\u201d her organizing efforts.\n\u201cI do believe that Apple retaliated against me for speaking out,\u201d Ms. Parrish said in an interview. She said she wanted to make clear to Apple \u201cthat retaliating against workers for speaking out at what they see as injustice is not an acceptable response.\u201d\nApple has disputed the charges made by the employees.\nDeirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s human resources chief, told employees in a September meeting viewed by The New York Times that the company tracks pay and closes wage disparities whenever they are found. And Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, framed the conversation as a battle over rooting out people who leak company information.\n\u201cAs you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it\u2019s product I.P. or the details of a confidential meeting,\u201d Mr. Cook wrote in a September memo to employees that was viewed by The Times and wasreported earlier by The Verge. \u201cWe know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman on Tuesday reiterated a previous comment the company had shared about employee activism, saying that Apple was \u201cdeeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace\u201d and investigating concerns. The company said it did not comment on specific employees.\nApple has in the past faced isolated cases of worker discontent. Last year, Kate Rotondo, a former software engineer, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming gender discrimination and unequal pay before choosing to end the agency\u2019s investigation.\nBarbara Dawn Underwood, an Apple retail store employee in Georgia, sued Apple for $1.7 million, accusing the company of failing to stop a co-worker from sexually harassing and assaulting her and then retaliating by firing her while she was trying to return to work after taking leave. Apple has asked for the case, filed in a Georgia federal court, to be dismissed, and Ms. Underwood is waiting to see if she can proceed.\nRecently, the complaints have escalated into #AppleToo. Led by Ms. Parrish and Ms. Scarlett, a security engineer, the movement grew from a group of employees arguing this summer against returning to physical office spaces into a broader referendum on Apple\u2019s culture. Ms. Parrish,before she was fired in October, collected more than 500 stories from people who said they were current or former Apple employees, describing verbal abuse, sexual harassment, retaliation and discrimination at work.\nMs. Parrish said Apple told her she had been fired for deleting files from her company computer and phone before handing them over to be examined while the company investigated whether she had leaked the recording of an Apple meeting to media outlets.\nWith Ms. Parrish gone, Ms. Scarlett, who returned to work Tuesday, has continued to send employees to media outlets and labor agencies, but she said some have been scared off. \u201cThere\u2019s something muted about it now,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be targeted by executives for retaliatory investigations when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d\nFor some Apple workers, Ms. Gjovik, an outspoken former employee, has been a rallying point. Ms. Gjovik, who was a senior engineering program manager, began speaking out in March about concerns that an Apple office in Sunnyvale, Calif., was built on or near aSuperfund siteand was being tested in relation to concerns about the site.\nShe eventually escalated concerns to a company environmental health team and complained to the Environmental Protection Agency after being told not to speak with other Apple employees. Later, she went public to news organizations and on social media. She said she was placed on leave in August and fired in September for leaking confidential information, which she disputes.\nMs. Gjovik has since complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the N.L.R.B. and the California Department of Industrial Relations, which told her in late October that it would assign her case to an investigator.\nMatthew Bodie, a law professor and former field attorney at the N.L.R.B., said the labor board would likely look at how realistic it was that Apple was motivated to fire an employee because it was worried about trade secrets.\n\u201cA company is certainly free to say, \u2018We\u2019re having a confidential meeting about a new product development and we don\u2019t want it leaked out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bodie said. \u201cBut butting up against that is this idea that employees should be free to talk to one another about what\u2019s going on at the company.\u201d"

        "title": "A Tech Whistle-Blower Helps Others Speak Out",
        "fulltext": "Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of Californiasigned a billto expand protections for people who speak up about discrimination in the workplace.\nAnew websitearrived to offer tech workers advice on how to come forward about mistreatment by their employers.\nAnd Apple responded to a shareholder proposal that asked it to assess how it used confidentiality agreements in employee harassment and discrimination cases.\nThe disparate developments had one thing \u2014 or, rather, a person \u2014 in common:Ifeoma Ozoma.\nSince last year, Ms. Ozoma, 29, a former employee of Pinterest, Facebook and Google, has emerged as a central figure among tech whistle-blowers. The Yale-educated daughter of Nigerian immigrants, she has supported and mentored tech workers who needed help speaking out, pushed for more legal protections for those employees and urged tech companies and their shareholders to change their whistle-blower policies.\nShe helped inspire and pass the new California law, the Silenced No More Act, which prohibits companies from using nondisclosure agreements to squelch workers who speak up against discrimination in any form. Ms. Ozoma also released a website, The Tech Worker Handbook, which provides information on whether and how workers should blow the whistle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad to me that we still have such a lack of accountability within the tech industry that individuals have to do it\u201d by speaking up, Ms. Ozoma said in an interview.\nHer efforts \u2014 which have alienated at least one ally along the way \u2014 are increasingly in the spotlight as restive tech employees take more action against their employers. Last month,Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, revealed that she had leaked thousands of internal documents about the social network\u2019s harms. (Facebook has since renamed itself Meta.) Apple also recentlyfaced employee unrest, with many workers voicing concerns about verbal abuse, sexual harassment,retaliationand discrimination.\nMs. Ozoma is now focused on directly pushing tech companies to stop using nondisclosure agreements to prevent employees from speaking out about workplace discrimination. She has also met with activists and organizations that want to pass legislation similar to the Silenced No More Act elsewhere. And she is constantly in touch with other activist tech workers, including those who have organized against Google and Apple.\nMuch of Ms. Ozoma\u2019s work stems from experience. In June 2020, she and a colleague, Aerica Shimizu Banks, publicly accused their former employer, the virtual pinboard maker Pinterest, of racism and sexism. Pinterest initially denied the allegations but later apologized for its workplace culture. Its workersstaged a walkout, anda former executive suedthe company over gender discrimination.\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how Ifeoma has taken some very painful experiences, developed solutions for them and then built a movement around making those solutions a reality,\u201d said John Tye, the founder of Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit that provides legal support to whistle-blowers. He and Ms. Ozoma recently appeared on awebinarto educate people on whistle-blower rights.\nMeredith Whittaker, a former Google employee who helpedorganize a 2018 walkoutover the company\u2019s sexual harassment policy, added of Ms. Ozoma: \u201cShe has stuck around and worked to help others blow the whistle more safely.\u201d\nMs. Ozoma, who grew up in Anchorage and Raleigh, N.C., became an activist after a five-year career in the tech industry. A political science major, she moved to Washington, D.C., in 2015 to join Google in government relations. She then worked at Facebook in Silicon Valley on international policy.\nIn 2018, Pinterest recruited Ms. Ozoma to its public policy team. There, she helped bring Ms. Banks on board. They spearheaded policy decisions including ending the promotion ofanti-vaccination informationandcontent related to plantation weddingson Pinterest, Ms. Ozoma said.\nYet Ms. Ozoma and Ms. Banks said they faced unequal pay, racist comments and retaliation for raising complaints at Pinterest. They left the company in May 2020. A month later, during the Black Lives Matter protests, Pinterest posted a statement supporting its Black employees.\nMs. Ozoma and Ms. Banks said Pinterest\u2019s hypocrisy had pushed them to speak out. On Twitter, theydisclosed their experiencesas Black women at the company, with Ms. Ozoma declaring that Pinterest\u2019s statement was \u201ca joke.\u201d\nIn a statement, Pinterest said it had taken steps to increase diversity. On Wednesday, the company settled a shareholder suit about its workplace culture and pledged $50 million to diversity and inclusion efforts.\nBy speaking out, Ms. Ozoma and Ms. Banks took a risk. That\u2019s because they broke the nondisclosure agreements they had signed with Pinterest when they left the company. California law, which offered only partial protection, didn\u2019t cover people speaking out about racial discrimination.\nPeter Rukin, their lawyer, said he had an idea: What if state law was expanded to ban nondisclosure agreements from preventing people speaking out on any workplace discrimination? Ms. Ozoma and Ms. Banks soon began working with a California state senator, Connie Leyva, a Democrat, on a bill to do just that. It was introduced in February.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of these women for coming forward,\u201d Ms. Levya said.\nAlong the way, Ms. Ozoma and Ms. Banks fell out. Ms. Banks said she no longer spoke with Ms. Ozoma because Ms. Ozoma had recruited her to Pinterest without disclosing the discrimination there and then excluded her from working on the Silenced No More Act.\n\u201cIfeoma then cut me out of the initiative through gaslighting and bullying,\u201d Ms. Banks said.\nMs. Ozoma said she had not cut Ms. Banks out of the organizing. She added that Ms. Banks had \u201cfelt left out\u201d because news coverage focused on Ms. Ozoma\u2019s role.\nSince leaving Pinterest, Ms. Ozoma has moved to Santa Fe, N.M., where she lives with a flock of chickens she calls the Golden Girls. She also runs a tech equity consulting firm, Earthseed.\nThrough Earthseed, Ms. Ozoma is continuing her whistle-blowing work. She is collaborating with the nonprofit Open MIC and the consulting firm Whistle Stop Capital to stop tech companies from using nondisclosure agreements to keep workers anywhere from coming forward on discrimination.\nIn September, Ms. Ozoma, Whistle Stop Capital and Open MIC, along with the social impact investor Nia Impact Capital, filed a shareholder proposal at Apple. The proposal asked the company to assess the risks associated with the use of concealment clauses for employees who have experienced harassment and discrimination.\nLast month, Apple said in a letter that it wouldn\u2019t take action on the proposal, arguing that the company \u201cdoes not limit employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to speak freely about harassment, discrimination and other unlawful acts in the workplace.\u201d It declined to comment beyond the letter.\nMs. Ozoma also supports and counsels other tech activists. The Tech Worker Handbook website, in part, was designed to help with that. The website has information on how to navigate nondisclosure agreements and how to protect against corporate surveillance or physical threats. Across the top of the site is a slogan: \u201cPreparedness Is Power.\u201d Since it went online on Oct. 6, the site has had over 53,000 visitors, Ms. Ozoma said.\n\u201cI send it to people who are thinking about coming forward,\u201d said Ashley Gjovik, a former activist employee at Apple who has relied on Ms. Ozoma for support. When people think about whistle-blowing, she added, \u201ctheir mind won\u2019t go to the places of the personal, digital, security stuff, all of the legal ramifications, how do you even get that story out, the impact on friends and family, the impact on your mental health.\u201d\nLast month, Ms. Ozoma also got a call from Cher Scarlett, another activist Apple employee who left the company this month. (Ms. Scarlett declined to provide her real name for security reasons; she is legally changing her name to Cher Scarlett.) She asked Ms. Ozoma how to pass legislation like the Silenced No More Act in her home state, Washington.\nMs. Ozoma described the steps she had taken, including working closely with a lawmaker who could write a bill, Ms. Scarlett said.\nAlong with another tech activist, Ms. Scarlett then contacted Karen Keiser, a Washington state senator and a Democrat. Ms. Keiser now plans to sponsor a bill to expand whistle-blower protections when the legislative session starts in January, her office said.\n\u201cThis is why the network of whistle-blowers and women like Ifeoma are so important,\u201d Ms. Scarlett said."

        "title": "The Chip That Could Transform Computing",
        "fulltext": "For decades, the chip-making giant Intel reigned as one of the most technically advanced companies in Silicon Valley.\nIt was Intel\u2019s co-founder Gordon Moore who famouslypredictedthat computer chips would keep getting unimaginably more powerful. And it was Intel\u2019s products, the x86 line of microprocessors at the heart of just about every personal computer, that turned Moore\u2019s prophecy into a governing \u201claw\u201d of tech. The promise that every year, Intel\u2019s new chips would be much faster than its old chipsset the rhythmfor advances across the entire industry.\nBut somewhere in the past decade, Intel lost the plot. It was blindsided by new trends \u2014 therising utility of graphics processors, the widespread adoption of mobile devices \u2014 and beset by a series ofembarrassing operational delays. Even more surprising than Intel\u2019s slippage has been which company has come to succeed it as the pacesetter of processors. Meeting with employees early this year, Pat Gelsinger, Intel\u2019s incoming chief executive at the time, was reluctant even to speak the enemy\u2019s name \u2014 according to The Oregonian, hejokingly referred to the new chip champion only as\u201ca lifestyle company in Cupertino.\u201d\nCupertino, Calif., of course, is the home of Apple, whose focus on design, aesthetics and usability has often left it vulnerable to Gelsinger\u2019s implication that its products are more fashionable than capable. But last month, Appleunveiledlaptops built around its own custom-designed processors, the M1 Pro and M1 Max, that have rendered such digs completely ridiculous.\nEarlyreviewsfor Apple\u2019s new machines have been so rapturous \u2014\u201cthe most powerful laptops we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d\u201cdramatically better than they have any business\u201d being,\u201cjust generally absurd\u201d\u2014 that I worried I\u2019d only be let down when I got my hands on one and it proved to be as frustrating as all computers inevitably are.\nI have not been let down. I\u2019ve been bowled over. I\u2019ve been using a new MacBook Pro with Apple\u2019s fastest new chip, the M1 Max, for about two weeks, and I can\u2019t remember the last time a laptop has wowed me like this. Actually, I don\u2019t think a laptop has ever really wowed me, because it\u2019s just a laptop.\nThis ridiculously fast laptop, though, got me thinking expansively about what\u2019s to come. Over the past several years, some in tech have worried thatMoore\u2019s Law has been running out of steam. At some point soon, experts theorized, microchips would begin to hit fundamental physical limits that would make further performance gains extremely challenging. And because processors are essentially the engines of computers, their impending limit implied an eventual limit on the usefulness of computing, too.\nI called up several experts to ask what Apple\u2019s innovation tells us about the future of computing. The short answer: We still have a way to go before hitting a wall.\nThe M1 chips make laptops as powerful as some of the fastest desktops on the market yet so efficient that their battery life beats that of just about any other laptop. The chips portend a future absolutely saturated with computing power \u2014 with extremely powerful processors not just in traditional computers and smartphones but also in cars, drones, virtual-reality machines and pretty much everything else that runs on electricity.\nHow Apple achieved these gains is an interesting business and technical story. In 2008, about a year after Apple released the first iPhone, itpurchased a small semiconductorstart-up to build specialized chips for its phones.For many years, Intel\u2019s chips were made primarily for stationary machines like servers and personal computers. To hit their top speeds, Intel\u2019s processorshad to draw a lot of electricity and created a lot of heat. But Apple\u2019s most important products are mobile, powered by batteries, so chugging a lot of power wasn\u2019t ideal. Its chip designers had to take a starkly different approach. Rather than maximize raw power, Apple aimed to build chips that were optimized for powerandefficiency.\nThetechnical ways Apple has achieved this combinationwill sound like geeky gobbledygook to anyone unschooled in semiconductor theory. Broadly, though, Apple\u2019s systems use a lot of specialized processing units and are optimized to run more operations\u201cout of order,\u201da technical term thatbasically means they can execute more code simultaneously.\nThe result is something like the difference between a muscle car and a Tesla. The muscle car achieves high speeds with a huge engine that burns a lot of gasoline. The Tesla canhit even higher speedswhile consuming less power because its electric motor is inherently more efficient than a gas engine. For years, Intel was making muscle cars; Apple\u2019s big innovation was to build the Tesla of computer chips.\nApple also benefited from enormous economies of scale. Because the iPhone isone of the most profitable products ever sold, the company could afford to invest billions in a custom chip operation \u2014 and then to repurpose its iPhone chips for the iPad, the Apple TV and now the Mac.\nApple\u2019s investments have helped spark a new race in the chip business. Intelis investing $20 billion on new chip-making plants, and other chip manufacturers \u2014 Samsung and TSMC, which manufactures processors for Apple \u2014are collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollarsto increase capacity.\nIf I sound a little too giddy about microchips, it\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been much breakthrough technical innovation in the tech business for years. Facebook is off ruining democracies, Google just keeps sucking more money out of ads, and each new iPhone is just incrementally better than the last.\nApple\u2019s processors feel genuinely new. For better and worse, they will dramatically improve the capabilities of our devices in the next few years. Today\u2019s fastest phones are more powerful than computers from just a few years ago; Andrei Frumusanu, whocovered Apple\u2019s new processorsfor the tech-news siteAnandtech, told me that he expects Apple will be able to keep pushing similar gains at least through the next decade.\nAnd other tech companies will spend heavily to catch up. After seeing what Apple has done, Frumusanu said, \u201ceveryone\u2019s just freaking out.\u201d\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "What Apple\u2019s New Repair Program Means for You (and Your iPhone)",
        "fulltext": "Apple delivered an early holiday gift on Wednesday to the eco-conscious and the do-it-yourselfers: It said it would soon begin selling the parts, tools and instructions forpeople to do their own iPhone repairs.\nIt was a major victory for the \u201cright to repair\u201d movement, which has demanded that tech manufacturers provide the necessary components and manuals for customers to fix their own smartphones, tablets and computers.\nApple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others have long fought proposed legislation that would make such repair resources publicly available. But the movement gained momentum this summer when the Federal Trade Commissionannouncedthat it wouldramp up law enforcementagainst tech companies that made it difficult to fix their gadgets.\nFor decades, the idea that people couldmaintain their own consumer electronicshas been impractical. Genuine parts were difficult to obtain, and repairs could be expensive and intimidating. When phones and computers broke, buying new ones was the simplest option.\nNow Apple\u2019s self-repair program is a sign that the tech industry could finally be warming to making maintenance a part of the experience of owning a gadget.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win for repair shops, it\u2019s a win for consumers, and it\u2019s a win for the planet,\u201d said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization that worked on the \u201cright to repair\u201d legislation.\nHere\u2019s what this means for you.\nStarting early next year, Apple said, people can use an online store to order parts and tools to mend its newer products, including the iPhone 12 and 13 and recent Mac computers. Customers who send in their broken part to Apple will receive credit toward the purchase of a new part.\nThe program will focus on the most common items that need fixing, such as screens, batteries and cameras, before expanding to other types of components.\nThe company has not yet published a list of costs for parts, but said the prices for consumers would be what authorized repair shops paid. Currently, a replacement iPhone 12 screen costs an authorized shop about $234 after a broken screen is traded in. At an Apple store, repairing an out-of-warranty iPhone 12 screen costs about $280.\n\u201cCreating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement.\nIn short, you will have more options to mend an iPhone, which can bring your costs down.\nPreviously, it was easiest to visit an Apple store to get an iPhone fixed. But just as taking your car to a dealer for servicing isn\u2019t the cheapest option, going to an Apple store also wasn\u2019t the most cost-effective.\nThe alternative was to take your iPhone to a third party for repair, potentially for a more competitive price. When I took a broken iPhone XS screen to an Apple store this year, I was quoted $280 for the repair, compared with $180 from an independent outlet.\nYet Apple has made iPhone repairs increasingly difficult for third-party shops, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and publishes instructions for consumers to repair their electronics.\nEven when genuine parts were used, some repairs could be authenticated only with Apple\u2019s software tools, which were not available to the public. Apple provided those software tools only to its staff and authorized repair shops that signed a contract and agreed to buy parts solely from the company. These authorized shops were then more likely to charge higher prices than unauthorized ones.\nApple\u2019s new program opens more doors. You could try fixing your device yourself to save cash. Or you could buy the parts from Apple and take them to someone else to do the repair.\nAll of this may encourage people to maintain their products for longer and hold on to them, similar to doing regular maintenance on a car. That has implications for reducing technology waste and helping the environment.\nApple was historically one of the most vocal opponents to the \u201cright to repair\u201d movement. The company cited security risks \u2014 like a customer\u2019s data being hijacked during an unauthorized repair \u2014 as a primary reason to keep parts and instructions out of public reach.\nFor non-Apple customers, this news is thus significant. If Apple, one of the world\u2019s most valuable public companies, is setting a new standard with repairs, you can expect other tech manufacturers to follow \u2014 especially if they want to avoid fines from the federal government.\n\u201cThis announcement marks significant progress toward securing our right to repair, and we\u2019re proud of Apple for making this bold move,\u201d Mr. Wiens said."
