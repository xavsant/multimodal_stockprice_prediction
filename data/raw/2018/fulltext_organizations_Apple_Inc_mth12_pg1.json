        "title": "Apple Will Update iPhones in China to Avoid a Ban on Sales",
        "fulltext": "Apple said it would update the software of iPhones in China to try to resolvea legal dispute that threatens to stop the companyfrom selling older iPhones in the country.\nApple and its longtime chip supplier, Qualcomm, have been fighting in court over Apple\u2019s use of Qualcomm\u2019s technology. On Nov. 30, a Chinese court ruled Apple must immediately stop selling seven older iPhone models in China because it infringed on two Qualcomm patents.\nBut Apple has not stopped selling those iPhones there. The company has argued the phones are not subject to the ruling because they are running new software that was not discussed at trial.\nOn Friday, Apple said in a statement that it would update its iPhones in China early next week \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order.\u201d Apple said its update would change the iPhones\u2019 software so it did not infringe on Qualcomm patents, which relate to switching between apps and changing the size and appearance of photographs.\nDon Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement that Apple was already violating the court\u2019s order.\n\u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d he said. Qualcomm this week asked Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court to enforce its injunction.\nApple also asked the court to reconsider its ruling. The company told the court it made about $13.3 billion on iPhone sales in China in the first quarter of 2018, meaning it would lose millions of dollars a day if it had to stop selling certain phones in the country.\nThe court\u2019s preliminary injunction barred Apple from selling the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X in China. The ruling did not apply to Apple\u2019s three newest iPhones: the XS, the XS Max and the XR.\nA lawyer for Qualcomm in China told the Financial Times this week that the company would also seek bans on sales of Apple\u2019s newest iPhones, claiming they were also infringing Qualcomm\u2019s patents."

        "title": "Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing Deals",
        "fulltext": "Facebook and some of the other largest technology firms in the world faced sharp criticism on Wednesday for failing to disclose the extent of the social network\u2019s data-sharing deals, many of which went back to the company\u2019s early years.\nDetails of the deals,revealed in a New York Times report on Tuesday, set in motion a fresh round of rebukes from legislators who had singled out Facebook\u2019s sharing practices in the recent past. And they came at a moment when the Trump administration, Congress and even some Silicon Valley executives are calling for stricter privacy laws that would govern Facebook and other businesses that trade in huge amounts of personal information.\nLawmakers in the United States and Britain on Wednesday called for greater oversight of Facebook, the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.\nSenator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201d\nThe outcry camein response to The Times\u2019s findingsthat Facebook had granted business partners, including Microsoft, Amazon and Spotify, more intrusive access to user data than it had divulged \u2014 allowing some partners access without users\u2019 permission. Last June, The Times uncovered a subset of Facebook\u2019s partners, all of them device makers, that pulled user data onto smartphones and tablets.\nFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.\nIn a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\n\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.\nBut he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.\nFacebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.\nNews of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.\nSenator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201d\nDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201d\nAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.\nFacebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.\nBut deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.\nRecords obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.\nAn Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.\nIn addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.\nFacebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.\nSpotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\n\u201cThis story exposes the myth of control,\u201d Kate Crawford, a founder of the A.I. Now Institute at New York University, wrote in atweetreferring to Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Spotify, Netflix and other companies.\n\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added."

If you like what you\u2019re reading and haven\u2019t already subscribed,click here\u2014 and then forward to a friend if you\u2019re feeling generous.\nSpeaking of the holiday season, are you one of the 45.7 million Americansplanning to fly in the next two weeks? If so, keep an ear out: Customs officials at Kennedy Airporthave intercepted almost 200 live finches(70 last week alone) that were smuggled on flights from Guyana. Once in the United States,the birds compete in chirping competitions, and a winner can fetch up to $10,000. While we do not condone any illegal behavior, in the grand scheme of sounds to be heard on a plane, a finch sounds downright pleasant.\nDEC. 9-15\nWant a shot at an Apple employee discount? Now may be your moment. Appleannounced plans on Thursdayto invest $1 billion in a slick new campus in Austin, Tex. It will eventually bring 15,000 jobs to the area, while additional offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., each plan to hire more than 1,000 employees. For years, Apple has been under fire for relying heavily on China for its product manufacturing, and this announcement makes good on its recent promise to expand operations in the United States.Other tech giantslike Amazon and Google have made similar moves to expand their domestic work force in the past few months.\nConsider popping over to England for some holiday shopping \u2014 you\u2019ll get a good deal on your dollar, as the British pound fell last week to its lowest value in a year and half. That\u2019s only one symptom of the instability brought on by Britain\u2019s floundering attempts to extricate itself from the European Union. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 whose name is almost impossible to say without the word \u201cembattled\u201d before it \u2014postponed the parliamentary voteon her Brexit proposal, which was clearly headed for defeat.

But the dispute is far from over, and China\u2019s economy is showing signs of stress, weakened by mounting debt and the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. On Friday, Chinese officialsreported bleak numbersfor monthly sales and industrial production, jolting markets around the globe. Auto sales have also plunged, and some factories are sending workers off for the Lunar New Year holiday two months early.\nDEC. 16-22\nDon\u2019t be surprised by a tremor in the markets this Wednesday \u2014 it\u2019s just the Federal Reserve making its last interest rate decision of the year. The Fed isexpected to raisebenchmark rates by another quarter point, and to do sotwice more in 2019. Officials hope to stem inflation and keep the economy solid as it grows over the long run, but these upticks affect home buyers and other borrowers most acutely in the short term: Higher interest rates on mortgages and other loans can add up, and quickly. President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for rate increases of any amount, andblamed this fall\u2019s market volatilityon the Fed\u2019s choice to impose them.\nSo much for Washington going quietly into the holiday break. Funding for parts of the federal government will expire this Friday unless Congress and Mr. Trump can agree on legislation to keep the lights on. In anawkward televised spatwith the Democratic congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the president said he would be \u201cproud to shut down the government\u201d if the funding bill did not include $5 billion for his proposed southern border wall \u2014 which he has repeatedly said thatMexico would pay for, but never mind. Democrats have agreed to dedicate funds to border security, but not enough for the wall.\nWhile Nissan\u2019s former chairman, Carl Ghosn, sits in jail, awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct, the future of his auto empire (the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors) isin limbo. Nissan\u2019s stock has dropped 9 percent in recent weeks, and its board members are meeting on Monday to attempt to appoint a new chairman. It\u2019sunlikely that they will agree on one. They\u2019ll also set a date for a shareholder vote to oust Mr. Ghosn from the board altogether. Rather awkwardly, Renault has stuck by Mr. Ghosn, and he remains chief executive. So much for an alliance.\nFederal prosecutors areexamining the financesof Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration committee and a pro-Trump super PAC to determine whether foreigners illegally funneled money to both in hopes of buying influence over American policy. Also, the tabloid publisher American Media Inc.admitted to participatingin a hush-money scheme intended to protect Mr. Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.

        "title": "Chinese Court Says Apple Infringed on Qualcomm Patents",
        "fulltext": "A two-year legal battle between Apple and its chip supplier, Qualcomm, reached a new level of contention on Monday when Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered Apple to stop selling older iPhone models in China.\nThe court ruling is the latest turn in the two companies\u2019 fight over Apple\u2019s use of Qualcomm technology in iPhones. But Apple and Qualcomm disagreed on the impact the decision will have on iPhone sales in China.\nQualcomm said a Chinese court ruled on Nov. 30 that Apple had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and issued a preliminary injunction that bars Apple from selling the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X in China. The ruling did not apply to Apple\u2019s three newest iPhones: the XS, the XS Max and the XR.\nApple said in a statement, however, that it continued to sell all iPhone models in China.\n\u201cQualcomm\u2019s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\u201d an Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said. He added that in the Chinese court case, Qualcomm had challenged Apple on three patents it had never raised before, including one that had already been invalidated.\nLate Monday in China, Apple continued to sell four of the seven iPhone models affected by the ruling \u2014 the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus \u2014 on its Chinese website, as well as its newer models.\nApple\u2019s stock price was up less than 1 percent on Monday. Qualcomm\u2019s stock rose 2.2 percent.\nA slowdown in iPhone sales has contributed to a roughly 25 percent slide in Apple\u2019s share price since the company last released quarterly results on Nov. 1. The ruling also adds to developments that have worsened trade tensions between the United States and China, including the recent arrest of the chief financial officer of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei.\n\u201cThe hits keep coming,\u201d said Tom Forte, an Apple analyst at D. A. Davidson, referring to the string of negative headlines for the company. He added that the Chinese ruling was not as worrisome as other recent news because it affected only older smartphones and could still be resolved.\nIt is possible that Apple would be able to sell older iPhones if they were running on newer software. But Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement that the court ruling wasn\u2019t specific to the phones\u2019 software. He said Qualcomm would ask the Chinese courts to enforce the order.\n\u201cApple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us,\u201d he said.\nQualcomm, which has long sold key communications chips to Apple but has been excluded from its latest models, has filed a series of patent suits against the smartphone giant in multiple countries. Those lawsuits came after Apple filed suit in early 2017 challenging Qualcomm\u2019s practices in licensing its patents.\nThe ruling in China involved two Qualcomm patents. One lets consumers adjust and reformat the size and appearance of photographs. The other manages applications using a touch screen when viewing, navigating and dismissing applications, Qualcomm said.\nA Qualcomm spokeswoman said Apple could ask the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court to reconsider its orders within 10 days of being served with them. There is no other appeal process. Apple cannot post a bond or pay a fine and continue infringing the two patents, she said.\nApple said it had filed a request for \u201creconsideration\u201d with the court on Monday, the first step in appealing the preliminary injunction.\nSteve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, has said he expects that victories in its patent cases would help persuade Apple to agree to settle the legal disputes.\nQualcomm is the largest supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks. More than half of its profits have historically come from patent license fees it charges to phone makers, which have in turn complained to regulatory authorities and sued Qualcomm.\nApple sued Qualcomm in January 2017, accusing it of monopolistic practices that harm Apple and the industry. The Federal Trade Commission raised similar charges in a case filed against Qualcomm the same month. Qualcomm has insisted its practices are legal.\nApple has gradually reduced its reliance on Qualcomm, turning to Intel for modem chips in its latest iPhones.\nQualcomm has tried to put pressure on Apple by claiming patent infringement and other misdeeds, such asaccusations that Apple stoleproprietary Qualcomm software and shared it with Intel. Apple said Qualcomm had failed to provide evidence of any stolen information.\nQualcomm has also resorted to an aggressive public-relations campaign against Apple. Itenlisted the firm Definers Public Affairsto publish negative articles about Apple on a conservative website and to start a false campaign to draft Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, as a presidential candidate, presumably to make him a target of President Trump.\nNews of the Chinese court\u2019s ruling emerged during a broad skirmish between China and the United States over trade. The United States has cracked down on ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese telecommunications giants, for illicit activities. And China scuttled Qualcomm\u2019s proposed acquisition of NXP, a Dutch chip maker.\nSome business leaders in the United States have been bracing for retribution from China after the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada, fearing that American executives in China could be harassed.\nThe Trump administration said last week that it did not anticipate such retaliation and expressed hope that the situation, which it described as a criminal justice matter, would not derail trade talks."

        "title": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble",
        "fulltext": "After a decade of extraordinary gains, the American stock market has come unhinged in recent weeks, with the technology sector leading the rapid decline. American tech giants are down on average25 percentfrom recent peaks, and it appears the big global bubble of the 2010s is bursting. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is what comes next.\nOne answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.\nInvestors\u2019 obsession with tech had thrown many other industries, and many countries not named theUnited States, into the lonely neighborhood of the anti-bubbles. At their peaks this year, Apple and Amazon were worth more than $1 trillion. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, became the richest man since John D. Rockefeller, with an estimated net worth of$156 billion. And tech was overshadowing entire countries and regions to a degree I have rarely seen in my 25 years as an investor.\nUntil the tech reversal began in October, stock markets from Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe and Latin America were trading at multidecade lows relative to the United States. For the price of Apple you could have bought all the companies in three of the largest markets of Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Or all the public companies in the three largest markets of Eastern Europe \u2014 Poland, the Czech Republic andHungary \u2014nearly three times over.\nThis isn\u2019t normal.Typically, prices reflect the market\u2019s best collective bet on the future, and it is a clear sign of mania when the market thinks one company has a brighter future than a large country.But that is the market-defying nature of bubbles and anti-bubbles today.\nTo be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.\nHistorically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.\nBut as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.\nIn the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage.\nThe next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom.\nBut they were forced to streamline their finances and operations, and their stock fortunes were poised to rebound when the dot-com bets went bust at the turn of the decade. By late 2007, with commodity prices surging, their comeback was complete. Five of the world\u2019s 10most valuable companies, as measured by market capitalization, were energy giants, including Russia\u2019s Gazprom.\nThough the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom.\nIf the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.\nThere are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.\nThe bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.\nAnti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.\nBubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram."
