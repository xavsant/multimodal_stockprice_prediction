        "fulltext": "LEON COOPERMAN COULD FACE SHOWDOWN WITH REGULATORS|Leon G. Cooperman and his $5.2 billion hedge fund Omega Advisors received a\n                                                    notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission sayingthey could face enforcement action over trading violations,Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook.\nMr. Cooperman said it was related to the trading of a single security \u2014 Atlas Pipeline \u2014 in July 2010 and a possible third party. Omega had been invested in the security since 2007.\nMr. Cooperman defended himself and his firm vigorously, saying,\u201cI am not going to let these guys change my legacy.\u201d\nHe said he had been called to testify before the regulator more than a week ago.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the government investigation will have an impact,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I were to\n                                                    reach a contrary conclusion, I would close up shop and give you back your money.\u201d\nOmega has had a tough time. Its Overseas Partners fund lost 10.4 percent in 2015.The firm is down 6 percent this year.\nThe investigation indicates that regulators have not given up on pursuing improper trading cases against the hedge fund industry in spite of an unfavorable court ruling more than a year ago.\n\nWILLIAM ACKMAN BETS AGAIN ON VALEANT, BUT IT COULD STILL CRUMBLE|The schadenfreude on Wall Street has been thick since William\n                                                    A. Ackman was dethroned,\nAndrew Ross Sorkin writes in DealBook.\nMr. Ackman\u2019s funds are down about 47 percentand his miscalculated investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals has turned into an unmitigated disaster.\nValeant said it would restate its earnings and pushed J. Michael Pearson, the chief executive, to step down,Katie Thomas and Andrew Pollack report in The New York Times.But Mr. Ackman, who made his name spotting financial fraud, missed signs of chicanery at Valeant.\nMr. Ackman would have to generate returns of 50 to 70 percent in his funds to earn a performance fee, Mr. Sorkin writes.This would take a near miracle.\nThe damage from the bet has also cascaded across Wall Street and around the world.Some followed Mr. Ackman into Valeant, Deutsche Bank helped underwrite a public offering for Mr. Ackman\u2019s\n                                                    funds. UBS also led Mr. Ackman\u2019s offerings.\nThe Rothschild Bank and its wealth management unit bought $274 million of Pershing stock on behalf of its clients. Qatar\u2019s investment fund also took a $141 million stake. The Blackstone Group bought\n                                                    into the offering as well as working as an adviser to Pershing. Even Carl Icahn, Mr. Ackman\u2019s former nemesis, has taken a hit via his stake in American International Group, which has a stake in\n                                                    Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund.Pension funds that manage money for teachers, police and firefighters have stakes in Pershing too.\nAll this hasset off gossip in New York real estate circles, where agents have begun speculating about the future of Mr. Ackman\u2019s property investments.\nMr. Ackman believes he can get back to even within a year, buthe may have to turn things around sooneras May is the next window for investors to ask Mr. Ackman for their money back.\nMr. Ackman may be maintaining his optimism, but Valeant\u2019s board looks like a toxic mixture,Robert Cyran writes in Breakingviews. The company pointed the finger at\n                                                    Howard B. Schiller, the company\u2019s former chief financial officer, for \u201cimproper conduct.\u201dMr. Schiller has refused to quit as a director, so he will be sitting on the board along with Mr. Ackman and a nominee for ValueAct Capital.\nValeant\u2019s failure to file audited financial statements on time may put it in default and potentially force it to repay slugs of debt. Raising new cash would be a challenge even without the company\u2019s\n                                                    other problems.\nValeant\u2019s indebtedness stems from the serial acquisition of sometimes mediocre assets at inflated prices \u2014 if anything, Valeant will have to sell assets to reduce debt.It is in a fight for survival,\n                                                    Mr. Cyran writes.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The House Financial Services committee will hear testimony from Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on thestate of the international financial systemat 10 a.m.\n\nMARRIOTT RAISES BID FOR STARWOOD|Marriott International sweetened its bid for Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, butit may not be enough to deter the Anbang Insurance Group and its co-investors,\n                                                    who swooped in with a bid last week,Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.\nUnder Marriott\u2019s new offer, shareholders would receive $21 a share in cash and 0.8 share of Marriott for each share of Starwood.The deal values Starwood at $79.53 a share, or $13.6 billion,\n                                                    as of the market close on Friday. This compares with last week\u2019s offer of $78 a share, worth about $13.2 billion.\nMarriott\u2019s proposal may not be on the table for long \u2014 analysts say that Anbang may come back with another offer and thatthe new bid does not do much to deter rivals.The breakup fee\n                                                    has increased from $400 million to $450 million, and Starwood has agreed to reimburse Marriott for its financing-related costs, up to $18 million.Morningstar said the Anbang consortium would have to offer around $86 a share to be competitive with Marriott\u2019s latest proposal.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nAndrew S.

        "fulltext": "ACKMAN\u2019S REPUTATION AT RISK|Pressure is growing on William A. Ackman after the stock price of the drug company Valeant\n                                                    plummeted more than 50 percent on Tuesday,Alexandra Stevenson writes in DealBook.\n                                                    Mr. Ackman, a hedge fund titan, has already lost investors 19.3 percent this year, with much of the decline driven by Valeant.\nThe drug company is facing a federal investigation and shareholder lawsuits. It also said on Tuesday that itwould not be able to file its annual financial statement in time, warning that it could\n                                                    default on some of its debt as a result, asKatie Thomas reports in The New York Times.\nMr. Ackman is not alone \u2014 other well-known investors followed him into the stock \u2014 but his reputation as a bold moneymaker is at risk.\nStill he maintained on Tuesday thatValeant was worth \u201cmultiples of the current market price.\u201d\nBut investors are struggling to see the silver lining in the headlines about Valeant.\nIt is difficult to say where the relationship between Mr. Ackman and J. Michael Pearson, Valeant\u2019s chief, goes from here, saysMatt Levine at BloombergView. Valeant is already an activist\u2019s dream \u2014 obsessed\n                                                    with shareholder value, compensated accordingly, disciplined on costs, open to leverage and financial engineering.There aren\u2019t a lot of moves left in the activist playbook.\nMr. Levine also notes that he does not understand Valeant\u2019s investor-relations strategy. Why have one-on-one calls to reassure analysts, only to sandbag them with bad results and guidance two weeks\n                                                    later? he asks. Also in question is why the company had to issue a correction over an earnings release that it knew would be heavily scrutinized.\nValeant\u2019s future hinges on the question of how much its collection of businesses is worth,\nGretchen Morgenson writes in Fair Game.\nIts stock market value of $11.4 billion after the close of business on Tuesday was less than half of the $31 billion in debt the company carries.\nValeant\u2019s reliance on acquisitions makes the company\u2019s true cash flows much harder to fathom and its preferred measure of cash flow is not based on generally accepted accounting principles,\n                                                    so it is not reliable.\nThe acquisitions are probably valued on Valeant\u2019s books at or near the prices paid for them and those prices are often far higher than the businesses are worth, analysts say.\nValeant are learning an age-old market lesson the hard way, Ms. Morgenson writes.A company\u2019s assets may shrink but its debt doesn\u2019t.\n\nFINANCIAL ALCHEMY CHOKES SUNEDISON|SunEdison is distressed and floundering after the terminated agreement to buy Vivint Solar\n                                                    for $2.2 billion,Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor.\nSunEdison could not afford the deal,instead resorting to debt instruments that is usually the last resort of acquirers. It also engaged in financial engineering by creating\u201cyieldcos,\u201d newly created public companies that purchase energy assets from a parent company.The\n                                                    parent company can then build these assets and offload them to the yieldco, which will run the asset with the aim of creating a steady stream of dividend payments to holders.\nOne of SunEdison\u2019s yieldcos, TerraForm Power, agreed to buy $922 million of Vivint assets from SunEdison, selling stock to finance the purchase. SunEdison controls the yieldcos but does not own a\n                                                    majority interest.\nAppaloosa Management protested about the acquisition, asserting that SunEdison used its control position to force TerraForm Power into this deal.\nThen the price of oil collapsed and investors drove down the stocks of solar power companies.\nAfter TerraForm Power openly talked of getting out of the deal and a delay in completing SunEdison\u2019s financial statements, a new ironclad merger agreement was written.\nYet SunEdison still has not finished its financial statements and Vivint has now terminated and is suing SunEdison for damages.\nIt is important to place blame here, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes.Five large investment banks were involved, but even with this firepower, no one appears to have questions such a highly leveraged\n                                                    acquisition.

Few are willing to do it and one person it has fallen to is a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast, Robert W. Seiden,Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein write in DealBook.\nMr. Seiden, aWall Street bounty hunterand former Manhattan prosecutor, has been appointed by judges as the receiver to oversee the management of nine Chinese companies that once traded shares in\n                                                    the United States.\nHis actual dollar recoveries for investors have been small\u2014 just $8 million out of the nearly $90 million he has sought to recoup.But he has a reputation for tenacity \u2014 a useful\n                                                    asset for getting through the extensive negotiations required to get Chinese executives to pay up.And his clients acknowledge that the efforts are long shots.\n\u201cHe is pretty much the only game in town,\u201d said Michael Sammons, a San Antonio investor who lost money in two Chinese companies, adding that he could not find anyone else to take on the cases.\nAnd for some investors \u2014 he is the only hope they have.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The10th Annual Capital Markets Summitstarts at 8 a.m. The House committee on financial services will hold\n                                                    a hearing on the semi-annual report of theBureau of Consumer Financial Protectionat 10 a.m. TheFederal Open Market Committeewill follow its latest meeting with a news conference at\n                                                    2:30 p.m.\n\nJEFFERIES REPORTS $166.7 MILLION LOSS|Jefferies ended the first fiscal quarter with a loss of $166.7 million, as markets slammed\n                                                    equity and fixed-income trading, junk bonds and leveraged lending,Liz Moyer reports in DealBook.\n\u201cWe are humbled,\u201dsaid Richard B. Handler, the chief executive.\nJefferies is viewed as a barometer of Wall Street and other banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, have already talked about how rocky trading has hurt their first-quarter results.\nMr. Handler did note, however, that there weresigns of a rebound in the second quarter.\nJefferies saw its equities struggle, after problems with fixed-income trading and energy market exposure in previous quarters. Several write-downs contributed to the decline in its equity business line,\n                                                    while deals lined up for completion early in the year were delayed.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nLondon Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Agree to Merge|The two exchange operators hope to create a European champion to\n                                                    compete globally in an industry that has rapidly consolidated in recent years.NYT \u00bb\n\nFleetCor Technologies in Deal for Brazilian Toll Payments Company|FleetCor, based in Georgia, said that it was impressed with\n                                                    how its acquisition, Servi\u00e7os e Tecnologia de Pagamentos, has fared during Brazil\u2019s downturn.NYT \u00bb\n\nCBS Looks to Exit Radio Business|CBS is examining various options as traditional radio tries to compete with online services like\n                                                    Pandora and Spotify.NYT \u00bb\n\nZoomlion of China Said to Sweeten Offer for Terex|Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology wants to challenge the merger\n                                                    between Terex, the United States crane maker, and Konecranes of Finland, Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the matter.reuters\n\nMitel and Polycom Said to Be in Merger Talks|Mitel Networks of Canada is in talks to merge with Polycom under pressure from the\n                                                    hedge fund Elliott Management, Reuters reports, citing sources.reuters\n\nR.B.S. to Cut 448 Jobs in Corporate and Investment Bank|The bank is shifting about 300 back-office and support positions to India,\n                                                    where it already has similar operations.NYT \u00bb\n\nS.E.C.

        "title": "At RSA Conference, Unlikely Allies Address Value of Digital Security",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 To Amit Yoran, a digital security veteran, the fight between Apple and the F.B.I. over access to an iPhone can be viewed in black-and-white terms: What law enforcement authorities want is \u201cso misguided, they simply boggle the mind.\u201d\nSpeaking to an audience of computer security professionals at the RSA Conference, Mr. Yoran, who heads the RSA Security division of the data-storage provider EMC, explained his exasperation with officials who he says want to weaken the data protection in computer products despite the growing threat of hackers and other attacks.\n\u201cSuch a policy would harm U.S. economic interests on an already suspicious world stage, as well as unconscionably undermine those trying to defend our digital environments in every industry,\u201d said Mr. Yoran, who was the cybersecurity czar at the Department of Homeland Security for a little more than a year, ending in 2004.\nMr. Yoran\u2019s strong take on Apple\u2019s confrontation with the F.B.I. might be expected of someone in the tight-knit security world. Indeed, it was a typical refrain of conference attendees who see the dispute as an extension of the decades-long struggle between the tech industry and government over encryption.\nBut what surprised many of the about 40,000 people attending the RSA Conference, the world\u2019s largest gathering of security experts, this week was the nuanced, industry-friendly tone of former government officials who spoke at the event.\nMichael Chertoff, the former director of Homeland Security under George W. Bush and an author of the Patriot Act, said it would be a mistake to sacrifice tough security to \u201cgive authorities admittedly important access to certain types of phones or data.\u201d\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nAnd strong security will become even more important in the coming years as Internet-connected technology spreads from smartphones and computers to home heating systems, streetlights, the electrical grid and much more, said Mr. Chertoff, who is now executive chairman of a risk-management and consulting organization.\n\u201cAttacks on control systems can have loss of life, and encryption is going to be a key element in a strategy to secure all of this going forward,\u201d he told an audience.\nThe F.B.I. wants Apple\u2019s help bypassing the password mechanism of an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple is resisting a court order requiring its assistance, and a crowd of tech companies have filed court briefs in support of Apple\u2019s stance.\nTo many in tech, the iPhone fight is a reminder of the 1990s, when the government unsuccessfully argued for a so-called back door to encryption called the Clipper chip. The encryption debate was reignited by the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic that was revealed in documents leaked in 2013 by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.\nMr. Snowden\u2019s revelations added urgency to the adoption of tougher security and encryption at Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, including Apple, which added an encryption system in 2014 that made it impossible for the company to extract data off a customer\u2019s phone without the owner\u2019s password, even when compelled to by court order.\nSecurity experts nowworrythat if Apple is required to create software to bypass its password system, it will be a precursor to many more government requests. They also worry that once Apple writes that code, it will show the world\u2019s spies, terrorists and hackers how to bypass its password security.\n\u201cNumerous governments are going to come a-calling for their bite of the apple,\u201d said Nuala O\u2019Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech policy group. \u201cOnce it\u2019s created, you can\u2019t unwrite that code.\u201d\nThe tech industry has other unlikely allies in this debate.\nJ. Michael McConnell, a director of the National Security Agency in the 1990s, was once an advocate of the Clipper chip. But he said at the RSA Conference that he changed his mind after joining the private sector and Booz Allen Hamilton, a military consultancy, where he said he had yet to examine any computer of consequence that had not been hacked by Chinese spies.\n\u201cWhen you understand that level of extraction of intellectual property,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cit\u2019s logical that ubiquitous encryption is something the nation needs to have.\u201d\nThere is, of course, a business rationale for these concerns. The United States hardly has a monopoly on encryption technology. Consumers can pick from around 800 encryption tools from 55 countries. Some in the security business worry they will lose badly to competitors in other countries if it becomes clear the United States government has a way around their systems.\n\u201cThe moral, economic, strategic and technical leadership of the United States is at stake here,\u201d Dan Kaminsky, a well-respected security researcher,wrote in Wired in a piece timed with the conference. \u201cWhoever masters making a secure, digital world not just possible, but practical, will own the next Silicon Valley.\u201d\nOthers at the conference, including James A. Lewis, a leading digital strategist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research group in Washington, said the iPhone debate was the start of a much larger discussion about the use of end-to-end encryption. That is, technology that protects data behind cyphers at every point.\nHe said this technology would make it difficult for corporations to see what employees were doing and for financial regulators to see what Wall Street was doing. It would, he added, put a veil over nearly everything.\nMr. Lewis argued for a system not unlike Google\u2019s, which has deployed encryption but, unlike Apple\u2019s encryption scheme, has yet to make it unrecoverable to authorities.\n\u201cEnd-to-end encryption does not make you safer, it creates legal problems,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re really fighting about.\u201d\nBut most at the conference disagreed with that premise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop this technology,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s already available in parts of the world.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Readers discuss the security issues raised in the clash between Apple and the government.\nTo the Editor: Re \u201cApple Battle Strikes Nerve\u201d (news analysis, front page, March 14): Privacy? People post personal details of their daily life to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube; our Internet searches are tracked and sold; the government tracks the senders and recipients of email; it can ask libraries for a list of books we\u2019ve checked out; we are watched by an ever-increasing array of surveillance cameras; with a judge\u2019s warrant, the police can track our movements, tap our phones, even come into our homes and rummage through every drawer. Yet when the F.B.I., with a warrant, asks to look into the phone of a dead terrorist, Apple puts up a furious row.\nThe fact that Apple has won over much of the public \u2014 the same public that seems perfectly happy to have its daily activity, interests, opinions and contacts accessible to all the world \u2014 as well as most privacy advocates, who seem to have done little to stem the increasing corporate invasion of privacy, makes Apple\u2019s efforts to block access to Syed Farook\u2019s phone look like the marketing exercise that the Justice Department claims it is. And like most of Apple\u2019s marketing campaigns, it is a highly successful one. We have become a nation of sheep, and Silicon Valley is our shepherd.\nSAMUEL REIFLER\n\nRhinebeck, N.Y.\nTo the Editor: When President Obama says \u201cI\u2019m confident this is something that we can solve,\u201d what he really means is \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue how to solve this.\u201d Neither do I. But here are three things I do know:\n1. Dear intelligence community: You reap what you sow. Maybe we would be more trusting if you hadn\u2019t broken the law by conducting sweeping data collection of American citizens and then lying to our faces about it. Just sayin\u2019.\n2. The F.B.I.\u2019s conduct in every aspect of the San Bernardino case has been rife with incompetence. If you\u2019re dumb enough to lock yourself out of the phone by changing the password, you\u2019re too inept to be trusted with an encryption key. Not to mention that you would eventually find a way to use it to spy on civil rights leaders. Again.\n3. Barack Obama\u2019s claiming to be a fierce defender of civil liberties is a knee slapper of epic proportions. But I doubt that all the journalists and whistle-blowers threatened with jail find it as funny as I do.\nEDWARD CRAFT\n\nWeston, Conn.\nTo the Editor: The F.B.I. director, James Comey, has tried to frame this confrontation with Apple as a moral argument, but the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. have overdrawn that account, leaving the public to see that those agencies have no moral authority. Directors of those agencies have repeatedly lied to Congress and the American people about the extent of their interception of telephone calls and email. They have used Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act courts to get their requests rubber-stamped and then sequestered as secret.\nAs reported all too frequently, government agencies have, through lax and inefficient \u201csecurity measures,\u201d allowed the private information of millions of government employees to be compromised. Are we really to believe that were Apple orWhatsAppto provide a \u201cback door\u201d to communications, the government would be able to keep the key to that door secure?\nThe federal agencies requesting access to private information have proven themselves reckless with the information they can access and gluttons for every bit they can find, whether useful or not. Thank goodness for Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures and Timothy Cook\u2019s steadfast refusal to abet further intrusions into the privacy of American citizens.\nRON D\u2019ARCY-CLARKE\n\nShaker Heights, Ohio\nTo the Editor: The debate over iPhone security really contains at least three separate questions.\nThe first is the question that President Obama addressed last weekend: Can any information be outside the reach of duly warranted law enforcement? The answer to this must be no. Otherwise, every child pornographer and terrorist will have a safe haven in his iPhone, and Apple will become the host and protector of all the world\u2019s criminal communications.\nNext is the question of what degree of privacy law-abiding citizens can expect. The Fourth Amendment guarantees our privacy, but in a post-9/11, post-Snowden world, private citizens have reason to doubt that guarantee. We need to develop new law for our new circumstances, to give the government the power to maintain our security, while also ensuring our privacy.\nThe most novel question is whether Apple should be enlisted to give the government access to iPhone data. This should be done only if the government is unable to reach it by its own devices. With today\u2019s extremely sophisticated coding, it may be that private companies will always remain a step ahead of government. The answer to this question may involve a partnership between government and private industry that the authors of the Fourth Amendment never foresaw.\nRON L. MEYERS\n\nNew York\nTo the Editor: The government is trying to make this all about the phone, but let\u2019s approach it from another angle. What about the guns the San Bernardino shooters used? Where would we be if those guns had all been registered, their movements tracked from factory to point of sale? What if we had better checks on buyer backgrounds? The government wants to get into my phone \u2014 but how about focusing on the guns?\nLARRY ROTH\n\nRavena, N.Y.\nTo the Editor: Many people\u2019s reaction to the iPhone-encryption debate is to comfort themselves by thinking \u201cthe authorities aren\u2019t interested in me.\u201d This is largely true. But even if one has nothing to hide, pervasive surveillance is dangerous because we all need whistle-blowers. It\u2019s not about ordinary people with ordinary stuff on their phone; it\u2019s the chilling effect when an informant won\u2019t call a newspaper because he or she fears that the government is listening.\nWe have repeatedly seen that surveillance always overreaches, from the F.B.I. spying on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the revelations of Edward Snowden. Whenever the veil is pulled back, we see the government using any loophole to gather as much information as it technically can. President Obama\u2019s defense of surveillance boils down to \u201cyou can trust us not to abuse this power.\u201d History shows otherwise. And even if we can trust Mr. Obama\u2019s respect for the Constitution, his successors may not be so scrupulous.\nUntil we have a transparent and clearly limited process for the government to break encryption, Americans should not accept the assurances of Mr. Obama or any president. Mr. Obama would do the country a service by proposing a protocol for surveillance that could be trusted. Pardoning Edward Snowden and welcoming him home as a patriot and privacy adviser would be a very good start.\nWILLIAM S. KESSLER\n\nSeattle\nTo the Editor:\nThe government wants Apple to design a utility to hack Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone, while Apple is refusing to do so. I agree with Apple that building a tool to bypass iPhone security can jeopardize the privacy of all iPhone users.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said in aletterto Apple customers, \u201cIt would be the equivalent of a master key capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.\u201d If hackers got hold of this master key, imagine what they could do with the data of millions of people who use iPhones.\nBesides the issues of data security and privacy, there is an issue of how much control we want the government to have. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the government\u2019s law enforcement agencies are \u201casking the public to grant them significant new powers that could put all our communications infrastructure at risk.\u201d\nSome argue that unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone would not set a wider precedent, but this back door could be used by hackers if not by the government.\nALYSSA HANSRAJ\n\nChicago\nThe writer, a sixth grader at Hawthorne Scholastic Academy, a literacy magnet school, wrote this letter as part of a class study of the Apple case."

        "title": "Sizing Up Apple\u2019s New Downsized Devices",
        "fulltext": "The iPhone SE and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro were the two headline-grabbing devices that Apple unveiledlast week. The gadgets stand out because they go against a recent trend of larger screen sizes; both deviceshave smaller screensthan their immediate predecessors.\nIf you are tempted to buy one of the new Apple products, which are available in stores starting Thursday, one of the first things you may want to do is download some apps. Here are some excellent options.\n\u2022Adult coloring booksare popular, and my favorite iPad Pro app \u2014 Pigment \u2014 combines this childlike fun with digital convenience. Pigment lets people choose a coloring page from its archive, select a color and start scribbling on the screen with a finger or an Apple Pencil.\nThe simple interface and realistic pencil-like graphic effects feel a lot like coloring on paper, with the advantage of being able to correct mistakes and use gestures to change the angle of the image or zoom in to see more detail. If you tap on an area, Pigment will only let you apply color there, which keeps your image tidy. You can also choose different pen and brush effects or fill areas with a gradient of color.\nPigment is also available for iPhones andis free, with a limited amount of blank templates. A monthly subscription for new templates is $2.\n\u2022 For productivity, Microsoft\u2019s familiar suite of business apps \u2014Word,ExcelandPowerPoint\u2014 work well on an iPad Pro (and iPhones too). They can be used just as they are on PCs to build documents, spreadsheets or presentations.\nIn some ways, though, the iPad editions are better. That\u2019s because there is seamless backup to the cloud, so there is no need to worry about saving a file in the wrong folder, then having to search for it later. They also work well with a touch screen.\nPowerPoint, in particular, is very well adapted to the fingertip, with drawing effects that would not work as well with a mouse or touch pad. Best of all, it\u2019s compatible with other versions of the software, so you can start a piece of work on an iPad and finish it on your office machine.\nMicrosoft\u2019s software isn\u2019t perfect, and while the business apps are free to download and use on iPhones, you can only read documents on an iPad Pro. To edit or make new documents, an Office 365 subscription is needed, starting at $7 a month.\n\u2022 Actually, I prefer Apple\u2019s productivity suite ofNumbers,KeynoteandPages. The apps are similar to Microsoft\u2019s offerings, though Numbers may not have as many features as Excel.\nStill, Apple\u2019s interfaces are more intuitive than Microsoft\u2019s, and the apps are more relaxing to use. They can also save files in Microsoft-compatible formats if your office uses PCs. Best of all, they cost a one-time payment of $10 each.\n\u2022 To show off the gaming power of your new devices, one excellent option is Super Arc Light. This is an arcade-style game with minimalist graphics and one single control. Players control a gun turret orbiting a zone that must be protected. Tapping the screen shoots a weapon; once it\u2019s fired, the direction of the rotating gun turret changes.\nThe gameplay is weirdly tricky and compelling. Super Arc Lightcosts $1.\n\u2022 I\u2019ve also been playing a lot of _Prism, on both iPad and iPhone. This is an abstract puzzle game in which colored spots are moved into place on the outside of 3-D prisms hovering in space. There are almost no instructions and yet the game is hugely absorbing.It\u2019s $3.\n\u2022 To explore the graphics power of your iPhone or iPad, check out Assassin\u2019s Creed Identity. This is a first-person role-playing game set during the Italian Renaissance, pitching you into combat with enemies in an incredibly detailed cityscape. You can customize your character and go on quests.\nThe graphics look as good as on a console game and the fighting and exploring actions are fun. This is a complex kind of game, not a casual one to play in a spare five minutes. The complexity means that the gamecosts $5and requires an always-on Internet connection, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\u2022 Finally, here are a few staple apps to try:Manual(a camera app that lets you take control via manual settings, $3);Pocket(for saving long Internet articles to read later, free);Strava(for tracking fitness habits, free);Shazam(to identify music automatically, free); and the amazingGarageBandfor creating different types of music ($5).\nFeedmesh is a news aggregator fresh on the Android app store. The aim is to make it simple to discover new and interesting news in a glance, which is why it keeps things in reverse chronological order and makes the source of each story clear.It\u2019s free."

        "title": "Apple Gets Tech Industry Backing in iPhone Dispute, Despite Misgivings",
        "fulltext": "It is a remarkable moment for the technology industry, with many different companies and organizations rallying around a single company \u2014 Apple \u2014 in amajor legal caseagainst the United States government over privacy and security.\nYet behind the scenes, it took time for some of the tech companies to make the decision to support Apple. Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.\nThose misgivings ultimately did not win the day. About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge\u2019s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.\nDropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. More than 40 individuals, including prominent security experts and academics, are also planning to sign briefs, which will focus on themes like free speech, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.\nThe show of support \u2014 including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now \u2014 is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.\n\u201cGiven the years of companies\u2019 reluctance to be at the barricades around intelligence discussions, this is significant,\u201d said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of theFuture of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank in Washington.\nStill, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry. In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.\nAll of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.\nKeith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption \u2014 \u201call the normal Silicon Valley views,\u201d he said \u2014 but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.\n\u201cIn my view, this is the wrong case to fight,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cThere are plenty of other cases with a lot less sympathetic case for the government.\u201d\nFor Mr. Rabois and others, the circumstances working against Apple include the iPhone\u2019s connection to a terrorist attack that left 14 people dead, rather than to a less highly charged crime. Furthermore, the iPhone was owned by the employer of the gunman,Syed Rizwan Farook, which consented to a search of the device.\nApple\u2019s defenders said the company did not pick this fight \u2014 the government did. Critics of Apple\u2019s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government\u2019s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case. But Apple has said that once a tool exists for extracting data from the phone, that tool cannot be made to disappear.\nYet whatever doubts Apple\u2019s allies voiced privately, they were in the end insufficient to keep a large number of big companies from signing on to the cause.\nDropbox\u2019s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, \u201cWe stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company\u2019s products.\u201d\nBruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement, \u201cWe are humbled by the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from our customers, our colleagues in business, nonprofit organizations, the security community and many others.\u201d He added, \u201cThe groups filing briefs with the court understand, as more and more people have come to realize, that this case is not about one phone \u2014 it is about the future and how we protect our safety and our privacy.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.\nFor many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple\u2019s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nA reportby Pew Research Center last week said 51 percent of Americans believed that Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case, while only 38 percent found Apple in the right.\nSome of the companies were also concerned that the relationships they had forged with the government might degrade because of Apple\u2019s battle, according to the people involved in the tech industry discussions. In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.\nOthers were also anxious that Apple\u2019s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.\nAnd these companies are watching what effect the fight could have on a proposal to establish a national commission that would explore ways to obtain encrypted data from consumers while working to safeguard users\u2019 privacy. The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.\nOn Monday, Apple got good news that could help soothe lingering tech industry doubts about its defense in the San Bernardino case. A federal magistrate judge in a separate drug case in New Yorkruled against a government requestto extract data from an iPhone, a decision that could influence the San Bernardino case.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s arc in supporting Apple \u2014 an initial flurry of concerns followed by an eventual coming around to the idea \u2014 is epitomized by Max Levchin, the co-founder of PayPal and chief executive of Affirm, an online financial services firm. Last weekin an interview on CBS, Mr. Levchin said his views on the case over the previous several days had shifted from a \u201cclear-cut, black-and-white\u201d stance of helping the F.B.I. He has since sided with Apple."

The current charges, listed in what is known as a statement of objections, are just one in a number of competition-related headaches that the search engine may face this year in Europe.\nMs. Vestageris also investigatingwhether Apple received an unfair tax deal from Ireland, and Amazon from Luxembourg, that broke Europe\u2019s state aid rules.\nHer aggressive positions have made the 47-year-old Danish politician \u2014 said to be among the inspirations behind \u201cBorgen,\u201d a critically acclaimed TV show described as Denmark\u2019s answer to \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 a poster child for Europe\u2019s somewhat combative relationship with United States tech giants.\nMs. Vestager sat down with The New York Times last week to discuss her priorities for the year, the issues underpinning her competition investigations and whether she unfairly targets American companies. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\u25a0What are your plans for 2016?\nWhat\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we\u2019ll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues.\n\u25a0The first anniversary of the statement of objections in the Google case is fast approaching. Have your thoughts changed on the issues at play?\nSince we aren\u2019t done yet, we can\u2019t yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren\u2019t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position.\nIt\u2019s a huge task. We\u2019re doing our best with the analysis, but it\u2019s also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it.\n\u25a0Are you disappointed you haven\u2019t moved the case forward?\nI have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that.\nBut speed isn\u2019t a quality unto itself. You can\u2019t substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue.\n\u25a0The current charges against Google are just one of many antitrust issues you\u2019re looking into at the company, including its role in advertising, as well as Android, its mobile operating system. Do you see a common thread?\nThat depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\nThen we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas.\n\u25a0Germany\u2019s competition authority hasopened an investigationinto Facebook and its use of people\u2019s data. Do you think access to digital data will become a competition issue?\nIt\u2019s not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data?\nSo far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That\u2019s why I have approached this area with a very open mind.\n\u25a0So there isn\u2019t a competition problem because many companies have access to people\u2019s data?\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a problem.\nBut I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it\u2019s that \u201cother\u201d that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data.\n\u25a0You\u2019re Europe\u2019s competition, not tax, authority. So why are you getting involved in tax cases linked to potential abuse of state aid?\nNational tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it\u2019s a simple question of fair competition.\nCompanies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem.\n\u25a0For many American companies, particularly in the tech sector, there\u2019s a sense that Europe is targeting them. What\u2019s your response to that?\nThere\u2019s a lot of convenience in that argument. I\u2019ve been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there\u2019s no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies.\nThese are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate."

        "title": "Forget the New iPhone. For Apple, It\u2019s All About the Dollar.",
        "fulltext": "Don\u2019t obsess about the svelte new iPhone or the price cut for the Apple Watch.\nDon\u2019t worry too much about Apple\u2019s courtroom battles over privacy and national security, at least not now. Those issues moved to the back burner on Monday when the Justice Department said that it might not need Apple\u2019s help to break into an iPhone connected to a mass shooting.\nInstead, if you\u2019re interested in Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, and not just in Apple as a maker of cool gadgets, the biggest news affecting it lately has arguably come from another quarter: the foreign currency markets.\nFor a reading on where Apple\u2019s share price may be heading, look to the dollar.\nThe underlying reason is this: The dollar\u2019s rise and fall have a direct effect on Apple\u2019s earnings, which ultimately drive share prices. When the dollar strengthens, sales of iPhones abroad are worth less in American currency, hurting profits and, sooner or later, knocking down share prices. When the dollar weakens, on the other hand, those overseas profits become more valuable.\nDespite a partial recovery over the last few days, the greenback has been weakening and Apple\u2019s shares have been rising. Apple has been getting a dollar bonus.\nAnd what\u2019s true for Apple is true for many of the multinationals in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which declined last year and fell sharply for much of the start of this one. Corporate profits fell 5.1 percent in 2015, the largest drop since 2008, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Profit margins continue to be pressured, but the turn in the value of the dollar gave earnings a nudge upward, helping American multinationals prosper. It is no accident that the S.&P. 500 began to recover in late January, as the dollar began to weaken.\nApple is a case in point. When it reported earnings on Jan. 26, the dollar had been rising for months, and Timothy D. Cook, its chief executive, discussed the repercussions during an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Two-thirds of \u201cApple\u2019s revenue is now generated outside the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cso foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results.\u201d\nHe illustrated that impact this way: Between the last three months of 2014 and the same stretch in 2015, every dollar\u2019s worth of sales that Apple earned outside the United States lost 15 cents when translated into dollars. In its latest quarter alone, he added, Apple lost six percentage points of sales growth to the rising dollar.\nThe iPhone is the company\u2019s profit engine, but the strong dollar chipped away at its power. The average sales price for the iPhone globally at the end of 2015 was $691, according to Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. But he said the strong dollar reduced the effective sales price by $49, or roughly 7 percent.\nApple\u2019s share price, which buoyed the overall stock market in past years, fell 4.6 percent in 2015 and dropped more than 11 percent through Jan. 27. Since, then, though, Apple shares have risen more than 13 percent.\nThe dollar\u2019s direction has been changing recently as well. On a trade-weighted basis, after gaining more than 9 percent in 2015, it has weakened by nearly 2.5 percent this year. That has helped American companies with significant international earnings, especially technology companies. Within the S.&P. 500 index, half of that sector\u2019s earnings come from outside the United States.\nCompare that with the utility companies in the index: They obtain only 4.4 percent of their earnings abroad. Over the last 12 months, utilities, which pay hefty dividends and have been insulated from the dollar\u2019s fluctuations, have returned 15.5 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for information technology shares. Since late January, tech shares have nearly kept pace with utilities. The decline in the dollar has helped account for that.\nWhere the dollar heads now is a matter for pure speculation. Clearly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s shifting monetary policy is important. As John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, put it, the Fed \u201cappears to have turned more dovish, which has undermined the dollar.\u201d In an election year in which the trade deficit is a major issue, you wouldn\u2019t be sticking your neck out very far in assuming that the Fed might retain a dovish bias and that the dollar might remain fairly weak.\nThat said, the Fed couldn\u2019t entirely control the dollar\u2019s value, even if it wanted to do so. Foreign exchange rates are determined by traders who compare currencies, many of which have been weakened by their own sputtering local economies and by central banks that have adopted near-zero or negative short-term interest rates. In comparison, the United States may be a bastion of stability, and the dollar could rise.\nIt is quite possible, in short, that the dollar\u2019s ebb has given companies like Apple only a temporary reprieve. And the dollar is only one ingredient in Apple\u2019s corporate mix. Other transient factors \u2014 the iPhone\u2019s shape and power, the Apple Watch\u2019s price and appearance, and the security of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 may play a more dominant role in determining Apple\u2019s fortunes.\nObsess about that if you must, but don\u2019t underestimate the dollar."

        "fulltext": "Q.What do I do when I try to play a track in iTunes and I get a message that says, \u201cthe song could not be used because the original file could not be found,\u201d and it asks me if I\u2019d like to locate it?\nA.When files get moved from their original locations outside iTunes, the program does not know how to find them again andissues an alertwhen you try to play the relocated track. You may also see the message if the music was originally stored on an external or network drive that is not currently connected to the computer, or if the original music files were deleted.\nTo see just where iTunes is looking for a missing file, select the track and press the Control and I keys (on a Windows PC) or the Command and I keys (on a Mac). When the Get Info box for the song opens, click the File tab in the box. The file\u2019s last known location on the computer should be listed at the bottom.\nYou can use this information to point iTunes back to the file when it asks if you want to locate it. If the files were accidentally moved to the Recycle Bin or Trash and you have not emptied it, find the items within, right-click (or Control-click) on the file or folder you want to rescue, and choose the Restore option (Windows) or Put Back (Mac). If the file\u2019s location path points to an unconnected external or network drive, connect it to the computer so iTunes can see the tracks again.\nIf all the songs in your iTunes library show the exclamation error, the program has probably lost the location of your iTunes Music/Media folder; this can happen if you copy the iTunes folder to an external drive to free up space on your main computer. Topoint the programto the iTunes Music/Media folder\u2019s new location, press the Control and comma keys (Windows) or Command and comma keys (Mac) to open the iTunes Preferences box. Click the Advanced tab, and in the \u201ciTunes Media folder location\u201d section, click the Change button and navigate to the folder\u2019s new location on the external drive.\nIf you update the iTunes program and do not see any of your content the first time you open the new version, there is a problem with the program\u2019s iTunes Library file.Apple has posted a series of stepsto take to correct that problem on its support site. The company also offers tips fororganizing and consolidatingyour iTunes music and media files in one place to make moving your library easier."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.\nBefore the Silicon Valley giant unveiled modest upgrades to its device lineup, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, defended the company\u2019s stance in its fight with the federal government over the encryption on iPhones.\nThe case had beenexpected to head to a court hearing on Tuesday, but the Justice Department abruptly moved on Monday to cancel the hearing, saying it might not need Apple\u2019s help to break into the phone used by a gunman in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting.\nIn a news conference at Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. \u201cWe need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThis is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201d\nHe said that Apple believed it had an obligation to help protect its users\u2019 data. That belief eventually prompted Apple to fight the Justice Department\u2019s demand to help the government crack the encryption on the iPhone used by a terrorist in last year\u2019s California attack.\ntranscript\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) APPLE CEO TIM COOK, SAYING:\n\n\u201cWe built the iPhone for you - our customers and we know that it is a deeply personal device. For many of us, the iPhone is an extension of ourselves. About a month ago we asked Americans across the country to join in a conversation - we need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy. I\u2019ve been humbled and deeply grateful for the outpouring of support that we\u2019ve received from Americans across the country, from all walks of life. We did not expect to be in this position at odds with our own government but we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country. This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility.\u201d\nCompared to that high-stakes contest \u2014 which has broad implications for the technology industry, consumers and law enforcement \u2014 Apple\u2019s new products were small ball.\nThe company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.\nThe new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is still some subset of the iPhone population that prefers a smaller phone,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, an independent consulting firm.\nGreg Joswiak, an Apple executive, said on stage that the company sold more than 30 million four-inch iPhones last year, and many iPhone users have been begging the company to update its phones of that size.\nSo Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399.\nApple, which has a higher market value than any other company, is now so big that it is difficult for the company to come up with new products to drive a new wave of purchases. Its premium pricing \u2014 its larger phones typically run $650 or more \u2014 has also left it vulnerable to cheaper handsets that run on Google\u2019s Android software.\nIn Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 26, its revenue grew just 2 percent, and the company has offered a cautious forecast for the year.\nThe lack of must-have new features in Apple\u2019s recent products has hurt sales growth, as many customers decided their older models were good enough and postponed upgrades, Mr. Dawson said.\n\u201cIn a way, you see both devices that Apple is launching on Monday as drivers of an upgrade cycle,\u201d he said.\nApple certainly hopes that fans of its four-inch phones will upgrade to the new iPhone SE, which packs a faster computer chip, a better camera, and Apple\u2019s Touch ID and payment technology into the same four-inch case as the aging iPhone 5S.\nThe new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year\u2019s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399.\nThe iPad Pros are particularly aimed at the hundreds of millions of users of old personal computers that run Microsoft Windows who might be looking to replace them, said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing.\nApple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $50, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.\nAnalysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.\nApple also touted the iPhone\u2019s potential usefulness in medical research and personal medical monitoring. It introduced new software on Monday to help developers create apps for both purposes, showcasing as an example a large project to study people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nEven then, Apple stressed its commitment to protecting customer data, saying that any sharing of health information would require a customer\u2019s explicit permission.\n\u201cNothing is more sensitive than your health data,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer."
