        "title": "Apple Unveils iPhone X and 8 Models as It Upgrades TV Set-Top Box",
        "fulltext": "Apple unveiled iPhone X, its first premium-tier phone, at an event in Cupertino, Calif., on Tuesday. Here\u2019s what else the company had to say.\n\u2022 iPhone X is priced at $999, the most expensive ever for a new iPhone model. It will ship on Nov. 3. (Pro tip: The X is pronounced 10, and not \u201cex.\u201d)\n\u2022 The phone has a newer screen technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.\n\u2022 The screen on the X has a so-called edge-to-edge display that takes up the entire face by eliminating the borders around the screen. Apple also eliminated the physical home button that has been a signature feature of the iPhone for a decade.\n\u2022 iPhone 8 is also here, as well as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus. The models include a glass body and a faster chip.\n\u2022 Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box that has never been a blockbuster hit, got an upgrade. The device will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs.\n\u2022 Apple took the wraps off a new Apple Watch. Called Apple Watch Series 3, it has cellular capabilities. There\u2019s also a new Watch OS.\nWith the $999 iPhone X, Apple moved to a new premium level of pricing. The smartphone will cost $300 more than the iPhone 8 and $200 more than the iPhone 8 Plus.\nWhile that will be too expensive for many people, the company said it saw the iPhone X defining a new era for the smartphone, much like the original iPhone did 10 years ago. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the device would \u201cset the path for the next decade.\u201d That\u2019s because Apple will likely build on some of the iPhone X\u2019s most notable features, including infrared facial recognition, wireless battery charging and sophisticated camera effects.\nConsumer reaction to the new phone will have a big impact on the company\u2019s revenue and stock price. Right now, analysts are betting on a slow uptake of the top-end phone, both because of production delays and the high price. But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.\nWall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.\n\u2014Vindu Goel\nThe iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.\nMuch of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.\nWhat we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?\nIt\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.\nWhether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.\n\u2014 Farhad Manjoo\nThe brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.\nThe technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\nFor Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.\nFace ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival. Experts have criticized Samsung\u2019s face-recognition feature, which could be tricked by holding a photo of the smartphone owner\u2019s face in front of the camera.\n\u2014Brian X. Chen\nBrian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.\nThe new iPhone 8 line includes the iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the 8 Plus.\nThe phones include a six-core processor that will handle more complex tasks and 3D games more quickly and efficiently than previous iPhones. The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.\nApple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.\nIn particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.\nAnother notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.\nThe new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.\n\u2014Brian X. Chen and Vindu Goel\nApple unveiled an upgrade for Apple TV, its set-top box. While Mr. Jobs referred to Apple TV as a \u201chobby\u201d because it was not a hot seller compared to the company\u2019s smartphones, computers and tablets, the product is becoming increasingly important to Apple as it, along with other tech giants like Facebook and Google, moves into creatingoriginal video content.\nThe new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.\nApple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.\n\u2014Brian X. Chen\nThe Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.\nToday, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.\n\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.\nThe cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.\nThis is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.\nThe new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.\n\u2014Farhad Manjoo\nApple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy. It\u2019s Apple Park, the company\u2019s new $5 billion spaceship-shaped campus, which the company is showing off to the media for the first time.\nThe press were penned off just out of range of the main building, at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat venue with a commanding view of the spaceship. A quick review: This place is just what you\u2019d imagine an Apple-designed campus would look like. Think of the aesthetics of an Apple Store \u2014 lots of wood and glass, everything in muted tans and greys, all signage in white-on-black Apple Sans type \u2014 set on an otherwise barren landscape.\nIt is, unsurprisingly, very pretty, but its beauty comes with a deliberate touch of fright. Nothing here is to human scale, and the overall impression is one of being overwhelmed by Apple\u2019s sheer might.\n\u2014 Farhad Manjoo"

        "title": "Toshiba Reaches Deal With Bain-Apple Group to Sell Chip Business",
        "fulltext": "TOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, the huge but struggling Japanese conglomerate, traded some of its size for financial security on Thursday by selling off most of its profitable microchip business.\nIt was not the way the company, which has long been accused of being bloated and directionless, had hoped to slim down.\nToshiba said it had signed a deal to sell 60 percent of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to a group of international investors that includes Bain Capital and Apple. The deal, which followed months of tumultuous negotiations, will net Toshiba about $14 billion.\nToshiba has staked its future on the sale, with the proceeds earmarked to help repair the financial damage from adisastrous forayinto nuclear power in the United States. The episode threatened to bankrupt the company, one of Japan\u2019s biggest and proudest.\nToshiba traces its roots to the 1870s, when its founders helped further Japan\u2019s industrial emergence, building the country\u2019s telegraph system and installing its first domestically made electric lights. If the company had collapsed, Japan would have lost a pillar of its economy and its tens of thousands of workers. It also would have lost the main contractor cleaning up the ruined Fukushima nuclear plant, which Toshiba helped build decades ago.\nWhile Toshiba\u2019s history in many ways embodied Japan\u2019s blazing economic rise, some people say the stumbles that led the company to sell chip unit reflected the country\u2019s more recent problems.\nIn an era when the global technology industry is dominated by nimble specialists selling cutting-edge design and software, Toshiba has been defined by a stultifying management hierarchy, a dogged focus on hardware and a scattered portfolio of businesses.\n\u201cToshiba is one of Japan\u2019s last zombies,\u201d said Jesper Koll, the chief executive of WisdomTree Japan, an investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s the last of the big conglomerates that does not have a defined strategy.\u201d\nSimilar problems have hampered other Japanese groups, but Mr. Koll said that Toshiba had been particularly slow to address them. Others, like Hitachi, another refrigerators-to-power-plants conglomerate, he said, \u201cmade hard decisions\u201d to restructure and become more accountable to shareholders, while Toshiba delayed.\nThe inaction helped Toshiba executives save face, at least for a while.\nBut then came anaccounting scandalin 2015, in which Toshiba admitted overstating its earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years. Top company leaders resigned, and investigators hired by the company blamed \u201ca corporate culture where it is impossible to go against one\u2019s bosses\u2019 wishes.\u201d\nToshiba had been covering up cost overruns at its American nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric, which it bought amid an ill-timed expansion in 2006. Those losses later ballooned further: Westinghouse sought bankruptcy protection in March, aftercosting Toshiba $6 billionin write-offs. Toshiba said it would stop building new nuclear power plants and focus instead on maintaining older ones.\nNow, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.\nThe company had been negotiating the sale for months, with ashifting rosterof potential investors. The final list of buyers, disclosed in astatementon Thursday, had some surprising omissions.\nTwo financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest at a later date.\nThe investors were instead drawn entirely from the private sector.\nIn addition to Apple, they include three other American businesses: Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.\nToshiba itself will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices.\nIn negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.\nToshiba pioneered its core technology, NAND flash memory, and although it has fallen to second in global production, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the business has generated the largest share of Toshiba\u2019s profits in recent years. Among the company\u2019s concerns was that its technology could fall into the hands of investors, like SK Hynix and Kingston, that are also its competitors.\nAlthough Japan dominated the global microchip market in the 1980s and 1990s, it has lost ground more recently. Tsugio Makimoto, a retired semiconductor engineer at Hitachi, said that in the past, big conglomerates were good at nurturing microchip businesses, because they had the money to finance research and build factories.\nNow, as the pace of technological change has quickened, \u201cmanagement speed and specialization are more important,\u201d he said.\nWhile Toshiba will retain only a minority of the chip unit\u2019s shares, it will still exercise significant control.\nThe American investors, whose precise financial contributions were not disclosed, will receive preferred shares that do not carry voting rights, Toshiba said. SK Hynix would be limited to an ownership stake of no more than 15 percent for 10 years.\nHoya is buying 10 percent. In a line that reflected nationalistic concerns about the sale, Toshiba made a point of noting that, \u201cWith Toshiba and Hoya\u2019s investments, Japan-based companies will hold more than 50 percent of the common stock.\u201d It added that Japanese owners would \u201ccontinue to hold a majority\u201d in the future.\nIn proceeding with the deal, Toshiba brushed aside objections by one of its business partners, Western Digital, the American storage company. Western Digital could still move to block the sale\u2019s completion.\nA Western Digital subsidiary, SanDisk, shares ownership with Toshiba of a flash memory production operation in Japan. Because of that, the American company contends that its approval is necessary for Toshiba to sell the chip unit. Western Digital said this week that it would seek an injunction against the deal.\nIf the legal battle is settled in Toshiba\u2019s favor, or if the two sides reach a settlement, it could make it easier for risk-averse government institutions like the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan to join the buyout conglomerate. That would take pressure off other investors and Toshiba\u2019s banks, which Toshiba said had agreed to provide 600 billion yen in fresh loans.\nRegardless of the legal outcome, Toshiba\u2019s relationship with Western Digital and SanDisk has been badly damaged, presenting a challenge for the chip unit\u2019s new owners.\n\u201cToshiba\u2019s flash memory success has a lot to do with its relationship with SanDisk,\u201d said Mr. Makimoto. \u201cThere are still a lot of issues to address before Toshiba can breathe easy.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.I\u2019m getting warnings about my iCloud drive\u2019s being full, and Apple wants to sell me more space. Are there other options that are easier and cheaper? I don\u2019t need to back up my whole computer, just random stuff.\nA.Apple gives every iCloud account holderfive free gigabytes of spaceon its servers to store online copies of documents, photos and videos, as well asdevice backups. The files can all be reached from iOS devices, Macs andPCs running the iCloud software. Messages from iCloud mail accounts (and Apple\u2019s older mail services using @me.com and @mac.com) are also stored within that space.\nIf you get warning messages, Apple suggests eitherbuying more iCloud storage\u2014 or deleting old messages, files and iOS device backups to free up space within your original five gigabytes. Buying more storage directly from Apple is relatively easy because you do not have to download or install any new software \u2014 and the company may already have your credit card on file if you buy media content and apps from its iTunes, iBooks or App Stores.Prices start at 99 centsa month to tack on 50 gigabytes of storage space; 200 gigabytes costs $2.99 a month, and two terabytes of server space is $9.99 a month.\nWhile Apple\u2019s offer may be convenient, other companies have their own deals that get you more bytes for your buck, especially if you are just looking for file storage and don\u2019t have a lot of space invested in Apple\u2019s mail or iCloud Photos service. For example,Amazon Drive cloud storagealso gives five free gigabytes when you sign up, but Amazon Prime members get unlimited photo storage on top of that; 100 gigabytes of extra space is $11.99 a year, and one terabyte is $59.99 annually.\nTheBox storage servicegives its individual users a free 10 gigabytes of space, and its Personal Pro plan raises that to 100 gigabytes for $10 a month.Dropboxprovides two gigabytes of storage for its free Basic plan, upgradeable to one terabyte with Dropbox Plus for $8.25 a month. TheiDrive servicestarts with five gigabytes of free storage, and upgrades start at $69.50 a year for two terabytes of space.\nYou can also cobble together a network of free or inexpensive storage locations to stash your files by using the services provided by Microsoft and Google.Microsoft OneDriveincludes five free gigabytes, and an upgrade to 50 gigabytes is $1.99 a month; Microsoft Office 365 subscribers get additional space with their plans.\nGoogle Drive file storagecurrently starts with 15 gigabytes of free space, which can be expanded to one terabyte for $9.99 a month, or 10 terabytes for a monthly $99.99.\nIf you plan to use the storage service with a mobile device, make sure the company offers a compatible app for your phone or tablet."

        "title": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple",
        "fulltext": "The iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.\nIn the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.\nThat conclusion emerges from a study of stock market returns byHendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. His broad findings on the market are startling: Most stocks aren\u2019t good investments. They don\u2019t even beat the paltry returns of one-month Treasury bills, he has found.\nBut a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.\nI\u2019ve written about Professor Bessembinder\u2019s broad findingsbefore, and several readers asked to see all the stocks in the professor\u2019s lifetime wealth creation list. So at my request, he updated his calculations through December 2016 and provided fresh rankings in hispaper\u201cDo Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills.\u201d We\u2019ve reproduced the crucial elements here, with an important revision: Today, in the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary year, Apple is No. 1.\nIn a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.\nBut it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\nRun the numbers as I did, and it\u2019s clear that at this moment, Apple has pulled ahead of Exxon Mobil, with total net wealth creation of somewhere in the vicinity of $1 trillion. Counting dividends, Exxon Mobil\u2019s losses in the stock market have reduced its total to a bit over $910 billion. (Note that, as a technical matter, Professor Bessembinder defines net wealth creation as total stock returns inexcessof one-month Treasury bill returns, which averaged an annualized 3.38 percent, so theactualstock returns for Apple, Exxon, and the others are evenhigherthan indicated.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201d\nExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.\nHe relied on a database developed at the University of Chicago, known asCRSP, for the Center for Research in Security Prices, that contains virtually all publicly traded stocks in the United States. The Center for Research uses rigorous and logicalcriteriato determine when stocks enter and depart its listings, with some results that may seem surprising at first glance.\nGeneral Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.\nThe list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.\nExxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.\nOther apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.\nTo start with, the \u201cold\u201d AT&T, a.k.a. \u201cMa Bell,\u201d is ranked 17th. It is said to have gone out of existence in November 2005. Another AT&T appears in the 33rd spot. That company came to life in March 1984 as Southwestern Bell,spun offfrom the old AT&T as a result of an antitrust suit. A descendant of Southwestern Bell bought the AT&T name in 2005 and operates under it today.\nOther AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.\nThe listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.\nAs I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.\nFacebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.\nAnd then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nNo list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.\nWhy is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?\nIt is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.\nAnyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.\nIf only it were that easy.\nHow do you find those companies? Not here.\n\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201d\nThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Q.How hard is it to switch smartphone systems from Android to the new iPhone that is coming out this fall? Do I have to buy all new apps? And if I ever want to change back to Android, how much of a hassle is it?\nA.Switching between Apple\u2019siOSand Google\u2019sAndroidsystem \u2014 thetop two platformsused by mobile devices \u2014 is easier than it used to be because each company has created illustrated guides for jumping ship to the other\u2019s software. As for your apps, though, programs written specifically for iOS will not run in Android \u2014 and vice versa.\nApps for popular services like Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail and others are available for both platforms, and you can download new versions from the respective app stores. However, some apps may only be available for one system, so take an inventory of every program you use on your phone and check for alternatives that work on the other platform. Media files with copyright restrictions built in may not play across platforms, although those from services that have apps for both platforms (like Amazon Music or Google Music Manager) may play fine after you log in.\nTo see what is involved with moving from an Android device to an iPhone, check outApple\u2019s guide for switching. As part of the relocation process, you need a Wi-Fi connection and a copy of Apple\u2019s ownMove to iOS appon your Android device. Although it does not have uniformly great reviews from users in the Google Play store, the Move to iOS app promises to automatically transfer your contacts, calendars, photos and videos, text-message history, mail accounts and web bookmarks over to an iPhone, while also providing a list of corresponding iOS versions of installed Android apps you can download from the App Store.\nThe steps needed to move from an iPhone to an Android device can vary, as many manufacturers offer Android phones and the softwaremay be different from maker to maker. Google\u2019s site has its ownthree-step guidetoleaving iOS for Android, with the first step asbacking up your iPhone\u2019s data to an online Google Drive account. As part of the process, you also import your phone\u2019saddress bookandcalendar eventsto Google\u2019s apps. For those leaving Apple\u2019s iOS platform, it is also important toturn off and \u201cderegister\u201d your phone numberfrom the company\u2019s iMessage service so your text messages will arrive properly on your Android device.\nNew versions of both systems are expected later this year, so look foriOS 11andAndroid 8.0 (Oreo)to arrive to compatible devices this fall."

        "title": "Red Sox Cheating Scandal Highlights Apple Watch\u2019s Illicit Uses",
        "fulltext": "Commercials for the Apple Watch show people swimming, running, climbing, jumping. But the watch can also be used, it turns out, for another activity: cheating.\nThe Boston Red Sox werecaught by baseball\u2019s authorities in a schemeto use the Apple Watch to steal signs from New York Yankees catchers.\nInvestigators confirmed accusations by the Yankees that a Red Sox trainer used his Apple Watch to receive messages from the team\u2019s video room about upcoming pitches, and then passed those messages to the dugout, where they were signaled to teammates on the field.\nSign-stealing is a time-honored baseball tradition \u2014 as long as only eyesight is used. Visual aids and technology \u2014 including walkie-talkies, cameras and Apple Watches \u2014 are not allowed.\nA fan of both the Red Sox and Apple said he was disappointed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing \u2013 it\u2019s an odd sport in that cheating is legal as long as you get away with it, but using technology is over the line,\u201d said Seth Lieberman, a Boston resident and Red Sox fan and chief executive of SnapApp, which creates content for marketers. \u201cBoth the Red Sox and Apple Watch are striking out.\u201d\nA Yankees fan used stronger language: \u201cDebacle,\u201d said Richard Ting, a Brooklyn resident raised not far from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. \u201cIt leaves a bad taste in our mouths in terms of what levels Boston teams are stooping to to win games,\u201d he said.\nBut, curious about what happened, Mr. Ting spent part of Wednesday conducting an experiment with a colleague\u2019s Apple Watch. They timed how quickly a text from an iPhone could reach the watch and be relayed to a third party.\n\u201cIf they really wanted to do it right, the batter could have just had an Apple Watch on his arm with vibrations to signal a fastball or an off-speed pitch, instead of having a middle man on the bench,\u201d said Mr. Ting, an executive at a design and advertising firm\nApple declined to comment.\nThe company need not worry about the latest news affecting sales, analysts said. The third iteration of the Apple Watch is expected on Sept. 12, with LTE cellular data capacity and improved battery life.\nAnd the Apple Watch\u2019s fortunes have improved. Last month, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said that quarterly sales of the watch were up 50 percent over the same period a year earlier.\nThe Red Sox were not the first to see illicit opportunities with the Apple Watch.\nUsers on Reddit have posted about cheating on exams by transferring documents to their watch.One video on YouTubefrom 2015 declared the Apple Watch the \u201cNew Easiest Way To Cheat in Exam\u201d and garnered more than 180,000 views.\nBut testing firms have responded.\nThe College Board, which administers the SAT and Advanced Placement tests, does not allow wearable technology such as digital watches or Google Glass in its testing centers. Neither does Law School Admission Council, which handles the LSAT.\nStudents who try to take smart watches into the GRE graduate admissions test are removed from the testing room, their fees forfeited and their scores canceled.\nGMAT test-takers must deposit watches \u2014 smart or otherwise \u2014 in lockers before entering testing rooms, said Jennifer Garfinkel, a spokeswoman for the Graduate Management Admission Council.\nDigital watches have been prohibited during the New York bar exam for several years, said John J. McAlary, executive director of the state\u2019s board of law examiners.\nAnalog watches are allowed for now. But in July, the board tested large, synchronized clocks in exam rooms and will decide this fall whether to ban watches altogether, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been concerned about this for a while,\u201d Mr. McAlary said."

        "title": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now",
        "fulltext": "ROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.\nFor Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.\nIn the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.\nThe $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.\nMs. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.\nMs. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.\nYet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.\nLess than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.\nThey both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.\nEastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\nBut Kodak also created enough working-class jobs to help create two generations of middle-class wealth in Rochester. The Harvard economist Larry Summers has oftenpointedat this difference, arguing that it helps explain rising inequality and declining social mobility.\n\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.\nMs. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.\nWhen Apple was seeking permission to build its new headquarters,its consultants projectedthe company would have 23,400 employees, with an average salary comfortably in the six figures. Thirty years ago, Kodak employed about 60,000 people in Rochester, with average pay and benefits companywide worth $79,000 in today\u2019s dollars.\nPart of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.\nApple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.\nThe 10 most valuable tech companies have 1.5 million employees,according to calculationsby Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute, compared with 2.2 million employed by the 10 biggest industrial companies in 1979. Mr. Mandel, however, notes that today\u2019s tech industry is adding jobs much faster than the industrial companies, which took many decades to reach that scale.\nMany of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.\nBut a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.\nIn part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.\nBut major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\nAnd the phenomenon stretches far beyond Silicon Valley, where companies like Apple are just a particularly extreme example of achieving huge business success with a relatively small employee count. The Federal Express delivery person who brings you a package may well be an independent contractor; many of the people who help banks likeCitigroup and JPMorganservice mortgage loans and collect delinquent payments work for contractors; and if you call your employer\u2019s computer help desk, there\u2019s a good chance it will be picked up by someone in another state, or country.\nApple emphasizes that its products generate many jobs beyond those who receive a paycheck from the company directly. The company estimates 1.5 million people work in the \u201capp economy,\u201d building and maintaining the mobile applications used on Apple products. Apple stores in 44 states tend to offer more generous pay and benefits than is standard in the retail industry. And it is growing quickly, including far from its California headquarters, such as with6,000 jobs in Austin, Tex., at an average salary of $77,000 a year, and many more indirectly through what it says is $50 billion in annual spending to suppliers in the United States.\n\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.\nBut it is also clear that, across a range of job functions, industries and countries, the shift to a contracting economy has put downward pressure on compensation. Pay for janitors fell by 4 to 7 percent, and for security guards by 8 to 24 percent, in American companies that outsourced, Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Ethan Kaplan of Stockholm University found ina 2010 paper.\nThese pay cuts appear to be fueling overall inequality. J. Adam Cobb of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Ken-Hou Lin at the University of Texasfound thatthe drop in big companies\u2019 practice of paying relatively high wages to their low- and mid-level workers could have accounted for 20 percent of the wage inequality increase from 1989 to 2014.\nThe same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.\nPhil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.\nThe difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.\nIn interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\n\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201d\nFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.\nThe smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.\nThe compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.\nThere are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201d\nAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\n\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201d\nWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.\nBut when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.\nLabor exists on a similar continuum.\nThe right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.\nThere is plenty of logic behind the idea that companies should focus on theircore competenceand outsource the rest. By this logic, Apple executivesshouldfocus on building great phones and computers, not hiring and overseeing janitors. And companiesshouldoutsource work when the need for staff is lumpy, such as for software companies that may need dozens of quality-assurance testers ahead of a major release but not once the product is out.\nThere\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.\nBut as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.\nFirms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.\nMore broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\n\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201d\nLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\n\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201d\nIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.\nAs you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.\nIn reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.\nApple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\n\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.\nMs. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.\nShe works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.\nA 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.\nThere is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.\nMs. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\n\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201d\nThe shift is profound. \u201cI look at the big tech companies, and they practice a 21st-century form of welfare capitalism, with foosball tables and free sushi and all that,\u201d Rick Wartzman, senior adviser at the Drucker Institute and author of \u201cThe End of Loyalty,\u201d said. \u201cBut it\u2019s for a relatively few folks. It\u2019s great if you\u2019re a software engineer. If you\u2019re educated, you\u2019re in command.\u201d\nBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized."

        "title": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues",
        "fulltext": "MAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\nHer name is Kayla Delzer. Her third graders adore her. She teaches them to post daily on theclass TwitterandInstagram accountsshe set up. She remodeled her classroom based on Starbucks. And she uses apps likeSeesaw, a student portfolioplatformwhere teachers and parents may view and comment on a child\u2019s schoolwork.\nMs. Delzer also has a second calling. She is a schoolteacher with her own brand,Top Dog Teaching. Education start-ups like Seesaw give her their premium classroom technology as well asswag like T-shirtsorfreebiesfor the teachers who attendher workshops. She agrees to use their products in her classroom and give the companies feedback. And she recommends their wares to thousands of teachers who follow her on social media.\n\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201d\nMs. Delzer is a member of a growing tribe of teacher influencers, many of whom promote classroom technology. They attract notice through their blogs, social media accounts and conference talks. And they are cultivated not only by start-ups like Seesaw, but by giants likeAmazon,Apple,GoogleandMicrosoft, to influence which tools are used to teach American schoolchildren.\nTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.\nMoreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.\nMore than two dozen education start-ups have enlisted teachers asbrand ambassadors. Some give the teachers inexpensive gifts like free classroom technology or T-shirts. Last year,TenMarks, a math-teaching site owned by Amazon,offered Amazon gift cardsto teachers who acted as company advisers, and an additional $80 gift card for writing a post on its blog, according to aTenMarks online forum.\nTeachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.\nMany public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\n\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.\nPublic-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.\n\u201cAny time you are paying a public employee to promote a product in the public classroom without transparency, then that\u2019s problematic,\u201d saidJames E. Tierney, a former attorney generalof Maine who is a lecturer at Harvard Law School. \u201cShould attorneys general be concerned about this practice? The answer is yes.\u201d\nMs. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201d\nAt a time when teachers shell outan average of $600of their own money every year just to buy student supplies like pencils \u2014 and makepleas for student laptops on DonorsChoose.org, a fund-raising site \u2014 it\u2019s understandable that teachers would embrace free classroom technology.\n\u201cMy kids have access to awesome things that, as a district, we could never afford,\u201d said Nicholas Provenzano, an English teacher in the Detroit area who is an ambassador for companies that make$1,299 3-D printers and $300 coding kits. He noted that he had apprised his school, and his students, of his company ties.\nAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.\nThe benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.\nApple, Google and Microsoft, which are in education partly to woo students as lifetime users of their products, have more sophisticated teacher efforts \u2014 with names like theApple Distinguished Educatorsprogram, Google for Education\u2019sCertified InnovatorProgram andMicrosoft Innovative Educator Expertprogram. Each yearlong program selects teachers to attend a conference and work with the company to help create, or develop, education innovations, often using company tools. The tech giants position their programs as professional development for teachers, not marketing exercises.\nMicrosoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.\nAn Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201d\nThe competition for these teacher evangelists has become so fierce thatGoEnnounce, a one-year-old platformwhere students can share profiles of their accomplishments, decided to offer a financial incentive \u2014 a 15 percent cut of any school sales that resulted from referrals \u2014 to Ms. Delzer and a few other selected teachers just to try to keep up with rival companies\u2019 perks.\nSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\n\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.\nThe medical profession has long wrestled with a similar issue: Can pharmaceutical-company gifts like speaking fees or conference junkets influence physicians to prescribe certain medications? A recent study of nearly 280,000 doctorsconcludedthat physicians who received even one free meal promoting a specific brand of medicine prescribed that medication at significantly higher rates than they did similar drugs. Drug makers are nowrequired by lawto providedetails on their payments\u2014 including gifts, meals and fees for promotional speeches \u2014 to a range of physicians and academic medical centers.\nUnlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\n\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.\nAnother issue: The Federal Trade Commissionconsiders sponsored poststo be a form of advertising. It expects people who receive a product, a meal or anything else of value from a company, in exchange for promoting a product, to disclose that sponsorship when they endorse the product.\nThis is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.\nSome teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\n\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201d\nFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.\nMs. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.\nTo do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\nShe spends some evenings and weekends doing her consulting work. She also co-founded her own teacher training conference, calledHappy Go Teach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.\nJust before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.\nIf her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.\nSo she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201d\nThe \u201cStarbucks for kids\u201d classroom proved so successful that Ms. Delzer wroteabout it for EdSurge, an industry publication, in 2015. The article quickly spread in education circles.\nSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201d\nBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.\nIn 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.\nThat was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\n\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201d\nShe soon found herself a bigger stage \u2014 at TEDxFargo, a local chapter of the well-known TED conference. It was 2015, and she spoke about using technology and other approaches to give students more autonomy. The YouTubevideo of her talkhas racked up more than 127,000 views.\nToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.\nSome non-tech companies, too, are eager to harness her star power byproviding their products at no charge.\n\u201cBIG THANKS to our friends @TradeWestEDU for the new chairs, bean bags and tables!\u201dMs. Delzer tweetedin January after Trade West Equipment, an office and school supplier, furnished items for her classroom. \u201cWe are loving our new #flexibleseating options!\u201d\nOne morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.\nSome children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201d\nMs. Delzer is also an ambassador for Seesaw, an unpaid post. \u201cSeesaw, my teacher heart loves you :-),\u201d Ms. Delzerwrote on Instagramthis year with a video clip showing her students using the program. It was seen more than 6,500 times.\nTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.\nMs. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.\nShe added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\n\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.\nBut companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\nAccording tothe Seesaw site, for instance, the company expects its teacher ambassadors to \u201cuse Seesaw regularly in your classroom,\u201d host two Seesaw-related conference talks or workshops annually and participate in Seesaw discussions online. In exchange, Seesaw offers teachers a subscription to its $120 premium service, product previews and a company badge to post on their profiles.\nJoel R. Reidenberg, a professorat Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan, said those kinds of arrangements could violate state or school district conflict-of-interest rules governing public employees.\n\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.\nTim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201d\nMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\n\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201d\nMs. Delzer has also served as anAmazon Education \u201cTeacher Innovator\u201d; a\u201cDigital Image Champion\u201d for GoEnnounce, the student portfolio platform; a brandambassador for GoNoodle, a classroom activity app; and a\u201cLead Digital Innovator\u201d for PBS LearningMedia, the education arm of the nonprofit broadcasting company.\nOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.\nHe had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.\nAt a time when many teachers feel constrained by curriculum requirements, Mr. Provenzano said digital tools provided a creative outlet. The design software assignment also took advantage of his side business, calledThe Nerdy Teacher. Mr. Provenzano consults for education technology companies, and his basement is chock-full of the electronics they send him to try.\nNow, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.\nLater he posted a photo of the gavelon Twitter, mentioning the brand: \u201cStudent designed and @DremelEdu 3D40 printed gavel for a To Kill a Mockingbird presentation.\u201d\nMr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.\nThis teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.\nDrug makers have long cultivated doctors to promote brand-name medicines to their peers. Insiders have a nickname for these doctors: \u201cKey Opinion Leaders.\u201d Among other things, drug makers havepaid physician influencersto give talks about company drugs, sent them on junkets and lavished them with fancy dinners.\nIf the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.\n\u201cThese techniques encourage the use of the product being promoted rather than evidence-based practices,\u201d said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical Schoolwho has studied how drug company payments influence doctors. \u201cThere is evidence that even a small amount of money, like a meal, can influence prescribing.\u201d\nSome academicmedical centers now prohibittheir doctors from giving industry-sponsored speeches. And some drug companies havestopped giving doctorsswag.\nBut there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.\nMr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.\nHe left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.\nSome ambassador programs involve formal contracts that may take advantage of well-meaning teachers, legal experts said. For instance,a document onlinereviewed by The New York Times titled \u201cDremel Idea Builder Ambassador Agreement\u201d contains a number of stipulations for teachers.\nAmong other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.\nAnd Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.\nLinda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\n\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.\nEarlier this year, after school, Ms. Delzer drove to Kittsona, a trendy midpriced clothing boutique in Fargo. She already had a host of speaking engagements on her calendar, and she wanted new outfits to wear to them.\nThe Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.\nLast year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.\nKittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.\nIt was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\nAn hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.\nAfter dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.\nMs. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.\nIf her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.\nEvery fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\nAfter all,the class accounts, calledTopDogKids, are essentially an offshoot of her own.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201d\nLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201d"

        "title": "Boston Red Sox Used Apple Watches to Steal Signs Against Yankees",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For decades, spying on another team has been as much a part of baseball\u2019s gamesmanship as brushback pitches and hard slides. The Boston Red Sox have apparently added a modern \u2014 and illicit \u2014 twist: They used an Apple Watch to gain an advantage against the Yankees and other teams.\nInvestigators forMajor League Baseballhave determined that the Red Sox, who are in first place in the American League East and very likely headed to the playoffs, executed a scheme to illicitly steal hand signals from opponents\u2019 catchers in games against the second-place Yankees and other teams, according to several people briefed on the matter.\nThe baseball inquiry began about two weeks ago, after the Yankees\u2019 general manager, Brian Cashman, filed a detailed complaint with the commissioner\u2019s office that included video the Yankees shot of the Red Sox dugout during a three-game series between the two teams in Boston last month.\nBoston used an Apple Watch and video cameras to illegally gain an advantage, decoding the signs of the Yankees\u2019 catcher to the pitcher.\nThe Yankees, who had long been suspicious of the Red Sox\u2019 stealing catchers\u2019 signs in Fenway Park, contended the video showed a member of the Red Sox training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout. The trainer then relayed a message to other players in the dugout, who, in turn, would signal teammates on the field about the type of pitch that was about to be thrown, according to the people familiar with the case.\nBaseball investigators corroborated the Yankees\u2019 claims based on video the commissioner\u2019s office uses for instant replay and broadcasts, the people said. The commissioner\u2019s office then confronted the Red Sox, who admitted that their trainers had received signals from video replay personnel and then relayed that information to Red Sox players \u2014 an operation that had been in place for at least several weeks.\nThe Red Sox responded in kind on Tuesday, filing a complaint against the Yankees claiming that the team uses a camera from its YES television network exclusively to steal signs during games, an assertion the Yankees denied.\nIt is unclear what penalties, if any, Commissioner Rob Manfred will issue against the Red Sox and whether he will order a more expansive investigation to determine the extent of the Red Sox\u2019 sign-stealing system. It is also unclear how he will proceed with the countercomplaint.\n\u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation on both sides,\u201d Mr. Manfred said to reporters at Fenway Park, where he was present for an unrelated event. \u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent comfortable that it is not an ongoing issue.\u201d\nMr. Manfred said he believed he had the power to punish teams in connection with such cheating.\n\u201cCould it happen? You know, is there the authority to do that? I think the answer to that, under the major league constitution, is yes,\u201d he said. \u201cHas it ever happened with this type of allegation? I think the answer is \u2014 Iknowthe answer is no.\n\u201cAnd the reason for that,\u201d he added, \u201cis it\u2019s just very hard to know what the actual impact on any particular game was of an alleged violation.\u201d\nBoston\u2019s manager, John Farrell, said he was aware that the players were trying to steal signs but said that he did not know they were using electronics.\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of the rule,\u201d Mr. Farrell said. \u201cElectronic devices are not to be used in the dugout. Beyond that, all I can say is it\u2019s a league matter at this point.\u201d\nStealing signs is believed to be particularly effective when there is a runner on second base who can both watch what hand signals the catcher is using to communicate with the pitcher and can easily relay to the batter any clues about what type of pitch may be coming. Such tactics are allowed as long as teams do not use any methods beyond their eyes. Binoculars and electronic devices are both prohibited.\nIn recent years, as cameras have proliferated in major league ballparks, teams have begun using the abundance of video to help them discern opponents\u2019 signs, including the catcher\u2019s signals to the pitcher. Some clubs have had clubhouse attendants quickly relay information to the dugout from the personnel monitoring video feeds.\nBut such information has to be rushed to the dugout on foot so it can be relayed to players on the field \u2014 a runner on second, the batter at the plate \u2014 while the information is still relevant. The Red Sox admitted to league investigators that they were able to significantly shorten this communications chain by using electronics. In what mimicked the rhythm of a double play, the information would rapidly go from video personnel to a trainer to the players.\nAs part of the inquiry, baseball investigators have interviewed the Red Sox team trainers and outfielder Chris Young, a former Yankees player. The Red Sox told league investigators that Mr. Farrell; Boston\u2019s president for baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski; and other front-office officials were not aware of the sign-stealing operation, the people said.\nIn the first game of the August series in question, the Red Sox prospered the first time they put a runner on second. It occurred in the second inning, and Rafael Devers promptly hit a home run, giving the Red Sox a 2-0 lead. The Red Sox went 5 for 8 in that game when they had a man on second.\nTheir success when they had a runner on second in the other two games of the series was mixed: 1 for 6 in the second contest and 3 for 10 in the third.\nThe video provided to the commissioner\u2019s office by the Yankees was captured during the first two games of the series and included at least three clips. In the clips, the Red Sox assistant athletic trainer, Jon Jochim, is seen looking at his Apple Watch and then passing information to outfielder Brock Holt and second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who was injured at the time but in uniform. In one instance, Pedroia is then seen passing the information to Young.\nThe Red Sox\u2019 tactics will add to the longstanding rivalry with the Yankees. Outside New England, the case will be reminiscent of the Spygate controversy that erupted a decade ago when the world-beating Patriots were found to have violated N.F.L. rules by spying on opponents to gain an edge.\nMr. Manfred is in a difficult position as he decides how to discipline the team and whether to continue investigating.\nIn Spygate, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, hastily took away a first-round draft pick and fined the Patriots and their coach, Bill Belichick, before conducting a thorough investigation. When more evidence of cheating later emerged, Goodell was accused of trying to minimize the damage and protect one of the sport\u2019s premier franchises.\nIn baseball, the most infamous incident involving sign stealing played out in 1951, when the New York Giants overcame a 13 \u00bd-game deficit over the final two months of the season to catch the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Giants went on to beat the Dodgers in a playoff for the pennant.\nFifty years later, The Wall Street Journal revealed that the Giants had spies at the Polo Grounds who used a telescope to steal signs from the opposing catcher, which were then relayed to Giants players from the bullpen.\nIn 1997, teams accused the Mets of planting small cameras near home plate in Shea Stadium to steal signals. The Mets denied that they had used the cameras to try to do so, and the league did not take any action.\nMore recently, the Philadelphia Phillies faced sign-stealing accusations in 2011. Several teams logged complaints with the commissioner\u2019s office that the team used binoculars and other unauthorized methods to steal signs. Major League Baseball never imposed sanctions on the Phillies."

        "title": "Apple Watch Series 3 Excels, Even if You Don\u2019t Need Cellular",
        "fulltext": "To understand why you might want the new cellular Apple Watch, put yourself in the shoes of a wealthy person who drives a weekend car. (I promise this is a fun exercise.)\nIn this situation, youriPhoneis like your everyday workhorse vehicle, with the muscle to speed through emails, calendar invitations and social media posts. But when it comes time to unwind, you can leave the house with just a cellular Apple Watch \u2014 the equivalent of the weekend car \u2014 and still have access to a lightweight phone that can handle calls and text messages.\nIn other words, wearing theApple Watch Series 3with cellular connectivity, which Apple will release Friday, is like owning a leisure phone that is excessive but situationally useful. Apple\u2019s first wearable to include cellular may come in handy when you are at the gym and want to leave your phone in the locker, or when you go out for a run and want to remain reachable.\nAfter testing the cellular watch for a week, I found it to be an excellent smart watch that is a significant improvement over thefirst Apple Watch, which was slow, confusing to use and deeply flawed.\nBut the cellular version is a luxury that most people probably will not need. The price you pay for those brief moments of respite from your iPhone is steep: at least $399 for the hardware, plus $10 a month for access on your cellphone plan for some carriers. And I seldom found reasons to use the watch without my iPhone to justify the extra cost.\nThere may also be some early kinks for Apple to work out with the new cellular Watch. Some reviewersdiscoveredthat the device occasionally lost its cellular connection, for example. Apple said on Wednesday that the issue was related to the watch inadvertently connecting to open Wi-Fi networks that lacked internet connectivity, and that it was investigating a software fix.\nIn the end, some people who want a wearable device for things like fitness tracking and a quick glance at mobile notifications will probably be happy with the Series 3 without cellular, which costs $329.\nLike its predecessors, the Apple Watch Series 3 is a computer worn around the wrist, with a miniature touch screen.\nThe device requires an iPhone to set up and work properly. Notifications like text messages or social media alerts that come to your iPhone appear on the watch first if you are not actively using the phone. The watch runs apps, including some built-in software for fitness tracking as well as third-party widgets you can download from the App Store.\nThe main difference with the cellular Apple Watch is that some important features, like placing calls, texting and streaming music, will work when you are not near your phone; the watch shares the same phone number and cellular plan with your iPhone.\nTo help determine whether the cellular watch is right for you, I abandoned my iPhone to test the watch in a number of common situations. Here\u2019s how that went.\nOver the weekend, my partner and I made plans to go to dinner at a sushi restaurant. I used the Apple Watch to summon a Lyft car to pick us up at home.\nAt the sushi bar, I liked that I didn\u2019t have a smartphone constantly buzzing in my pocket, though I got a text that I quickly responded to on the watch using an emoji. My partner and I enjoyed 90 minutes of intimate conversation over omakase with minimal distraction, though I was a bit envious that she could Instagram our gorgeous nigiri. (Alas, the watch does not have a miniature spy camera.)\nVerdict: I could have had roughly the same experience with just an iPhone put on Do Not Disturb mode \u2014 and a bit of self-discipline.\nFor several days, I wore just the watch while walking my dogs. Not having a phone freed up valuable space in my pockets for other items, like my keys, my wallet, dog treats and bags. I liked that the Apple Watch tracked my steps and walking distance to make dog walking feel more like exercise than a chore. I placed a call to my partner with the watch to tell her where to meet me at a park; she said the call sounded crystal clear.\nIt was also nice that with just the watch, I could still be reachable via phone or text by my colleagues during morning walks \u2014 but emails took several minutes to show up after they were sent. It turns out that while texts and calls are done directly on the cellular watch, emails still rely on the iPhone\u2019s pushing emails to the cloud, which then transmits the message to your watch.\nVerdict: The watch is good for staying reachable via phone or texts. But in those brief moments when you need to step away from a computer during work hours, a smartphone is still necessary if you rely heavily on email, as I do.\nI wore the watch and took a pair of AirPods, Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds, to a rock-climbing gym. Again, I left my iPhone behind.\nAt the gym, I opened the Workout app to track my heart rate and calories burned throughout the workout. During breaks, I used Siri to write a few quick texts to some friends to make plans for the week. I put on the AirPods in the hope of streaming songs on the watch from Apple Music, only to realize that this capability has not yet been released. Apple said music streaming for the cellular watch will come out next month.\nVerdict: It was nice being able to stay in touch with people at the gym without a phone bulging in my pocket, but I\u2019d be happy unplugging for a while and tracking my workout with a noncellular Apple Watch. As for whether streaming music makes a cellular watch worth owning, I unfortunately can\u2019t tell you yet.\nHere\u2019s where leaving my phone behind and relying only on the watch did not make sense: during grocery shopping. The watch doesn\u2019t have a web browser, let alone a big enough screen, for looking up recipes. But when it came time to check out, I hit the side button to activate Apple Pay and quickly paid for the groceries.\nVerdict: A smartphone is a better shopping companion than a watch.\nThe value of the cellular capabilities on the Apple Watch is questionable considering the price you pay each month.\nAT&T and Verizon Wireless, for example, charge a network access fee of $10 a month to share your phone plan\u2019s texts, minutes and data with an Apple Watch. That\u2019s about the same as a Spotify subscription, but with the exception of avid joggers and gym rats, people may not use the cellular features frequently enough. Hopefully, over time, Apple will negotiate with carriers to bring the monthly rate down.\nAlthough I think most people can skip buying the cellular model, the Apple Watch Series 3 is the first smart watch I can confidently recommend that people buy. While I don\u2019t personally find it attractive enough to replace my wristwatch, the new Apple Watch is a well-designed, durable and easy-to-use fitness tracker for people who want analytics on their workouts and general health (R.I.P.,Fitbit).\nImportant features like the stopwatch, calendar and Siri work quickly and reliably. And unlike its predecessors, the watch has impressive battery life \u2014 on average, I had more than 40 percent battery remaining after a full day of use.\nSo the final verdict? The Apple Watch Series 3 is the first sign that wearable computers are maturing and may eventually become a staple in consumer electronics."
