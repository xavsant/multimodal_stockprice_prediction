        "fulltext": "Q.Do the trackpad shortcuts on a MacBook work the same way on an iMac if you buy an external trackpad to use instead of the included mouse?\nA.If the iMac is running at least OS X 10.7 (Lion)and you have a trackpad accessory that supports Apple\u2019sMulti-Touch gestures, you should be able to use most of the same finger taps, swipes and other moves that you use to navigate on the Mac laptop. Several third-party trackpads are available, but make sure the trackpad is compatible withOS XormacOS Sierra, as many models are designed for Windows systems.\nApple\u2019s own $129Magic Trackpad 2brings Multi-Touch gestures to the company\u2019s desktop hardware and also includes theForce Touch functionalitythat responds accordingly to different levels of pressure. The Magic Trackpad 2 requires a Mac running at least OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and that usesBluetooth 4.0wireless technology.\nOnce you connect the Magic Trackpad 2 to the iMac over a Bluetooth connection, you can tap its surface to click, scroll through web pages by sliding two fingers, zoom in with a two-finger double-tap, pinch, zoom and all the other familiar gestures you use on your MacBook. You canadjust the trackpad\u2019s settingsby opening the System Preferences icon in the Mac\u2019s dock and clicking the Trackpad icon. (You may need to visit the settings toturn on the \u201cthree-finger drag\u201d Force Touch gesturefor moving an active window on the Mac\u2019s screen.)\nIf you have older iMac hardware, Logitech\u2019s discontinued Rechargeable Trackpad for Macsupports many Multi-Touch gesturesandcan still be foundon some sites for around $100. The original version of Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad also pops up in some places onlinefor about $70. However, these older products may not be fully compatible with newer versions of the Mac operating system."

        "title": "Daily Report: Google\u2019s Day in Europe\u2019s Court Highlights Nature of New Tech",
        "fulltext": "Europe has a big headache: the current state of American technology companies. And it may take a long time to go away.\nAs Mark Scott reports, Google will respond this week to charges brought by the European Commission that the tech giant hobbles competitors and squelches consumer choice in cases involving its Android mobile operating system, its online searches and some advertising products.\nIn addition,Salesforce is pressingthe commission to look into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, which it says will hinder Salesforce\u2019s access to LinkedIn\u2019s data about people, job skills and companies. Facebook hasfaced issuesabout how its data on Europeans is transferred to the United States. And the European Union has told Ireland itisn\u2019t collecting enough taxesfrom Apple.\nWith all these complaints, only Apple seems ensnared in a traditional argument with regulators. The others, because they are intrinsically tied to new kinds of business, require creative thinking about the meaning and importance of data, privacy, competition and the like.\nNo European company has a comprehensive leading position in the new tech world, which combines cloud computing, mobility, data and artificial intelligence. But that\u2019s probably not why the regulators are preoccupied with Americans.\nIt\u2019s the nature of big online businesses to seek as much data as possible, and often engage with consumers in such a way that the users share a lot about themselves in the name of fun (Facebook) and professional advantage (LinkedIn).\nCreating effective methods for searching for information, for using smartphones or for building applications seems to enable companies to acquire dominance more rapidly than ever. Some of that may be because of noncompetitive behavior, but it is also because of the strong network effects that benefit these companies. It\u2019s cheap and easy to distribute software online, and if people love your product, they will share and publicize it for you.\nThe continued strength of Amazon Web Services is a case in point. A.W.S. was an early leader in cloud computing, and it now hosts services likeTwilio, used to build cloud-based communications,Stripe, a payments service, andBraintree, used in mobile commerce.\nSoftware developers using these applications may choose among other cloud providers, but having so many popular tools in A.W.S. gives it an edge; it is also known and trusted.\nIt\u2019s a strong model. And it quite possibly provides years of work for European regulators, until they can integrate the new businesses that technology creates into old customs and laws."

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: The Political Evolution of Silicon Valley",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Hey hey, Farhad! I regret to say I may not be my usual, incredibly sharp self in this week\u2019s newsletter, as I am dealing with a back injury and the medication may have dulled my wits. So basically I\u2019m down to your level, which may actually make you feel more comfortable.\nFarhad:What a nasty woman you are.\nMike:Um, thank you, Farhad. On to this week\u2019s news!\nOn Monday, another page turned in the endless story that is the Apple car project, the troubled attempts by the Cupertino company to get some sort of self-driving car rolling in the future, aswe\u2019ve reported on extensively in the past.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the ambitions of the projects have been scaled back drastically, which may mean Apple won\u2019t build its own car after all. It may turn out more likethings Uber is doing, which pairs the technology company with automakers to create custom cars with self-driving technology to guide them.\nOr the whole thing could fall apart. I think Apple should have just bought a carmaker and brought it all in-house. Seems to me that the great hubris of Silicon Valley is thinking that you can build everything, no matter how complex, on your own.\nFarhad:Hey, Apple\u2019s no puppet. You\u2019re the puppet! You\u2019re the puppet!\nMike:I\u2019m going to ignore that and keep going. Speaking of disastrous car wrecks, a bit more Twitter news to talk about. Earlier this week, thecompany hired Greg Gopmanto work on its fledgling virtual reality and 360-degree video efforts.\nTechCrunch criticized the hire, citing a screed against the homeless that Gopman posted to Facebook a while back that made him persona non grata of San Francisco for quite some time.\nShortly after that,Twitter fired Gopman, apparently not wanting to deal with the added headache of a guy who (at one point, butapparently no longer) hated the homeless, especially while the company is dealing with negative headlines from every which direction regarding its sale process, or lack thereof.\nTechCrunch, bafflingly,criticized that move as well. Some people are never satisfied.\nFor me, the biggest takeaway here is that VR tweets seem like the most insane thing ever. But I have been wrong before.\nFarhad:Oh, there was another politics-related dust-up in Silicon Valley this week. You remember Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who secretly funded the lawsuit that put Gawker out of business and is also the tech world\u2019s most prominent supporter of Donald Trump? Well, a bunch of his friends and associates said this week that theyweren\u2019t going to punish himfor donating $1.25 million to Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief,said Thiel would remain a member of Facebook\u2019s board. \u201cWe can\u2019t create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a memo to Facebook\u2019s staff.\nCiting similar reasons, Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, alsosaid it would not cut ties with Thiel, even though it disagrees with Trump.\nThat set off a wave of outrage among people who\u2019ve been trying to promote diversity in the tech industry. Project Include, a group that seeks to advise companies on gender and racial diversity,said it was cutting off ties with Y Combinatorbecause Thiel\u2019s donation to Trump stands in contrast to its goals.\nTo me, it seems we\u2019re witnessing a newfound political awareness in the tech industry, which is reliably lefty but has long been willing to sit out national political disputes. I don\u2019t think Thiel\u2019s donation is going to cost him anything beyond social awkwardness, but in the long run, I suspect it will spark a progressive awakening among many in the industry. What do you think?\nMike:It\u2019s kind of funny to me how willing tech has been to put itself front and center in the global conversation \u2014 they eat up magazine covers and love to be on mostly meaningless power lists, just like me \u2014 but then feel completely blindsided when their politics are called into question.\nTo me, if you\u2019re building technology that is literally shaping the world as it will be defined in the future, there is no avoiding that your personal ideologies will come into question at some point. Perhaps this Thiel situation will finally bring that sense of self-awareness to those who hadn\u2019t realized this yet. In any case, yeah, I think it\u2019s probably going to rouse techies to be more vocal than they\u2019ve been in the past.\nFarhad:Yay, more Medium posts!\nMike:Finally, I want to talk about Nintendo. The companyreleased its first teaser trailer on Thursday for Switch, a new console that combines the power and familiarity of a video game setup in your living room with the portability of a hand-held gaming device.\nIt\u2019s a novel idea: People still want to play video games on their big-screen TVs at home, so you have to produce a console as successful as the Xbox or PlayStation that can run next-generation graphics and games.\nThat said, everyone games on the go these days. The advent of the smartphone changed what we think of when we think of gaming, as users have migrated en masse to freemium or low-cost app gaming on their phones. It\u2019s easier if, say, you\u2019re commuting, since you only have to carry one device that you already have in your pocket anyway.\nI have my thoughts on this \u2014 namely, it could be awesome or terrible \u2014 but I wonder mostly about the content that needs to fill this thing out. And other than the highly successful franchises Nintendo has built out over the years like Mario, Zelda and a handful of others, I haven\u2019t really seen any blockbuster titles from them in some time.\nWhat do you think? Fail or win?\nFarhad:I\u2019m willing to reserve judgment, but at the moment, I\u2019m skeptical of this idea. From the video, the Switch looks like a tablet computer that can be fitted with some game controllers when you\u2019re on the go, and then connected to your TV when you\u2019re home.\nBut if that\u2019s the case, you have to wonder why you need a stand-alone device \u2014 why couldn\u2019t you just carry around a controller for your smartphone or tablet, and then connect your device to your TV when you\u2019re home? In other words, why is Nintendo making new hardware when it could simply put out its games for the iPhone, iPad and Android devices?\nMike:This is the eternal question for Nintendo. They seem to cling desperately to owning the hardware, which seems questionable to me since it is a lower-margin business than, say, plopping out a series of janky smartphone games and sticking Zelda\u2019s face on it.\nFarhad:That suggests the second complication. Nintendo recently announced that it is planning to put out some content for other platforms. For instance a Mario game, Super Mario Run, will be available in the iPhone\u2019s App Store this December. But if that\u2019s the case, which platform will get Nintendo\u2019s best games \u2014 will Nintendo Switch get the exclusives, or will iOS and Android (which have far more users) be given the same titles?\nTo me, it seems like a complicated path. I\u2019d favor something simpler: Kill the hardware, focus on creating killer games, release them for high prices on iOS and Android, and profit.\nMike:An intriguing thought. I\u2019m not sure I fully agree with killing hardware entirely, but I understand the impulse. And for what it\u2019s worth, Nintendo\u2019s valuable intellectual property assets would at least give them a leg up in content in the near term.\nLook at Disney: After they bought \u201cStar Wars\u201d they planned to crank out a movie a year until 2020, and everywhere I look there\u2019s a BB-8 motorized ball for me to trip over.\nO.K., enough for me today. I\u2019m going back to my back-healing poses: Lying flat on the floor like a starfish, tweeting from my phone.\nFarhad:You\u2019re a bad hombre, my friend. A bad hombre. Hope you feel better!"

        "title": "Google Pixel Review: Assessing the New Smartphone",
        "fulltext": "Google\u2019s Pixel, the first smartphone to carry the search giant\u2019s brand name, arrives in stores on Thursday in a lucky stroke of timing. For Google, at least.\nThis holiday season, all Google\u2019s new phone has to do to compete with those from Samsung, the world\u2019s largest handset maker, is notburst into flames. That\u2019s what recently happened to a bunch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s, the higher-end smartphones that use Google\u2019s Android software. The Note 7s have since been recalled and Samsung has shut down the product entirely.\nThe absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung\u2019s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel\u2019s camera don\u2019t look as good as the iPhone\u2019s. And Google\u2019s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb.\nBut hey, the Pixel probably won\u2019tburn down your garageorinjure a child. So if you prefer Android and are already hooked on Google\u2019s suite of internet-powered software, including its maps, photos, email and document-editing apps, then you probably won\u2019t regret buying the Pixel.\nGoogle said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural.\nIn the United States, Google\u2019s Pixel will initially be available for Verizon Wireless orProject Fi, Google\u2019s cheaper phone service. Like other high-end phones, Pixel\u2019s starting price is about $650. Pixel comes in two different screen sizes: five diagonal inches and 5.5 diagonal inches. Google provided the 5.5-inch model, Pixel XL, for testing.\nAfter testing Pixel for five days, I concluded that although the device\u2019s features are underwhelming, this is a good smartphone for Android fans. It does a great job doing what Google designed it to do: Running Android in its purest form, untainted byslipshod third-party apps. Better yet, this is an opportune time to consider breaking up with your carrier and switching to Project Fi, Google\u2019s phone service that costs as little as $30 a month.\nHere\u2019s what stood out in my tests of Pixel:\nGoogle\u2019s Still-Annoying Assistant\nIn a comparison of voice-controlled virtual assistants offered by Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoftlast January, I determined that none were great, though Google\u2019s was slightly ahead of the pack. Nine months later, the situation remains largely the same: Artificially intelligent assistants still aren\u2019t that smart.\nAnd so it was with Google\u2019s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of \u201ctwo-way conversations.\u201d In plain English, what Google means is you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately.\nGoogle offers this example: You can ask, \u201cWhere is the Taj Mahal?\u201d and then ask, \u201cHow old is it?\u201d\nWhile that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, \u201cWhat time is \u2018Westworld\u2019 on TV?\u201d Assistant displayed a web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, \u201cSo what time is it on?\u201d Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m.\nFrom there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, \u201cbook me a table nearby,\u201d Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn\u2019t list other options.\nOn the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. \u201cRain is not expected this week in San Francisco,\u201d it said. Better.\nIn its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves.\nA Mediocre Camera\nLike pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel\u2019s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7\u2019s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7.\nAll the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder \u2014 they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural.\nI decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. (Before reading the results below, take a look and make your own vote.)\nPhoto A was taken with the Samsung phone, photo B with Google\u2019s Pixel, and photo C with an iPhone 7. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone.\nComparisons With the Competition\nBased on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights:\n\u25a0 What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google\u2019s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don\u2019t use.\nThe best part: In the United States, Project Fi relies on cell networks from Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular; Project Fi also works in more than 135 countries, and you pay the same rate no matter where you travel. In myreview of Project Fi this year, I found the service to be reliable and the overall package to be a good, frugal option.\n\u25a0 The Pixel\u2019s fingerprint sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you\u2019re on the go, you will probably be using two hands \u2014 one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back \u2014 to unlock the Pixel.\n\u25a0 In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 20 percent slower than both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7.\n\u25a0 The Pixel wasn\u2019t designed to be water-resistant though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water.\n\u25a0 It\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone\u2019s omission of the jack was not a big deal).\nThe Bottom Line\nLargely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether.\nUsing Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with two gigabytes of data, you\u2019d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn\u2019t include free international roaming.\nIf you are uninterested in Project Fi and are not deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem, there is another route: Try an iPhone. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus outperformed the Pixel in every way in terms of hardware features.\nAnd so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven\u2019t blown up."

Jim Kerstetter, the deputy technology editor in San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield, technology reporter in Seattle, are filling in for Farhad and Mike this week.\nJim:Hi, everyone. Apologies in advance to the people who came here expecting Mike and Farhad and their witty, bromantic discussion of the week\u2019s tech news. They are, sadly, out of the office this week. But don\u2019t worry! As your one-week-only fill-ins, you\u2019ll have two middle-aged guys discussing the finer points of progressive lenses, teen parenting and why Subarus are terrific in the snow.\nBut before ourClick and Clackimpression \u2014 tech news! Nick, you\u2019ve been covering consumer electronics since the \u201claptop\u201d computer came in a wheeled suitcase. Have you ever seen something like Samsung\u2019s problems withburning Galaxy Note 7 phones?\nNick:There have certainly been recalls of overheating and exploding laptops, includingone by Della decade ago that involved defective batteries made by Sony. Samsung\u2019s problems are of a different order, though. The company is such a high-profile player in a market that is so much bigger than laptops ever were and they\u2019re justyanking the Note 7, their flagship phone, off the market completely.\nBeyond the direct sales losses from this model, how badly damaged will the sales of future models be? It\u2019s not hard to imagine Samsung-inclined customers buying iPhones because they feel like Apple\u2019s devices aren\u2019t going to, you know, blow up on them.\nJim:See, that\u2019s just it. The phones are nice and all, but that whole \u201cit\u2019ll blow up on you\u201d would keep me from buying it \u2014 if I could. A friend told me the story of a college professor with a student who had the latest take on \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d: My phone torched my homework. He even had a burn on his leg to prove it.\nBad as this is for Samsung, I don\u2019t see anyone other than Apple capitalizing on it in the high-end of the smartphone business. At least not right away. This is a gift for Apple:Wacky wireless earbuds or not, they\u2019re going to have the most profitable part of the smartphone business pretty much to themselves.\nSamsung has problems. But what about a company that can\u2019t seem to do anything right? I speak, of course, of Yahoo.It looks like Verizon, which announced plans to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in July, is doing some saber-rattling about thatgigantic hack that Yahoo discloseda few weeks back. Looks like they may want a discount. So here\u2019s my question: Do you think Verizon bought themselves a pig in a poke?\nNick:Verizon is like the person who buys a used car only to find out it needs a new transmission a week later. For now, the public rhetoric is pretty cordial between the companies, which suggests that they still want to find a way to work this out. Do you think any concession Verizon ends up getting on price is in the billions or millions?\nJim:It\u2019s hard to say until theforensic investigation of the hackis finished. There was one report that they were looking for a $1 billion price cut. But it\u2019s hard for me to imagine Yahoo would go along with that.\nWhat about companies that aren\u2019t dying? Amazon has had a lot going on this week.\nNick:That\u2019s right. Amazon finallylaunchedits much-anticipated subscription music service and, as they usually do, they want to use price to shake up the market. They are masters of the upsell. They got a lot of attention for offering a music subscription plan for $4 a month, well below the $10 that Spotify and Apple charge. But you can only get that plan if you get their $99 Prime membership and you can only listen to it on one of their Echo devices, not on your mobile phone. It\u2019s like the food samples they hand out at the supermarket \u2014 tasty, but you\u2019re going to need to pay more if you want a real meal.\nJim:So instead of asking \u201cWould you like fries with that?\u201d They say, \u201cWould you like a burger with your fries?\u201d Clever! Maybe not as clever as coming out with an artificially intelligent home appliance a few years before their competitors,like they did with the Echo. But pretty sharp.\nWell, that does it for us for this week. Sorry we didn\u2019t get into that Subaru discussion!"
