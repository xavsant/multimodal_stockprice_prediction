        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 Amazon said on Thursday that it would stop selling devices from Apple and Google that compete with its own streaming media players, escalating the entertainment battle between the major tech companies.\nApple TV and Google\u2019s Chromecast are popular items in Amazon\u2019s electronics store. But the devices are in a brawl for market share withAmazon\u2019s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, which were introduced in 2014. The Fire Stick delivers Amazon\u2019s rapidly expanding video offerings to its customers. Apple TV and Chromecast do not.\nAmazon\u2019s move to ban competitors is not a retailing gambit. In fact, the company is willing to risk annoying customers who cannot get what they want because it is pursuing a much bigger prize. The stick is crucial to Amazon\u2019s ambitions to move from being just a retailer to a multifaceted provider of everything virtual and physical.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlike Amazon to be this territorial,\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. But he said it was a logical and perhaps inevitable move.\nAmazon Prime, which began as a frequent shipping service, now has tens of millions of subscribers. In the effort to build out its ecosystem, Prime\u2019s video and music components are becoming as important as quick package delivery.\nUpdates about Prime Music and Prime Video are frequent. Just as the news was breaking about Apple TV and Chromecast, Amazon announced on Thursday another Prime Video licensing deal, saying it would be theexclusive streaming subscription home for three new CBS series.\nMr. McQuivey said Amazon\u2019s move echoed Apple TV\u2019s refusal to play Netflix\u2019s streaming service several years ago because Apple did not want to promote a competitor. Apple ultimately gave in.\nApple, Google and Amazon once made very different products. Apple made hardware like computers and smartphones, Google ran a web search behemoth, and Amazon was an online retailer. But the three companies\u2019 business models are converging with a vengeance, with each offering a combination of hardware, like the competing video streaming devices, as well as software and entertainment like music and video.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a turf war play out between Apple, Amazon and Google,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.\nThe companies have clashed in the past. In 2012,Apple pushed Google\u2019s YouTube appoff its lineup of built-in apps on iPhones and iPads, for example. That same year, Apple alsofeatured its own maps app on the gadgetsinstead of using Google Maps.\nAs a store, Amazon likes to stress that it is a place \u201cwhere people can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online.\u201d It does not want customers to go elsewhere. Last year, when theretailer clashed with the publisher Hachetteand warned customers it was going to make it harder for them to buy Hachette books, it stressed that they were still available from third-party sellers on its site.\nThis time is different. Amazon is forbidding its vast army of third-party merchants from selling the Apple and Google devices after Oct. 29, according to messages from resellers posted in online forums and that Amazon did not dispute. Amazon\u2019s ban of sales of the Apple and Google devices from third-party merchants wasearlier reportedby Bloomberg.\nAmazon, which is never keen on explaining its actions, issued a cryptic statement that did not mention its two competitors.\n\u201cOver the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion. Roku, Xbox, PlayStation and Fire TV are excellent choices.\u201d\nThe Xbox is made by Microsoft and the PlayStation by Sony. Roku is more popular than Apple\u2019s device and is about even with Google\u2019s device.\nApple and Google declined to comment. On Amazon\u2019s list of top-selling electronics products, Chromecast comes in at No. 6 and Apple TV is No. 14.\nAmazon issued the ban just after Apple and Google unveiled new streaming media players. Apple showed an upgraded Apple TV last month, but analysts were generally unimpressed. Its ambition is to get into more living rooms with a multipurpose entertainment hub that lets app makers create content for the big screen. When the new Apple TV is released at the end of this month, users should be able to watch TV and play video games, as well as use apps to shop, book lodging and collaborate on art and design projects.\nGoogle this week introduced a redesigned Chromecast along with a second device, Chromecast Audio, for streaming music to speakers. Chromecast has been a huge success in Google\u2019s otherwise spotty record on hardware. Since unveiling the device in 2013, the company has sold some 20 million units.\nSome analysts said there was one immediate loser here: customers.\n\u201cIt really just hurts the consumers and creates confusion at a time when all of these companies are trying to build up these products,\u201d said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer.\nBut he said sales would not be affected. \u201cI don\u2019t think that in today\u2019s world consumers are going to not buy one of these products just because Amazon isn\u2019t selling it,\u201d Mr. Verna said. \u201cIf Amazon is trying to hurt Apple and Google\u2019s business, this isn\u2019t going to do it.\u201d\nAmazon likes to focus on the long term, however. And in the long term, it is banking on content being king.\n\u201cPeople get these devices to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and YouTube. If you don\u2019t have all four of those things, you have an inferior device,\u201d said Mr. McQuivey, the Forrester analyst. \u201cAnd given how expensive the devices can be, particularly Apple TV, it\u2019s a lot to ask a customer to pay that kind of money to only get three-fourths of the content you really want.\u201d"

        "title": "Lease a Smartphone or Buy It? The Pros and Cons",
        "fulltext": "FOR at least $600 a handset, popular smartphones likeApple\u2019siPhoneand the Samsung Galaxy are expensive. So why not lease one for a low monthly rate, and while you\u2019re at it, get a new phone every year?\nThat\u2019s the sales pitch that wireless carriers and others are using to lure people into trying a phone plan known as an \u201cearly upgrade plan,\u201d under which consumers can buy devices more often than every two years. The plans are in vogue right now since Applefollowed carrierslike AT&T and Verizon Wireless by offering its ownannual upgrade planfor the iPhone in September.\nThe idea underlying early upgrade plans is simple: You lease a smartphone, and after a certain amount of time \u2014 say, one year \u2014 you trade in your current device and start a lease for a brand-new phone.\nWe decided to do the math to take a closer look at the pros and cons of the early upgrade plans. We found that if you upgrade every year, you pay more over time than if you paid off a device and held on to it longer.\nBut we also found that the extra costs of leasing are reasonably low, making early upgrades ideal for tech-loving consumers with disposable income. The plans can also be beneficial even if you don\u2019t intend to trade up to a new device every year but want to reserve that option \u2014 in other words, you can take advantage of these plans just for flexibility.\n\u201cThere is nothing forcing you to go for an early upgrade,\u201d said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a company that analyzes phone bills and helped The New York Times with the calculations. \u201dThey are a good thing, if you understand them correctly.\u201d\nHow Early Upgrade Works\nIn the past, smartphones plans worked like this: You would pay a one-time down payment for a phone and sign a two-year contract, which included the costs of wireless service combined with the remaining cost of the device. People would typically have to wait two years to pay off the rest of the phone before earning the privilege of getting another device at a subsidized rate.\nNow the wireless industry hasshifted toward so-called equipment installment plans, which state the phone\u2019s actual cost and let you spread out the payments over monthly installments. Many of these plans have built in an option for an early upgrade, so people can hand in their phone early and start a payment plan for the next device. Apple, AT&T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile and Sprint each offer slight variations in early upgrade plans.\nTo do the math on the plans, we decided to use a 64GB iPhone 6s as a base example and add up the costs of leasing the phone over a year.\nUnder Apple\u2019s iPhone program, which includes coverage from its device insurance program, AppleCare Plus, you would pay $36.58 a month for a new 64GB iPhone 6s. Over the course of one year, that\u2019s $438.96 to lease the phone.\nFor AT&T\u2019s annual upgrade plan, called Next 12, you would pay $37.50 a month for 12 months before getting the option to trade in for the next iPhone. The total over a year is $450.\nVerizon\u2019s early upgrade plan totals $374.88 in leasing cost over a year, while Sprint\u2019s iPhone Forever program\u2019s total cost for a year before an upgrade added up to $321.24. With T-Mobile\u2019s early upgrade plan, you make a down payment of $99.99 for the 64GB iPhone, and pay $27.09 a month for a year before being able to upgrade, with the cost over the year coming to $425.07.\nSo how do those early upgrade plans for a 64GB iPhone, which we now know cost from $321 to $450 a year, compare to owning a device before buying a new one?\nIf you were to fully purchase a $750 iPhone and use it at least two years, that would amount to $375 a year. But you also have to consider that after you have paid off a phone, you can sell it.\nFor example, if you bought an iPhone 6s for $750, in two years you could probably sell it for about $175, reducing the overall cost of ownership to $575, or $287.50 a year; after you\u2019re done paying for the device, the equipment cost is removed from your phone bill. That makes owning a device outright cheaper than the leasing plans.\nWho Are the Plans Good For?\nIf owning a device fully costs less, that raises the question of who these early upgrade plans are suited for. Our conclusion: The plans can be good for those seeking the freedom to upgrade, as long as you have leased the phone for a certain amount of time or paid it off entirely. In the past, you would typically have had to wait two years or pay a stiff fee to upgrade early.\nAn important point in all of the early-upgrade plans is that you are not forced to keep leasing new phones every year. If you are happy with your current phone, you can keep it until you have fully paid it off, at which point you own it; you pay nothing extra to do so.\nLet\u2019s say, for example, you subscribed to AT&T\u2019s Next 12 annual upgrade program. This program gives you up to 20 months to pay off the phone and own it. So let\u2019s imagine that in 12 months, an iPhone 7 comes out and you are not excited about it. You can just continue paying your lease for eight more months until you own your phone.\nBy the time the 2017 iPhone comes out, you can sell your current iPhone and start a new lease for the brand-new phone. In this situation, you had the option to upgrade early, but you ended up waiting two years before upgrading and paid no premium.\nBuying Advice\nSo which early upgrade plan should you choose? First check the coverage maps for each phone carrier to see if the network is good where you live. Then decide by price.\nT-Mobile and Sprint offer the cheapest leasing plans, so if their networks near you are strong, go for one of those. If not, consider leasing through AT&T or Verizon. Note that Apple\u2019s upgrade plan, which includes insurance, is cheaper than AT&T\u2019s without insurance, and just slightly more expensive than Verizon\u2019s leasing option without insurance. If you are an accident-prone iPhone owner, Apple\u2019s early upgrade plan with baked-in device insurance offers great value.\nIt remains unclear whether many consumers will want to upgrade every year. Data from multiple research firms suggests that consumers on average still wait at least two years to upgrade to new smartphones. Piper Jaffray, the investment firm, estimates that only 10 percent of iPhone owners are annual upgraders, though it expects that number to grow to 75 percent by the end of 2018.\nIt\u2019s no wonder annual upgraders are a small group: As this column illustrates, early upgrade plans can be confusing and, in some ways, intimidating.\nAs far as upgrades go, I\u2019m an advocate for cherishing items for as long as possible. Aftertesting the iPhone 6sfor a few weeks and switching back to my iPhone 6, I am still just as satisfied with the older device.\n\u201cWhy do we constantly need new things?\u201d said Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts for people to repair products. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we be happy with what we have?\u201d"

        "fulltext": "\nQ.I upgraded my PC laptop to Windows 10 and ever since my computer doesn\u2019t have any sound. How do I get my audio back?\nA.Upgrading a computer from an older version of Windows can sometimes damage the system\u2019s device drivers, including the one for the sound card. To grab a new copy of the driver software, go to the Start menu\u2019s search box, enter Device Manager and open it when it pops up in the results list.\nNext, in the \u201cSound, video and game controllers\u201d area, look for the name of your computer\u2019s sound card. Depending on your model, you may see hardware fromCreative Labs,Intelor another company listed. Click the Driver tab there and choose Update Driver.\nWindows should look around and install a new version of the driver. If the system reports that it cannot find a driver for your sound card, go to the support area of the company\u2019s website and see if there is an updated driver there to download.\nUninstalling the driver \u2014 and then having Windows 10 reinstall it for you \u2014 is another option. Go back to the Device Manager box, right-click the audio driver and choose Uninstall; if you have a touch-screen device, press and hold the driver to get the Uninstall option from the menu. Restart your computer, and Windows will try to reinstall it for you.\nIf that maneuver fails as well, Microsoft suggests installing the generic High Definition Audio Device driver, which you can choose in the Device Manager when you use the Update Driver option. Instead of letting Windows look for the driver, choose the path that lets you search the computer and pick a driver from a list.\nSound problems in Windows 10 are not uncommon, and Microsoft has prepareda page of resourcesthat includes a series ofvideo tutorialsandtroubleshooting tools. You can find it all atwindows.microsoft.com/support.\nSpeaking to Siri\nQ.I thought Siri on the iPhone was supposed to just answer if you said, \u201cHey Siri,\u201d but I still have to press the button. Why?\nA.Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant software, will respond without you having to hold down the Home button \u2014 under certain conditions. If you do not have one of the newest models, (the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus), youneed to have the phone plugged into a power sourceto summon Siri solely by voice.\nThe \u201cHey Siri\u201d option also needs to be enabled on your iPhone. To check in iOS 9, open the Settings icon on the Home screen. On the Settings screen, tap General, then Siri and flip the switch next to allow \u201cHey Siri.\u201d After a short \u201cHey Siri\u201d training session, you should be ready to go.\nTIP OF THE WEEKThe convenience of an e-reader has helped many people fit more books into their lives. For planning purposes, Amazon\u2019s Kindle software can often provide an estimated time it takes to read a particular title. With the book (or sample chapter) open on the screen, select the Menu button and then choose About This Book to see the typical amount of time needed to read the entire thing.\nThe About This Book option is available on Amazon\u2019se-reader appsfor other mobile devices such as some of its newer Kindle hardware like thePaperwhitemodel. When you are reading a Kindle book on a touch-screen device, you can tap the screen to cycle throughseveral progress indicatorsat the bottom of the page, including the percentage of the book read, the number of pages left, the estimated time still needed to finish the chapter or to complete the whole book."

        "fulltext": "Appleon Tuesday turned inanother quarter of enviable revenue and profit growth, fueled by sales of theiPhone. But the results raised a perennial question for the world\u2019s most valuable company: How can it keep its growth streak alive?\nThe issue was stoked by Apple\u2019s muted forecast for its all-important holiday quarter, as well as the unwillingness of Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, to go into detail in an earnings conference call about how Apple plans to rev up sales next year.\nOver all, Apple posted a profit of $11.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $51.5 billion, up 22 percent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates.\nYet while the performance was bolstered by sales of the iPhone \u2014 Apple said that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 39 million in the same period last year \u2014 the company was more cautious about sales for the key holiday sales period.\nApple projected revenue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year quarter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell below Wall Street estimates and would amount to anemic growth of less than 4 percent from a year ago. The last time Apple\u2019s quarterly sales fell below 4 percent was in mid-2013.\nWhen asked on the earnings call about Apple\u2019s growth prospects in 2016, Mr. Cook also said, \u201cWe don\u2019t guide beyond a quarter.\u201d\nApple\u2019s stock price, which had initially risen after the earnings results, later ended up flat.\nThe growth question is a quandary created by Apple\u2019s own success. The company has gotten investors accustomed to double-digit growth rates and enormous profit. That sets a high bar for Apple to clear each time and creates tough comparisons to beat later. Apple\u2019s holiday quarter last year was enormous, driven by the unveiling of the larger-screen iPhone 6 Plus, analysts said, making it difficult to compare to this time around.\nTo keep up this kind of growth, analysts said Apple had only a few levers to pull: Attract more first-time customers, get more people to switch from rival Android-based phones and continue to grow in China.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get great visibility into the central question that we have about Apple,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cCan the iPhone grow in fiscal 2016?\u201d\nMr. Cook for the most part shrugged off the growth question. In the conference call, he said Apple\u2019s full fiscal year revenue growth was equivalent to that of almost 90 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500. Apple delivered \u201ca strong finish to a very strong year,\u201d even with a strong dollar that has forced the company to raise prices in many of its markets around the world, he said.\nApple is going into 2016 with a full slate of refreshed products. In late September, the company introduced its newest iPhone models,the 6s and 6s Plus. It also announced a largeriPad, the iPad Pro, and will begin shipping a new Apple TV this week.\nWhile the iPhone continues to grow, the iPad has been facing declines. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPad sales dropped 20 percent from a year ago, making it the seventh consecutive quarter that sales of the tablet have slipped. The company is increasingly positioning the iPad as a business device.\nThe company did not break out sales of the Apple Watch, whichdebuted in April. But the category called \u201cother products\u201d \u2014 which includes the watch \u2014 posted $3 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the previous quarter, which was the first quarter that included sales of the device.\nBen Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the numbers for the \u201cother\u201d category were in line with his expectations, and implied somewhere between 3.5 million and four million watches were sold over the quarter.\nOne of Apple\u2019s fastest-growing markets \u2014 China \u2014 continued to grow. Sales in the region that Apple calls Greater China jumped 99 percent in the quarter to $12.5 billion. The region remained the company\u2019s second-largest market after the Americas, accounting for 24 percent of sales in the quarter, compared with 13.7 percent a year ago. Investors have been scrutinizing the China business given that the country has been cutting interest rates to shore up a slowing economy.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, also told investors that the company had $206 billion in cash, up $3 billion from last quarter, and that 91 percent of that money was held outside of the United States.\nApple also said that it would pay investors a cash dividend of 52 cents a share. Over the last few years, Apple has taken advantage of low interest rates toborrow billions of dollarsthat it has redistributed to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and stock buybacks."
