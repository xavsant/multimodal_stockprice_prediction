        "title": "As the Streaming Wars Heat Up, Ryan Murphy Cashes In",
        "fulltext": "The battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance.\nThe effect of the digital disrupters on the Hollywood economy had its big reveal in August when Netflix announced a multiyear agreementworth an estimated $100 millionwith the producer Shonda Rhimes, who had made her name at Disney\u2019s ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d\nIn November, Apple \u2014 a new entrant in the streaming wars \u2014 beat out Showtime and Netflix for a series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as morning talk show hosts. The cost? An estimated$240 million for 20 episodes.\nThat same month, Amazon Studios entered the mass-market arena in dramatic fashion bypledging to spend some $200 millionon a series based on \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Previously, it had been following a please-the-critics strategy heavy on midbudget fare from directors like Todd Haynes, Richard Linklater and Jill Soloway.\nIn this overheated atmosphere, Ryan Murphy, the 52-year-old producer behind critical and commercial hits like \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d found himself in the final months of his contract with 21st Century Fox, his longtime corporate home. He took full advantage of the shifting Hollywood economy on Tuesday, agreeing to leave Fox for Netflix and its offer of a five-year dealvalued at roughly $300 million.\nMr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks.\nTed Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201d\nThat statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.\nJump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might bysigning David Lettermanto a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series,giving Chris Rocka reported $40 million for two standup specials andhanding Jerry Seinfelda reported $100 million for his interview program, \u201cComedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,\u201d and standup shows.\nDana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.\n\u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201d\nRick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.\n\u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201d\nAnother competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.\nApple is the wild card. The company has been buying projects at breakneck speed as it begins to shell out more than $1 billion on original programming. And as Amazon moves into the internationally friendly fantasy genre with \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d it has equipped itself with fresh leadership in the person of the respected NBC executiveJennifer Salke. (Earlier this month, she replaced Roy Price, whoresigned as the head of Amazon Studiosin October after he was accused of sexual harassment.)\nWith the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.\nPending governmental approval, Disneywill acquiremuch of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December.CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner \u2014 a deal that is in jeopardy because of alawsuit filed by the Justice Departmentto block it on antitrust grounds.\nThe mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.\n\u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201d\nMr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.\nDisney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.\nThe day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).\n\u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.\nThe money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d\nThe Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.\nAnd it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.\n\u201cAll Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,\u201d said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children. \u201cHe loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched \u2018The OA\u2019 and loved it, he loved\u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him.\u201d\nThe question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said."

        "title": "Amazon and Apple Gush Over Holiday Sales",
        "fulltext": "SEATTLE \u2014 For Apple and Amazon, the holidays are the time to shine, the period when shoppers have the greatest appetite to buy their devices and, in Amazon\u2019s case, anything else that can be stuffed into a box and delivered to homes.\nDuring the final few months of last year, neither disappointed.\nBoth companies singled out the booming sales of their devices in the quarterly financial results that they reported on Thursday. Apple boasted of itshighest revenue everfor a new lineup of iPhones, which included the high-priced iPhone X.Amazon raved about the demand for gadgetslike the Echo, which runs its intelligent voice assistant, Alexa.\n\u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said. \"We don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d\nAmazon, a company once known for routinely posting losses, more than doubled its profit thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing division and a newer business for the company \u2014 advertising. It also benefited from a large gain resulting from changes to the United States tax code.\nFor the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, net income rose to $1.86 billion, the highest profit in its history and more than double the $749 million from a year earlier. A big part of the increase, $789 million, came from the tax benefit. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $60.45 billion from a year earlier.\nAmazon\u2019s shares soared nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results. \u201cAmazon\u2019s best-in-class large-cap growth story remains unchanged,\u201d Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.\nWhile Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.\nYet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.\nBy far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.\nAmazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.\nApple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.\nFor the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.\nWhile Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers.The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.\n\u201cCustomer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\nMr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.\nThe company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.\nSales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, whichincludes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.\nApple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.\nApple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.\nDespite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple wasslashing productionof the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.\nBut in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.\nLast month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that in light of the new tax code, the company would announce plans for its repatriated cash, including dividends and buybacks, in April."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s HomePod Has Arrived. Don\u2019t Rush to Buy It.",
        "fulltext": "On my second day with Apple\u2019s new HomePod, I asked the artificially intelligent speaker to play some music. Siri, the virtual assistant that powers HomePod, enthusiastically replied, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s get going with some Dashboard Confessional.\u201d\nI cringed. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody likes Dashboard Confessional.\u201d\nSiri replied, \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t find the song \u2018Nobody Likes Dashboard Confessional.\u2019\u201d Then to my horror, HomePod continued playing a track by theemo rock band.\nAt the time, I gave Siri a pass. After all, Apple\u2019s HomePod, a rival to smart speakers from Amazon and Google, is supposed to study your music preferences over time to create special playlists just for you. I had had only one day with HomePod.\nBut after a week \u2014 during which I asked HomePod to play my favorite tunes from artists like Beck, Talking Heads and David Bowie \u2014 the smart speaker still did not learn. Instead, like a stubborn D.J., Siri kept playing music by artists outside my music palette: Taylor Swift and Leroy Francis, to name just two.\nThat leads to my conclusion: The $349 HomePod, which costs roughly three times as much as its competitors and arrives in stores on Friday, is tough to recommend to you, dear reader.\nApple\u2019s speaker is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. Audiophiles will appreciate that it has a woofer with a custom amplifier and seven tweeters. The result is a speaker with a deep bass and rich treble that is loud enough to fill a large room with superb sound. HomePod makes the Amazon Echo and Google\u2019s Home sound muffled and tinny in comparison.\nBut Siri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it. Siri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.\nFor Apple, that\u2019s unfortunate. The company was the first to bring virtual assistants to the mainstream withSiri on the iPhone in 2011, but it has since fallen behind Amazon and Google with smart speakers. Appleannounced HomePodlast June \u2014 but thendelayed its releaseuntil this year.\nEven now, Apple is shipping the HomePod unfinished. On Day 1, the device will lack some cool features, like the ability to link several HomePods to create a multiroom sound system that Apple says will fill an entire home with music. That feature will come in a software update later this year.\nAnd there are other limitations: The HomePod requires an iOS device, like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch, to set it up. To use your voice commands to play music, you will also need to subscribe to Apple\u2019s streaming music service, Apple Music.\nSo how exactly did I reach my conclusion on HomePod? I tested it side by side with Echo and Home smart speakers, grading them on their ability to accomplish 14 tasks across several categories, including music, productivity, commuting, home automation and cooking. Let me walk you through the process and results.\nI started picking the 14 tasks by reading up on research studies that looked athow people use virtual assistants in the home. Activate, a management consulting firm, found the majority of people turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather and set a timer.\nApple also provided statistics on smart speaker usage from the research firm Parks Associates. That report also found that playing music and getting the weather were the top uses of smart speakers, while roughly 20 percent of people enjoyed using them for tasks like accessing a calendar and searching for recipes.\nAmazon says most of its Echo customers use at least one \u201cskill,\u201d or third-party app. So I added the ability to use Uber, the most popular ride-hailing service, as a test.\nNow onward to the tests themselves.\nI set up a HomePod, an Echo and a Home in my house and began with a battery of question-and-answer sessions. First up: traffic.\nAll the speakers gave a similar traffic estimate for a drive to San Jose, Calif. \u2014 roughly a one-hour drive on the freeway. But when I asked HomePod to summon a car from Uber, Siri responded, \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t help with rides here.\u201d\nThe other speakers were happy to help \u2014 so I followed up with: \u201cHey, Siri, what gives?\u201d HomePod\u2019s colorful touch screen lit up to show it had heard my question, but Siri remained silent.\nNext, it was time for some cooking questions. All the speakers were able to flawlessly set a kitchen timer. But when I asked HomePod how to make pasta, Siri blanked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t get the answer to that on HomePod.\u201d\nGoogle Home was more responsive \u2014 it gave me the steps for making pasta from the recipe siteGenius Kitchen. Amazon Echo was even more accommodating. Alexa listed the ingredients for a pasta dish, including noodles, milk and heavy cream, and offered to send the steps to my phone or play them aloud.\nThen it was time to move on to some work-related tasks. I asked Siri to schedule a meeting for Tuesday. Siri responded: \u201cI cannot access your calendar from here. Sorry about that.\u201d It couldn\u2019t look at my calendar for the day, either. Google Home and Amazon Echo, in contrast, managed to schedule new events and read my calendar for the day: a meeting in the morning, followed by a photo shoot and a business dinner in the evening.\nWhen I asked Apple about Siri\u2019s hiccups, the company said that for the first version of HomePod, it focused on including tasks that people use smart speakers for the most, like playing music and asking about the weather, and that it would continue to evaluate what other features to add over time.\nI wondered whether HomePod would do better with home tasks and decided to ask all the smart speakers to turn on a Wi-Fi-connected light bulb from the smart light company Lifx. In this test, HomePod got a higher score because setting up the smart light, which involved using the iPhone camera to scan a code on the instruction manual, was seamless and much easier than it was with Google Home and Amazon Echo, which required installing a third-party app.\nBonus: The light turned on when I asked.\nOne of the most crucial tests for HomePod had to do with audio. That\u2019s because Apple has long emphasized that the smart speaker is first and foremost a music player.\nPhil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing, said at a gathering at the company\u2019s audio lab last week that Apple started developing HomePod six years ago with the intention of making a speaker that specialized in playing music in a unique way. The project started well before Apple introduced other services like Apple Music, which was released in 2015, and HomeKit, the home automation platform that was unveiled in 2014, he added.\nMr. Schiller said Apple wanted to stay true to the original goal of the project \u201cwithout ever compromising that it\u2019s a speaker first.\u201d\nAll three speakers did great playing music. Echo, Google\u2019s Home and HomePod were each able to play specific songs by artists, generate playlists for specific artists or music genres, and play podcasts. HomePod got a higher score in audio with its superior sound quality factored in.\nYet that\u2019s also where Dashboard Confessional came in and where HomePod\u2019s biggest shortcomings became apparent. Whenever I asked HomePod to \u201cplay some music,\u201d it never played music that was relevant to my preferences or listening history.\nThat wasn\u2019t the case with the Google and Amazon speakers. When I asked those speakers to play music, the gadgets simply resumed what I was last playing on Spotify, which was satisfying.\nSiri also had laughably awkward pronunciations of some artist names. When I once asked HomePod to play songs by Tupac, Siri replied: \u201cSure, here\u2019s Tu,\u201d and after a short pause said: \u201cPac.\u201d (I\u2019m not sure Dr. Dre or Jimmy Iovine, whose streaming service wasacquired by Appleto develop Apple Music, would approve.)\nIn response to my concerns, Apple said HomePod studies a customer\u2019s music preferences over time. I figured a week should have been enough.\nFrom the tests, I graded the speakers on their ability to accomplish each task on a scale from 0 to 4. (I gave a 0 for tasks that could not be done at all, a 2 for tasks that could be done with some issues, and a 4 for tasks that could be completed flawlessly.)\nSo how did they all stack up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0? The final results:\n\u25a0 Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 3.4\n\u25a0 Google\u2019s Home \u2014 3.1\n\u25a0 Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 2.9"

        "title": "What I Learned from Watching My iPad\u2019s Slow Death",
        "fulltext": "My old iPad just turned five, and it\u2019s starting to die. If it could wonder about such things, it might question this prognosis. Its memory, after all, still retrieves information as quickly as it ever did. Its face hasn\u2019t aged a day, projecting as vividly as it did in 2012, when Apple called it \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cgorgeous.\u201d It hasn\u2019t suffered vision loss; the camera still works. The touch-screen works. Buttons work. Speaker, headphone jack, charging port: All still do what I ask of them. On examination, almost nothing about the device seems to have changed. And yet it\u2019s starting to give up, and so am I.\nI\u2019ve lost plenty of devices before, but this death feels different. When my old iPad is powered down, it seems practically new; when I turn it on, it feels instantly old. Tap the familiar YouTube app, and I am met with a pregnant pause: one, two, three,app. Ditto for the App Store, Podcasts, Netflix and e-books. Newer games are often out of the question, which wouldn\u2019t bother me much if Safari, the web browser, wasn\u2019t constantly overwhelmed by complicated pages. My attempt to install an alternative browser ended with this message: Firefox requires iOS 10.3 or later. My old iPad stopped getting updates in the 9s. I wouldn\u2019t say my old electronics always aged gracefully, but their obsolescence wasn\u2019t a death sentence. My old digital camera doesn\u2019t do what some new cameras do \u2014 but it\u2019s still a camera. My iPad, by contrast, feels as though it has been abandoned from on high, cut loose from the cloud on which it depends.\nIt hasn\u2019t been used up; it\u2019s just too old. A pristine iPad from the same era, forgotten in a storeroom and never touched, would be equally useless. The moment it came online, it would demand to be updated; as soon as it was, it would find itself in the same grim predicament as my device, which has been at work for half a decade.\nIf my old iPad could talk, it might ask me what has changed. If it could feel indignant, it might suggest thatitisn\u2019t the problem, and that everyone and everything else is. While it would be wrong according to the logic of its creation, it wouldn\u2019t be incorrect. It is a piece of consumer technology, so you would expect that everything around it \u2014 its own software, Apple\u2019s new products, the internet on which it depends \u2014 would have improved in the last five years, and that it would suffer in comparison. What seems unfair is that my old iPad, because it does nothing but provide access to these ever-evolving services, necessarilyhasto get worse and that it may, before long, have nowhere to go. Above all, my old iPad has revealed itself as a cursed object of a modern sort. It wears out without wearing. It breaks down without breaking. And it will be left for dead before it dies.\nMy old iPad is,to be precise, a late-2012 iPad Mini, model number A1432, black, with 16 gigabytes of storage. It retailed, at release, for $329. It has a few scratches and a couple of flat spots on its metal edges, where it made contact with one hard surface or another, but it\u2019s otherwise the same thin, shiny slate that I popped out of its plastic packaging five years ago. It isn\u2019t worn in; in fact, it has acquired no physical character at all. In many ways, it\u2019s the exact opposite of a baseball mitt in its resistance to sentiment and nostalgia. It exists in memory, barely, as a sort of rectangular green screen, disappearing completely until I remember that it had to have been there. It has been present for the entirety of my relationship with my wife but holds no special significance to us. It has been handled by every member of my immediate family, not all of whom are still alive, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what any of them did with it. The device seems to repel whatever personal experiences it is exposed to; it has a coating on its screen that resists fingerprints.\nFifteen years ago, before I would replace a desktop computer or a laptop, it would have quite conspicuously broken down, its fans getting louder, its spinning hard drive grinding to a halt. When I would replace it with something newer or faster or more capable, it would enter a promising second life: it could be repurposed as a spare, a computer for a friend, a terminal for playing old games or for doing undistracted work. It could be given to someone who could make use of it.\nAs I did when I first got it, I still use my old iPad for passive consumption: reading, watching videos, checking feeds. My routine has barely changed, but one by one, formerly easy tasks have become strained. Social apps have become slow, videos take longer to load and Safari can\u2019t seem to handle the most important and fundamental services of the modern web.\nAs my iPad has aged, I\u2019ve started to notice it more, not because I\u2019m growing fonder, but because I\u2019m getting frustrated: by the fact that it won\u2019t do what it ought to or even what it used to. But what I find most frustrating of all is the gradual disappearance of all options other than buying a new iPad. I understand the reasons for this. I understand the concept of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d less as a conspiracy than as the unfortunate but universal prerogative of dominant, profit-driven companies that make their money from selling hardware.\nIn a world more accommodating toward my old iPad, I might squeeze another five years out of it by replacing the one part of these devices that tends to fail: the battery. I could purchase a kit from a site like iFixit, with a fresh battery and tools to pry my iPad apart, for $39.99. But the repair is quite involved and requires, among 71 other steps, heating up the device in order to pry its screen free of its glue. I could send it to Apple, which says out-of-warranty iPad battery service is $99 plus $6.95 in shipping plus local taxes, which totals more than I would get if I sent it to an Apple partner called Brightstar to be \u201crecycled\u201d: a $45 gift card to the Apple store. Lower down the rung is Gazelle, a company that buys old devices and resells them, often abroad. A tool on their website offered me $30, conditionally.\nBut the iPad was never really meant to be tinkered with, examined or torn open and modified. When it first appeared, Steve Jobs pitched it as essentially a portal: a simple tool for consumption, as useful and wonderful as the seemingly infinite things that might manifest on its screen. This was accurate on more than one level. It was a tool for consumption, sure, but it was also a consumable. Early criticism of the device, which was minor and muffled by enormous sales, focused on the few things that made it noticeable, like its weight or the size of the black border around its screen. (The iPad Mini was an answer to both complaints.) It was, in contrast to the iPhone from which it descended, understood by its users as simply good enough \u2014 not life-changing, but handy. It was to be used until its users started noticing it, at which point it was to be replaced. It was, like the iPhone, immune to attachment. But unlike the iPhones, which might be reclaimed by a cellular carrier as part of a scheduled trade-in or just shoved aside by a two-year upgrade, iPads tend to linger. They have time to reveal their tragicthingness.\nPerhaps the best option is to sell my old iPad overseas to a consumer who understands what it is: not quite an iPad, but nevertheless a machine that will still chat, that will manage FaceTime, that can receive email or maybe take payments for a shop. But before long, it will lose the ability to do these things. It will still be a wonder of industrial design and a technological marvel, right up until the moment it is destroyed for scrap."

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: HomePod Whiffs, but Elon Musk Does Not",
        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, The Times\u2019s technology columnist, reviewsthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis (and maybe a joke or two) about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nGood morning! Let\u2019s talk about tech.\nThe HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!\nApple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.\nBut most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.\nWhat does it do well? It sounds great. Every reviewer \u2014 among themNilay Patel at The Verge,Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journalandmy New York Times colleague Brian X. Chen\u2014 found that HomePod beat Echo, Google Home and a comparable Sonos device in audio quality.\nWhat doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.\nAnd most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.\nNone of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.\nTravis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201d\nThese are the highlights fromWaymo\u2019s big trade-secrets lawsuit against Uber, which, after months of legal maneuvering, finally hit a San Francisco courtroom this week. Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder and ousted C.E.O., was the first high-profile witness to take the stand.\nAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?\nThe trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.\nI\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.\nHere\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.\nBut this week \u2014 surprise! \u2014Snap reported robust revenueand user growth, and Twitter posted itsfirst quarterly profitas a public company.\nElon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla,launched a huge rocket into space! Not only that, but he also put a cherry red Tesla in it, and a mannequin wearing a space suit inside the Tesla. The whole thing will orbit the sun.\nThere\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars. (As my colleague Kenneth Chang explained in this family-friendly newspaper about B.F.R.: \u201cThe B stands for big; the R for rocket.\u201d)\nBut let\u2019s forget the serious stuff for a second. Look at the video of the Tesla\u2019s flight. What a world!\nFarhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column calledState of the Art. You can follow him on Twitter here:@fmanjoo."

        "title": "In an Era of \u2018Smart\u2019 Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better",
        "fulltext": "It still feels magical to light up your living room by saying \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d But with all the hype surrounding so-called smart things \u2014 everyday devices that are connected to the internet \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget that sometimes the dumb stuff is just better.\nTech companies are adding internet connections to just about everything you can imagine so that they can be controlled with smart speakers or phones. Thermostats, surveillance cameras, mosquito zappers, coffee makers \u2014 you name it.\nAnd smart devices are becoming more popular. In 2017,15 percent of American householdsowned a home automation device, up from 10 percent in April 2016, according to NPD Group, a research firm.\nBut before we get carried away setting up the Wi-Fi connections on all our appliances, lights and fashion accessories, let me play Luddite for a second. Some of the most mundane devices are designed to accomplish a simple task extremely well \u2014 and in some cases they still execute those duties better than their high-tech brethren.\nSo let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate some of the best dumb things. Here are my top picks.\nThe Apple Watch, by all measures, is a hit. Thelatest iteration of the Apple Watch, called Series 3, is fast, water-resistant and versatile with long battery life, making it a superb smart watch for tracking your fitness activity.\nYet a normal wristwatch is still superior at one crucial task: Telling the time.\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s screen wakes up when you tilt your wrist at an angle, which indicates you are trying to check the time. That helps conserve battery life. But any Apple Watch wearer is familiar with situations where this feature gets frustrating.\nWhile riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you\u2019re standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you\u2019re in a meeting and want to see if you\u2019re staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn\u2019t very subtle.\nUntil the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.\nMany cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.\nThesesmart car systemsare designed to seamlessly work with your smartphone. Plugging in an iPhone, for example, loads a screen of apps like Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple\u2019s podcast app, which you can then control on the console or with Siri instead of fiddling with your smartphone screen.\nThe problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you\u2019re out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.\nIn addition, if your smart car system needs a major software update, some car brands are lagging in allowing you to download and install the updates yourself. Instead, they require you to bring the car to the dealer and pay for the updates to be installed there. General Motors, for example, has for years declined to offer so-called over-the-air updates and will only say itplans to support them before 2020.\nUsing aphone mountis a cheap and simple solution that is far less frustrating. You just attach the mount to the dash, a CD player slot or an air conditioning vent, mount your phone and plug it into apower chargervia the accessories port.\nVoil\u00e0, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?\nAmazon recently introduced theEcho Spot, a smart alarm clock with a touch-screen and the Alexa virtual assistant. A less desirable feature is a built-in camera for placing video calls.\nA camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It\u2019s like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.\nAmazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren\u2019t using it. But it\u2019s an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.\nSo if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.\nOne of the mostcommon uses of Amazon\u2019s Echois to set a kitchen timer. Just say \u201cAlexa, set a timer for 80 minutes\u201d while you\u2019re busy chopping vegetables.\nBut there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.\nCooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer \u2014 either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons \u2014 can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it\u2019s quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.\nYou can also constantly see how much time is left on the timer, whereas with the Echo, you have to open a smartphone app to see the remaining time or ask Alexa to tell you how much time is left. Over the long term, using a smart speaker as a timer gets tedious.\nWhen people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen. There, the ancient tablet gets mounted to the refrigerator with a magnet and becomes a glorified recipe reader.\nHaving tried this experiment, it\u2019s a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged. And if you want to double or halve a recipe, you have to do some mental math, which makes multitasking more challenging when you are busy in the kitchen.\nPrinting out or jotting down a recipe on a piece of paper is just simpler. You can easily scribble additional notes, like changes and improvements to the recipe. Assuming you have decent handwriting, it\u2019s easy to read the steps and ingredients.\nAnd if it gets covered in food, you can just throw it away."

        "title": "Should You Get a Cheaper Phone? Be Sure to Look Into the Camera",
        "fulltext": "The evolution of the smartphone can be summed up by two trends: Phones just keep getting bigger. They are also getting pricier.\nThe chief examples are phones from Apple and Samsung Electronics, the top handset makers. Samsung this week introduced theGalaxy S9, its new flagship smartphone, with starting prices of about $720 and, for a slightly larger screen, $840. Years ago, Galaxy phones started at about $650.\nApple\u2019s iPhone prices are also increasing. Last year, Apple released theiPhone 8for $699, up from the $649 starting price of earlier iPhones. In addition, the company introduced theiPhone X, its first premium-tier handset, for $999.\nRising prices make the smartphone one of the most expensive household products. But unlike televisions, which plummet in price and attract bargain hunters, many consumers are willing to up their spending on phones.\n\u201cThey become more and more essential to people\u2019s everyday life, so price sensitivity just continues to erode,\u201d said Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm.\nYet plenty of people don\u2019t want to splurge on a fancy phone every few years. Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer, was theNo.3 phone makerin the fourth quarter last year, IDC, a research firm, said. Sales of cheaper Honor smartphones and other low-end devices contributed to the company\u2019s growth.\nAnd there\u2019s a silver lining for those who want to spend less: Cheaper smartphones have never been better. If you spend between $200 and $300, you can get a capable, fast smartphone for basic tasks like placing calls, using maps and sending texts. Of course, there are trade-offs, like lower-quality screens and less impressive cameras.\nIs a budget phone right for you? Here\u2019s an overview on the pros and cons of going cheap, with some phone recommendations from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.\nLet\u2019s start with the downsides of buying a cheaper phone.\n\u25a0 You won\u2019t get the best camera. Budget phones lack the advanced camera sensors found on high-end smartphones. So if you go cheap, your phone camera probably won\u2019t be very fast, won\u2019t do a great job at taking photos in low light and will lack features like optical image stabilization, which helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. \u201dThe camera is a big one,\u201d said Andrew Cunningham, a Wirecutter editor. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking photos, especially in low light, performance is going to fall off a cliff.\u201d\n\u25a0 Obviously, you won\u2019t get cutting-edge features like the infrared face recognition system on the iPhone X or the fancy stylus on Samsung\u2019s big-screen Galaxy Note. You also won\u2019t get the fastest computing processor, so your phone won\u2019t be as capable of running games with heavy graphics.\n\u25a0 You also won\u2019t get the brightest and most vibrant display. The fanciest smartphones have OLED screens, which have better color accuracy and contrast.\n\u25a0 You won\u2019t get many software updates, which are important because they introduce new features and security enhancements. For phone makers, the priority is issuing big software updates to more powerful smartphones. At best, with a cheap Android phone you will probably get one major software update and a few security updates over 18 months.\nWith all that said, there are plenty of benefits to buying a good budget phone.\n\u25a0 You will get a decent camera. Many cheaper phones have high-resolution sensors that can take clear, rich photos. \u201cA cheap phone today is going to have a better camera than a cheap phone from three years ago,\u201d said Nathan Edwards, a senior editor for Wirecutter. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re truly awful.\u201d\n\u25a0 You\u2019ll get a good enough screen for reading websites, watching videos and looking at photos. Budget phones still use LCD, an older display technology that has greatly matured and still looks quite good.\n\u25a0 Your phone will be fast enough for important tasks like placing calls, sending and receiving email, browsing the web and running lightweight apps. If you aren\u2019t an app-aholic or a gamer, maybe that is all you will need.\nSo here\u2019s the upshot. There is a strong argument for spending more on your smartphone: If it is your most important technology tool for work and play, you should probably invest in a superior device. But if you want a phone only for basic tasks and you\u2019re not in a hurry to adopt the latest and greatest technology, a cheaper phone may serve you well.\nNow comes the tough part: picking a good budget phone and avoiding the duds. Wirecutter tested 20 of thebest budget smartphonesover the last few years to highlight a few. Expect to spend roughly $200.\nWirecutter\u2019s top budget phone isMotorola\u2019s Moto G5 Plus, which costs about $230. It has a high-quality camera, a good 5.2-inch screen, a fast fingerprint sensor and plenty of storage. The device also comes unlocked, meaning it works with all American carriers. (If you want to spend a bit more, you could buy the Moto X4, which is water-resistant and on sale for $300, down from $400.)\nWirecutter also highlighted Huawei\u2019s $200Honor 7X, which has a better camera and bigger screen than the Moto G5 Plus. The downside is it runs an older version of the Android operating system, called Nougat.\nAnother option, if you prefer iPhones, is to buy an older iPhone model. Apple is still selling theiPhone 6s, introduced in 2015, which is reasonably fast with a nice camera and a good screen. It costs $449 through Apple, but you may find it much cheaper elsewhere. What\u2019s more, Apple typically supports its iPhones for about five years, so the 6s should continue to get software updates through 2020.\n\u201cA lot of things you\u2019d have to pay 600 or 700 bucks for three or four years ago, you\u2019ll get for $200 or less now,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cIf you just want the basics, a budget phone is going to do just fine for most people.\u201d"

        "title": "How Tiny Red Dots Took Over Your Life",
        "fulltext": "As the ranks of tech-industry critics have expanded, it has become harder to tell what common ground they occupy. Across various political divides, there is a sense that Facebook, Twitter and Google exert too much influence on the national discourse; closely connected to this is the widespread concern that we users have developed an unhealthful relationship with our phones, or with the apps on them. But on any more specific claim than that, consensus becomes impossible. The sudden arrival of a new class of tech skeptic, the industry apostate, has only complicated the discussion. Late last year, the co-inventor of the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d Justin Rosenstein, called it a \u201cbright ding of pseudopleasure\u201d; in January, the investment firm Jana Partners, a shareholder in Apple, wrote a letter to the company warning that its products \u201cmay be having unintentional negative consequences.\u201d\nAll but conjuring Oppenheimer at White Sands, these critics offer broadsides, warning about addictive design tricks and profit-driven systems eroding our humanity. But it\u2019s hard to discern a collective message in their garment-rending: Is it design that needs fixing? Tech? Capitalism? This lack of clarity may stem from the fact that these people are not ideologues but reformists. They tend to believe that companies should be more responsible \u2014 and users must be, too. But with rare exceptions, the reformists stop short of asking the uncomfortable questions: Is it possible to reform profit-driven systems that turn attention into money? In such a business, can you even separate addiction from success?\nPerhaps this is unfair \u2014 the reformists are trying. But while we wait for a consensus, or a plan, allow me to suggest a starting point: the dots. Little. Often red. Sometimes with numbers. Commonly seen at the corners of app icons, where they are known in the trade as badges, they are now proliferating across once-peaceful interfaces on a steep epidemic curve. They alert us to things that need to be checked: unread messages; new activities; pending software updates; announcements; unresolved problems. As they\u2019ve spread, they\u2019ve become a rare commonality in the products that we \u2014 and the remorseful technologists \u2014 are so worried about. If not the culprits, the dots are at least accessories to most of the supposed crimes of addictive app design.\nWhen platforms or services sense their users are disengaged, whether from social activities, work or merely a continued contribution to corporate profitability, dots are deployed: outside, inside, wherever they might be seen. I\u2019ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while. These dots are omnipresent, leading everywhere and ending nowhere. So maybe there\u2019s something to be gained by connecting them.\nThe prototypical moderndot \u2014 stop-sign red, with numbers, round, maddening \u2014 was popularized with Mac OS X, the first version of which was released nearly 20 years ago. It was used most visibly as part of Apple\u2019s Mail app, perched atop an icon of a blue postage stamp, in a new and now ever-present dock full of apps. It contained a number representing your unread messages. But it wasn\u2019t until the launch of the iPhone, in 2007, that dots transformed from a simple utility into a way of life \u2014 from a solution into a cause unto themselves.\nThat year, we got the very first glimpse of the iPhone\u2019s home screen, in Steve Jobs\u2019s hand, onstage at MacWorld. It showed three dots, ringed in white: 1 unread text; 5 calls or voice mail messages; 1 email. Jobs set about showing off the apps, opening them, eliminating the dots. Eventually, when the iPhone was opened to outside developers, badge use accelerated. As touch-screen phones careered toward ubiquity, and as desktop interfaces and website design and mobile operating systems huddled together around a crude and adapting set of visual metaphors, the badge was ascendant.\nOn Windows desktop computers, they tended to be blue and lived in the lower right corner. On BlackBerrys, red, with a white asterisk in the middle. On social media, in apps and on websites, badge design was more creative, appearing as little speech bubbles or as rectangles. They make appearances on Facebook and across Google products, perhaps most notoriously on the ill-fated Google Plus social network, where blocky badges were filled with inexplicably, desperately high numbers. (This tactic has since spread, obnoxiously, to news sites and, inexplicably, to comment sections.) Android itself has remained officially unbadged, but the next version of the operating system, called Oreo, will include them by default, completing their invasion.\nWhat\u2019s so powerful about the dots is that until we investigate them, they could signify anything: a career-altering email; a reminder that Winter Sales End Soon; a match, a date, a \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d The same badge might lead to word that Grandma\u2019s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don\u2019t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat.\nNew and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties. Dots are deceptively, insidiously simple: They are either there or they\u2019re not; they contain a number, and that number has a value. But they imbue whatever they touch with a spirit of urgency, reminding us that behind each otherwise static icon is unfinished business. They don\u2019t so much inform us or guide us as correct us: You\u2019re looking there, but you should be looking here. They\u2019re a lawn that must be mowed. Boils that must be lanced, or at least scabs that itch to be picked. They\u2019re Bubble Wrap laid over your entire digital existence.\nTo their credit, the big tech companies seem to be aware of the problem, at least in the narrow terms of user experience. In Google\u2019s guide for application developers, the company makes a gentle attempt to pre-empt future senseless dot deployment. \u201cDon\u2019t badge every notification, as there are cases where badges don\u2019t make sense,\u201d the company suggests. Apple, in its guidelines, seems a bit more fed up. \u201cMinimize badging,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t overwhelm users by connecting badging with a huge amount of information that changes frequently. Use it to present brief, essential information and atypical content changes that are highly likely to be of interest.\u201d\nThese companies know better than anyone that dots are a problem, but they also know that dots work. Late last year, a red badge burbled to the surface next to millions of iPhone users\u2019 Settings apps. It looked as though it might be an update, but it turned out to be a demand: Finish adding your credit card to Apple Pay, or the dot stays put. Apple might as well have said: Give us your credit card number, or we will annoy you until you do.\nThe lack of consensus within the mounting resistance to Big Tech can also be found within the perimeter of the dot. After all, it\u2019s where the most dangerous conflations take place: of what we need, and what we\u2019re told we need; of what purpose our software serves to us, and us to it; of dismissal with fulfillment. The dot is where ill-gotten attention is laundered into legitimate-seeming engagement. On this, our most influential tech companies seem to agree. Maybe our self-appointed saviors can, too."
