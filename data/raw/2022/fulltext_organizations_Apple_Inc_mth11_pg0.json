        "fulltext": "As world leaders gather in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, for theCOP27 climate conference, questions about how to deal with the potentially catastrophic effects of global warming have reached a new level of urgency. No less contentious: how to pay for solving the problem, and just how much will businesses be asked to pitch in.\nThe United States is focusing on a new plan for carbon credits,The Financial Times reports. John Kerry, President Biden\u2019s climate envoy, is said to be gathering support for a system in which governments would earn credits for cutting their power sector\u2019s emissions, whichcompanies could then buyto offset their own output.\nCentering the plan on credits is contentious, given criticisms that they don\u2019t always save on emissions. But they have grown in popularity as a tangible way for companies and governments to incentivize reducing carbon output. The F.T. added that Kerry\u2019s plan lacks key details at the moment, even as the Biden administration hopes to announce it at the summit meeting.\nCorporate commitments to addressing climate change already appear uncertain.Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England who now leads the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, said last week that the group\u2019s members wereno longer required to follow a U.N. initiativeto phase out fossil fuels.\nCarney said that members of the coalition, which have a combined $150 trillion in assets, had raised antitrust concerns. Members like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chasehad reportedly worriedthat they could be sued for following global decarbonization pacts.\n(Law firms are facing pressure, too. Republican senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Chuck Grassley of Iowa havesent letters to 51 major firmswarning them of potential antitrust violations for advising clients on environmental, social and governance issues.)\nMeanwhile, Mike Bloomberg is focused on reducing coal use.The billionaire, a special U.N. envoy on climate change, announced a new initiative tohelp developing countries phase out coalby 2040. That would include devising business plans and technical resources to increase the use of clean energy \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t include a new financial commitment.\nOne more thing to watch at the conference: \u201closs and damage,\u201ddiplomacy-speak for ecological reparations to developing countries from the world\u2019s biggest polluters.\u201cFunding arrangements\u201d for loss and damage\u2014 which one study estimates could run up to $580 billion a year by 2030 \u2014 are on the conference\u2019s formal agenda for the first time; reparations would come on top of existing financial commitments by industrialized nations to help poorer ones cope with climate change, which have fallen far short of promised targets.\nRead The Times\u2019s coverage of COP27here.\nApple warns that China\u2019s zero-Covid restrictions could cause an iPhone shortage.The tech giant predictedlonger wait times for high-end iPhone 14 modelsbecause of \u201csignificantly reduced capacity\u201d at a major plant in China that had been shut due to Beijing\u2019s strict zero-Covid policies. Analysts said China wasunlikely to lift its pandemic policiesuntil next year, despite speculation among investors and the damage to the economy.\nMeta is expected to announce job cuts as soon as this week.The social media giant has been looking to rein in costs as advertisers pull back, and its push into the metaverse continues to lose money. Sourcestold The Timesthat the expected job cuts will be the most significant since its founding in 2004.\nKen Griffin backs Gov. Ron DeSantis for president.The billionaire financier and major Republican donor said that he wouldsupport the Florida governorshould he run for the Republican nomination in 2024 \u2014 even over Donald Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to move on to the next generation,\u201d Griffin told Politico.\nMacy\u2019s will invest $30 million in loans for minority-owned businesses.The department-store giant will work with Momentus Capital onfinancing channelsfor independent retail-oriented companies. Total financing under the program will run to $200 million.\nWeek two of the Elon Musk era of Twitter looks as chaotic as ever: The company executed one of the biggest single rounds of layoffs in recent Silicon Valley memory \u2014 and, reportedly, is now worrying that it has cut too deeply \u2014 while Musk is facing a deepening financial hole that he helped dig.\nTwitter has some regrets about its layoffs.The company has reportedly reached out to some of the nearly 3,700 employees it laid off last week,asking them to come back, the journalist and Hard Fork co-host Casey Newton reported over the weekend. Analysts have questioned whether the cuts have left Twitter more vulnerable to cyberattacks, impersonation of users and other challenges.\nThe reversal comes despite Musk explaining that steep cuts were necessary, given that he says Twitter islosing over $4 million a day. The Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey appeared to acknowledge that the cull was probably necessary. \u201cI grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that,\u201dDorsey tweeted.\nTwitter\u2019s new verification plan has been delayed until after the midterms,The Times reports.The movecame just a day afterthe company announcedthat it would begin charging $8 a month to receive a check mark on their profiles, and was born out of worries that users could create verified accounts to pose as politicians, electoral officials or news outlets to spread disinformation.\nYet Twitter has already been cracking down on those impersonator accounts, particularlythose pretending to be Musk\u2019s, including celebrities like thecomedian Kathy Griffin. On Sunday night, the billionaire \u2014 who had previously said \u201ccomedy is now legal\u201d on the platform \u2014 said parody accounts needed to be clearly labeled or risk being permanently suspended.\nMeanwhile, Twitter\u2019s financial woes are deepening.As Musk asserted that his new company is bleeding money, he blamed \u201cactivist groups pressuring advertisers\u201d to at leasttemporarily halt campaignson the platform. (He also threatened a \u201cthermonuclear name & shame\u201d of advertisers who halted spending on the social network.)\nBut advertisers had started to pull the plug on their campaigns before pressure from activists had begun, largely over uncertainty about the company\u2019s future (and indeed, some reportedly did soduringMusk\u2019s call with advertiserslast week).\nOn Sunday a rift broke into the open between Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried, two of the most influential figures in the crypto sector, hitting already battered investors hard.\nZhao, who goes by C.Z., is the founder of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Yesterday, he announced that the company wouldsell off its holdings in FTT, the token of the rival exchange FTX, founded by Bankman-Fried. FTT plunged more than 10 percent at one point on Sunday knocking billions off its market valuation.\n\u201cDue to recent revelations that have came [sic] to light, we have decided to liquidateany remaining FTT on our books,\u201d C.Z.wrote. He didn\u2019t explain his cryptic note, but crypto insiders took it as referring toa recent report in CoinDeskquestioning the finances of Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund, Alameda Research, and the fund\u2019s financial ties to FTX. Binance was an early investor in FTX, and got a sizable chunk of FTT when it exited the company last year. Adding to their ties, Zhao was once a mentor to Bankman-Fried.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to build. Make love (and blockchain), not war,\u201dBankman-Fried \u2014 known as S.B.F. \u2014 wrotein a threadyesterday that noted both his frustration with and respect for C.Z.\nFrustration has been mounting at S.B.F.\u2019s growing stature in Washington.The crypto mogul has become a major political donor and a big influence on congressional thinking about digital assets. He\u2019s a fixture in the nation\u2019s capitallobbying for policy proposalsthat some in the industry say will advance FTX but harm others. A policy piece that he had posted online recently generated fury from all corners of the crypto community, and he quickly walked back some of his positions. But it seems all has not been forgiven.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs,\u201dC.Z. later tweeted. \u201cOnwards.\u201d\nDespite asurprisingly resilient labor market, talk of a downturn is in the air.

A year ago, \u201crecession\u201d was uttered on 42 earnings calls by S&P firms in the entire third quarter.\nEarnings growth has slowed significantly.Profits are up just over 2 percent on average for S&P 500 companies that have reported this quarter, down from 6 percent a quarter ago, according to FactSet, which tracks corporate profits and other market data. Worse, analysts now expect that profits will decline in the fourth quarter for S&P 500 companies, which would be the first time that has happened since the start of the pandemic.\nClimate talks are on the agenda, but so too are politics, profits and inflation.\nTuesday:It\u2019s Election Day.

        "title": "Apple Built Its Empire With China. Now Its Foundation Is Showing Cracks.",
        "fulltext": "Every September, Apple unveils its latest phones at its futuristic Silicon Valley campus. A few weeks later, tens of millions of its newest handsets, assembled by legions of seasonal workers hired by its suppliers, are shipped from Chinese factories to customers around the world.\nThe annual release of Apple\u2019s iPhones usually runs like clockwork, a prime example of how the U.S. tech giant has become the most profitable company of the globalization era by seamlessly navigating the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nBut this year, a smooth rollout for the iPhone 14 was the latest casualty of the growing difficulties of doing business in China. Beijing\u2019s no-holds-barred approach to stopping Covid-19 and heightened tensions with the United States have forced Apple to re-examine major aspects of its business.\nA recent outbreak of coronavirus cases in the region surrounding Apple\u2019s largest iPhone factory, in Zhengzhou, in central China, prompted local officials to order a seven-day lockdown last week. As a result, the company said on Sunday,it will not be able to produce enough phonesto meet the demands of the holiday season.\nFor much of this year, Apple has also been the focus of a bipartisan intervention in Washington, where alarm overBeijing\u2019s military provocationsand technology ambitions has upended orthodoxy about free trade.\nWord trickled out in March that Apple was in talks with an obscure Chinese memory chip maker, Yangtze Memory Technology Corporation, or YMTC, to supply components for the iPhone 14.\nThat collided with work being done by a coalition of lawmakers and more than a dozen congressional aides, which had spent months examining the ins and outs of Apple\u2019s supply chain in China. The Commerce Departmentissued restrictionslast month that prohibited American companies from selling machinery to YMTC, making it difficult for Apple to go ahead with the deal.\nApple has confirmed publicly that it talked with YMTC, which didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. But an Apple spokesman declined to comment when asked if the company had abandoned the possibility of working with the Chinese memory maker.\nThe recent developments underscore how Apple\u2019s close ties to China, once considered a strength of its business, have turned into a liability.\nIt is no coincidence that Apple\u2019s rise from near bankruptcy in the 1990s to the world\u2019s most valuable company has closely followed China\u2019s economic ascent. It pioneered a best-of-both-worlds business model: Products designed in California were assembled inexpensively in China and sold to the country\u2019s growing middle class.\nApple raked in profits as China\u2019s economy roared. But as U.S.-China relations falter, and both governments meddle in Apple\u2019s business, the company has gone from one of globalization\u2019s greatest success stories to a symbol of its fracture.\n\u201cApple is discovering that geopolitics drive business models \u2014 not the other way around,\u201d said Matthew Turpin, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution specializing in U.S. policy toward China. \u201cThis whole collection of supply chain risks are creating a real liability for them.\u201d\nChina\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, hasforced business leaders to reconsider long-held assumptionsabout operating in the country. For several decades, economic growth was the Chinese government\u2019s top priority. But Mr. Xi used an important Communist Party congress last month to make it clear that security issues and the more ideological viewpoints of the party would take precedence over business concerns.\nMr. Xi\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d policy has slowed factory output andthrottled the country\u2019s economic growth, and his government has faced pressure from business leaders and markets to ease the restrictions. But it has not signaled clearly that it will make a change.\nLoosening Covid restrictions could allow Apple to fill some of its supply shortages and meet some demand, but the company will still lose sales this holiday season, said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst with Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm.\nIt would be difficult for Apple to untangle itself from China. The company spent two decades working with manufacturing partners to build enormous factories supported by a vast network of suppliers in the country. Over time, it has added more Chinese components to its products and benefited from their lower prices.\nIn a bid to limit its exposure to China, Apple began manufacturing asmall percentage of its newest iPhones in India. It shifted production of several other products to Vietnam. But both markets offer factories with only tens of thousands of workers \u2014 a small fraction of the scale that Apple enjoys in China, where its manufacturing partners employ some three million workers.\nApple depends on factories like the iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, which is operated by Foxconn, its biggest assembly partner. When Covid-19 cases started to spike in the area, Foxconn walled its roughly 200,000 workers inside the grounds of a factory that can produce as much as 85 percent of iPhones worldwide, according to Counterpoint Research. It wasn\u2019t long before Covid started to spread and Foxconn struggled to balance business demands with the country\u2019s ultra-strict pandemic policy.\nAs stories of unrest and food shortages flooded Chinese social media, workers began to fear for their lives.Hundredsfled. The assembler initially offered workers an extra $14 a day to continue working. It later nearly quadrupled that amount, to $55 a day.\nWhen officials ordered the region around the plant into a lockdown, the factory was forced to operate at \u201csignificantly reduced capacity,\u201d Apple said on Sunday. It\u2019s unclear when operations will return to full capacity.\nThe production slowdown in Zhengzhou forced Apple to warn investors \u2014 for the third time in three years \u2014 that sales would be affected by pandemic-related disruptions to its operations in China.\nWhile Beijing\u2019s stringent Covid policies are crimping Apple\u2019s iPhone production plans, Washington is watching carefully what goes into its products.\nYMTC, the small Chinese chip maker, was founded in 2016 with a $2.9 billion government investment and a mission to help reduce China\u2019s dependence on foreign chip makers.\nApple, which declined to comment, was in talks about a supply agreement with the Chinese firm, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Memory chips, YMTC\u2019s specialty, are one of the iPhone\u2019s most expensive components, accounting for roughly 25 percent of its material costs, according to Susquehanna International Group, a financial firm.\nBecause it would offer lower prices to gain market share, YMTC could help Apple pressure its current Western suppliers to lower their costs, said Walter Coon, a semiconductor analyst with Yole Group, a market research firm.\nBut YMTC\u2019s importance to China made it a target of U.S. national security researchers. In late 2020, a team led by James Mulvenon, a Chinese linguist and researcher at the U.S. defense contractor SOS International, issued a 17-page report that detailed YMTC\u2019s connections, through its parent company, Tsinghua Unigroup, to entities that sold products to China\u2019s military.\nIn February 2021, Mr. Mulvenon presented his findings to about two dozen Republican and Democratic staff members on Capitol Hill. He outlined the risks that he believed YMTC posed, because its government subsidies could empower it to undercut competitors on price.\n\u201cIt never made sense to cluster the entire supply chain inside a country that was the most potent cyberthreat to the United States,\u201d Mr. Mulvenon said.\nAs Apple geared up for this year\u2019s iPhone release, Wall Street analysts at Credit Suisse issued a report saying that Apple might include YMTC chips in upcoming models. Though Apple and YMTC neither confirmed nor denied the report, the potential deal prompted lawmakers, including Senators Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to sendletters urging the Biden administration to investigate Apple\u2019s plans.\nSemiconductor industry officials also raised concerns with lawmakers that Apple had assisted in recruiting engineers from Western companies to help YMTC improve its production, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nApple later sought to reassure lawmakers bytelling themthat it would use YMTC chips only for iPhones sold in China. But that did not address congressional leaders\u2019 bigger concern that any purchase from YMTC would hurt the market for memory chips.\nLawmakers urged Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, to put YMTC on the United States\u2019 \u201centity list,\u201d a designation that would bar it from buying American technology and components without a waiver. On Oct. 7, the department stopped short of that,placing export restrictionson YMTC and 30 companies believed to have ties to China\u2019s military.\nThe new restrictions cost YMTC access to critical American machinery for a new factory in Wuhan and may limit its ability to work with a company like Apple.\nIn the days after the restrictions were issued, the Japanese business outlet Nikkei published a report sayingApple had dropped its plansto use YMTC. When asked if the Nikkei report was accurate, an Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nLawmakers continue to pressure Apple and YMTC. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Rubio said, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive: \u201cIf Tim Cook understands the risks that YMTC and the rest of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s chip-making efforts pose to U.S. national security and that of our allies, then he and his company should clearly commit not to proceed.\u201d\nAna Swanson and Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington."

        "title": "Investors Cheer Leadership Shakeup at Disney",
        "fulltext": "Last December, Robert Iger told a Variety reporter hewasn\u2019t second-guessinghis departure from Disney after leading the entertainment giant on a 15-year run of growth and profits. Besides,he\u2019d later acknowledge, Hollywood is going through an \u201cage of great anxiety\u201d with uncertainty at the box office and in the streaming wars.\nNow, in a move that\u2019s stunned Hollywood, Mr. Iger is back in the top job. Disney on Sunday night fired his handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, as C.E.O. The 71-year-old Iger has signed a two-year contract as his replacement. Jobs one and two for Mr. Iger: restore the company\u2019s fortunes and groom a successor, meaning the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-like contest to find a replacement begins immediately.\nThe intrigue is where Iger may turn for the next leader, and what are his plans for Hulu, the streaming service in which Disney holds a majority stake. Dan Loeb, the activist investor,had been pushing Disneyto combine Hulu with Disney+, the company\u2019s own streaming service. Meanwhile on the succession front, Peter Rice, a top content chief at Disney, and Kevin Mayer, one of the architects behind the launch of Disney+, are no longer at the company. Will Iger try to bring them back?\nDisney shares soared in premarket trading this morning,but are off by more than 40 percent this year. The stock is on its worst run since at least the 1970s,according to Bloomberg, tumbling by 22 percent under Mr. Chapek and wiping out roughly $35 billion in market cap.\nPressure has been building from activist investors, with Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management joining Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point in calling for big changes. (Mr. Peltz, though, doesn\u2019t want Iger back, The Wall Street Journalreports. Reed Hastings, the co-C.E.O. of Netflix, meanwhile, wrote on Twitter that he wished Iger would have gotten out of Hollywood and instead run for president.) Mr. Iger had also seen enough, telling confidants that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Disney\u2019s decline, The Times\u2019 Brooks Barnesreports.\nMr. Chapek\u2019s tenure was marked by the pandemic and PR disasters.He took over Disney in February 2020, a few weeks before Covid-19 forced the company to shut down its theme parks. With people stuck at home, the company doubled down on Disney+, a strategy that worked well \u2026 until it didn\u2019t.\nOn Nov. 8, Disneyreportedthat quarterly losses at the unit had more than doubled to $1.5 billion and revenues missed expectations. Investors were mortified by Chapek\u2019s sunny tone on a call following the results, and shares fell 12 percent the next day.\nOn the Hollywood front, Disney under Mr. Chapek was embroiled ina contentious pay disputewith the actress Scarlett Johansson, and Mr. Chapekfired his top TV content executive, Rice, sending a shock wave through the industry.\nChapek was also bruised by America\u2019s culture wars, angering both employees and Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, with his response to the Parental Rights in Education Act \u2014 or what critics call the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. Mr. Chapek sparked a staff uproar by not taking a public stand. When he eventually weighed in, it provoked a political backlash.\nMr. Iger had been away from the company for less than a year, having served as executive chairman through the end of 2021. He told Disney employees in an email of his \u201camazement\u201d at being back. Just two months ago, he had joined Thrive Capital, the venture fund, as a partner, and the board of Genies Inc, a crypto avatar company. It\u2019s unclear if he will remain at the companies.\nEuropean soccer teams drop Fifa protest threat.England, the Netherlands and other national teamsabandoned plans to wear anti-discrimination armbandsat the World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is a crime. The reversal is the latest controversy to hit an event beset by accusations of human rights abuses and corruption allegations.\nAsian stocks fall on renewed Covid fears in China.The authorities imposed tough restrictions on a city near Beijing that was seen as atest casefor the country\u2019s easing of its strict pandemic policies. The moves followed the first reported Covid-related deaths since May and renew concerns that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is not ready to lift restrictions and open up.\nElon Musk reinstates Twitter accounts of Donald Trump and Kanye West.The former president has not tweeted since Muskallowed him back. But the musician known as Ye posted \u201cShalom\u201d on Sunday, after he was suspended from the platform last month for making antisemitic remarks that led to a sharp slide for his reputation and his earnings.\nLawmakers demand inquiry into Supreme Court leak allegation.Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation and tighter ethics rules for justices, after reports that a 2014 decision on contraception wasdisclosed in advanceto anti-abortion activists.\nCrypto assets are in the red again on Monday, with Bitcoin hovering around a two-year low, as investors grow increasingly jittery about the contagion risks from the collapse of FTX. Over the weekend, the failed crypto exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, revealed that its combined businesses owed a total of $3.1 billion to its top 50 creditors.\nAbout half of that sum isowed to FTX\u2019s top 10creditors.The company submitted aredacted listto U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Saturday, but warned it could make further adjustments given the disastrous state of its record keeping. Little is known about who precisely is on that list. What\u2019s known is that the list of FTX backers is vast and impressive, including thelikes of BlackRock, Sequoia and the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund.\nThere is some good news for creditors.John Ray, the new FTX C.E.O. overseeing the bankruptcy, said that some entities, including FTX US, are solvent. He is reviewing assets and is preparing to sell or reorganize those businesses, to begin the process of paying back those it owes money. The company has also asked the court for permission to pay its remaining 330 employees, noting that they are quitting swiftly.\nCrypto companies are in trouble, whether or not they have cut FTX ties.Shares in Silvergate Capital, a bank specializing in crypto assets, are down in premarket trading this morning, after halving in the past month. The company hasissued a series of statementssaying it has no loans outstanding to FTX or its founder. Shares in Coinbase, a rival crypto exchange, are off a further 5 percent in premarket, too, as investors sell risky assets connected to crypto.\nAdding to investor worries: suspicious movements this weekend in FTX\u2019s crypto assets.That triggered an alert from the blockchain research firm Chainalysis,warningthat FTX may have been hit by another hacker attack, similar to one that occurred the previous weekend.\nAs special committees for both News Corp and Fox evaluate Rupert Murdoch\u2019s proposal to recombine his two media properties, investors are pushing for a greater say in the matter.\nThe activist investor Irenic Capital Managementsays it may vote against the deal, according to a letter sent to News Corp on Sunday. Several News Corp investors, including a top 10 shareholder, also told DealBook that they remain unconvinced about the merits of a transaction.\nThe Murdochs call most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the shots.The Murdoch Family Trust, which Murdoch controls with his eldest children, holds about 40 percent of the votes at the companies through Class B shares. A deal would require the approval of a majority of News Corp and Fox\u2019s respective minority shareholders.\nIrenic, which owns about 2 percent of the Class B shares, says any deal would most likely undervalue News Corp, and that its stock, which trades at $18 a share, could be worth $34. Unless Fox pays a lofty premium for the whole company, Irenic wants News Corp to instead explorespinning off its real estate businessand its Dow Jones media business.\nMr. Murdoch has said he sees cost-saving and moneymaking opportunities from a merger.Greater scale could also bring advantages as the broader media sector consolidates, eventhough many of these dealshave not withstood the deeper challenges facing the sector.\nBut some shareholders struggle to see the value of a combined company with such diverse businesses. \u201cDoes The Wall Street Journal gain by having Fox attached to it? That\u2019s not obvious to me,\u201d said Will Granger of Airlie Funds Management.\nDemocratic attorneys general in 17 states have accused their Republican counterparts of threatening their ability to fulfill a legal duty to investors to adhere to environmental, social and governance principles, adding further political tension to this booming area of investing.\nDealBook got a first look at a letter,which the A.G.s will send to congressional leaders later on Monday. \u201cRepublican politicians are engaging in a dangerous misinformation campaign to influence how investment decisions are made,\u201d Karl Racine, the District of Columbia attorney general, said in a statement.\nRepublican A.G.s have targeted asset managers and state pension funds.They argue that investors may be violating antitrust law by backing carbon reduction initiatives and haveaccused BlackRock, for example, of prioritizing \u201cactivism\u201d over its fiduciary duty. Some state pension managers, including in Texas and Florida, have been ordered to adopt new models that ignore E.S.G.\nThe E.S.G. fight will play out in a divided Congress after the midterms.Executive agencies that are integrating climate risk into policy, like the S.E.C. and the Treasury, can expect a grilling at House hearings called by Republicans. Some powerful G.O.P. senators, including Chuck Grassley and Tom Cotton, havecalled for antitrust investigationsinto \u201cclimate cartels and other ill-advised ESG schemes,\u201d and have warned asset managers\u2019 legal advisers to prepare for document requests.\nThe dispute is over value and values.Those who oppose E.S.G. contend that the trend ignores investors\u2019 financial interests in favor of ideology, although many investors say it is consistent with maximizing shareholder returns.\n\u201cA rigorous consideration of ESG factors to evaluateValue\u2014 the risk and reward of a potential investment \u2014 notValues\u2014 a subjective preference\u201d benefits investors,\u201d the Democratic A.G.s write.\nThis week kicks off both the World Cup \u2014 which started yesterday, and runs through Dec. 18 \u2014 and the traditional start to the holiday shopping season.\nTuesday:The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publishes its projections for the world economy.

        "title": "Apple Could Be Short of iPhones Because of Factory Disruptions in China",
        "fulltext": "Weeks after expressing optimism about the global economy and its business, Apple on Sundaywarned that its saleswould fall short of expectations because a key iPhone factory in China had been shut down by a coronavirus outbreak.\nThe abrupt change in its business prospects are the latest reminder of the risks of the company\u2019s concentrated manufacturing supply chain in China. Once an operational strength that afforded Apple the flexibility to have legions of workers crank out iPhones to meet global demand, its reliance on China has become a liability as the country\u2019s commitment to a zero Covid-19 policy has led it to lock down cities, businesses and factories.\nIn mid-October,Apple\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, shut off the primary plant in Zhengzhouas coronavirus cases spiked. Foxconn closed the facility to the outside world and walled roughly 200,000 workers inside its grounds. Production of iPhones has continued at \u201ca significantly reduced capacity,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Sunday. The company added that its production woes would mean that customers would face longer wait times between the purchase and delivery of its high-end iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.\n\u201cWe are working closely with our supplier to return to normal production levels while ensuring the health and safety of every worker,\u201d Apple said in its statement.\nThe shutdown is the second to affect Apple this year. It lost about $4 billion in sales of iPads and Macs over the spring and summer after factories outside of Shanghai were closed to limit the spread of Covid-19.\nApple\u2019s setback comes amid a larger downturn in the prospects for the tech industry. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have tumbled this year amid an economic slowdown that has caused e-commerce and advertising sales to falter. Apple\u2019s share prices has slipped but avoided the steep declines of its peers in large part because it continued to deliver strong business results.\nChina\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been promoted by China\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping. The country\u2019s leadership has remained committed to that policy in the wake of Mr. Xi\u2019s election to a third term.\nApple\u2019s presence in China is so prominent thatlocals refer to Zhengzhou as \u201ciPhone City.\u201dAt full tilt, the Foxconn factory there was capable of producing 500,000 iPhones a day. It is the largest single plant for the iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s annual sales.\n\u201cThis is what Apple has feared,\u201d said Wayne Lam, a technology analyst with CCS Insight. \u201cChina is not letting its foot off this zero Covid policy, and it\u2019s going to have a big impact because these premium phones were the last area of the smartphone market that have been in demand.\u201d\nAfter Foxconn locked down its Zhengzhou plant, some factory workers fled the facility and began walking toward their homes across the countryside. Images and videos of them fleeing spread across social media. Leo Lin, a 29-year-old factory worker whospoke to The New York Timeslast week said that many workers panicked as quarantine facilities began to overflow.\nFoxconn responded by offering workers an extra $14 a day to continue working. It later increased those payments to $55 a day.\nApple has begun to diversify its supply chain away from China, shifting production of some iPhones to India and other products to Vietnam. But the company still relies on China to produce more than 90 percent of the iPhones that it sells, according to analysts.\nThe push to diversify is \u201cclearly not fast enough,\u201d Mr. Lam said."

        "fulltext": "To the Editor:\nRe \u201cDoctors\u2019 Real Thoughts on Disabled Patients\u201d (Science Times, Oct. 25):\nWhen envisioning barriers to health care, one does not think of the physicians asthebarrier. I understand that physicians are tied to a system driven by time constraints and financial incentives, so it\u2019s not shocking that physicians discriminate against those with disabilities. This substantiates the need to re-examine health care reimbursement policies and practices.\nDoctors have a legal responsibility to accommodate patients with disabilities and provide equitable care. Evading and denying care is a civil rights violation, a blatant disregard of the Hippocratic oath and a moral failure.\nLindsey AminaEwa Beach, HawaiiThe writer is the daughter of a disabled father.\nTo the Editor:\nLet me tell you what my patients with disabilities have taught me over my 25 years of practice so far:\nI have learned what a pleasure it is to hop on for a ride with a person who has a body that is one of a kind and is willing to tell you about it.\nI have learned that it is downright awesome to watch a woman who has suffered a stroke recover, go to school in her electric wheelchair, get a degree and show us all what a strong, resilient and loving soul she has.\nI have learned to be humbled by my many patients who have struggled with trauma, drug abuse and the stress of societal prejudice, and yet have learned to care for themselves and to live life fully, with soul and a sense of humor.\nI hope all doctors will be as blessed as I have been to work with such superstars.\nSusan FergusonOakland, Calif.The writer is a primary care doctor in inner-city Oakland.\nTo the Editor:\nHow can a doctor adequately treat any patients when, as one put it in your article, they are \u201cseeing patients at a 15-minute clip\u201d?\nWho decided that 15 minutes was the amount of time needed to see a patient? I\u2019m betting that insurance companies and money had a lot to do with that decision.\nLet\u2019s start there: Many patients, not only those who might be disabled, need more than 15 minutes with a doctor, especially those of us who are older.\nWhat can be done about these arbitrary limits? Why can\u2019t doctors push back?\nConnie KnappOssining, N.Y.\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cHobbs Defeats Trump\u2019s Choice to Run Arizona\u201d (front page, Nov. 15):\nKari Lake, like her backer, Donald Trump, has shown herself to be totally unfit to serve in any office of public trust.\nAs a candidate she did not worry about adhering to the truth. But if she had become governor of Arizona, any form of lying or deception would have been destructive and unacceptable to the state and to the country.\nHer defeat was a vital step in the arduous task of keeping our democracy from being systematically poisoned by Mr. Trump and his cohort of election deniers.\nEzra CohenDeal, N.J.\nTo the Editor:\n\u201cPence Says \u2018Reckless\u2019 Tweet by Trump Endangered Him and His Family on Jan. 6\u201d (news article, Nov. 15) reports that former Vice President Mike Pence has now finally criticized Donald Trump for Jan. 6 in a more forceful and direct fashion than he ever has before.\nWell, hello! Mr. Pence now has his book to sell, and it appears that he feels shielded by the rising tide of contempt now directed at Mr. Trump as a result of last week\u2019s elections \u2014 further proof that Mr. Pence is a follower and certainly not a leader with a strong sense of self-worth.\nWhat a spineless, oleaginous, obsequious sycophant he is, seemingly devoid of courage, perhaps thinking that he is protected by his pompous religious fervor.\nA future president? No way.\nC. Richard BrubakerNovelty, Ohio\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cU.S. Officials Split on Talks for War\u2019s End\u201d (front page, Nov. 11):\nVarious U.S. and Western officials are dropping not so subtle hints that Ukraine should start plans for negotiating with Russia. This risks undercutting Ukrainian morale and, more important, gives Vladimir Putin hope that the Western support of Ukraine is approaching its limits.\nInstead, the West should tell Mr. Putin that if Russia does not immediately stop targeting Ukrainian civilians and basic infrastructure, the West may be unable to restrain Ukraine from attacking inside Russia\u2019s borders and new, stronger sanctions will be imposed. Mr. Putin should not receive any gains from his war of aggression against democracy.\nIn addition, Biden administration officials should be stopped from airing foreign policy discussions and disagreement in the media.\nRon KurtzAlpharetta, Ga.\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cSouth Africa Faces an Uphill Battle to Transition From Coal\u201d (news article, Nov. 9):\nIt\u2019s disheartening that South Africa is focusing on coal as it builds its industrial base. Instead of relying on a dying and polluting industry, it could put its resources into becoming a world-class manufacturer (and user) of solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient appliances and building materials, thereby helping its economy and the planet.\nWinnie BoalCincinnati\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cChina Turning Into a Liability for the iPhone\u201d (front page, Nov. 8):\nWorking-class families have been betrayed by companies like Apple. The manufacturing base in the United States has been the foundation for companies to prosper and be in a position to create valuable new products. Yet Apple, like so many other Silicon Valley companies, undercut American workers by rushing to China and acquiring dirt-cheap labor.\nCan American workers assemble iPhones? Can they manufacture computer chips? Of course they can. Shame on Apple and all the companies that see labor as something to subvert and exploit rather than a solid investment in our society and well-being.\nWe can only hope that next time the Apples of the world will build their empires with American labor.\nDaniel DziedzicRochester Hills, Mich.\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cIs It Better to Brush My Teeth Before or After Breakfast?\u201d (Ask Well, Nov. 8):\nAs a retired dentist who practiced for 48 years, I vote strongly in favor of brushing after breakfast. First of all, if you thoroughly clean your teeth after the last meal or snack of the day (meaning brushing and flossing), there will usually be no \u201cmorning breath.\u201d\n\u201cMorning breath\u201d is often the result of the bacteria on the teeth working on the food residue lingering on the teeth and excreting the waste products of that metabolism. I always counseled my patients to brush after breakfast to remove the overnight bacteria and remnants of breakfast \u2014 especially because they would be unlikely to brush again until bedtime.\nMichael MarcusSilver Spring, Md."

        "title": "What Will Iger Do With ESPN and Hulu?",
        "fulltext": "On Robert Iger\u2019s first day back as C.E.O. of Disney, the stock popped, adding billions to the entertainment giant\u2019s shrinking market valuation. Now comes the hard part: finding a path to growth, and resolving a Space Mountain-sized heap of concerns from the future of flashy properties like Hulu and ESPN to finding a successor.\nMr. Iger doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to get things done.Weighed down by losses at the streaming service Disney+, the stock had been on its worst run in decades. Top executives \u2014including Christine McCarthy, the company\u2019s C.F.O. \u2014 had lost confidence in Bob Chapek, leading to his weekend ouster as C.E.O. just months after the boardhad extendedhis contract. Mr. Chapek had been Mr. Iger\u2019s handpicked successor and the 71-year-old now has a two-year contract to find another lieutenant who can take the reins in 2025.\nWho does he bring in?Mr. Iger is already reshaping Disney back in his image, announcing a big restructuring yesterday to give studio executives more control. A top Chapek content executive, Kareem Daniel, is out. Some are speculating Mr. Iger might try to bring back Peter Rice, the former TV content chief at Disney who clashed with Mr. Chapek and wasfired in June. Mr. Rice had been seen as a possible successor to Mr. Chapek. Another well-regarded Disney executive is Dana Walden, who oversees content production and news programming. A plus: her strong ties to Iger.\nWill Mr. Iger spin off ESPN?Finding new ways to profit from the popularity of Disney\u2019s sports broadcaster has long been discussed. The activist investor Dan Loeb pushed Mr. Chapek to spin off ESPN this summer, but then relented. Equity analysts at Bank of America say everything is under review, including ESPN, now that Mr. Iger is back. \u201cIger has made public comments recently on the secular challenges in the linear TV ecosystem, which coupled with accelerating linear subscriber declines, could signal a potential openness to re-evaluate strategic alternatives,\u201d the bank said in an investor note yesterday.\nHow does he turn the streaming businesses around?Let\u2019s start with Disney+: Does he raise prices? (Bank of America sees this as a possibility). Does he put Hulu, in which Disney holds a majority stake, on the market to pay debt elsewhere? Could he even get a good price for it given how depressed valuations look? And what about its chief competitor, Netflix?Merger speculationabout Disney and Netflix was rife five years ago. Or how about a deal with Apple? Mr. Iger made a number of big acquisitions in his first go-round as C.E.O., mostly around big franchises like Pixar and Marvel. Watch this space.\nWhy did he come back?That\u2019s the big question everyone in media circles is asking. Mr. Iger left Disney (as chairman) last December beloved, and on top. There wastalkof a presidential bid, or maybe an ambassador role. Now, he\u2019s returning to a Disney that\u2019s been bruised by the Covid pandemic and the streaming wars. Not to mention skyrocketing inflation and a battered global economy. Maybe, like his late friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who found success in a second act, Mr. Iger (who was previously on the board of the iPhone maker) sees this new adventure as one worth taking.\nPenguin Random House\u2019s bid to buy Simon Schuster falls apart.The companies officially gave up on the $2.2 billion deal yesterday, in a victory for the Justice Department, which had sued to stop it on the grounds that it would harm competition and be bad for authors. The scupperingcame as a surpriseto many in the publishing industry, which has consolidated in recent years.\nOil prices rebound after Monday\u2019s plunge.Brent crude rose to $88 per barrel after falling precipitously in yesterday\u2019s trading session whenThe Wall Street Journal reportedthat Saudi Arabia might raise output. Prices rallied after the kingdom denied the report.\nAmerica\u2019s defense secretary presses China\u2019s over Taiwan.Lloyd Austin told his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, to avoid\u201cdestablizing actions\u201dover the self-governing island. Their talks, in Cambodia, came days after a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping kindled faint hopes of an easing in tensions. They were also the first since Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan this summer, infuriating Beijing.\nA nationwide railway strike moves a step closer.A union that primarily represents freight rail conductorsnarrowly voted downa White House-brokered contract deal, increasing the risk of industrial action next month that could cost the economy more than $2 billion a day.\nCrypto\u2019s monthlong slide continued this morning with Bitcoin dipping to a two-year low as investors brace for more bankruptcies following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Adding further tension to the markets: Federal prosecutorsreportedly began investigating FTX, which was founded by the crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried, months before its demise.\nThe crypto brokerage Genesis is also said to be teetering.According to Bloomberg, the company is in a make-or-break dash to secure $1 billion in emergency funding. Genesis, which was among the first to reveal its close ties to the fallen FTX,reportedly reached outto Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, and the private equity firm Apollo Global for funding. With $175 million of its funds tied up in the collapse, Genesis says it\u2019s looking to plug the hole in its balance sheet and avoid bankruptcy.\nIs Genesis\u2019s parent Digital Currency Group at risk?Valued at about $10 billion last year, the crypto conglomerate includes the asset manager Grayscale and the news site CoinDesk, and was backed by blue-chip investors like Alphabet and SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund 2. Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin fund, pitched as a handy way for retail investors to access the market \u2014hit a new lowyesterday after falling to about half the value of Bitcoin on fears about the parent group. Grayscale denies it\u2019s in trouble, but itsrefusal to give evidenceof proof of reserves that satisfies the crypto community is weighing heavily on the value of the assets it sells.\nDigital Currency Group\u2019s connections extend far across crypto.It has invested in about165 companies, including Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, whose share price has plummeted by nearly 90 percent since last year. That hasn\u2019t stopped Cathie Wood. Her Ark Investments has gone on a cryptobuying spreethat has included Coinbase and Grayscale, but few on Wall Street share her enthusiasm.\nThe collapse of FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Researchm has created a liquidity crisisdubbed the \u201cAlameda Gap.\u201d That means further investor uncertainty. Here\u2019s what the markets are watching:\nFTX has now found $1.24 billionin cash holdings, according to a bankruptcy filing. The problem: Its liabilities may exceed $10 billion.\nTexas regulators areinvestigating celebritieswho promoted FTX, including the quarterback Tom Brady and the basketball star Steph Curry, over potential violations of securities law.\nWhere did the funds go? Mr. Bankman-Fried, his parents and senior executives of FTX reportedlybought property in the Bahamasworth $121 million.\nA senior official at the Bank of England sayscrypto exchanges that bundle services, as FTX did, need to be more closely regulated. The practice is banned in mainstream finance.\nElon Musk says he\u2019s done laying off people at Twitter after the latest round of cuts yesterday, but worries persist about everything from data security to the platform\u2019s ability to moderate content after he scythed through the work force.\nIs there anyone left?Mr. Musk laid off sales staff buttold an all-hands meetingthat he wasn\u2019t planning any more job cuts. Even so, worries persist about Twitter\u2019s ability to function since he has got rid of about half of the 7,500 employees and 1,200 more resigned. Advertisers continue topause their use of the service, despite Musk\u2019s attempts to assuage their concerns since his takeover. And rival tech firms are lookingto poach disgruntled staff.\nMr. Musk\u2019s taking a rain check on blue checks.A plan to give users a verified check mark for $8 a month, which the new owner launched this month, was put on pause after parody accountsimpersonatedcompanies and politicians. The problem: still too many parody accounts. The next version of the service, Musktweetedyesterday, \u201cWill probably use different color check for organizations than individuals.\u201d\nAt least one top Apple executive doesn\u2019t seem to want one. Phil Schiller, who runs the App Store and Apple events, deactivated his Twitter account. The move attracted attention because Twitterrelies heavily on the App Store to reach users; removal would be catastrophic for the company. Musk has alreadylaid off most of Twitter\u2019s content moderation team, as well as the executives who oversaw it, which could make abiding by Apple\u2019s requirement to create \u201ca safe experience for users\u201d a lot harder.\nThe Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development released itsoutlook for the global economyfor 2023 on Tuesday, and the Paris-based club of rich nations is a little bit more optimistic about next year than other observers.\nThe organization expects 2.2 percent growth next year, and says the world won\u2019t fall into recession. That\u2019s a fair bit better than Goldman Sachs, which forecast last week that global output would rise 1.8 percent next year.\nThe O.E.C.D. predicts there will be no recessionfor every major region in the world, despite facing the biggest energy shock since the 1970s.\nThe consensus forecast for the U.S. is that there is a 65 percent chance of recession but the O.E.C.D. puts the chance at close to zero and says the economy will grow \u2014 though more slowly than it did this year.\nThe inflation outlook is steady, but still high.The O.E.C.D. doesn\u2019t believe rising prices will go away anytime soon. Energy prices are pushing inflation higher, especially in Europe. But it says many of the pressures appear to be easing, pointing specifically to shipping costs. All in, the organization predicts prices globally will rise 6.5 percent next year, down from over 9 percent this year. \u201cEurope has gone a long way to replenish its natural gas reserves, and curb demand,\u201d the O.E.C.D. said. \u201cBut this winter in the Northern Hemisphere will certainly be challenging.\u201d It added that winter next year may be even more complicated as it becomes harder to replenish gas reserves.\nAnd the organization is bullish about China.Large parts of the world\u2019s second-largest economy remain the subject to strict Covid controls, and a recentspike in caseshas renewed worries that Beijing will be slow to open up. But the O.E.C.D. expects lower Covid restrictions by the end of the year, and more spending on infrastructure. In all, it expects China\u2019s G.D.P. to rise 4.6 percent, up from 3.3 percent this year. Other Asian countries are also predicted to grow, including Japan, which hasn\u2019t had the same problems with inflation as the rest of the world.\nDeals\nCarl Icahn has reportedly built upa sizable short positionagainst GameStop, beginning at the height of the meme-stock frenzy in 2021.

        "title": "Losses Pile Up in FTX Bankruptcy Turmoil",
        "fulltext": "Two weeks after the epic collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto exchange, disagreement and confusion still reign. In the first bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday, FTX lawyers said that a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of the firm\u2019s assets were missing or stolen, and that the empire was run like the \u201cpersonal fiefdom\u201d of Mr. Bankman-Fried. Adding to the drama around Bankman-Fried, or S.B.F. as he\u2019s known: Elon Muskslammed a reportthat the former crypto mogul has a stake in Twitter.\nS.B.F. broke his weeklong silence on Tuesday.In a letter to FTX\u2019s remaining employees,he divulgedthat the company suffered a $51 billion collapse in collateral, and apologized for the group\u2019s rapid demise. Still, he seemed to reject the proceedings unfolding in Delaware bankruptcy court, saying FTX might have been saved had he not caved to pressure to file for bankruptcy. \u201cPotential interest in billions of dollars of funding came in roughly eight minutes after I signed the Chapter 11 docs,\u201d he said. Left out of the letter: any response to reports of the firm commingling funds or loaning money to the C.E.O. and other executives.\nFTX wants to keep some things secret for now.Its lawyersargued that disclosure threatens their efforts to sift through the rubble, protect whatever is left and preserve what may be sold. They said they also believe that keeping creditor and asset investigations sealed for now just might add some stability to the wider crypto market, which has seen a broad sell-off and even hack attacks on FTX. The day of the bankruptcy filing, in an apparent security breach, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto wereremoved from FTX\u2019s digital vaults. The court said creditor information would bedisclosed eventually.\nDamage is spreading beyond the bankruptcy.Sequoia apologized to its limited partners on Tuesday for its $150 million investment in FTX. Meanwhile, more crypto businesses face potential failure. The crypto lender Genesis, which has $175 million stuck at FTX, has hired restructuring advisers to explore options including bankruptcy,DealBook reported on Tuesday.\nIs this a wake-up call to lawmakers?Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, in aWall Street Journal opinion piece, likened crypto to the subprime mortgages of 2008 and called on Congress to act fast to prevent risk to the wider financial system. Warren and two Democratic colleagues also wrote to Abigail Johnson, C.E.O. of Fidelity Investments, urging her toreconsider allowing Bitcoin exposurethrough the firm\u2019s 401(k) plans and sponsors. Attorney General Laetitia James of New York urged Congress to stop retirement investments in crypto altogether. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another reminder that cryptocurrencies are unstable,\u201dshe wrote on Twitter.\nAnd what about the Mr. Musk connection?Semaforreportedthat Musk texted S.B.F. in May asking if he would roll over his $100 million investment in Twitter once Musk took it private. Muskdenied the report, and questioned the news site\u2019s journalistic integrity, noting that S.B.F. invested in Semafor.\nCredit Suisse shares fall as the bank forecasts more trouble ahead.Ahead of a big capital-raising vote on Wednesday, the beleaguered Swiss lender said in a trading update that itexpects to lose $1.6 billion in the current quarteras its wealth management and investment banking divisions underperform. The bank has alsolaid off staff in Chinaas part of its restructuring.\nU.S. stock futures edge up ahead of the release of Fed minutes.This afternoon the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of this month\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, when it raised interest rates 0.75 percentage points for the fourth straight time. Investors will be watching for any sign of a split between governors on when the central bank should adopt a more gradual approach to rate rises.\nThe Supreme Court allows the House to get Trump\u2019s taxes.Itrejected the former president\u2019s requestto block the I.R.S. from turning over six years of his tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, ending a lengthy legal fight over the documents just before Republicans take control of the chamber in January.\nWith PC demand in decline, HP plans big layoffs.The computer maker saidit would cut 6,000 jobsover the next three years as it anticipates a \u201cchallenging\u201d market ahead. It\u2019s the latest tech giant to slash head count as the global economic downturn hits its bottom line.\nAmong the surprising assets uncovered in the bankruptcy of the failed crypto exchange FTX is this: An investment in a one-branch bank in eastern Washington that earlier this year had just three employees, and didn\u2019t offer online banking.\nIn March, Alameda, FTX\u2019s trading arm,invested $11.5 millionin the parent company of Farmington State Bank, the hometown lender of Farmington, Wash., population 130. At the time of the deal, Farmington was the nation\u2019s 26th smallest bank, and the FTX investment was about twice the bank\u2019s $5.7 million net worth.\nThe tiny bank\u2019s connection to FTX raises questions.Among them: How closely tied is FTX to the broader financial system? The investment \u201cshould have raised massive red flags for the F.D.I.C., state regulators and the Federal Reserve,\u201d Camden Fine, a bank industry consultant who used to head the trade organization Independent Community Bankers of America, told DealBook.\nAnother question: In the hunt for FTX\u2019s missing assets, will this tiny bank get dragged into the multibillion-dollar bankruptcy of the crypto exchange?\nFTX never said why it was interested in the tiny lender.The presence of FTX (and other new investors) does appear to have modernized the bank a bit. Farmington now goes byMoonstone Bankonline. The namewas trademarkeda few days before FTX\u2019s investment. Moonstone\u2019s website doesn\u2019t say anything about bitcoin or other digital currencies, but it does say Moonstone wants to support \u201cthe evolution of next-generation finance.\u201d\nFarmington has more than one crypto connection.The bank, which has been around since 1887, was bought by FBH Corp. in 2020. The chairman of that company is Jean Chalopin, who, along with being a co-creator of the cartoon cop Inspector Gadget in the 1980s, is also the chairman of Deltec Bank, which, like FTX, is based in the Bahamas. Deltec\u2019s best known client is Tether, a crypto company with $65 billion in assets offering a stablecoin that is pegged to the dollar. Tether has long faced concerns about its finances, in part because of its reclusive owners and offshore bank accounts. The fact that Tether\u2019s main banker and FTX were co-owners of a small Washington bank is sure to get Tether\u2019s critics talking, if not regulators poking around.\nManchester United parted ways with its star player Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday, but its investors (and plenty of disgruntled fans) couldn\u2019t be happier. Shares of the fabled soccer club jumped nearly 15 percent on the New York Stock Exchange after its American owners, the Glazer family,said they had hiredadvisers to find outside investors or sell the team.\nThe club\u2019s market capitalization hit nearly $2.5 billion following Tuesday\u2019s rally.But Forbes has valued Man U, which has an avid global fan base and rich history, at closer to twice that.

Liverpool is also on the block. The club\u2019s American owners, Fenway Sports Group, which also owns the Boston Red Sox,put it up for saleearlier this month.\nWho would bid?The private equity group Apollo and Britain\u2019s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, emerged as possible suitors in August when rumors began circulating that the Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were looking for an exit. A spokesman for Ratcliffe, the billionaire founder of the chemicals giant Ineos, told DealBook at the time that he \u201cwould be interested in buying the club if it was for sale.\u201d When reached this morning, he had no further comment. Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nManchester United has hired the Raine Group and Latham & Watkins to advise in any deal; the Glazers have also brought on Rothschild and Co. to assist.\nFlying for Thanksgiving?

But in recent weeks, officials havereinstated partial of full lockdownson more than 49 Chinese cities representing about a third of the country\u2019s population and two-fifths of total economic output, according to Nomura.

        "title": "Elon Musk Takes on a Goliath",
        "fulltext": "Elon Musk has been unafraid of picking fights, whether withprominent politicians,political whistle-blowersorhis own employees. But intaking on Appleon Monday, the Twitter owner was trying to start a brawl that could have ramifications stretching from Silicon Valley to Washington.\nMr. Musk complained that Apple had paused most of its advertising on Twitter, continuing his berating of companies that have done so. But it\u2019s his allegation that Apple \u201cthreatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store but won\u2019t tell us why\u201d that could prove more important.\nApple is a major source of ad dollars for Twitter.It was thebiggest advertiser on the platformin the year\u2019s first quarter, spending $48 million, according to The Washington Post.\nMr. Musk\u2019s App Store allegation resurrects a potent charge against Apple:that it has used access to millions of iPhone and iPad devices as a cudgel to extract more money from app makers. A key part of Mr. Musk\u2019s plans for Twitter is collecting more revenue from subscriptions \u2014 but under Apple\u2019s policies, up to 30 percent of those sales from iPhone users would go to Apple itself. (\u201cDid you know Appleputs a secret 30% taxon everything you buy through their App Store?\u201d Mr. Musk tweeted.)\nBut Mr. Musk has also pitched his complaint inbombastically broader terms, calling it \u201ca battle for the future of civilization.\u201d (Twitter\u2019s former head of public safety, Yoel Roth, wrote in a recent Times guest essay that Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores do prohibit certain kinds of content, and that failure to adhere to those rules \u2014 including by allowing certain kinds of material on the Twitter app \u2014 \u201cwould be catastrophic\u201d to Twitter\u2019s business.)\nSo far, Apple hasn\u2019t commented on Musk\u2019s allegations.\nApple is already being investigated for its App Store policies,including by the Justice Department. Meanwhile, Spotify sued Apple forrejecting its audiobooks appthree times, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior. And Epic Games is still locked in a legal fight with Apple over forced use of the company\u2019s in-app payment system. (Epic\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Sweeney, backed Musk\u2019s fight on Tuesday, tweeting, \u201cApple is a menace to freedom worldwide.\u201d)\nRepublicans \u2014 including Representative Ken Buck of Colorado and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the ranking members of the House and Senate antitrust subcommittees \u2014 also seized upon Musk\u2019s comments as proof that Apple and Google should open up their app stores.\nCongress plans to intervene in the rail labor dispute.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would vote on a bill toimpose a White House-brokered compromisethat could avert a crippling transport strike ahead of the holidays. It\u2019s not clear that legislation could pass the evenly divided Senate, and many unionized workers are unhappy with the deal.\nLeon Black is accused of raping a woman at Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s home in 2002.Cheri Piersonsued Black, the former Apollo Global Management C.E.O., becoming the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual assault. A lawyer for Mr. Black denied Pierson\u2019s claims and called them an extortion attempt.\nBob Iger commits to reining in expenses at Disney.At hisfirst companywide meetingon Monday, the recently rehired Disney C.E.O. said that he would keep a hiring freeze in place and that Disney+ would focus on turning a profit over adding subscribers. Mr. Iger also said Disney was committed to inclusive storytelling, seemingly defying conservative critics.\nMajor banks are working on a Zelle fraud compensation plan.The seven owners of the Zelle quick-payment service, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, are discussing a policy that wouldreimburse customers for some kinds of scams, The Times reports. Lawmakers and regulators have pressed the banks to do more to help victims of Zelle-based fraud.\nThe fallout from FTX\u2019s collapse is still being felt. On Monday, BlockFi, a crypto lender that targeted individual investors, offering them loans and high-interest savings accounts backed by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,filed for bankruptcy. In June, FTX extended a $400 million lifeline to BlockFi, which had been struggling for months. At the time, BlockFi hadother biddersoffering to help. But in the wake of FTX\u2019s demise, few are willing or able to offer a rescue to failing crypto firms.\nFTX\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, appears to have thought that a savior, or solution, would emerge as his own firm flailed. That was the case even in the exchange\u2019s final hours. The result was a chaotic last few days for FTX, which pitted S.B.F., as he\u2019s known, against his former top aides for control of the firm, according to new documents detailedin a report this morningby The Times\u2019s David Yaffe-Bellany. Documents, internal texts and emails sent in the days before FTX\u2019s Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing show S.B.F. as increasingly deluded and desperate; top lawyers and staffs at the firm struggled to convince S.B.F. that bankruptcy was the only option.\nIn a Nov. 10 email to staff, S.B.F. said he was close to securing new financing from the crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. It never materialized.\nSenior FTX employees reached out to S.B.F.\u2019s father, the Stanford Law School professor Joe Bankman, in an effort to get his son to give up control of the company.\nS.B.F. delayed the hiring of John Jay Ray III, the restructuring expert who has since taken over the company, thinking he still had time to raise new funds.\nEarly on Nov. 11, S.B.F. refused to sign off on FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\n\u201cThe founding team is not in a cooperative posture,\u201dRyne Miller, a top FTX lawyer based in the U.S., wrote in an email to S.B.F. and other staffers. \u201cPlease can you sign the document,\u201d Miller wrote S.B.F. at 2:29 a.m. on Nov. 11.\nS.B.F. continues to believe he could have saved the firm.Even after FTX filed for bankruptcy, and having resigned as C.E.O., he continued contacting potential investors about providing new funding. In a brief interview this weekend, S.B.F. told The Times that he had lined up \u201cnumerous parties\u201d willing to invest in FTX, even after its collapse, though he declined to name them.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening in crypto this morning.\nDigital asset prices arebouncing back, with Bitcoin up 1.7 percent to trade near $16,500.\nA venture firm tied to Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a major Bitcoin booster, held a19 percent stake in the now-bankrupt BlockFi.\nBlockFiis suingS.B.F.\u2019s investment vehicle to seize the shares it owns in Robinhood, the trading app operator. According to BlockFi, the FTX founder had pledged the stock as collateral, but never paid up.\nThe crypto exchange Krakenagreed to pay $360,000to settle a dispute with the Treasury Department over whether it violated sanctions policy by allowing users in Iran to trade crypto.\n\u2014Chinedum Egbosimba, a 27-year-old Harvard Business School student, on how a new generation of students is increasingly challenging traditional ideas about business and capitalism.\nChina is once again moving global markets on Tuesday \u2014 this time, higher.\nInvestors appear to be betting Beijing will ease its zero-Covid policy,even as authorities reasserted theircommitment to the approach.Rarepublic protestsagainst President Xi Jinping\u2019s highly restrictive policy have been largely quashed, but thedamage to the economyis putting pressure on the government to reopen parts of the country that are under full or partial lockdown.\nThe evidence of any easing is thin.Chinaannouncedit would renew its vaccination push for older people, but otherwise has only slightly tweaked its anti-Covid policy. In Shanghai, the country\u2019s financial center, authorities closed some businesses and reintroduced quarantine for close contacts. Nevertheless, stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rebounded sharply on Tuesday, and that risk-friendly mood has swept into Europe and U.S. stock futures. Here\u2019s how China\u2019s approach to the virus almost three years after the start of the pandemic is still preoccupyingglobal investors:\nChina\u2019s growth is slowing.Nomura last week cut its China G.D.P. forecast for this year (+2.8 percent) and next (+4 percent), predicting a rocky road ahead. \u201cMarkets might be tumultuous this week. Reopening will be slow, painful and bumpy,\u201d Ting Lu, the bank\u2019s chief China economist, warned investors on Monday. If that slowdown further hits China\u2019s massive manufacturing sector, there would be consequences for the global supply chain \u2014 Apple already expectsa production shortfallof 6 million iPhones because of disruptions at a Zhengzhou factory \u2014 and stocks. Apple fell 2.6 percent on Monday, underperforming the S&P 500.\nCommodity prices are highly dependent on China.The country \u201cconsumes 40 to 70 percent of global commodity supply,\u201d Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum, an investment bank, told DealBook. Uncertainty over whether Chinese factories and industrial plants would be shut because of infection has added volatility to the pricing of everything from crude oil to iron and gold in recent weeks, Price noted.\nA possible silver lining: the impact on emissions.China is theworld\u2019s biggest greenhouse-gas emitter. One effect of zero-Covid crackdowns in cities across the country: the Chinese have been driving less frequently. According to Rystad Energy, \u201cChinese road traffic remains well below comparable 2020 and 2021 levels as persistent lockdowns and China\u2019s growth slowdown weigh on road traffic.\u201d If that were to persist, it could limit oil prices in the short term \u2014 something to watch as OPEC+ nationsmeet next weekto determine production policy.\nDeals\nMicrosoft reportedly plans tooffer concessions to E.U. regulatorsto win approval of its $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, including a licensing deal with Sony.

        "title": "Why the N.F.L.\u2019s Big Streaming Deal Is Going Into Overtime",
        "fulltext": "Roger Goodell, the National Football League\u2019s commissioner, flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, this summer for Allen & Company\u2019s annual media conference, confident that the N.F.L. was close to announcing its latest blockbuster TV rights deal.\n\u201cWe will probably have some decision by the fall,\u201d hetold CNBC at the time.\nBut nearly five months later, the league is still looking for a technology or media company willing to replace DirecTV as the rights holder for Sunday Ticket, which allows fans to watch every N.F.L. game, not just those broadcast in their region. The negotiations are now expected to extend into next year, according to five people familiar with the talks.\nThe Sunday Ticket negotiations have been closely watched by analysts and executives. Live sports, particularly N.F.L. games, are one of the last remaining staples of traditional television. Who the winning bidder is, how much it pays and how the deal is structured will have seismic implications for the sports, media and technology industries.\nBidding for Sunday Ticket\u2019s valuable package of games could set a precedent for how much tech firms like Apple and Google are willing to pay to take viewers from traditional TV companies, which still rely on cable subscription fees and advertising to stay afloat.\nThe competitive landscape for Sunday Ticket has shifted as the talks have dragged on, the people familiar with the talks said. Sports and media executives have long considered Apple to be the front-runner, with some involved in the bidding process saying they thought the tech giant had reached an agreement.\nBut in the absence of a deal, Google has stepped up its pursuit, aiming to win the package for YouTube TV, the company\u2019s streaming-cable service, four of these people said. Other interested bidders include Amazon and Disney\u2019s ESPN.\nRobert Kyncl, YouTube\u2019s chief business officer, has played a key role in Google\u2019s pursuit. Though he will take a new job early next year as chief executive of Warner Music Group, Mr. Kyncl has committed to working with YouTube to see the deal through, three people familiar with his priorities said. He has a relationship with Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.\u2019s chief business officer, who worked with Mr. Kyncl during Google\u2019s unsuccessful bid for Sunday Ticket in 2013.\nThe league\u2019s negotiations with Apple, Google and others have become protracted because it is trying to bundle the package of out-of-market Sunday N.F.L. games with other media assets, including NFL Network and the NFL RedZone channel, according to these people.\nLast year, the N.F.L. hired Goldman Sachs to help it explore selling a stake to those media businesses. The decision was partly driven by the league\u2019s recognition that Sunday Ticket competes for subscribers with the RedZone channel, which jumps back and forth among live Sunday football games as teams get close to scoring touchdowns.\nBy seeking investors in that channel and other media businesses, the N.F.L. must negotiate how to structure a joint venture with an investment partner that would likely want a voice in the co-owned company\u2019s operating structure, these people said.\nOne media executive who has negotiated with both Apple and the N.F.L. cited another reason for the monthslong impasse: Both sides are used to getting their way in negotiations.\nThe N.F.L.,Apple, Amazon and ESPNdeclined to comment. Google didn\u2019t immediately have comment.\nThe league is asking for more than $2.5 billion annually, a $1 billion increase from the current eight-year deal, which expires at the end of this season. It wants a long-term partner for the rights, having locked up its marquee packages last year for games on Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays with11-year agreements.\nThe slowing economy could create another challenge for the N.F.L. as it tries to close a deal that could top $10 billion over its life. Tech and media companies alike are under pressure from Wall Street and investors to cut staff and control spending, a reversal after years of lavish spending.\nThe downturn has helped sour some Wall Street analysts on Amazon\u2019s $1 billion-a-year deal for \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson, an investment bank, said he was skeptical that the company would bring in enough new Amazon Prime members or advertising revenue to cover its costs. He added that Amazon\u2019s struggle to make money meant it was highly unlikely to make a serious bid for Sunday Ticket.\n\u201cAt a time when technology companies are tightening their belts, it would be shocking to see Amazon spend more for N.F.L. rights given the challenges they have already had,\u201d Mr. Forte said.\nThere\u2019s similar skepticism about the viability of a bid from ESPN. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, saidRobert Iger\u2019s return as chief executive made Disney, which owns 80 percent of ESPN, more likely to cut costs at ESPN or sell it. He cited Mr. Iger\u2019s remarks at a conference hosted by Vox Media in September, when he said he was \u201cnot bullish\u201d on certain traditional media businesses.\nGoogle has also faced pressure to cut costs and thin its ranks. After reporting in October that sales had slowed on YouTube and search, Google\u2019s executives committed to cut hiring in half and reduce spending.\nBut Mr. Kyncl has said cutting a deal for Sunday Ticket wouldn\u2019t be subject to the company\u2019s belt-tightening, said two people familiar with his thinking. He has said it would be a good investment because of the YouTube TV subscribers it would deliver, which could rival the estimated two million subscribers whom DirecTV credits to its current Sunday Ticket deal.\nApple has avoided a slowdown in its business for much of the year, but an outbreak of Covid-19 at its largest iPhone factory in China derailed production and could reduce its sales over the Christmas holidays. Still, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said he believes in investing through a downturn, and a deal with the N.F.L. for a decade would fit that philosophy.\nThe N.F.L. aggressively pursued Apple as a Sunday Ticket partner earlier this year in part because it didn\u2019t have any major business relationships with the tech giant, three people familiar with the talks said. But the urgency cooled afterthe league struck a deal this fall to make Applethe presenting sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show.\nAs Sunday Ticket talks languished, the N.F.L. focused on a separate search for an independent studio that could help produce and distribute football-related movies alongside the league. NFL Films, which makes documentaries and other shows, put out a proposal that drew interest from bidders including Sony, A24, North Road and Skydance, the studio that co-produced \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d according to two people familiar with the search.\nMr. Rolapp, who led negotiations for the league, met with bidders in recent months and settled on Skydance Sports, which will team up with the N.F.L. to develop and distribute film and TV projects. One of the N.F.L.\u2019s biggest objectives is marketing the sport by reaching younger audiences and viewers outside the United States.\nWork on the deal shifted the league\u2019s focus away from Sunday Ticket talks, some of these people said. Only a few top N.F.L. executives are involved in media negotiations, making it difficult for the league to fully engage in numerous simultaneous negotiations. Now that Skydance has been selected, the league is expected to pick back up the Sunday Ticket talks."

        "fulltext": "Protests across Chinaover the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policies shook up global markets over worries that the authorities will take longer to reopen the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The visuals were jarring: Thousands took to the streets over the weekend in the biggest challenge to the authority of the Chinese Communist Party in years.\nThe market response was swift.Exchanges in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed lower, as did those in Japan and Australia. Investor jitters quickly spread west, with Europe down at the open and U.S. futures dropping. Among the stocks to watch: Apple, which was down nearly 2 percent, as investors worry about the company\u2019s iPhone production hubs in China. Crude prices, meanwhile, fell to an 11-month prewar low.\nWhy are Chinese protesting?The demonstrations started after10 people died in a fireon Thursday in Urumqi, a city in Xinjiang where some residents have beenunder lockdownfor more than 100 days. Many Chinese blamed Covid restrictions, saying residents were unable to escape in time and rescue efforts were delayed. (The authorities deny the allegations).\nAnger erupted on social media and thousands took to the streets in multiple cities, including Shanghai, Wuhan and Chengdu, and on university campuses in Beijing, where studentsheld blank sheets of paperto protest widening censorship.\nChinese state media even allegedlycensoredimages of maskless fans at the World Cup in Qatar, after the images hadinfuriated Chinese social media users. Elsewhere, Twitter was reportedly grappling with a deluge of Chinese-language spam content apparently designed todrown out coverage of the protests. In Shanghai, some demonstrators called for Mr. Xi to step down \u2014 an extremely rare public challenge \u2014 and many were arrested, includingtwo foreign journalists.\nDemonstrations are not unheard-of in China,but it is highly unusual for widespread protests in multiple cities on a matter so central to the party\u2019s signature domestic policies.\nZero Covid could be around for a while.The authorities had signaled this month that they would start to ease restrictions that have hammered the economy, raising hopes that the country would soon reopen. But a recent spike in infections has led to more restrictions, with athird of the population put under full or partial lockdownlast week, according to Nomura.\nDeutsche Bank said in a note to clients that the country would not reopen until late spring 2023. \u201cUntil then, we see China\u2019s growth stagnating,\u201d it said.\nSome analysts said the public anger was proof that the strategy was not sustainable and would have to lead to an easing. \u201cIf there\u2019s a glimmer of light, it\u2019s that once the winter infection surge is over China will move to ZCiNO: Zero covid in name only. It cannot keep people locked up,\u201d said George Magnus, an associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Center and former chief economist at UBS.\nBlack Friday sales surge, though the economy weighs on shoppers.By several measures, spending on the closely watched shopping day grew over 2021 \u2014Mastercard estimates 12 percentyear-on-year \u2014 asstores pushed sales. But retailers worry that consumers concerned about high inflation and the prospects of a recession will ultimately spend only ifoffered deep discounts.\nAdidas is said to have been warned of the risks of working with Kanye West.Senior executives were briefed as early as 2018 that putting employees in \u201cdirect exposure\u201d to the rapper and designer, with whom it shared the Yeezy venture,could pose legal headaches, The Wall Street Journal reports. Adidas said last week that it wouldreview workplace misconduct claimsagainst Mr. West, with whom it severed ties last month.\nQatar seeks a record valuation for the Paris Saint-Germain soccer club.The emirate is in talks topotentially sell a stakein the group at a valuation of more than \u20ac4 billion ($4.2 billion), the highest for a club. That could also buoy bids for other soccer franchises on the market, including Inter Milan, Liverpool and Manchester United.\nElon Musk says he would back Ron DeSantis for president.The C.E.O. of Tesla and Twitter is the latest billionaire tooffer support to DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, if he were to run in 2024. Mr. Musk noted on Twitter that he had previously supported Barack Obama and, \u201creluctantly,\u201d Joe Biden for president.\nAdvertisers maintain their distance from Twitter.Multiple ad agencies told The Financial Times that nearly all their big-brand clients hadpaused spending on the platform, citing concern about reduced content policing since Elon Musk took over. Others are reportedly spending a minimal amount in an effort to avoid Mr. Musk personally calling their executives to berate them. Tomorrow: the verified check option for paying subscribers isscheduled to go liveafter a series of delays.\nCrypto asset prices sank again on Monday even as Binance, the industry\u2019s biggest exchange, tried to restore investor trust by pushing for greater transparency across its exchange following the collapse of its rival, FTX, earlier this month. How bad could it get? Mark Mobius, a co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners,told Bloomberg this morningthat his new price target for Bitcoin is $10,000, implying a further drop of nearly 40 percent.\nBinance sought to calm investor nerves.This weekend, Changpeng Zhao, its founder, said that the exchange hadenough Bitcoins on handto meet customer redemptions, and that anyone could track its reserves on a new website. (It\u2019s not yet clear whether Binance has enough Ether or other digital coins in its reserves to ease investor concerns.)\nSince FTX imploded amid a flood of customer withdrawals earlier this month, C.Z., as Mr. Zhao is known, has argued that the industry has to embrace such a proof-of-reserves system. He has increased Binance\u2019s potential commitment to an industry rescue fundto $2 billion; more than 150 companies have applied for the aid. Still, the price of the firm\u2019s native digital token, Binance Coin, has fallen over 5 percent in the past 24 hours.\nElsewhere in crypto:\nThe crypto lender Genesis Global Capital is one of several companies facing inquiries from state regulatorsin a sweeping review of industry practices.

It\u2019s deepening its push into digital advertising even as the industry is in a slump.\nYahoo and Taboola are making a 30-year bet on each other.You read that right: They have signed a three-decade partnership, in which Yahoo will give Taboola the exclusive license to sell its native ads across Yahoo\u2019s sites, with the two sharing revenue from those sales. Yahoo advertisers will also be able to sell their ads on sites across Taboola\u2019s network. They expect the partnership to yield at least $1 billion in annual revenue.\nAs part of the deal, Yahoo will become Taboola\u2019s biggest shareholder and will get a seat on its board.\nThe deal comes despite major advertising headwinds.The sweeping decline in digital ads has battered even internet giants like Google and Facebook, and Taboola has been no exception: Its stock is down nearly 80 percent over the past year. Taboola has been racing with Outbrain, its largest native-advertising rival (and onetime merger partner), to lock up deals with digital publishers.\nBut Yahoo\u2019s C.E.O., Jim Lanzone, said that his company\u2019s still-vast platform \u2014 it claims 900 million monthly users across its properties, including AOL, TechCrunch and Yahoo Sports \u2014 will still depend in part on digital ad dollars. \u201cWe have hundreds of millions of people consuming news and sports and finance on market-leading properties that are heavily monetized through advertising \u2014 and will continue to be,\u201d he said.\n\u2014Anthony Fauci,the White House\u2019s outgoing chief medical adviser, on how the Covid pandemic is far from over.
