        "title": "Congress Asks More Than 80 Companies for Big Tech Complaints",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 House lawmakers have asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, according to four people familiar with the requests.\nThe House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the influence of the tech giants, sent formal requests for information to the companies on Sept. 13.\nThey were asked about their own businesses and how the four tech companies may have engaged in anticompetitive behavior, according to the people who have seen the requests and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawmakers asked to keep the letters private.\nThe bipartisan requests from the committee indicated the increasing scope of the congressional investigation into Silicon Valley\u2019s power and offered more insight to the pressure Big Tech faces in the coming months. Similar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.\nLawmakers sent the requests on the same daythey asked for scores of documents and personal emailsfrom top executives at the four tech companies, according to the people. All of the companies have until mid-October to respond.\nThe additional letters to more than 80 companies show the breadth of the offensive forming against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The recipients of the requests range from smaller firms in retail and advertising to large corporations in entertainment, software and social media, the people said.\nA range of companies, including News Corp., Oracle, Spotify, TripAdvisor and Yelp, have complained about the behavior of the four big tech companies and were likely to have received the requests. It was unclear how the queries to the more than 80 companies are split among the four tech giants.\nOne person familiar with the requests said lawmakers decided against publicizing the requests to protect the complaining companies from potential retribution from the four tech firms \u2014 though those firms have said they do not retaliate against critics.\nCompanies have protested Silicon Valley\u2019s growing size and influence for years, but regulators and lawmakers in Washington have sharply increased their focus on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in recent months.\nThe House investigation is largelycentered on the market power and alleged anticompetitive practices by the four companies. The committee is examining accusations that the big companies favor their own products over rivals, buy smaller firms to head off competition and leverage their size to further cement their dominance.\nLawmakers are also scrutinizing how the companies avoid taxes, are used to spread disinformation and handle people\u2019s personal information.\nLawsuits and investigations could eventually lead to the breakup of some companies and to new laws that alter the balance of corporate power.\nAmazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have said in the past that they face ample competition and do not engage in anticompetitive practices. When asked on Friday about the letter sent to the more than 80 companies, none of the companies offered additional comment.\nThe Wall Street Journalreported earlierthat House lawmakers had sent requests to some of the tech companies\u2019 rivals.\nThe various investigations are just beginning in earnest. How far they will go, what they will uncover and whether any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain.\nIt is also not clear how the tech companies will defend themselves. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive,met with President Trump and held discussions on Capitol Hillabout election security, privacy and other issues.\nSenator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said on Thursday that it was time for the companies to be more upfront with the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of talk from Facebook, and we have a troubling pattern, when they\u2019re up on the Hill, of them saying things that turn out to be either very misleading or at the end of the day it\u2019s just not true or they just don\u2019t follow through on it,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.\nThe Department of Justice sent Google a formal request for information this year, and Facebook has acknowledged it is the subject of an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. When the agencies divided up responsibility for handling competition questions about Silicon Valley this year, the Justice Department also took Apple and the F.T.C. got Amazon.\nState attorneys general around the country have also banded together to start separate investigations into Google and Facebook.\nThe House Judiciary Committee has held multiple public hearings on the subject of the tech companies\u2019 market power as part of its inquiry. It escalated last week when it sent the formal requests to the tech companies and their critics.\nIn a statement last week, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, called the document requests \u201can important milestone\u201d in the fact-gathering stage.\nSeparately on Friday, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, and Mr. Cicilline met with Mr. Zuckerberg, who left the meeting without offering a comment.\nMr. Cicilline said afterward that Mr. Zuckerberg had offered an \u201congoing commitment to cooperate in the investigation, and that\u2019s a whole range of things, obviously document requests, requests for information, participation in a number of different ways.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I take him at his word,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple Steps Into the Movie Business",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Apple is going to the movies.\nThe company, which is set to unveil its Apple Plus TV streaming service on Nov. 1, will enter the film business this fall with theatrical releases of three movies it acquired this year, Apple said on Friday.\nThe effort will expand in 2020, when Apple plans to start producing its own films, some of which are being made in conjunction with the independent movie studio A24, the producer behind \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cLady Bird,\u201d two people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans said. Apple and A24 agreed last year to make movies together.\nThe first movie that Apple has lined up for theatrical release is \u201cElephant Queen,\u201d a documentary centered on a 50-year-old elephant. It will open in theaters in \u201cselect cities\u201d on Oct. 18, the company said, before appearing on Apple TV Plus on the streaming platform\u2019s start date. The film, which the Toronto International Film Festival screened this month, is narrated by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.\nThe next offering will be \u201cHala,\u201d a coming-of-age drama about a Muslim teenager played by Geraldine Viswanathan, who had a role in the 2018 comedy \u201cBlockers.\u201d It will make its debut in what the company described as \u201cselect theaters\u201d on Nov. 22 and go onto the streaming service in December. Apple acquired \u201cHala\u201d after itsdebutat the Sundance Film Festival in February.\nApple will give its widest theatrical release to \u201cThe Banker,\u201d a civil-rights drama set in the 1950s starring Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie. The company acquired worldwide distribution rights for the film in July and will put it in theaters on Dec. 6. While wider than the others, the release will still involve only a limited number of theaters.\n\u201cThe Banker\u201d will be made available onApple TV Plusin January, Apple said.\nApple declined to comment on its plans for going into movie production. The company also did not specify which theaters, or theater chains, if any, would screen the three movies it acquired this year.\nTed Mundorff, the chief executive of Landmark Theaters, the largest independent cinema chain in the country, with 265 screens, questioned Apple\u2019s strategy of putting films in theaters with awards season underway.\n\u201cI\u2019m very skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the film isn\u2019t the right type to attract Academy and critical attention, it shouldn\u2019t be in the marketplace at this time. If it isn\u2019t strong enough for the fourth quarter, it will disappear quickly \u2014 if it can find the right theaters, which it probably will not.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the danger of going up against all the marketing horsepower the other studios are using to get into the Academy conversation,\u201d Mr. Mundorff added.\nIn partnership with A24, Apple is also looking for a 2020 theatrical release of Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cOn the Rocks,\u201d a film that reunites the director with Bill Murray, the star of her 2003 comedic drama, \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d according to the people familiar with Apple\u2019s plans, who were not authorized to speak on the record.\nIn the movie, Mr. Murray portrays the estranged father of a woman played by Rashida Jones. \u201cOn the Rocks\u201d would be the first co-production between Apple and A24 to hit the marketplace.\nMatt Dentler, who managed independent film partnerships for iTunes, is charged with overseeing Apple\u2019s push into feature-film development and acquisition. He reports to Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, the co-heads of Apple\u2019s video programming. Mr. Dentler started his career as an intern at the SXSW Film Festival before becoming its head in 2003.\nApple also recently hired Greg Foster, a former head of entertainment at Imax, as a consultant. Mr. Foster spent 18 years transforming Imax from a large-format exhibitor popular at museums and other cultural institutions into a partner to Hollywood studios that helped jump-start big-budget theatrical releases and encouraged filmmakers like Christopher Nolan to film with Imax cameras."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Has a New Feature: A Lower Price",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple\u2019s product launches have long been full of surprises, but rarely has a price cut been among them.\nOn Tuesday, in a sign that Apple is paying attention to consumers who aren\u2019t racing to buy more expensivephones, the company said the iPhone 11, its entry-level phone, would start at $700, compared with $750 for the comparable model last year.\nApple kept the starting prices of its more advanced models, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, at $1,000 and $1,100. The company unveiled the new phones at a 90-minute press event at its Silicon Valley campus.\nThe cost cut on the iPhone 11 was unexpected because Apple had been raising prices each year as a way to keep revenues afloat whileiPhonesales fell. But Apple might have hit the ceiling this past year. Sales of the two models that began at $1,000 or more lagged expectations, causing the company to cut revenue estimates and eventually slash prices in China to increase demand.\nAt the same time, Apple\u2019s entry-level phone last year \u2014 theiPhone XR, at $750 \u2014 became the company\u2019s best-selling device.\nAnalysts say that one issue with the rising prices has been that new iPhone features haven\u2019t kept up. As a result, many people are holding onto their phones longer. The falling price suggests Apple sees that trend and is trying to entice more people to upgrade.\nApple said it would also still sell older models for even less. The iPhone 8 now costs $450 and the iPhone XR now costs $600.\nApple has rebranded its iPhone line to make the iPhone 11 its entry-level option, while adding a \u201cPro\u201d label to its more expensive models.\nThe move is a departure from Apple\u2019s previous marketing strategy, which gave the cheapest phone a different label that branded it as the discounted model. (It still started at $750.) The iPhone XR became Apple\u2019s best-selling iPhone, while its more expensive models struggled in some markets. Those lagging sales caused Apple to cut revenue estimates earlier this year.\nThe iPhone XR also likely outperformed its costlier cousins in part because tech reviewers considered it to be about as good as the flagship iPhone \u2014 for 25 percent less. Apple has long been in a bind on pricing and developing its line of iPhones, aiming to make the least expensive devices still worth paying hundreds of dollars for without undercutting the pricier models.\nThe rebranding suggests Apple is embracing the lowest-priced iPhone as the device most people will use, while marketing the \u201cPro\u201d devices for the higher end of the market. The company has done the same with its iPads, also labeling its most advanced tablets the iPad Pro.\nThe company introduced three new phones: the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The main difference? Each of the three iPhones gained a new camera lens.\nThe new high-end Pro models include a triple-lens main camera, up from two lenses in last year\u2019s models, and the entry-level iPhone now has a dual-lens camera, up from a single lens in last year\u2019siPhone XR. All the iPhones include a so-called ultrawide angle lens.\nHere\u2019s what that means: The new ultrawide lens take photos with a wider field of view than traditional phone cameras, which makes it handy for shooting landscapes or large group gatherings. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10, which was released this year, also includes an ultrawide angle lens.\nThe second lens on the entry-level iPhone will also make the camera more capable of shooting photos in portrait mode, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while softly blurring the background.\nLast year\u2019s iPhone XR had a single lens and was capable of shooting portrait photos of only human subjects. The second lens in the new entry-level iPhone will let you take portrait shots of nonhuman subjects like food, animals and plants.\nOn the high-end iPhones, the triple-lens system lets users zoom in closer on their subjects. Apple also said it had added a night mode for shooting photos in low light. By default, when users shoot photos in the dark, the camera will automatically make photos look better lit.\nWith its focus on camera tech, Apple is playing catch-up with Google. Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones focus on camera innovations including Night Sight, a popular feature for shooting photos in low light, which led critics to conclude that the search giant had used its prowess in artificial intelligence to surpass Apple in camera tech.\nApple detailed the Apple Watch Series 5. The watch\u2019s most noteworthy new feature is its so-called always-on display. In previous models, the screen would turn on when you tilted your wrist to check the time.\nThe new watch uses a display technology (previously seen in Samsung phones) to keep some pixels activated just to show the time, consuming little power. The screen becomes fully illuminated when you tilt your wrist. Other updates to the watch, including a built-in compass, were minor. The watch starts at $400, the same price as the last model. It will be available on Sept. 20.\nThe company introduced a new version of its entry-level iPad, which costs $330. The new model includes a 10.2-inch screen, up from 9.7 inches. Unlike the previous model, the new tablet is compatible with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard. (Previous iPads worked only with third-party keyboards.)\nThe updated iPad is unremarkable compared with Apple\u2019s high-end iPad Pros, which include sharper screens and infrared face recognition and work with a more advanced Apple stylus. However, the entry-level iPad is Apple\u2019s best-selling tablet, and its investment in the entry-level model shows the company\u2019s commitment to the category even though its sales have slowed down.\nAt last, Apple\u2019s original television shows have a premiere date and price point. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, announced that Apple would begin rolling out original shows and movies on Nov. 1 for $5 per month.\nApple TV Plus, which will be the home of all of Apple\u2019s original content, will be free for a year to users who buy a company product like a new iPhone or a laptop.\nApple announced that on Nov. 1, it would feature a lineup of adult dramas, comedies, children\u2019s programs and documentaries. Those series include four shows the company has released trailers for, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell; \u201cDickinson,\u201d a comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld and Jane Krakowski; \u201cSee,\u201d an epic drama starring Jason Momoa; and \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d a space drama. The launch will also feature other programs, including Oprah Winfrey\u2019s new book club, a Peanuts series called \u201cSnoopy in Space\u201d and a documentary that Apple bought the rights to last year called \u201cThe Elephant Queen.\u201d\nBy year\u2019s end, Apple will have six subscription services, from news to TV to music. Customers who wanted all of them would pay up to $55 a month.\nThe launch date puts Apple in the thick of the so-called streaming wars, which have consumed Hollywood. Disney is rolling out its new streaming service, Disney Plus, on Nov. 12. AT&T\u2019s Warner Media, the home of HBO, Warner Bros. and the DC comic universe, will introduce its own streaming service next year, and will announce new details for it on Oct. 29.\nThe monthly price makes it cheaper than Disney\u2019s service, which will be $7 a month, and is well belowNetflix, which is $13 per month.\nBut questions linger: How will Apple market these programs in the coming months? Which shows will be introduced from the get-go? And will Apple drop all episodes of new series at once like Netflix does, or will it roll them out once a week?\n\u2014 John Koblin\nApple announced it wasgetting into gamingearlier this year. Now we know how much its subscription will cost: $5 a month.\nThe company said its gaming service, Apple Arcade, would be available starting Sept. 19 in more than 150 countries. The service will give users access to more than 100 games that aren\u2019t available elsewhere. The games can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs and on Apple TV.\nApple showed off several of the games on Tuesday, including an undersea-exploration game from the Japanese game maker Capcom and an updated version of the arcade classic Frogger.\nApple Arcade is part of a larger strategy by the company to create a steady, more predictable revenue stream from services as sales of iPhones continue to slide. Apple has also added subscription services for news, music and streaming video.\nApple spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fund the development of new games for Apple Arcade, The Financial Times reported in April. Analysts expect gaming could become a major moneymaker for Apple within the next several years. HSBC analysts forecast its revenues to reach $2.7 billion by 2022, outpacing the company\u2019s news and video subscription services."

        "title": "House Antitrust Panel Seeks Documents From 4 Big Tech Firms",
        "fulltext": "Congress showed the breadth of its investigation into the big tech companies on Friday, making a public demand for scores of documents, including the personal emails and other communications from dozens of top executives.\nRepublicans and Democrats alike on the House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the market power and behavior of the companies, sent letters directly to Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Google.\nThe requests called for all communications to and from eight executives at Amazon, 14 at Apple, 15 at Facebook and 14 at Google.\nWith the request, which waspostedon the committee\u2019s website, the lawmakers sent a not-so-subtle message that executives would be held responsible for the replies, and that the investigation would continue to play out publicly. That has the potential of damaging the brands\u2019 reputations.\nThe companies, once held up as beacons of American ingenuity and business acumen, have been under siege about spreading disinformation, failing to respect users\u2019 privacy and maneuvering to minimize their taxes. In addition, President Trump and other Republicans accuse some of the companies of censoring conservative voices.\nSimilar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and by attorneys general of dozens of states. The investigations are just beginning in earnest. How far they will go, what they will uncover and whether any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain.\nBut the investigations show the growing angst about the power of the tech companies, which for decades faced little regulation. Now Silicon Valley\u2019s influence on everything from how we vote to how we shop is readily apparent \u2014 and yet the technology driving it remains largely mysterious.\n\u201cThere is this great and growing dependence on technology that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d said A. Douglas Melamed, a former antitrust official in Justice Department. \u201cAnd that frightens people.\u201d\nHouse lawmakers were expected to demand internal corporate documents and communications as part of their antitrust investigation. But such demands are often made to a company\u2019s top lawyer. And the committee asked for all communications related to a long list of corporate actions, like Google\u2019s purchase of ad companies, Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of other social networks and Amazon\u2019s handling of its private-label products.\nBy releasing its requests, the House committee offered a glimpse of the depth of the scrutiny that the companies will face and laid out the lines of investigation. The lawmakers are looking for signs of executives\u2019 intent when they made decisions that harmed competitors, according to a person close to the congressional investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawmakers\u2019 plans were private.\nThe information the committee collects can also feed the other investigations, and help lawmakers more sharply question witnesses under oath in hearings, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.\n\u201cThose interrogations take on an entirely different tone,\u201d said Mr. Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThis is a significant escalation of the process.\u201d\nThe inquiries into individual companies are complex; the tech giants span a range of digital markets, including internet search, advertising, e-commerce and social media. And the companies are likely to resist some of the requests, contending they could reveal trade secrets.\nThe companies will almost certainly try to narrow the scope and reduce the volume of the documents they deliver. But the House investigators have leverage. These are document \u201crequests\u201d but backed by the threat of subpoenas if the companies do not comply.\nThe communications habits of the individual companies will also play a role in determining how much evidence there is and in what form.\nAt Amazon, for example, Mr. Bezos writes brief emails to make announcements or delegate, but largely gives feedback and discusses issues in person. He is well known internally for forwarding customer complaints to staffers with just a \u201c?,\u201d leaving teams scrambling to resolve the issue.\nHe has developed a rigid process for making decisions at Amazon that heavily relies on paper documents \u2014 called six-pagers for their length \u2014 that lay out the plan and reasoning for a proposed strategy. They often include hefty appendices and are presented to executives in long meetings where they are read and discussed.\nLawsuits and investigations could eventually lead to the breakup of some companies and to new laws that alter the balance of corporate power.\nBut there are numerous examples of tech executives\u2019 correspondence turning up as evidence in legal cases. Emails from Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, were key evidence in the Justice Department\u2019s successful lawsuit against Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books.\n\u201cWow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,\u201d Mr. Jobswrote in a 2010 emailto a colleague after Apple opened an e-bookstore that prompted Amazon to change how it sold e-books.\nIn response to the committee\u2019s requests, representatives of the companies mainly pointed to their previous public statements: They have consistently said they would cooperate with the federal and state investigations, and would seek to demonstrate that they operate in dynamic, highly competitive markets.\nIn a statement, Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, called the document requests \u201can important milestone\u201d in the fact-gathering stage.\nMr. Cicilline also emphasized the effort\u2019s bipartisan nature. The letters to chief executives are signed by Mr. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat; Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and the ranking Republicans on the committee and the subcommittee, Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.\nThe formal requests for information begin with cover letters to the chief executives, saying the investigators are examining competition in online markets and \u201cwhether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct.\u201d The letters are accompanied by detailed lists of the requested documents and communications.\nIt is unclear how much investigative work will become public as the various inquiries progress. At later stages, when investigators are trying to lay the groundwork for a suit, they won\u2019t want to show their hand to a potential corporate defendant.\nSuch work \u2014 collecting more documents, taking depositions, assembling evidence and building the narrative of corporate misbehavior \u2014 is best done in secrecy. Major antitrust investigations typically last many months or years.\nSometimes, companies themselves make disclosures about an investigation. Google, for example, said last week that its parent company, Alphabet, had received a mandatory request for information from the Justice Department about previous antitrust investigations.\nThe House\u2019s document requests indicate that its staff has closely studied the companies.\nThe request sent to Google, for example, seeks communications to or from senior executives on a series of company moves including Google\u2019s purchase of DoubleClick in 2008 and AdMob in 2011. Those acquisitions helped build up Google\u2019s huge and lucrative ad business.\nHouse investigators also want to see the executives\u2019 communications on Google practices: One request is for communications on its policy on \u201cwhether non-Google companies can provide competing ad networks\u201d and other services.\nThat part of the House inquiry echoes that of the states\u2019 investigation of Google. The Texas attorney general\u2019s office, which is leading that effort, sent Google a lengthy demand this week for information on its ad business, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\nBut the House investigation is broader. Its request touches other businesses, including smartphone software, seeking information on Google\u2019s purchase of Android in 2005.\nThe House requests for the other companies are similarly detailed. From Amazon, the investigators asked for information on fees charged to sellers on its online marketplace, algorithms for ranking products for sale, favored treatment for Amazon-branded products and bundling of marketing benefits for vendors that also use the company\u2019s distribution service, Fulfillment by Amazon.\nThe House committee asked Apple about its technology forranking apps in its App Store, its policy on links to non-Apple payment systems and whether iPhone users can choose non-Apple services by default.\nThe document sent to Facebook asks for extensive internal information about its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, which were potentially emerging competitors until they were bought.\nThe House committee asks for company documents related to the \u201cstrategic value\u201d and \u201cany antitrust risks associated with acquiring\u201d those companies.\nThe House document also requests information on any Facebook decisions that limit third-party apps\u2019 access, including a version of the company\u2019s \u201cplatform policy,\u201d which it withdrew last year and could be read as a policy intended to keep competing technology off Facebook.\nAccording to the House document, the policy said apps should \u201cadd something unique to the community\u201d and continued, \u201cDon\u2019t replicate core functionality that Facebook already provides.\u201d"

        "title": "The Week in Business: Walmart Takes a Stand on Gun Control, and Brexit Goes Off the Rails",
        "fulltext": "Just when you thought things couldn\u2019t get crazier with Brexit, the China trade war and online privacy issues \u2014 well, they did. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the biggest stories in business and tech, and what to know for the week ahead. \u2014Charlotte Cowles\nOne month after a gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart store in Texas, the retail giant (unlike Washington lawmakers) isactually doing something about it. Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said it would stop selling ammunition for military-style assault rifles and handguns,phase out the sale of handgunsentirely and request that customers not openly carry weapons in its stores, even in states where it\u2019s legal. He also called on the government to tighten gun regulations. Obviously, the decision has irked some customers, and will leave Walmart with a smaller share of the nation\u2019s gun and ammunition market. Still, the company\u2019s stock rose after the announcement. And itraises a question: What role should corporations play in the gun control debate?\nWe all know that tech companies track people\u2019s online behavior to sell ads and make money. But here\u2019s a twist: It\u2019s illegal to collect the personal data of children under 13 without a parent\u2019s consent, and the internet hasn\u2019t exactly been checking IDs. Now Googlemust pay a record $170 million fineto settle charges that it knowingly harvested personal information from children watching videos on YouTube and then used it to target them with ads that were a littletooage appropriate. The company promised to do better, but stopped short of admitting any wrongdoing. Critics are skeptical that the settlement will change much, especially since the fine is peanuts considering Google\u2019s billions in ad revenue.\nAfterdevastating the Bahamas, Hurricane Dorianpummeled the Carolinas, where it caused powerfailures, business closings, tornadoes and general mayhem. The cost of the damage remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Residents shouldn\u2019t count on much help from the government or insurance companies. The Trump administration issitting atop tens of billions of dollars in unspent recovery moneyallocated to help Americans rebuild after major disasters like this one, which may explain why many Carolinians are still digging out from last year\u2019s Hurricane Florence. And the number of Americans with flood insurance is on the decline (fewer than 15 percent of homesin floodplains have it), even as major storms become more frequent.\nMarkets around the world rejoiced at the news thattrade talks between China and the United States would resume(again) in early October. But there\u2019s little reason to believe that this round of negotiations will go better than before \u2014 which is to say, anywhere at all. Both countries imposed yet more tariffs on imports from each other last Sunday, and plan to raise them again in December if no deal comes about. (Picture a global game of chicken, with a lot of collateral damage.) Adding to China\u2019s headaches: Pro-democracy protests in Hong Konghave been gumming up the city\u2019s international airport, a major hub for Asian business travelers.\nFinally ready to relinquish your decrepit old phone? Apple will unveil your latest iPhone options at its annual event Tuesday. The new phones arerumored to beslightly thicker, more water-resistant and harder to shatter than previous versions \u2014 good news for those who\u2019ve cut their thumbs while desperately typing on a broken screen.

But if you decide to let your current device limp through another year or two, you\u2019re in good company \u2014 owners arewaiting longer and longerto replace their smartphones, causing sales to decline for the last few years.\nIt\u2019s the same old mess, but with a few new snags. Britain is hurtling toward itsOct. 31deadline for pulling out of the European Union, but \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 Parliamentis still divided on how to go about it. Boris Johnson, the country\u2019s new prime minister, had a particularly rough week when lawmakers rejected his request for a snap election, which would have shored up his proposal to leave with or without an actual plan. They also passed a bill that would prohibit a no-deal Brexit, and it\u2019s expected to become law as soon as this week. In other words, Brexit can\u2019t happen without an agreement, but no one can agree \u2014 democracy at its finest.\nFacebookintroduced its dating service, which will allow users to merge their Facebook and Instagram accounts to stalk \u2014 er,find\u2014 potential love matches. The feature also lets people make \u201cSecret Crush\u201d lists, so you can tag your romantic interest without anyone finding out (well, anyone besides Facebook, of course). Speaking of co-opted social media: Leaders from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoftmet with government officialsin Silicon Valley on Wednesday to discuss measures against foreign meddling in the 2020 election.

        "title": "Google Antitrust Investigation Outlined by State Attorneys General",
        "fulltext": "The state attorneys general from four dozen states officially declared on Monday that they were beginning investigations into the market power and corporate behavior of big tech companies.\nThe formal declaration, delivered from the steps of the United States Supreme Court by a bipartisan group of state officials, adds investigative muscle and political momentum to the intensifying scrutiny of the tech giants by federal watchdog agencies and Congress.\nThe states are focusing on two targets: Facebook and Google.\nLetitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York,announced on Friday that a bipartisan group was investigating Facebook. That came with a simple press statement. The event on Monday, formally announcing the Google investigation and discussing Facebook, was a news conference in the nation\u2019s capital.\nKen Paxton, the Republican attorney general of Texas, another large state with a sizable legal staff, is taking a lead role in the Google inquiry.\nIn a statement, Mr. Paxton noted that there was nothing wrong with a company becoming big and powerful. But, he said, \u201cwe have seen evidence that Google\u2019s business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users\u2019 privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.\u201d\nThe state inquiries coincide with bipartisan scrutiny of the tech companies in Washington, by House and Senate committees, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials are examining the practices of Amazon and Apple as well as those of Facebook and Google.\nThe states can play a key role, often in concert with federal regulators and Congress, in building evidence and public support for major investigations. That was the pattern in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.\nThe highly public declaration on Monday was partly political theater, but it was also seen as a signal of the states\u2019 commitment.\n\u201cThis kind of high-profile announcement creates expectations, and it does put pressure on the federal agencies to follow through \u2014 to seriously investigate these companies,\u201d said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. \u201cAnd by making it bipartisan, they are wisely laying the groundwork for what could be a lengthy and far-reaching investigation.\u201d\nLawsuits and investigations could eventually lead to the breakup of some companies and to new laws that alter the balance of corporate power.\nThe investigation into Google has been joined by 48 states as well as the attorneys general for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The states that have not joined the inquiry are Alabama and California, the home to Google and Facebook, Mr. Paxton said at the news conference.\nMajor antitrust inquiries can take years, whether they result in legal action or not.\nThe states have been looking at the big tech companies amid rising concerns about their power in markets and their influence in public communication and political debate. The states formed a multistate unit called the Tech Industry Working Group months ago.\nThey steadily built up support, both getting bipartisan backing and enough states to marshal the legal resources to pursue in-depth investigations and potentially an antitrust suit.\nEach investigation has a smaller core group of states, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. And they are supported by a larger collection of states that agree to join the effort.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re just beginning, but this is going to be a thorough investigation,\u201d said Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado.\nColorado is a member of the core group in both the Facebook and the Google investigations, and Mr. Weiser is an antitrust expert, having served as a federal antitrust official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about having the legal and intellectual firepower for these investigations,\u201d he said.\nUnlike the Microsoft case, which focused on a single company, the concerns about today\u2019s tech giants cover a range of markets and issues.\nThe various investigations reach beyond the companies\u2019 size, wealth and market power \u2014 the usual concerns of antitrust regulators. The companies\u2019 handling of consumer data, their ad-targeting practices and their role as gatekeepers of communication are all under scrutiny, both in the United States and in Europe.\nIn 2017, Josh Hawley, who was the attorney general of Missouri, began an investigation of Google. At the time, it was a lonely pursuit. He said the large, bipartisan effort announced on Monday was a sign of the times.\n\u201cThis really speaks to the increased awareness and concern\u201d surrounding the big tech companies, said Mr. Hawley, now a Republican senator from Missouri. \u201cThey\u2019re hearing from people in their states.\u201d"

        "title": "Iger Departs Board of Apple, Disney\u2019s New Streaming Competitor",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, has resigned from the board of Apple, whose growing Hollywood operation would have made it harder for him to fully engage as one of its directors.\nMr. Iger, 68, resigned on Tuesday, according to an Apple filing on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also on Tuesday, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, announced that Apple TV Plus, a subscription streaming service, will make itsdebut on Nov. 1 and cost $5 a month.\nApple TV Plus will offer a limited number of original television shows and films. But its arrival puts Apple in the thick of Hollywood\u2019s so-called streaming wars. Disney owns Hulu and ESPN Plus, a sports service;Disney Plus, dedicated to all things Disney, Marvel, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Pixar and National Geographic, will arrive on Nov. 12 and cost $7 a month.\nThose offerings will join the subscription services Netflix, Amazon Prime and CBS All Access. WarnerMedia, owned by AT&T, will enter the fray with HBO Max next year.\nMr. Iger joined the Apple board in 2011, a month after the death of Steven P. Jobs, one of the company\u2019s founders. (Mr. Jobs had sat on the Disney board since the sale of his Pixar Animation Studios to Disney in 2006.) When Mr. Iger became an Apple director, the company was still fully focused on computers, smartphones and tablets. More recently, as iPhone sales have slowed, Apple has started to look more seriously at the entertainment business \u2014 Disney\u2019s bailiwick.\nMr. Iger told Bloomberg Televisionin April that he was careful to step out of Apple board meetings whenever the topic of an Apple streaming service came up. He said at the time that those moments were relatively infrequent because the board primarily focused on Apple\u2019s biggest businesses.\n\u201cSo far it\u2019s been O.K.,\u201d Mr. Iger told Bloomberg. \u201cI\u2019m in constant discussion about it.\u201d\nMr. Iger declined to comment on his resignation beyond a statement.\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for Tim Cook, his team at Apple and for my fellow board members,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cApple is one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, known for the quality and integrity of its products and its people, and I am forever grateful to have served as a member of the company\u2019s board.\u201d\nApple called Mr. Iger an \u201cexemplary\u201d board member, one of Apple\u2019s \u201cmost trusted business partners\u201d and \u201ca role model for an entire generation\u201d of leaders.\n\u201cMore than anything, Bob is our friend,\u201d Apple continued. \u201cHe leads with his heart, and he has always been generous with his time and advice. While we will greatly miss his contributions as a board member, we respect his decision, and we have every expectation that our relationship with both Bob and Disney will continue far into the future.\u201d\nMr. Iger\u2019s departure leaves Apple with seven members on its board, the smallest among the large technology companies. Facebook has eight directors; Amazon and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have 10; and Microsoft has 14.\nAs the companies expand into new industries, there are more potential conflicts for their board members. For instance, Apple\u2019s chairman, Arthur D. Levinson, a former chief of Genentech, is also an executive at Alphabet, where he has run a unit developing life-extension technology since 2013."

        "title": "This Week in Business: E-Cigarettes Take a Hit, and Gig Workers Get Good News",
        "fulltext": "It was a good week for soybean farmers and a bad one for \u201cFroopy\u201d e-cigarettes. What are those, you ask? Read on and learn.\n\nDessert-flavored e-cigarettes willsoon be bannedas part of a federal crackdown on the growing trend of teenage vaping.Spearheaded by President Trump and the Food and Drug Administration, the initiativecame aftersix deaths in the United States were linked to a vaping-related lung illness, and officials are investigating hundreds of similar cases across the country. By outlawing child-friendly e-cigarette flavors likeStrawberry Milk and \u201cFroopy\u201d(tastes like Froot Loops, yum?), officials hope to discourage young people from adopting a potentially deadly habit. Some members of the$2.6 billion vaping industryhave called the measures \u201canti-business,\u201d and argue that e-cigarettes are still far less damaging than actual cigarettes \u2014 but that\u2019s hardly a ringing endorsement.\nIn a victory for struggling gig workers, Californiapassedlegislationrequiring businesses that rely on them \u2014 like ride-hailing companies and delivery services \u2014 to treat them as employees. That would require those companies to provide their gig labor force with benefits like paid sick leave and minimum wages. Uber, one of the bill\u2019s main targets, claimed that the measure did not apply to its drivers, and waspromptly sued. Other companies dependent on the gig economy, like Postmates, Lyft and TaskRabbit, are generally confused about what to do, especially ifother states follow California\u2019s lead. On a related note, Uberlaid off over 400 actual employees\u2014 about 8 percent of its product and engineering teams \u2014 earlier in the week.\nIt\u2019s a start. Late in the week, Chinamade its first large purchaseof American soybeans in months and said it wouldexclude some American agricultural goods(including pork and, yes, soybeans) from additional tariffs. The concession followed Mr. Trump\u2019s promise todelay his next round of tariffsby two weeks, which he called a \u201cgesture of good will.\u201d It\u2019s hardly an olive branch, but it\u2019s clear that both sides are trying to calm tensions before they head into yet another round of trade talks in October. Still, the chances of a quick resolution remain low. For now, many analysts believe the best we can hope for is a d\u00e9tente, although Mr. Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to a smaller-scale interim deal.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates in response to the slowing global economy. The question is, by how much? Mr. Trump recently tweeted that Fed officials (or \u201cboneheads,\u201das he called them) should slash rates to zero or below \u2014 whichhas never been done in the United States, but is technically possible. Analysts are expecting a rate decrease ofa quarter percentage point, but with the China trade war roiling markets, it\u2019s tough to predict anything these days. Meanwhile, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan will also set monetary policy this week, painting a fuller picture of exactly how worried we should be about the world\u2019s economic state.\nIt seems impossible to come up with a settlement befitting the devastation of the opioid crisis, but lawyers are still trying. Last week, thousands of plaintiffsreached a tentative dealwith Purdue Pharma \u2014 which developed and marketed the addictive painkiller OxyContin \u2014 and its owners, the Sackler family. Under the terms, Purdue Pharma would file for bankruptcy and OxyContin would be sold by a new company, with the proceeds going to plaintiffs. Purdue Pharma would also donate drugs for addiction treatment. And the Sacklers \u2014 whose pockets were lined by opioid sales \u2014 would have to pay $3 billion in cash. But the details aren\u2019t final yet, and some plaintiffs want to pursue the Sacklers\u2019 money further.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson continues his losing campaign for a potential no-deal Brexit, which could wreakeconomic havoc. (Think: shortages of food, medications and fuel.) Last week, matters reached a new level of absurdity when Parliament was suspended and a government official called Black Rodparaded in protestthrough the House of Commons carrying a sword and, well, an actual black rod. A Scottish courthas already ruledthat Mr. Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament is illegal, and the high court in London will weigh in this week. Stay tuned for more theatrics.\nMore than145 executives, including the heads of Twitter, Uber, Airbnb and the Gap,signed a letterto the Senate calling for stronger gun control measures \u2014 yet another sign that the business world is taking a stand on what had been a mostly political issue. In other news,Hasbro will release Ms. Monopoly, a new version of its board game that features female characters and pays women more than men. And speaking of fantasies coming true, Applereleased its latest fleet of iPhones last week, and they\u2019re significantly cheaper than previous new versions."

        "title": "How to Make the Most of Apple\u2019s New Privacy Tools in iOS 13",
        "fulltext": "To get the latest security protections against viruses, exploits and whatever other nasty stuff is out there, it\u2019s wise to keep the software for our devices updated.\nForiPhones, that\u2019s especially true now. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s iOS 13, the most recent mobile software for iPhones, arrived last week. Similar updates to iPadOS, the operating system for iPads, were released this week. And they offer many new tools that help safeguard our digital privacy.\nApplewalked me through a list of the new privacy features. Among them is a shortcut to automatically create a burner email address for signing in to apps. The software also has a call-silencing feature to shut down robocallers. And there are new buttons to minimize sharing of location data with third parties.\nIn an era whendigital privacy is in the spotlight, these tools are more than welcome. So I tested iOS 13 for a week to figure out which of the new features are easy to use and how best to take advantage of those items that are buried in the system settings. (Android users, stay tuned for a similar how-to guide on Google\u2019s new privacy tools soon.)\nOne word on when you should adopt iOS 13: New operating systems are typically chock-full of software bugs, and this one is no exception. So it would behoove most iPhone owners to wait a few weeks for those glitches to be fixed before installing the free update.\nFor now, bookmark this column to find out more about iOS 13\u2019s top new privacy features. Then return to it after you download the update.\nApple\u2019s most significant new privacy tool in iOS 13 is a button that lets you use an Apple ID to sign in to apps and websites. It\u2019s called Sign in with Apple.\nVersions of this already exist elsewhere. Google andFacebook, for instance, let you use your Google or Facebook accounts to log in to different websites and apps. But Sign in with Apple has a special privacy-centric twist.\nWhen you use it to register for a website or app, iOS 13 will present you with an option to hide your email address that is linked to your Apple ID. If you choose to use it, Apple will create what is essentially a burner email address so that you can sign up for the app or website while hiding your real email address from the third party.\nWhenever the website or app then tries to contact you, it will email the burner address and not your real email address. Apple will forward the note to you so you are aware of it. Then if a business starts sending spam to the burner email address, you can easily delete your account and the business won\u2019t have your real email address.\nI tested Sign in with Apple with a few apps like the travel-booking app Kayak. It worked smoothly. Here\u2019s how: When I opened the Kayak app, the button labeled Sign in with Apple showed up. After clicking through, I saw the option to hide your email address. From there, Apple generated a random string of characters as a burner address and automatically set a password for the account.\nSign in with Apple then made logging in and out of the Kayak app a breeze. I didn\u2019t have to memorize the burner email address or password; after signing out of the app or website, I signed back in by scanning my face and using Apple\u2019s Face ID biometric system.\nThere are some downsides. If you try to sign in with the burner email account on, say, a web browser that lacks Sign in with Apple, you will have to manually enter the email address and reset the password.\nSo this feature is most convenient with apps and sites that you plan to use primarily on the iPhone, to spare you the hassle of jotting down strange email addresses and their passwords.\nRobocallers can make random calls to you throughout the day, which is invasive. But a new option in iOS 13 lets you silence calls coming from all unknown numbers. I had mixed feelings about this tool, which I\u2019ll explain in a bit.\nTo turn on the feature, you open the Settings app, open the Phone menu and toggle on the switch for Silence Unknown Callers. When an unknown caller then tries to call, you will see a notification on your screen, but the phone won\u2019t vibrate or ring. The caller is sent to voice mail.\nThis is a brute-force approach to shutting out robocallers, which makes it imperfect. When I tested this feature, I blocked six spam calls \u2014 but also missed several important work-related calls from people who were not yet in my address book.\nStill, Apple\u2019s tool is a decent temporary solution compared withseveral robocall-blocking appsthat I have tested over the last several years. All of those were ineffective and let plenty of scam calls through.\nUnbeknown to many of us, thousands ofapps have been collecting our location dataand selling the information to advertisers, retailers and hedge funds.\nNew buttons in iOS 13 help address this issue. In the past, when opening a newly downloaded app that wanted access to your location, you had the option of always sharing location data, sharing it only when the app was in use or never sharing location. Now when you open an app that is asking for your location, you can tap \u201cAllow Once.\u201d\nIf you tap it, you are explicitly giving the app permission to share your location that one time. That eliminates the app\u2019s ability to continue pulling your location data in the background when you are not using it.\nThe annoying part of this is that if you tap Allow Once, you will be asked how you want to share your location data every time you open the app. But it\u2019s worth using for peace of mind if you don\u2019t fully trust an app that wants your location \u2014 a weather app from an unknown start-up, for example.\nSimilarly, iOS 13 now requires that apps ask for permission to gain access to your Bluetooth sensor, the chip that you typically use to wirelessly connect to accessories like earphones. That can stop many retailers and brands that have deployed Bluetooth-sensing beacons throughout their physical stores from knowing when you have entered their location.\nFor apps that clearly don\u2019t use this sensor for anything other than detecting your location \u2014 like the Macy\u2019s app \u2014 you may choose to reject access.\nThere\u2019s one more important new feature in iOS 13 related to location sharing that has to do with your camera.\nWhen you take photos, the camera records metadata by default, including where the photo was taken. Photo apps use this feature to automatically organize your photo albums by place. But if you share an image containing location metadata on social media or in messages, you could give away sensitive information like where you live or work.\nWith iOS 13, you can strip metadata from a photo before sharing it. In the Photos app, you choose the photo and tap the icon of a square with an arrow pointing upward. Then click Options, and for the option that says Location, switch it to the off position. Then you can share the photo without revealing your whereabouts.\nOver all, these are thoughtful additions to iOS. Although some of these features feel overdue, Apple\u2019s software system is better equipped to protect our privacy than its main rival, Google\u2019s Android.\nMost important, Apple\u2019s descriptions of the features are written in plain language for casual users. For example, when Macy\u2019s asked for access to my Bluetooth, Apple\u2019s notification warned that the app could use the sensor to know when I am nearby.\nIt\u2019s disturbing to realize by getting all these new privacy tools now that our data was ever exposed like this to begin with. These are all features we have desperately needed in the constant struggle to protect our digital privacy."

        "title": "IPhone 11 and 11 Pro Review: Thinking Differently in the Golden Age of Smartphones",
        "fulltext": "Over more than a decade of writing about technology, reviewing a new iPhone has long been one of my simplest assignments.\nYear after year, the formula was this: I tested the most important new features of Apple\u2019slatest smartphoneand assessed whether they were useful. Assuming the newest iPhone worked well, I generally recommended upgrading if you had owned your existing smartphone for two years.\nBut with this review of theiPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max\u2014 which Apple unveiled last week and will become available Friday \u2014 I\u2019m encouraging a different approach. The bottom line? It\u2019s time to reset our upgrade criteria.\nThat\u2019s because we are now living in the golden age of smartphones, when the gadgets\u2019 improvements each year are far from seismic. Devices that debuted three years ago remain zippy and more than capable. Those with the iPhone 7 from 2016, for example, still have a very good phone with a stellar camera and fast speeds.\nSo now is the moment to ask: Do we really need toupgrade our iPhonesevery two years?\nBased on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don\u2019t get me wrong: The newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs.\nBut none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren\u2019t a big leap forward fromlast year\u2019s iPhonesor even theiPhone Xfrom 2017.\nSo here\u2019s what I ultimately suggest: You should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.\nI tested the new iPhones for a week, starting with the $700 entry-level iPhone 11 with a 6.1-inch display, which I used as my primary phone for three days. Then I switched to the iPhone 11 Pro, the $1,000 model with a 5.8-inch screen, for two days. And then finally the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the $1,100 model with a jumbo 6.5-inch screen, for another two days.\nThen I compared the results with my notes and photos from testing the iPhone X in 2017. What I found was that the iPhone 11 was better, but not profoundly so.\nAll the iPhone 11 models have a new ultra-wide-angle lens in their cameras, which provides a wider field of view than traditional phone cameras. This makes them handy for shooting landscapes or large group gatherings. The iPhone X lacks the ultra-wide-angle lens, but its dual-lens camera is capable of shooting portrait-mode photos, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while softly blurring the background.\nThe newest iPhones all have the same computing processor, A13 Bionic, which is about 50 percent faster than the iPhone X. While that may sound significant, the iPhone X is already incredibly fast at shooting photos and running apps and games.\nThe new iPhones all have longer battery life. Even after a day of heavy use, which included taking phone calls, using maps and shooting lots of photos, each iPhone had lots of juice remaining \u2014 at least 30 percent \u2014 by bedtime. After similar tests with an iPhone X two years ago, the battery had about 15 percent left by bedtime.\nThe back of the Pro models is composed of a rugged glass that makes them scratch-resistant. This is impressive, but if you\u2019re spending $1,000 on a phone, you will probably protect it with a case that covers the back anyway \u2014 just as many iPhone X owners do.\nThe Pro models have OLED displays that are slightly brighter than the screen on the iPhone X.\nThere are lots of little things that are somewhat better on the new iPhones than on the two-year-old iPhone X. For early adopters who are keen to have the latest and greatest tech, those differences may add up to a substantial upgrade.\nBut for most of us, the upgrades won\u2019t meaningfully change our phone experience.\nThe most noteworthy new feature on the iPhones 11s is the ultra-wide-angle lens. Using the ultrawide mode is simple and seamless: You pinch outward to zoom all the way out. On a beach, the wider view captured my dogs playing on the sand, the ocean waves and the adjacent highway.\nThe telephoto lens on the iPhone 11 Pro did an exceptional job zooming in on my dog Mochi\u2019s snout as she shook some water off her head.\nThe new iPhones also have a new mode for shooting photos in low light. Once the camera detects that a setting is very dark, it automatically captures multiple pictures and then fuses them together while making adjustments to colors and contrast. The result was that photos taken in low light without flash look brighter, in a natural way.\nPhotos taken with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro looked crisp and clear, and their colors were accurate. But after I finished these tests, I looked back at my archived photos taken with an iPhone X.\nThose pictures, especially the ones shot with portrait mode, still looked impressive. Some of the low-light ones looked crummy in comparison with the ones taken by the iPhone 11s, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend that you buy a new phone just to get better night photos. You could always just use flash.\nEach year, the most common question I get from friends and colleagues is whether they should buy a new iPhone. So here\u2019s a list of considerations in any decision about upgrading.\nThe simplest place to start is software. Apple\u2019s newest mobile operating system,iOS 13, will work only on iPhones from 2015 (the iPhone 6S) and later. So if you have an iPhone that is older than that, it is worth upgrading because once you can no longer update the operating system, some of your apps may stop working properly.\nFor those with younger iPhones, there are ways to get more mileage out of your current device. While the newest iPhones have superb battery life \u2014 several hours longer than the last generation \u2014 a fresh battery in your existing gadgetcosts only $50 to $70and will greatly extend its life.\nIf you have the iPhone 6S from 2015 and the iPhone 7 from 2016, the iPhone 11s are speedier, with camera improvements and bigger displays. That makes an upgrade nice to have but not a must-have.\nBut if you spent $1,000 on an iPhone X two years ago, then hold off. The iPhone 11s just aren\u2019t enough of an innovation leap to warrant $700-plus on a new smartphone.\nIf you wait another year or two, you will most likely be rewarded with that jump forward. That might be an iPhone that works with fast 5G cellular networks, or a smartphone that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch.\nPatience has its benefits \u2014 and so will breaking free of the iPhone\u2019s automatic two-year upgrade cycle."
