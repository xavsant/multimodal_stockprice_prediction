        "title": "Is Your Child a Phone \u2018Addict\u2019?",
        "fulltext": "On the heels oftwo large Apple investors urging the company to address kids\u2019 phone addiction, many parents may be wondering: How do I know if my child is addicted to his or her smartphone? And how can I prevent problematic overuse?\nThere are reasons for concern. A2016 survey from Common Sense Mediafound that half of teenagers felt addicted to their devices, and 78 percent checked their devices at least hourly. Seventy-two percent of teens felt pressured to respond immediately to texts, notifications and social media messaging.A 2015 Pew Research reportfound that 73 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds had their own smartphones or had access to one, and 24 percent said they were online \u201calmost constantly.\u201d\nI have spent the past 15 years helping teens with organization and time management. Many parents of kids I work with are conflicted about their teens\u2019 smartphone use. They appreciate the convenience of having access to their children and the potential safety benefits. And, in an age of social media socialization, teenagers use messaging apps to stay in touch with friends and make social plans, some of which can be positive.\nWhen a high school student I work with broke his neck playing football this past fall, his smartphone became a crucial link not just to friends, but also to others dealing with similar injuries. After watching videos of others documenting their recovery on YouTube, he connected with some via Facebook Messenger and began conversations he found \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201d\nInstead of becoming overly fixated on teens\u2019 smartphone use in general, it is important to think about \u201cwhat are the applications on the smartphone and how is your particular child using the applications on that smartphone,\u201d said Katie Davis, assistant professor at the University of Washington and co-director of theUW Digital Youth Lab, whose research explores the role of new media technologies in young people\u2019s personal, social and academic lives. Parents trying to monitor use can have difficulty distinguishing abusive behavior from appropriate use, especially since teens use their devices for both schoolwork and free time, often simultaneously.\nFor some teens, the constant potential feedback loop from notifications and messaging might create a fear of missing out, or FOMO. And although there is currently no official medical recognition of \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d as a disease or disorder, the term refers to obsessive behaviors that disturb the course of daily activities in a way that mirrors patterns similar to substance abuse.\nHere are some questions to ask: Does your teenager\u2019s mood suddenly change and become intensely anxious, irritable, angry or even violent when the phone is taken away or unavailable for use? Does your teen skip or not participate in social events because of time spent on the phone? Another red flag is spending so much time on a smartphone that it affects personal hygiene and normal daily activities (most notably, sleep). Lying, hiding and breaking family rules to spend more time on a smartphone can be cause for alarm, said Hilarie Cash, a psychotherapist and the chief clinical officer atreSTART, an internet addiction rehabilitation program outside of Seattle.\nIn my work with students, I\u2019ve found that even teenagers who want to curb their phone use may find it difficult to self-regulate without parental guidance. Creating daily and weekly offline time as part of the family routine is helpful, and finding a way to have a once- or twice-yearly extended period of time off \u2014 at a summer camp or outdoor expedition without Wi-Fi, or on a family trip \u2014 may provide the reset teens need to break negative habits.\nSouth Korean researchers developed and tested a10-item questionnaireto determine adolescent smartphone addiction. The brief questionnaire, published in the journal PLOS One in December 2013, asks users to answer statements like whether they have missed work because of smartphone use, have had a hard time concentrating in class because they were thinking about their phones and whether they became impatient when not using a smartphone.\nFor parents thinking of getting their kids smartphones, providing incremental and compartmentalized access can help establish good habits and prevent problematic dependency. Parents sometimes hand down their old iPhones as a first phone for a child in elementary school. I encourage parents to get their kids flip phones first, and wait until they have developed good overall habits before giving them a smartphone.\nJust as kids learn to ride bikes with training wheels or get junior licenses when they learn to drive, kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to manage their first smartphones all by themselves. Fortunately, there are ways to manage use and help kids develop better tendencies, and much of it requires a delicate balance of parental modeling and involvement.\nTaking the time to discuss appropriate use, establish guidelines and come up with a family agreementbeforekids get a phone is ideal, because it can be harder to put rules in place afterward. Family agreements can include rules about when and how the phone may be used, and potential consequences for broken rules. Agreements are more likely to be successful if they are followed consistently and revisited frequently as kids grow older and new apps become available.\nFor parents of teens who have smartphones, making the effort to understand how, where and why kids are spending time on their phone is critical.\nIt can be helpful to think about imbalances over a span of time rather than on a single evening or weekend. After all, binge-watching a television series on a smartphone while feeling sick or heartbroken isn\u2019t the same as lying about phone use over an extended period of time. An app likeMomentcan help track usage and display the time spent in each app.\nApple\u2019s Family Sharing and Google Play have settings to help parents monitor use, and most phone carriers have their own parental control options. Devices likeCircleand apps likeOurPactgive parents the ability to automate access, disable access to certain apps after a certain hour and build in structured time off to promote rest. The psychologist Larry Rosen, who has researched technology and the brain and is a co-author of \u201cThe Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World,\u201d said one of the most important steps is to remove the phone from the bedroom at night.\nOf course, parents trying to set healthy guidelines for smartphone use may themselves be struggling with similar issues: The 2015 Pew survey found that46 percent of American adultsbelieved they could not live without their smartphones. Teens aren\u2019t the only ones we need to worry about when it comes to smartphone addiction \u2014 adults should consider their habits as well."

        "title": "Companies Warn of Hits From Tax Cuts. Don\u2019t Be Fooled.",
        "fulltext": "It will sound like bad news.\nOver the next few weeks, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, household names including Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson, are likely to warn that their financial results will be severely dented, if not altogether wiped out, by huge tax bills that they have to pay to the Internal Revenue Service.\nDon\u2019t be fooled.\nThe big one-time losses are a prelude to even bigger profits \u2014 a paradox caused by the tax cuts that recently zoomed through Congress and that largely benefit corporations.\nA couple of provisions in the tax package are prompting many companies \u2014 those based in the United States as well as some foreign corporations with big American presences \u2014 to pay the taxman while anticipating huge savings for decades to come.\nThe biggest factor, by far, is the requirement that American companies bring backmoney that they claimed to have earned via overseas subsidiaries, most of them in tax havens such as Luxembourg, Grand Cayman and Bermuda.\nUntil now, companies generally didn\u2019t have to pay federal income taxes on such earnings, at least not immediately, as long as those profits stayed overseas. But if the companies brought the money back to the United States, they would face a 35 percent tax rate (minus whatever they had already paid tax collectors in other countries).\nAmerican companies currently attribute about $2.8 trillion to their overseas units. The new law requires them to bring the money back to the United States \u2014 or to \u201crepatriate\u201d it \u2014 but at reduced tax rates as low as 8 percent.\nIn the short term, that may appear painful. Companies collectively will have to pony up about $235 billion in taxes stemming from the repatriated profits, saidDavid Zion, a tax accounting analyst. He estimates that five companies \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, Cisco and Oracle \u2014 account for one-third of that.\nThe phenomenon is likely to be on display in the next few weeks, as companies report financial results that look surprisingly weak because of the tax law.\nGoldman Sachs Groupsaid last weekthat it expected to suffer a $5 billion charge in the fourth quarter, mostly because of the forced repatriation of earnings. That threatened to obliterate the Wall Street bank\u2019s normally robust quarterly profits. But investors shrugged, sending Goldman\u2019s shares down slightly before quickly pushing them higher.\nWhy? Because the repatriation provision is part of a package likely to deliver vastly larger long-term savings for the world\u2019s biggest multinationals. Mr. Zion estimates the benefit from the repatriation tax break alone could be worth $500 billion to companies compared with the old law \u2014 more than double what they\u2019re paying upfront.\nAnd so profit warnings that normally would leave investors shuddering are instead being taken in stride.\n\u201cAlthough hundreds of companies are going to report unfavorable charges, ultimately the legislation should be a big win for them,\u201d saidJ. Richard Harvey, a Villanova University law professor and former I.R.S. official. \u201cMultinationals have been pursuing this sort of legislation for over a decade. We wouldn\u2019t have the legislation if they didn\u2019t want it.\u201d\nIndeed, companies have spent years lobbying for tax breaks on the profits they held in tax havens. In 2004, they succeeded when Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which dangled a one-time tax break for companies that repatriated offshore profits.Companies brought home $312 billionat a rate of just 5.25 percent.\nDespite the law\u2019s name,studies showed that companies used the money to buy back their shares in order to lift their stock prices. Some of the same companies laid off thousands of workers.\nAmong the biggest potential winners from the new tax package\u2019s repatriation provision is Apple.The company has $252 billion in cash offshore\u2014 and most likely even more in earnings, untaxed by the United States.\nApple might eventually fork over about $33 billion to the I.R.S. when those earnings come back to America, Mr. Zion said. But, in yet another oddity caused by the tax package, the company might actually record a one-time benefit to its profits.\nThat\u2019s because, over the years, Apple has set aside money, at least in accounting terms, to cover the potential taxes it might owe on its offshore earnings. But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.\nFiguring out how to tally this quickly is giving finance chiefsheartburn. Regulators are offering some breathing room. Two days after Christmas, the Securities and Exchange Commissionessentially gave companies an extensionto report any expected tax-law-related losses or gains, if they could not come up with a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d by the end of the year.\nGoing forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.\nUnder the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)\nThe new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.\nIt is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.\nIn Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.\nCredit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.\nSeveral companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain. They included the German automakers BMW and Daimler, which both said the law would provide a temporary benefit of more than $1 billion."

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Trump is expected to tick off accomplishments from his first year in office and present his policy vision going forward \u2014 and The New York Times will fact-check him as he speaks.\nThere is no guarantee that Mr. Trump willstick to the script. While his impromptu tweets and remarks are more prone to beinaccurateorunfounded, the president\u2019s prepared speechestend to be more tempered, even if they havetaken facts out of context, includedoverstated or undue self-praiseoroffered bleak and exaggerated diagnoses.\nHere are some lessons and themes drawn froma year of fact-checkingMr. Trump\u2019s public remarks, interviews and social media posts as president.\nMr. Trump has been unable to fulfill one of his central campaign pledges \u2014 repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t stopped him fromfalselydeclaringotherwise. In some remarks, Mr. Trump has been accurate, describing the end of the health care law\u2019s individual mandate as \u201cpartial repeal.\u201d Virtually all other parts of the law remain intact.\nIt is alsonot accuratefor Mr. Trump toclaimfull creditfor the collapse of the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. A significant amount of territory has been recaptured and major battles have been won in the last year, but Mr. Trump has largely overseen a strategy started under President Barack Obama.\nThe $1.5 trillion tax cut signed by Mr. Trump in December is his first major legislative achievement in office. But he iswrongto characterize it \u2014 as he hasdoneat leastfourtimesthis year \u2014 as the largest in history (at least three are bigger) or the first since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut (most presidents since Reagan have cut taxes).\nMr. Trump is likely to boast about a roaring American economy and healthy job growth, though his claims should be viewed in context.\nHe has, for example,boastedat leastseventimesin thepasttwo weeksthat the black unemployment rate, 6.8 percent in December, is the lowest ever recorded.While true, it is the culminationof a longer-term trend. It is alsoan open question how much credit a president, especially in his first year, can take for the economy.\nThe same can be said of Mr. Trump\u2019srepeatedclaimthat nearly 2.4 million jobs have been added since his election in November 2016. The number isaccurate, butappears less groundbreaking with the appropriate context: More jobs were added in the 14 months before his election than in the 14 months since.\nMr. Trump has also misrepresented the tax cut\u2019s effect on the decisions of American businesses.\nContrary to his claims that Chrysler is \u201cleaving Mexico and coming back to the United States,\u201d the automaker continues to operateseveral plants in Mexicoeven as it shifts production ofsome pickup trucks to Michigan. Similarly, hehastrumpetedApple\u2019s announcement of a $350 billion, five-year investment as a boon for manufacturing, but the company wasalready on track to spend $275 billionover the next five years.\nMr. Trump often talks up his deal-making prowess. But he has taken credit for agreements that were drawn up before he was involved or relies on fuzzy math to promote the most impressive dollar figure possible.\nMr. Trump claimed to have signed$250 billion worth of deals with China, Japan and South Koreain November and $350 billion of deals in Saudi Arabia that would add \u201chundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d in June. Both packages include plans made before his trips and rely on verbal agreements.\nMr. Trump has also made inaccurate statements about international deals he dislikes.\nAs his trade teamnegotiates revamping the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Trump haserroneously saidthe United States has a trade deficit with Canada, when it actually has a surplus. He has alsoexaggerated the trade deficit totalswith China and Mexico.\nMr. Trump mischarachterized the Iran nuclear deal, alleging that Mr. Obama \u201cso foolishly gave\u201d gave money to the Islamic republic\u2019s leaders to fund terrorism. The diplomatic agreementdid not cut Iran a check, but it did release about $100 billion in previously Iranian frozen assets, much of which is tied up in debt obligations.\nIn pushing Congress to approve a new immigration policy, Mr. Trump has made several erroneous statements.\nHe hasfalselyaccused other countries of \u201csending their worst\u201d through the diversity visa lottery. Applicants enter of their own volition and are denied a visa if they have a criminal record or would rely on public assistance.\nHis repeated claim that Sayfullo Saipov, thesuspect in the Manhattan truck attack, brought in dozens of relatives through what he calls \u201cchain migration,\u201d or family-based immigration, isimplausible. As a green card holder, Mr. Saipov is not allowed to sponsor extended family.\nFinally, Mr. Trump is right that illegal border crossings \u201care way, way down\u201d under his watch, but he hasexaggeratedthe extent of that decline."

        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviewsthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nGood morning, readers! It was an interesting week in the tech world. Let\u2019s get to the news.\nOne thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale \u2014 the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don\u2019t make for great optics. There\u2019s a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites.\nWell, they want you to know they aren\u2019t.\nAmazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday,the company announcedthe 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There\u2019s one city in Canada \u2014 Toronto \u2014 and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there\u2019s oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win.\nMeanwhile, in its ownvery well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money \u2014 the largest tax bill ever paid \u2014 and invest billions in new facilities and peoplein the United States. The company is also giving many of its employeesa $2,500 bonus.\nApple\u2019s announcement madeTrump very happy. And the president\u2019s victory lap is, I think, somewhat deserved. Trump and the tech industry have not had the warmest relationship, but it\u2019s clear that his campaign \u2014 in which he constantly harangued Apple and Amazon for perceived slights \u2014 has shaken the industry from its presumption that everyone in the country loves it.\nJust a few weeks ago, people brave enough to enter the market for Bitcoin and its many rival electronic currencies looked like lucky geniuses.They were suddenly making millions, even billions \u2014 and you were kicking yourself for overlooking the crypto boom.\nWell, now you\u2019re the genius (if still poor). Much of the cryptocurrency markettook a bath this week, with Bitcoin falling below $10,000 at one point, more than 50 percent off its December peak.\nRedditwas flooded with panicked crypto lovers, but, as it usually does, the market leveled off by the end of the week, and crypto-heads were professing to be back on board for the long haul. Godspeed, I guess.\nThere wasn\u2019t so much else in tech news this week, so take some time to read some great magazine stories.\nIn Bloomberg Businessweek, Eric Newcomer and Brad Stone havea dishy inside lookat how Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder and former hard-charging C.E.O., fell from grace. Among the details: During one harrowing Kalanick-caused scandal, he fell to \u201chis hands and knees and began squirming on the floor.\u201d\nAlso, Steven Johnson hasa fascinating piece in The New York Times Magazineabout the uses for the blockchain, the technology undergirding cryptocurrencies.And in The New Yorker, there\u2019s a lovely ode to blogging and The Awl, a much-beloved Brooklyn web magazine that sadly called it quits this week.\nSpeaking of quits: See you next week!\nFarhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column calledState of the Art.

        "title": "Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Second Act: Big-Time Producer",
        "fulltext": "A few months ago, Reese Witherspoon realized everything had changed.\nHBO\u2019s glossy, seven-episode drama, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d \u2014 which Ms. Witherspoon starred in and helped produce \u2014 won eight Emmy Awards,including the one for best limited series. From the Microsoft Theater stage in Los Angeles on Sept. 17, to swelling applause, Ms. Witherspoon spoke of how important it was to bring \u201cwomen to the front of their own stories and make them the heroes of their own stories.\u201d\nNot long after that night, she found herself in demand.\n\u201cIt opened a lot of doors for me,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview this past week. \u201cPeople wanted to be in business with me as a producer in the TV space. My mission was to create television for other women, for other female storytellers that are actresses, other directors and other writers. I think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\nSince then, Ms. Witherspoon has transformed herself from an actress increasingly frustrated with the roles she was being offered into a producer with a slate of projects that puts her in the company of series creators like Dick Wolf, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.\nLast month, HBOordered a second seasonof \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d with Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s production company,Hello Sunshine, among the key companies behind the show. In addition, Apple has bought three Hello Sunshine projects as part of its push to compete with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu in streaming. That amounts to a third of Apple\u2019s TV purchases to date.\nOne of the series \u2014 which is set to star Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as hosts of afictional morning news show\u2014 marks one of the most expensive deals in TV history: With a 20-episode commitment, Apple has pledged roughly $240 million to make it, according to two people familiar with the series. Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s other two Apple projects will star Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\nApple\u2019s top TV executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, said in a statement that Ms. Witherspoon had \u201can extraordinary knack for being a step ahead of the zeitgeist.\u201d\nThe rise of Hello Sunshine \u2014 with projects centered on strong, complicated women \u2014 syncs up perfectly with the #timesup movement, which counts Ms. Witherspoon as a major player, and gives evidence that the risk-averse Hollywood establishment may have learned something from the blockbuster success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d last year.\n\u201cPeople are desperate for this kind of storytelling about the female heroes that have always been in the shadows and now are coming into the light,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.\nMs. Witherspoon, 41, does not have the track record of super producers like Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, who have created hit shows for more than a decade, but she has already put a lot of distance between herself and the pack of actors who run production boutiques as a hobby.\nMs. Rhimes, the hitmaker behind \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d who recently signed an deal with Netflix, called Ms. Witherspoon a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d producer.\n\u201cReese has been very smart about what she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cShe has leveraged her power in a very smart way to get big projects done. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d\nCasey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO, said he was impressed by her willingness to get into the minutiae.\n\u201cReese is a movie star, she has a movie star\u2019s presence, she\u2019s a great actress \u2014 that all goes without saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat surprises people is I can call Reese on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 and have those conversations, saying, \u2018How do we get this deal closed?\u2019 \u2014 and she\u2019ll go off and get it closed.\u201d\nOne of her recent producing coups was to add Meryl Streep to the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d cast. Along with her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star (and fellow executive producer) Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon lobbied Ms. Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, to come aboard. She said yes in an email to Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman on the day \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was nominated for six Golden Globes. (The show went on to win four.)\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I got that email,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cI called Nicole, and I just started to cry.\u201d\nThat catharsis was a long time in coming, said Ms. Witherspoon, who had seen a number of her projects wilt. She grew weary of hearing that the industry had reached its quota of female-driven movies for the year. At the same time, she was starring in mostly forgettable movies \u2014 \u201cHow Do You Know\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Knot\u201d \u2014 and her box-office stock was dropping.\nShe took control of her career by making a deeper commitment to producing. An avid reader who often posts photos of her favorites on Instagram, she started optioning book after book, partly motivated by a conversation she had with her husband, Jim Toth, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.\n\u201cI talked to my husband around that time, when the movies weren\u2019t working for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Are these movies you want to be making?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting for the scripts to come in.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who sits around and waits for the phone to ring. You read more books than anybody I know, so why don\u2019t you start making them into your own material?\u2019\n\u201cAnd I thought about my mom, who said, \u2018If you want something done, do it yourself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Witherspoon continued. \u201cYou can sit there and complain about it, or you can do something about it. Instead of having people make calls for me, I called every studio head myself: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Reese!\u2019 I\u2019ve known everybody for 27 years. They knew me when I was 14 years old, all of them. I\u2019ve made movies at pretty much every studio. It\u2019s still the same 200 people who are working in our business.\u201d\nMs. Witherspoon\u2019s previous production company, Pacific Standard, had hits with the 2014 movies \u201cWild\u201d (based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed and starring Ms. Witherspoon) and \u201cGone Girl.\u201d It came to an end in 2016 when Ms. Witherspoon split from her longtime producing partner, Bruna Papandrea.\nMs. Witherspoon sought outside investment when she was ready to start Hello Sunshine, striking a deal with Otter Media, a company owned by the Chernin Group and AT&T, which bought a 30 percent stake in her new production house.\nIn addition to the three Apple projects and \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Hello Sunshine has two potential series in the running at ABC and NBC. Several film projects are also in the works. Among them, Fox 2000 has picked up \u201cSomething in the Water,\u201d based on a thriller by Catherine Steadman about newlyweds whose Bora Bora honeymoon goes awry, and Sony\u2019s TriStar Pictures has given the green light to \u201cA White Lie,\u201d based on a 2016 novel \u201cThe Gilded Years,\u201d by Karin Tanabe, about the first black woman to attend Vassar College, in the 1890s.\nHello Sunshine, which recently named Sarah Harden, formerly of Otter Media, as its chief executive, also has plans to create short bursts of digital-friendly content. At the moment, though, Ms. Witherspoon is making her name in the producer ranks because of her work in the hypercompetitive streaming market.\nHer planned Apple series with Ms. Aniston \u2014 the \u201cFriends\u201d star\u2019s return to a lead role in a television series \u2014 was inspired by \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a book by the CNN media reporter Brian Stelter on the so-called morning TV wars. For that one, Apple has pledged to make two 10-episode seasons, without so much as a script written. Two people familiar with the project said Apple would pay $12 million to $15 million an episode. (By comparison, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the costliest shows ever made, has a budget of $15 million an episode for its final season.)\nUnlike the stereotypical Hollywood producer or celebrity, Ms. Witherspoon is a deep reader \u2014 which has impressed the women who are working with her on Hello Sunshine\u2019s other Apple projects.\nColleen McGuinness, a former \u201c30 Rock\u201d writer who is the show runner for the planned series based on a short-story collection by Curtis Sittenfeld, was surprised that Ms. Witherspoon had read the book before their first meeting. When Ms. McGuinness mentioned this, she said, she \u201cgot a look\u201d from Ms. Witherspoon.\n\u201cWe laughed about it, and I said, \u2018Yeah, most people don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Ms. McGuinness said.\nDuring a meeting about the project starring Ms. Spencer, the writer-producer Nichelle Tramble pointed out a book in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s office \u2014 \u201cThe Alice Network,\u201d a novel by Kate Quinn set in the 1940s. That led to a discussion of the lack of female leads in historical dramas.\n\u201cThat she was such an intense, true and avid reader was very exciting and a little bit shocking,\u201d Ms. Tramble said.\nMs. Witherspoon marvels at how the business is changing. A few years ago, she said, prospects were dim for actresses over age 40. She hopes she can help change that in her new role.\n\u201cYou get older and the phone does stop ringing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, because the people who are writing the stories aren\u2019t 40-year-old women. You write what you know. Well, there were no 40-year-old female screenwriters, and now women of color are writing screenplays and getting them made at big studios.\n\u201cI\u2019m as incredulous as everybody else,\u201d she continued. \u201cI never thought this would happen.\u201d"

        "title": "India Extends Hand to Apple and Others by Easing Rules on Foreign Firms",
        "fulltext": "MUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s central government moved on Wednesday to reinvigorate itssluggish economybyrelaxing rules governing foreign investmentin industries including retailing and air travel.\nThe changes could lead Apple and other companies based outside this country of 1.2 billion to significantly expand their retail presence here. In addition to the changes in the retail sector, the government also said it would allow up to 49 percent of Air India, the troubled national air carrier that is now up for sale, to be bought by foreign airlines.\nThe moves are the latest steps taken by the government toopen India\u2019s economy up to outside companies. Foreign investment in the country reached $60 billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31, up 8 percent from the previous year. In a statement, the government said the changes would contribute to \u201cgrowth of investment, income and employment.\u201d\nAmong the potential beneficiaries of the changes is Apple, which haslong soughtto open stores in India. The company\u2019s iPhones account for only about 1 in 20 smartphones in active use in the country, according to the research firm Forrester, and Apple phones are now sold only by third-party vendors.\nApple and other multinational retailers had lobbied the government for several years to ease a requirement that foreign-owned, single-brand retailers obtain 30 percent of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country.\nApple executives argued that the 30-percent figure was impossible to meet, at least in the short term, because the company assembles almost all of its products in China and buys many of the necessary components there. Although the company\u2019s supply chain stretches across the world, Apple told the Indian government that the country\u2019s electronics industry could not produce the quality and quantity of parts needed. (Even Indian cellphone makersassemble their phones from imported parts.) Apple\u2019s position rankled many officials.\nThe new rules could break the stalemate. They allow single-brand retailers that are entirely foreign-owned to temporarily meet the 30 percent requirement by buying goods made in India and then selling them overseas. If, for instance, Apple sold $100 million of its products in India, it could meet the target by buying $30 million of India-made leather cases and selling them outside the country. After five years, the existing local-sourcing requirement for sales in India would apply.\nIn addition, foreign-owned single-line retailers would no longer have to seek government approval before opening.\n\u201cThese rules are a very dramatic relief,\u201d said Sudhir Kapadia, a partner at EY India, an affiliate of the accounting and consulting firm formerly known as Ernst & Young.\nApple declined to comment on the change. The company has scouted out potential locations for its first stores in India, and its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, reiterated to investors in November that opening stores in the country was an important piece of its strategy here, where inexpensive Android handsets now dominate.\nSingle-brand shoe or clothing companies like Uniqlo could also find India a more appealing place to operate stores, perhaps buying some products here to sell overseas and others to sell locally, said Ankur Bisen, senior vice president of retail at Technopak, a consulting firm based in New Delhi.\nIkea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has spent five and half years trying to open in India. Part of the challenge has been finding the right Indian suppliers of furniture and other household items to meet the 30-percent requirement for local goods. The new rules give the company more flexibility toward meeting the goal.\nForeign brands like Kenneth Cole, Marks & Spencer and Tesco that already operate in India through joint ventures with local companies may now find wholly owned units to be a better option, Mr. Bisen said.\nOpening the Indian economy up to foreign companies remains a politically delicate proposition, particularly since employment is a major issue among voters.\nThe Confederation of All India Traders said that relaxing the restrictions on single-brand retailers would make it too easy for multinationals to enter India.\n\u201cWhat will happen to my people who will be losing their jobs?\u201d said Bal Krishna Bhartia, national president of the group, which represents 70 million traders. \u201cThese corporates will not hire them.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\n\u2022 Kodak plans to create its own virtual currency.\n\u2022 President Trump plans to attend the World Economic Forum.\n\u2022 Just how rich is Jeff Bezos?\n\u2022 The shine is coming off the tech industry more and more.\n\u2022 Talk of an Oprah presidential run has boosted at least one company.\nWant this in your own email inbox?Here\u2019s the sign-up.\nShares of Kodaksurged 34 percentafter the company said it said it was launching a \u201cmajor blockchain initiative.\u201d\nThe company and WENN Digitalannounced the creationof KODAKOne, an image rights management platform, and KODAKCoin, a virtual token \u201cto allow photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.\u201d\n\u201cFor many in the tech industry, \u2018blockchain\u2019 and \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who\u2019ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it\u2019s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,\u201d said Jeff Clarke, Kodak\u2019s chief executive.\nErik Holm of MoneyBeat writes:\n\u201cFor the past several years, people have been experimenting with ways to adapt the technology behind bitcoin, usually called blockchain. At its essence, blockchain is an open record of transactions, maintained in an online ledger that is distributed across a network of computers, that cannot be tampered with. That makes it like an indelible timestamp, which could be useful in a case of copyright and digital rights management.\u201d\nKodak plans to hold an initial coin offering for KODAKCoin on Jan. 31.Coin offerings, which allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, have surged in popularity during the past 12 months.\nKodak\u2019s shares are just the latest to get a digital currency boost. The stocks of a number of companieshave surgedin recent months after those firms rebranded themselves as having something to do digital currencies or blockchain.\nCritic\u2019s corner:Kodak is \u201cbetting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering designed to help photographers sell their work. The crypto buzz more than doubled its stock, but it\u2019s unlikely to do anything like the same to the company\u2019s sales or profit,\u201dwrites Tom Buerkle of Breakingviews.\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\nThe chief executive of Renault-Nissan has escalated the auto industry\u2019s technology-driven arms race.\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance said Tuesday it is setting up a venture capital fund to invest $1 billion in automotive technologies over the next five years. Mr. Ghosn pushed for the fund \u201cto speed development of technologies that the three automakers don\u2019t have in-house,\u201dthe WSJ reported.\nMore about the fund:\n\u2022 It\u2019s named Alliance Ventures.\n\u2022 Francois Dossa is leading the fund and will have teams in Silicon Valley, Paris, Japan and China looking for startups in which to invest.\n\u2022 The fund has already invested in Ionic Materials, a Woburn, Mass., startup working to develop solid-state batteries.\nAutomakershave poured money into automobile technology startupsin recent years. General Motorsbought Cruise Automationin a deal potentially valued at more than $1 billion. Last summer Toyota set upa $100 million investing armcalled Toyota AI Ventures.\nFrom Reuters:\n\u201cThe traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.\u201d\ntranscript\nSteve Bannon is out at Breitbart News, the right-wing website that served as a megaphone for President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist. His ouster was put in motion after these remarks by Bannon came to light. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s not going to make it,\u2019 Bannon reportedly said. \u2018He\u2019s lost his stuff.\u2019 \u201cTreasonous and unpatriotic.\u201d Those comments sparked the president\u2019s wrath ... \u201cIn a blistering statement the president said ... and gave Bannon the nickname \u2018Sloppy Steve.\u2019 The former Breitbart chairman, who once boasted about overthrowing the Republican establishment in a blazing revolution, also lost key conservative allies, a sign that his revolution may not be televised. The family of hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer played a major role in funding Bannon\u2019s platform, but not anymore. In a statement, Rebekah Mercer said, After the book published, Bannon issued this statement But that didn\u2019t patch up the discord with the Mercer family. Rebekah Mercer controls a minority stake in Breitbart and a majority stake in Bannon\u2019s future. She ultimately forced him out of Breitbart. Between Trump and Bannon, the split has been more swift. Bannon was one of Trump\u2019s most trusted aides until August ,when he left the White House. That was just days after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville. \u201cI think there\u2019s blame on both sides.\u201d Critics accused him of channeling Bannon in that response. While in the White House, reports say Bannon had a profound influence on policy bringing in other far-right nationalist figures to help shape laws. And after he was out of the White House, Bannon continued to enjoy the president\u2019s support. \u201cAnd I can understand where Steve Bannon is coming from. So I can understand fully how Steve Bannon feels.\u201d After leaving the White House, Bannon helped Roy Moore\u2019s controversial campaign for Senate. After Moore lost the election, critics \u2014 including the president \u2014 blamed Bannon. Still, he was steadfast on his campaign for a populist conservative revolution. Now, his feud with Trump and departure from Breitbart may bring that to an end.\nFrom The New York Times:\nStephen K. Bannon is stepping down from his post as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the company announced Tuesday.\nMr. Bannon\u2019s departure, which was forced by a onetime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, comes as Mr. Bannon remained unable to quell the furor overremarks attributed to him in a new bookin which he questions President Trump\u2019s mental fitness and disparages his elder son, Donald Trump Jr.\nMr. Bannon\u2019s departure from the website is the latest ignominious turn in a career that was once one of the most promising and improbable in modern American politics.\nHere\u2019s what White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanderstold Maggie Haberman and Michael Shear of the NYT:\n\u201cAt this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries, and American workers.\u201d\nHe\u2019ll be the first U.S. president to do so since Bill Clinton in 2000.The BBC previously notedthat Ronald Reagan spoke to the crowd at the World Economic Forum via videoconference, but that neither of the Bushes nor Barack Obama attended. (Joe Biden did, however.)\nWhy?As the NYT adds, presidents have been concerned that being seen rubbing shoulders with some of the world\u2019s wealthiest might send the wrong political message. (Other heads of state, likeXi Jinping of China, have attended.)\nOne additional note:Having attended the forum a few times, I\u2019d say that one thing that a visit from Mr. Trump would definitely do is make the traffic in Davos during the event \u2014 which often moves at a glacial pace as V.I.P.\u2019s vehicular escorts crawl through the windy streets \u2014 probably more difficult.\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\nShot:\u201cJeff Bezos is nowthe richest person of all time,\u201d CNN reported. (The Bloomberg article that the news item citedmakes no such claim.)\nChaser:\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\nLet\u2019s count the ways:\n\u2022 Apple is being pressed to protect young users from smartphone addiction by an unusual coalition: the hedge fund Jana Partners and the California public pension fund Calstrs.\n\u2022 Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny over Russia\u2019s use of social media to manipulate elections.\n\u2022 Amazon is facing scrutiny for its effect on jobs.\n\u2022 Europe is examining many U.S. tech companies on competition and privacy grounds.\nAsBarry Rosenstein, the managing partner of Jana, told David Gelles of the NYT:\n\u201cAs more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over.\u201d\nThe growing fear about tech addiction:Two former Facebook executives,Sean ParkerandChamath Palihapitiya, spoke last year about how the company hooks into users\u2019 psyches. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia,held a briefingon the issue. (Axioshas more.)\nOne place you don\u2019t yet see a problem:These companies\u2019 stocks. Apple\u2019s shares dipped only slightly yesterday, and its market capitalization is still just shy of $900 billion. Shares in Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter gained slightly.\nCritics\u2019 corner\n\u2022 Shira Ovide writes, \u201cWhen financial mercenaries start caring about the potential human harm of technology, Silicon Valley should be extremely nervous.\u201d (Gadfly)\n\u2022 Jennifer Saba writes of Jana\u2019s campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets.\u201d (Breakingviews)\nShares in the weight-loss company, of which Ms. Winfrey owns 10 percent,jumped as much as 13 percentyesterday amid speculation thatshe may run for president.\nNot everyone was as euphoricabout the possibility. Here\u2019s what Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist, told the NYT:\n\u201cBeating Trump isn\u2019t just about finding the right candidate \u2014 we have to show what we stand for,\u201d Ms. Katz said. \u201cOther than \u2018we all get a car,\u2019 what will an Oprah presidency look like?\u201d she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show.\nIt comes down to how they respond to the provision that taxes the income of overseas subsidiaries at half the domestic rate \u2014 even as Mr. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to struggling cities.\nCompanies havea new reason to move plants abroad, Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT reports:\n\u201cHaving such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,\u201d said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. \u201cIt creates terrible incentives.\u201d\nThe caveat:Some companies may want to stay, for America\u2019s legal system and skilled workers. But big manufacturers like auto companies may be tempted to move anyway.\nMore in taxes\n\u2022 Mr. Trump celebrated the passing of the tax overhaul in Nashville, where he overstated the size of the cuts. (NYT)\n\u2022 Residents of high-tax states rushed to prepay their bills before deductions are capped, giving those areas a welcome, if brief, revenue boost.

Vance, the investor and author of the book \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d to run against Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. (Politico)\nFederal regulators blocked an Energy Department proposal tosubsidize struggling coal and nuclear power plants. That raises questions about what else the Trump administration can do to prop up an industry that \u2014 even as pollution regulations loosen \u2014 is being battered by market forces.\nMore from Brad Plumer of the NYT:\nLast year, utilities announced plans to shut down more than 22 gigawatts of coal capacity across the country, and more retirements are expected this year. Mr. Perry\u2019s proposal was the most aggressive move yet in support of coal and nuclear power and would have shielded a number of plants in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic from those competitive forces.\nThe policy flyaround\n\u2022 A Senate resolution to block the F.C.C.\u2019s repeal of net neutrality rules has enough support to force a vote \u2014 but the House is unlikely to follow suit.

        "title": "It\u2019s Time for Apple to Build a Less Addictive iPhone",
        "fulltext": "It\u2019s not Apple\u2019s fault that you feel enslaved by your phone. But the company that gave the world the modern smartphone has a perfect opportunity this year to create a brave and groundbreaking new take on that device: a phone that encourages you to use it more thoughtfully, more deliberately \u2014 and a lot less.\nTech \u201caddiction\u201d is a topic of rising national concern. I put the A-word in quotes because the precise pull that our phones exert over usisn\u2019t the same as that of drugs or alcohol. The issue isn\u2019t really new, either; researchers who study how we use digital technology have for years been warning ofits potential negative effects on our cognition, psyche and well-being.\nWhat is new is who has joined the ranks of the worried. Recently, a parade of tech luminaries, including severalformer Facebook employees, have argued that we\u2019re no match for the sophisticated machinery of engagement and persuasion being built into smartphone apps.Their fears are manifold: They\u2019re worried about distraction, productivity, how social networks alter our emotional lives and relationships, andwhat they\u2019re doing to children.\nIt\u2019s hard to know what to make of these confessions of regret. Come on, guys \u2014 you gave us these wondrous machines, you made billions of dollars from their ubiquity, andnowyou tell us they\u2019re bad?\nAlso, what do we do about it?\nLike air pollution or intrusive online advertising, tech addiction is acollective-action problemcaused by misaligned incentives. Companies that make money from your attention \u2014 that is, ad-supported apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube \u2014 now employ armies of people who work with supercomputers to hook you ever more deeply into their services. Sure, we should call on them to act more ethically \u2014 and Facebook, for its part, has saidit\u2019s willing to lose money to improve its users\u2019 well-being\u2014 but I\u2019m skeptical they\u2019ll be able to suppress their economic interests.\nGovernment regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who\u2019s left?\nThe same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.\nI got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrotean open letter askingthe company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?\nBut when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.\nAnd there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.\n\u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d\nFor one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.\nYet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.\nMr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.\nImagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d\nAnother idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.\nMr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\nApple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).\n\u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\nThere\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\nAnother thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.\nDone right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.\n\u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.\nHe suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.\nApple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.\nApple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s working on something grand."

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 The executive in charge of Facebook\u2019s efforts to court China has left the company, a fresh setback for the social network as it seeks to get its products into China\u2019s huge internet market.\nWang-Li Moser, who as Facebook\u2019s lead liaison with Beijing had become a symbol of its ambitions in the country, resigned in December, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nMs. Moser had been brought in from Intel to professionalize Facebook\u2019s efforts to court China\u2019s government. Her job was a tough one. She set up and presided over negotiations between China\u2019s most powerful officials and a social network that many of them believed could be perilouslydestabilizing.\nShe also had to manage broader trade and security frictions between China and the United States. China blocks Facebook and most other major American internet companies, fearing the products could be used to undermine the government. Google, Twitter and Snapchat are all inaccessible within China. Apple and Amazon must use local partners to offer cloud services.\nDuring her roughly three-year tenure, Ms. Moser worked behind the scenes as Facebook waged a charm campaign to get back into the country. As part of those efforts, Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his Mandarin, did apromotional jogthrough a polluted Tiananmen Square and dined withPresident Xi Jinping.\nMs. Moser\u2019s departure, after she failed to achieve any major breakthrough in China, underscores the challenges, and setbacks, Facebook has faced as it seeks to gain entry to one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most closed off \u2014 internet markets.\nAlong with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s high-profile appearances in China, Facebook has quietly tried numerous other strategies to gain access. The company worked internally on a tool that would allowtargeted censorship, even as some employees quit over the project. The tool has thus far not been used.\nLast year, Facebooktook the novel approachof releasing an app in China without putting its name to the product. Called Colorful Balloons, the app is an almost exact copy of Facebook\u2019s own photo-sharing app Moments. Considered a sort of trial balloon to better understand the market, the app was introduced anonymously by Facebook through a separate company. It appears to be no longer available in app stores in China.\nStepping into the role of government liaison will be William Shuai, a former government relations executive at the Chinese search engine Baidu and the American social network LinkedIn. Before holding those positions, Mr. Shuai was briefly a low-level official in the Chinese government.\nFor Facebook, which declined to comment on Ms. Moser\u2019s departure, getting into China remains a major priority. China is Facebook\u2019s largest market for ad spending in Asia, even though it is blocked in the country. Chinese companies, local governments and the state news mediaall use advertisingon Facebook as a way to reach beyond Chinese borders.\nThere are both signs of progress and problems for the company\u2019s efforts to enter China.\nFacebook has been quietlyscouting Shanghaifor an office, and late last year Mr. Zuckerberg was among several executives who met President Xi shortly after China\u2019s leaders held the 19th Communist Party Congress.\nBut in the lead-up to the party congress, Chinese censors blocked the company\u2019s last major viable product in China, WhatsApp. The chat app remainsmostly unusablein the country."

        "fulltext": "A pair of investors who say they hold about $2 billion in Apple stock are pushing the company to do more to protect its youngest users from the effects of digital technology.\nInan open letter to Apple, the investors, the activist hedge fund Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, voiced concerns that such technology might be hurting children and said Apple could help ease the damage even as it generates business.\n\u201cWe believe that addressing this issue now will enhance long-term value for all shareholders, by creating more choices and options for your customers today and helping to protect the next generation of leaders, innovators, and customers tomorrow,\u201d they wrote in the letter, dated Saturday.\nThe investors, whose combined holdings are small compared with Apple\u2019sapproximately $900 billion market value, cited research suggesting that the prevalence of digital devices, such as the laptops, tablets and smartphones Apple makes, may be negatively affecting children.\nOnesurvey of teachers in Alberta, Canada, found that about two in three believed that digital technology was increasingly distracting their students, according to the letter. And research by Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, suggests that the rise of digital technology may be linked to anincrease in mental health problems among teenagers.\nAddressing the issue now could help Apple avoid an impending reckoning as unease grows over the role technology and social media play in our daily lives, the shareholders wrote.\nEven those involved with designing such technologies have acknowledgedtheir downsideandpotential for misuse.\n\u201cThere is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility,\u201d the investors wrote.\nThe solution, they argued, is not to banish such devices from children\u2019s hands, but to help parents help them understand how to use technology with care.\nTo achieve that goal, they said, Apple should form a committee of experts, fund research, improve parental controls in its products, educate parents and regularly report on the company\u2019s progress.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
