The union is looking fora contractsimilar to the one it signed with General Motors of Canada last month.\nAmong other things, that deal traded pension benefits for shortening the time it takes newly hired employees to reach full wage rates.

Ajury foundthat Samsung had violated an Apple design patent by mimicking the iPhone\u2019s round corners and grid of icons. The question for the justices is whether that means Samsung must turn over all its profits from the infringing phones or just those attributable to the disputed features.

The Fed extended its stimulus campaign, but three officials voted to raise rates, the largest bloc of dissenting votes in several years.

Yellen, said at a news conference after the meeting that the majority of officials saw no reason to rush ahead with a rate increase.

        "title": "Apple Predicts a Big Holiday Bounce After Its Biggest Rival, Samsung, Falters",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple predicts that strong sales of its new iPhones will soon pull the company out of a yearlong slump.\nAnd the misfortunes of its archrival, Samsung, probably deserve a bit of the credit.\nOn Tuesday, Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the upcoming holiday quarter, driven largely by consumer purchases of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which went on sale in September.\nThe new iPhones hit the market with remarkably good timing. This month, Samsung was forced torecall its Galaxy Note 7, the South Korean company\u2019s answer to the iPhone, because the devices were catching fire. That vaporized Apple\u2019s toughest competition for the most profitable part of the smartphone market.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more demand we can supply right now,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said in an interview. Interest in the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s largest model and the most direct rival to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7, is so intense that Apple said production could still lag demand even by December.\nIf the company\u2019s forecast is accurate, it will mark a turnaround from what has been a disappointing year for the Silicon Valley giant. In April, Apple announced that sales in the first three calendar months of 2016 shrank for the first time in 13 years.\nThe poor performance continued through the quarter that ended on Sept. 24, the company reported on Tuesday. For the most recent three-month period, Apple said, revenue fell 9 percent to $46.9 billion. Net income fell 19 percent to $9 billion.\nOne bright spot for Apple was the accelerating growth of its services businesses \u2014 essentially its cut of iPhone app sales as well as subscriptions to Apple Music and other services such as cloud storage. Revenue from services was up 24 percent as the company squeezed more value from the billion or so Apple devices that it estimates are in active use.\n\u201cThe next big product is the App Store,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, who sees services as an underappreciated part of Apple\u2019s business.\nMr. Maestri said that revenue from Apple Music, the company\u2019s streaming service, grew 22 percent in the quarter and more than offset the decline in music downloads from the iTunes store.\nBased primarily on the robust demand for the iPhone 7, Apple raised its financial projections for the quarter that will end in December, when crucial holiday sales occur. The company said it expects revenue of $76 billion to $78 billion, compared to $75.9 billion in the same quarter last year.\nChina, a key market for Apple where sales have fallen sharply, appears to be stabilizing. In the September quarter, sales in greater China were about flat compared to the June quarter. Sales were still down 30 percent compared to the previous year, but Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said he was optimistic about an improvement.\n\u201cWe are very bullish on China,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be a new normal there, but the new normal is a good growth rate.\u201d\nApple shares were down about 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.\nWhile phones account for the majority of Apple\u2019s business, its Mac laptop and desktop personal computers remain significant contributors to the company\u2019s bottom line. On Thursday, Apple is expected to announce several major updates to its Mac lineup, including the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in four years.\nKevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at the Jensen Quality Growth Fund, said that Apple\u2019s phones are gradually becoming commoditized, yielding lower profit margins. Services, which are far more profitable, will drive the company\u2019s future growth.\n\u201cApps and services have higher margins,\u201d said Mr. Walkush, whose mutual fund has been building its stake in Apple stock. \u201cIt makes it more annuity-like.\u201d\nMr. Cook got a bit prickly when asked about artificial intelligence technology found in devices made by competitors like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google \u2019s Home. Those gadgets rely on amassing a large amount of information about users to deliver personalized information.\nHe said Apple could deliver similar personalized services through its Siri technology without compromising privacy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false trade-off that people want you to believe, that you have to give up privacy to have A.I. to do something for you. We don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\nAs for new areas of focus for the company, he said Apple remains very interested in television content. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view,\u201d Mr. Cook said."

        "title": "U.S. Tech Giants Are Investing Billions to Keep Data in Europe",
        "fulltext": "In the battle to dominate Europe\u2019scloud computing market, American tech giants are spending big to build up their local credibility.\nAmazon Web Services, the largest player, announced last week that it wouldsoon openmultiple data centers in France and Britain. Google, which already has sites in countries likeFinland and Belgium,is expected to finish a new multimillion-dollar data complex in the Netherlands by the end of the year.\nAnd Microsoft, by some measures the second-largest cloud computing provider in Europe, said on Monday that it had spent $1 billion in the last 12 months to expand its offerings, taking its total investment in European-based cloud services to $3 billion since 2005.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building our global cloud infrastructure in Europe so it can be trusted by the multiple constituents,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe can meet the data residency needs of our European customers.\u201d\nWith many in Europe questioning why America\u2019s largest tech companies control how many of the region\u2019s 500 million citizens use everyday digital services, it is not surprising that the likes of Microsoft and Amazon are eager to play up their local roots.\nAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\nAs the European Unioncontinues to clamp downon the perceived misuse of people\u2019s digital information, analysts also say that many Silicon Valley giants are responding to theseprivacy concernsby increasingly offering individuals and companies the ability to keep information close to home, whereas in the past, data might have been stored solely in the United States.\n\u201cCountries like Germany are well aware of data privacy, and it has made them more wary of where data is kept,\u201d said Gregor Petri, a cloud computing analyst at the technology research firm Gartner in Veghel, the Netherlands. \u201cLocal data sovereignty has become important, and American companies are now aware of that.\u201d\nThere is also a more basic explanation for American companies\u2019 expansion into European cloud computing: a growing amount of money to be made.\nEurope\u2019s market for so-called cloud application services, or software that is run virtually across the internet, is expected to more than double, to $16.1 billion, by the end of the decade, according to Gartner. That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.\nDespite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.\nIn 2014, for instance, Amazonopened a number of data centersin Germany, partly in response to that country\u2019s strict privacy laws. Last year, Microsoft followed suit,teaming up with Deutsche Telekom\u2014 the local carrier and the owner of T-Mobile \u2014 which has control of the sites, again to comply with German legislation. (Microsoft charges a premium for the service.)\nIn an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.\n\u201cAll the data stays in Germany,\u201d he said. The companyrecently won an appealagainst the United States government, which had tried to obtain digital information held in a Microsoft data center in Ireland.\nWhile such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.\nApple, which has faced a number of European regulatory issues, including a demand that itrepay $14.6 billionin back taxes to Ireland,is spending almost $2 billionbuilding two data centers in the region. The facilities, its first such centers in Europe, will open in Denmark and Ireland by early 2018.\nFacebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting deep in the forests of northern Sweden with the Lulea data center,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive,wrote on his Facebook pageon Wednesday when talking about the Facebook\u2019s tech investments. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t think about Lulea when you share with friends on Facebook, but it\u2019s an example of the incredibly complex technology infrastructure that keeps the world connected.\u201d"

        "title": "Paying $15 Billion for Twitter Will Be Hard for Anyone to Justify",
        "fulltext": "Twitter\u2019s openness to being sold has set off a tweetstorm with a direct message: It will be hard for a new owner to make buying the $15 billion social network stack up.\nThe company, led by Jack Dorsey, wants offers before the end of the month. Suitors are falling away, however, after some companies initially showed interest, according to media reports. Google, Walt Disney and Apple probably won\u2019t bid, saysthe tech news site Recode reported.\nAll the excitement has shaken up investors. Twitter shares soared as much as 35 percent in the days after a Sept. 23 report on CNBC that said the company was moving closer to a sale. They tumbled 20 percent on Thursday after the news reports that Google and others had lost interest.\nIn the meantime, the stock of Salesforce.com has fallen more than 5 percent in a day on two occasions after being linked to the auction \u2014 and rebounded again after remarks by its chief executive, Marc Benioff, suggested that he might not be that eager. Salesforce, a $50 billion business-software maker, is short on cash, and investors probably aren\u2019t thrilled about the idea of being diluted for Twitter. More generally, though, there is no way conventional financial analysis can help any company rationalize an acquisition of the purveyor of 140-character messages.\nTwitter is expected to lose about $270 million next year. Add back around $100 million of interest, then cut in half the roughly $1.7 billion of research and development and marketing costs, as a buyer might do. Twitter\u2019s operating profit would then be about $700 million. According to Morningstar, Twitter\u2019s weighted average cost of capital is roughly 9 percent. To generate an equivalent return on investment, even generously assuming a zero tax rate, would mean paying no more than $7.7 billion for the company, about half its current market value.\nSilicon Valley often prefers its own oddball math. Twitter may look cheap next to what Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn if the chosen metric is price per monthly active user. Or a company like Alphabet, the parent of Google, might think it can wring more value from Twitter\u2019s ample data. The topic that seems to be trending, though, is that it will be hard for anyone to justify buying Twitter."

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: Hello, Mike! I hope we can make this a quick chat, as I\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do on my Halloween costume. I\u2019m going as Sexy Donald Trump.\nMike:That is truly terrifying. Speaking of which, I\u2019m going as celebrity chef Guy Fieri. Do you have a bowling shirt with flames on it that I can borrow for the weekend?\nFarhad: Oh yeah, I have many. I make so many trips to Flavor Town! On to the news. Let\u2019s start with personal computers. Remember those?\nMike:Like the old Gateway 2000 we had growing up? My favorite thing about those computers was that they came in a box that was painted white and splotchy black like a cow. Because I definitely think of livestock while I\u2019m computing.\nFarhad: Yeah, well, apparently not only do personal computers still exist, but if you\u2019ve got a lot of money to spend, they can be pretty awesome.\nTake the Surface Studio,which Microsoft unveiled at a press conferencein New York this week. It\u2019s, get this, a desktop computer, a device that was first invented in the Jurassic period, I think. But still, it looked pretty sweet. The machine is basically a flat sheet of glass mounted on a hinge, allow creative professionals to use it as a traditional desktop or a large drafting table. Microsoft also showed off a really intriguing accessory for the Studio, a physical dial that you turn to perform very precise functions (like zooming) on the machine.\nMike:I could see that being pretty cool if I had artistic talent. Usually those folks like those bigWacom tablets, but this seems to have a different type of interface \u2014 drawing directly on the screen, for example \u2014 that could win that crowd over.\nFarhad:Microsoft was widely ridiculed when it began building its own computers a few years ago (that first Surface was a stinker). But I have to say, they\u2019ve really done wonders since then. This new Surface \u2014 which, alas, starts at $3,000 \u2014 was the most interesting computer design I\u2019ve seen in a long time. And that includes the other company that showed off some new computers this week.\nCan you guess which company that was?\nMike:Um, Gateway?\nFarhad: No, I meant Apple. TheMac company put out a new line of laptops, including a couple of high-end machines that include something called the Touch Bar. It\u2019s a little touch-screen mounted at the top of the keyboard that offers a range of controls that adapt to whatever software you\u2019re using at the moment.\nI tried it out at Apple\u2019s press event this week, and in my short demo it looked quite handy, but it\u2019s expensive. Mac machines with the Touch Bar start at $1,800.\nMike:I guess that\u2019s cool. Everyone is criticizing it because you have to look down at the keyboard to use it instead of, say, typing on the buttons we have there now without looking down.\nAm I crazy, or am I the only guy who still needs to look at the keyboard in the unlikely event I am required to press F8?\nFarhad:Yeah, you\u2019re crazy. Never press F8. Never.\nO.K., let\u2019s touch on some earnings reports, because I know you love those. After previously warning investors that it would soon start spending heavily to invest in its core business,Amazon reportedthat it had kept to its word and spent a lot of dough. But apparently investors weren\u2019t expecting that, despite the company\u2019s warning. So Amazon\u2019s profits came in below analysts\u2019 expectations, which sent the stock price slipping.\nBut here\u2019s what I found interesting. Amazon, which is the most opaque large company in tech, told investors that it was expecting a remarkably wide range in business performance in the holiday quarter. Operating income could come in as high as $1.25 billion at the high end \u2014 or $0 at the low end. Who knows, right?\nBasically Amazon is like one of those baked kids in \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d contemplating the emptiness of it all:Like, hey, man, we could make a whole lot or we could make nothing, man, what does any of it matter on this pale blue dot out here in the middle of nothingness, you know what I mean, man?\nMike: I do, in fact, know what you mean. The philosophy of Matthew McConaughey guides many of my life choices, especiallythe character he playedin that movie.\nAnyway, I think at this point Amazon can tell investors whatever they want \u2014 \u201cProfit? Who knows? Who cares?\u201d \u2014 and Wall Street will eventually get in line and keep singing the company\u2019s praises. Tech companies are good at not caring what analysts think.\nFarhad: A couple of companies went on cost-cutting missions this week, though for totally different reasons. Alphabet, the holding company that Google created to manage its many non-search-related businesses, said that it was halting further expansion of its Google Fiber project. Fiber is a plan to build superfast fiber-optic internet access in cities across the country, a mission that has always seemed a little crazy in its expense and ambition. Now,citing a need for greater financial discipline, Google is going to lay off Fiber.\nPlease please don\u2019t make a joke about digestion.\nMike: Whatever do you mean? I\u2019m just happy to see Google is stayingregular.Uh, in its ambitions.\nIn all seriousness, this is a bummer, because my Comcast connection at home is the definition of terrible and unreliable. No competition within markets makes me very sad, even if I do get to make a fiber joke.\nFarhad: And then, finally, there was Twitter, which woke reporters up at 4 a.m. on the West Coast to deliver its financial results. The struggling social network saidit would lay off 350 people and would essentially shut down Vine, the once-popular looping video app.\nMan, I feel like I think about Twitter\u2019s mortality more frequently than my own. Is there any good news this time?\nMike: Actually, yes! They added more new users than everyone expected, and while their revenue growth is in decline, it still beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\nAlso, layoffs can be seen a few ways. It\u2019s always painful and you can\u2019t cheer when a company does it. Real people and their lives are affected by them. That being said, Twitter employs 3,900 people, and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t tell you what most of them actually do all day. I\u2019m not sure they could, either. So, perhaps this was something that was a long time coming, as many people around the company will grudgingly admit.\nAnyway, they\u2019re doing O.K., considering. The stock price went up, which is good, I guess. Too bad Vine is going away. I\u2019ve spent the past few days watching hilarious and weird vines on my computer. I highly recommend it.\nFarhad:I loved the idea of Vine, but I never really watched many. Guess that was the problem. Anyway, see you next week!"

        "title": "Conundrum for Justices: Does a Design Patent Cover a Whole Smartphone?",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday seemed inclined to let Samsung have a fresh shot at arguing that it does not have to give up all of its profits for copying a part of the distinctive look of Apple\u2019s iPhone.\n\u201cIt seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone,\u201d said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s not applied to all the chips and wires.\u201d\nIt followed, he said, that \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.\u201d\nSeveral justices seemed to agree that the damages Samsung must pay may well be less than its total profits of about $400 million on several phones. They said the right award might be limited to profits attributable to the protected features, including the iPhone\u2019s rounded corners and grid of icons.\nBut the justices seemed frustrated about how to articulate the right legal standard. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he did not know what jurors should be told in deciding how much companies that infringe design patents must pay.\n\u201cNeither side gives us an instruction to work with,\u201d he said.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor echoed the point. \u201cHow do we announce the right test?\u201d she asked.\nKathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said jurors could, for instance, hear expert testimony from accountants.\nJustice Kennedy responded that such evidence could not place a value on a \u201cstroke of genius\u201d like the design of the Volkswagen Beetle. That analogy came up throughout the argument, with some justices arguing that the car\u2019s design provided much of its value.\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed. \u201cI can\u2019t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if it, you know, costs, I think, $1,800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got two miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles?\u201d\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said jurors could be given examples. \u201cYou know, wallpaper, you get the whole thing,\u201d he said, referring to total profits. \u201cA Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don\u2019t get all the profit from the car.\u201d\nDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.\nMs. Sullivan, Samsung\u2019s lawyer, argued that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.\n\u201cA smartphone is smart,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work.\u201d\nDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits.\nSeveral leading technology companies, including Facebook and Google, filed abrief supporting Samsung. Their brief said that \u201cthe availability of disproportionate profits from accused infringers of design patents would reduce innovation.\u201d\nCompanies that sell products with distinctive designs, including Tiffany and Adidas, fileda brief supporting Apple. \u201cThe total profits rule,\u201d the brief said, \u201chelps to ensure that designers have the appropriate incentives and rewards to make investments in innovative designs.\u201d\nLast year, Samsungagreed to payApple $548 million in damages in the case, but it reserved the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. The company now hopes to recover as much as $399 million of that, representing its total profits from various models of phones that Apple said, in a lawsuit filed in 2011, infringed on its design patents.\nThe case before the Supreme Court is just one challenge faced by Samsung. The firm is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after struggling to address reports that the device can overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw.\nThe three design elements at issue in this case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201d\nLast year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals,ruledthat the governing statute \u201cexplicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.\u201d\nThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\n\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.\nThe design patent law says that infringers \u201cshall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit\u201d from the sale of \u201cany article of manufacture.\u201d\nAs the case reached the Supreme Court, the two sides and the Obama administration all focused on that last phrase, agreeing that the \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d at issue could be a component of the product rather than the entire product sold to consumers.\n\u201cThe parties, actually, and the government are fairly close,\u201d Justice Breyer remarked.\nBut Ms. Sullivan said the appeals court had not allowed it to make its case on what was the \u201carticle of manufacture.\u201d Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for Apple, responded that Samsung had litigated the case on the understanding that the entire phone was the relevant product and that it could not change its mind now.\nThe justices did not seem inclined to adjudicate that last dispute. \u201cWe have a hard enough question trying to figure out what the standard is,\u201d Justice Breyer told Mr. Waxman. \u201cNow, why can\u2019t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple\u2019s high-end laptop, the MacBook Pro, which hasn\u2019t had a major overhaul in four years, is getting a little more like the iPhone.\nApple on Thursday showed off new MacBook Pros that feature the Touch Bar, a touch-screen strip at the top of the keyboard that changes to display functions specific to the app being used.\nThe company also added its Touch ID function to the power button of the computers, allowing users to unlock the device or buy something with Apple Pay with the touch of a finger.\nBoth features are adapted from the iPhone, continuing Apple\u2019s pattern of adding the features that make its smartphones so popular to its laptops. Last month, Apple released a software update that put its Siri voice assistant on the Mac.\n\u201cMobile has focused us on simplicity,\u201d said Julie Ask, a technology analyst at the Forrester research firm.\nApple executives announced the new MacBooks at a news conference at the company headquarters here in Cupertino. Two days earlier, Applereported declining revenue and profitsfor the quarter that ended in September. The number of Macs sold in the quarter dropped 14 percent compared with a year ago.\nThe company is hoping that its new iPhones and other products, like the updated MacBooks, will return it to growth during the holidays.\nThe new MacBooks, which are thinner, lighter and faster than previous models, are primarily aimed at business customers and others who spend a lot of time on their computers, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting stuff done,\u201d he said.\nThe cheapest model with the new Touch Bar, a 13-inch machine, is $1,800, and the 15-inch version starts at $2,400. Apple\u2019s least expensive laptop, the ultralight Air, is unchanged and costs $1,000, while competitors\u2019 machines running Microsoft\u2019s Windows typically cost $500 or less. The models with the Touch Bar can be ordered now and will ship within the next few weeks.\nMr. Dawson said that Apple\u2019s strategy of putting more touch features on the keyboard is in sharp contrast to Microsoft, whichunveiled a new desktop PCon Wednesday with powerful touch features on the display. \u201cApple wants you to keep your hands where they are,\u201d he said.\nThe Touch Bar replaces the function keys at the top of the current laptop keyboards and pops up customized functions depending on the app. In Apple\u2019s Photos app, for example, it allows users to perform simple editing and play videos. In the Mail app, the Touch Bar shows reply options, automatically suggests words and phrases and shows a menu of the user\u2019s commonly used emoji.\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s worth a moment for a requiem for the function key,\u201d Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, said after unveiling the Touch Bar.\nThe new laptops immediately drew some complaints from current Apple laptop users because they use a newer type of port, USB-C, that requires adapters to work with older accessories.\nBut Apple did keep the traditional headphone jack on the Macs,unlike its new iPhone 7 line.\nApple also previewed a new app for its Apple TV set-top box as well as iPhones and iPads. Called simply TV, the app, which will be released in December, will allow users to see in one place their favorite shows from the other video apps on their device. The app will also feature suggestions of new video content to watch, curated by Apple editors.\n\u201cWe want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.\nThe service is not quite there, since Apple has not yet signed on key streaming services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and live television shows are still difficult to get access to on Apple TV."

Apple, which has experiencedsluggish salesof its flagship iPhone products in recent quarters, will offer the first peek into sales of the new iPhone 7 and the extra business it is getting sinceSamsung\u2019s troubleswith the Galaxy Note 7. The anticipated updates to the Mac line should also perk up what is still an important business for Apple in the mobile era.Vindu Goel\nGoogle must respond by Wednesday toEuropean antitrust chargesthat some of the company\u2019s advertising products hampered consumer choice. The search company denies any wrongdoing. The deadline may also still be extended from Wednesday. But it represents the first of three separate responses that Google must give to European competition authorities by early November to allegations that some of its services and products, including the popular Android smartphone operating system, hindered rivals and limited competition in Europe.Mark Scott\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nTesla Motors\u2019 finances will come into focus on Wednesday when it reports its earnings for the third quarter. The company previously disclosed thatdeliveries rose 70 percentto 24,500 cars in the July-to-September period. But a loss is likely because the company is spending heavily to introduce anew car, the Model 3, and to start up its giganticGigafactory in Nevada, where it will produce batteries. Investors will listen closely to Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, and any details he offers on thepending mergerwith one of his other companies, SolarCity, a maker of solar panels. On Friday, the company is expected to present a system that combines solar panels with a battery pack to store power for home use and a vehicle-charging unit.Neal E. Boudette\nBANKING\nIt should be a busy week for earnings reports in Europe as several of the region\u2019s biggest banks are scheduled to report their third-quarter results. Deutsche Bank, the French bank BNP Paribas, Santander of Spain, the Swiss bank UBS and the British lenders Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are all expected to update investors on their results.\nInvestors are expected to keep a close eye on Deutsche Bank and any update on its negotiations with the Justice Department over investigation of its underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities. The German lender\u2019sshares have been under pressureover concerns about the pace of its turnaround and worries that it may be forced to pay billions of dollars in fines. The Justice Department has proposed that the bank pay as much as $14 billion to settle the case.Chad Bray\nTECHNOLOGY\nAlphabet, parent company of Google, reports quarterly earnings on Thursday after the close of market. Google\u2019s dominance in search and digital advertising is expected to ensure another quarter of growing revenue and profit ata clip rarely seenfor a company of its size. But the focus will be on the progress of Alphabet\u2019s \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 loss-making businesses like Google Fiber and the Nest connected home devices. Alphabet wants to limit those losses in the short term, while hoping that one of those bets blossoms into a future earnings pillar.Daisuke Wakabayashi\nECONOMY\nOn Thursday, the Commerce Department will announce data on durable goods orders in September. Economists are predicting that durable goods demand will be up by 0.7 percentage point, with much of that gain resulting from a jump in aircraft orders. The less volatile core capital goods category is thought to have declined by 0.1 percentage point, oncontinuing cautionamong businesses in terms of new investment, especially in the industrial sector.Nelson D. Schwartz\nOn Friday, the Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of economic growth in the third quarter. Afterlackluster gainsin the first half of 2016 \u2014 0.8 percentage point in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in the second \u2014 economists think the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the July-to-September period.\nWhile that\u2019s better, it\u2019s still down a bit from earlier forecasts of third-quarter growth, amid weakness in business spending and construction of new multifamily housing. On the other hand, consumer spending continues to be healthy, and experts will be watching to see whether that trend continued last quarter.Nelson D. Schwartz"

        "fulltext": "Q.How can I tell how much free iCloud storage I have left and what\u2019s using it? Do I look on my Mac or my iPhone?\nA.Apple gives five free gigabytes of iCloud server space to every user to store mail and other data. If you exceed your allotment, you either have todelete filesand old messages orbuy more iCloud storage spacefrom Apple. You can see how much space you are currently using on your Mac, iOS device or even a PC with theiCloud for Windowssoftware installed.\nOn the Mac, open the System Preferences from the Apple menu or desktop dock, click the iCloud icon and then click Manage. In iOS 9 or later, open the Settings icon on the home screen, select iCloud and then Storage. On a Windows computer, open iCloud from the Apps or programs menu and click Manage in the box.\nOn the storage-management screen, you can see a list of all the apps parking their files on the iCloud server \u2014 and how much of your five gigabytes each one is using. This can be helpful in deciding which apps to whittle down.\nFor example, if you see your iCloud Mail is taking up several gigabytes, you can delete old messages and attachments you no longer need to regain some space. Deleting iCloud Photo Library pictures you do not need (or want) also helps free up room.\nIf you do not want to delete any files, tap or click the Buy More Storage button on the iCloud screen to sign up fora monthly service plan. Prices now start at about a $1 a month for 50 gigabytes of storage and go up to about $20 a month for two terabytes of iCloud real estate."
