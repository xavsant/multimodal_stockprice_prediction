        "fulltext": "President Trump and congressional lawmakers are not the only ones interested incollecting taxes on global profitsthat American corporations are hoarding overseas. European regulators, knee deep in a campaign to stamp out tax avoidance, have their own plans for that money.\nLast week, for instance, the European Commissionbilled Amazon for $293 millionin unpaid taxes in Luxembourg, arguing that the country\u2019s failure to collect the tax amounted to an illegal state subsidy. It also took Ireland to court for not following up on the $15.2 billion tax bill imposed on Apple last year.\n\u201cThe Europeans are targeting U.S. dollars overseas that the U.S. believes should be taxed here,\u201d said Dave Camp, a former Republican representative from Michigan who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the author of anunsuccessful tax overhaulin 2014. \u201cWe have to address this problem before the Europeans get there first.\u201d\nThe rulings on Amazon and Apple \u2014 which those companies are disputing \u2014 are byproducts of a race among governments to lure corporate giants to their shores in the hunt for new sources of revenue. That cutthroat competition is the reason that 73 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a subsidiary in a low-tax haven, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (Their latest report, done in conjunction with the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, was released on Tuesday.)\nThat rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help \u2014 rather than hobble \u2014 Washington\u2019s efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nRepublican leaders have already put at the center oftheir tax rewritean idea borrowed from Europe and other countries: Replace the system of taxing the worldwide profits of a domestic corporation with one that taxes only profits earned within its own territory.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,\u201d Mr. Camp warned.\nMultinationals will inevitably shop around for low rates. Americans and foreign companies have all played the same games, shifting patents and copyrights, profits and royalties to places with no or low corporate tax rates, like theCayman Islands and Bermuda. (The I.R.S. itself went after Amazon over assets it transferred to a Luxembourg unit, but Amazonultimately prevailed.)\nEfforts to cooperate have not always been successful, but there are signs that coordination can help. TheEuropeans\u2019 effortis gradually shutting down the most notorious tax dodges that route corporate cash through Ireland and Luxembourg, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor and tax specialist at Columbia Law School.\n\u201cThose are like dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving towards extinction.\u201d\nAnd anew ruleadopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, requiring multinationals to report their income and tax bill ineach country, will make it easier for the more than 60 governments that have signed on to monitor how much is actually collected.\nSo far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles.\nNow the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don\u2019t bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what\u2019s known as a territorial system.\nThe bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\nThe $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated \u2014 although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals.\nBut this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals.\nWithout tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes.\nTo some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company\u2019s tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S.\nOther experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators \u2014 like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals.\nAs theAmazonand Apple cases show, \u201cthe politics in Europe are to tax somebody else\u2019s multinationals, particularly ours,\u201d said Mr. Graetz of Columbia.\n\u201cAll of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,\u201d he added, \u201cand not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.\u201d\nThis is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can\u2019t shield assets.\nThe complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul.\n\u201cThe United States corporate and international tax rules are an anticompetitive mess,\u201dsaid Itai Grinberg, a law professor at Georgetown University. And one of their most senseless features, he added, is the tax advantage that permits foreign-owned corporations to artificially strip out their earnings in the United States.\nBoth he andBret Wells, a law professor at the University of Houston, testified that foreign and American companies should be treated the same way.\nLeveling the playing field does not necessarily have to wait for a rewritten tax code. Adam Looney, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department, said the Trump administration could take a step now. He urged the president to reverse a decision todelay an Obama-era regulationto limit foreign companies\u2019 tax advantages and prevent them from transferring out their earnings.\n\u201cWithout the regulations, American-owned businesses will be worse off,\u201d while foreign multinationals avoid about $7.4 billion in United States taxes, Mr. Looney wrote this week in apolicy brieffor the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.\nThe delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying \u201cforeign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.\u201d"

Last summer, Sony Pictures releaseda movie that imagined emojis\u2019 inner emotional life. (Neither the campaign nor the film was a success. The real-world track record of emojis is not great.)\nNevertheless, emojis have provided a cheeky visual shorthand for such common experiences as laughing, vomiting and, with the latest update, the desire to reference a hedgehog in everyday conversation.\nThe latest update appears to continue a yearslong trend toward greater diversity among emojis, which began in earnest in 2015, when Apple allowed users to select the skin tone of most of the human pictograms.\nThe company said in a statement that thenew emojis were \u201cdesigned to reveal every detail\u201dand were adopted from approved characters used in earlier updates.\nAmong the options announced on Friday were a woman in a head scarf, a woman breast-feeding, and what the company called the love-you gesture, which it said was designed after the sign for \u201cI love you\u201d in American Sign Language, which combines the signs for the letters I, L and Y.\nSo, how does a new emoji find its way to your screen? The process is complicated enough that it might make you feel like a smiley face with a nuclear mushroom cloud erupting from your head. (Yes, that is one of the new ones.)\nThe process is shepherded by the Unicode Consortium, a little-known group that meets quarterly and includes executives from several large technology companies, including Apple and Google.\nThe consortium was founded in the 1980s to develop a standardized code for text characters \u2014 including letters, numerals and, in the present day, emojis \u2014 that enables different computers easily to communicate with one other.\nThe Unicode Consortium\u2019s co-founder and president, Mark Davis, 63, described how the group chose emojis inan interview with The Timesin 2015.\nAmong the factors he cited for inclusion were whether the symbol had been translated into Unicode, and how likely it was to be popular or useful.\n\u201cCompleteness\u201d was also an influential factor, he said, citing the addition of a mosque and a synagogue to the emoji lexicon that had already included an image of a church."

        "title": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It",
        "fulltext": "The tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.\nThe history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.\nIn the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve thesafety of automobilesandother manufactured goods,to break up a telephone monopolythat controlled much of the nation\u2019s communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society.\nWe are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies,the Frightful Five\u2014 Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value \u2014 control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future.\nYet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.\nNow, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.\nThere are growing efforts in Washington to dosomethingabout big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year\u2019s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.\nOn the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.\nBut there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\n\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\nMr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation,reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)\n\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201d\nPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.\nThey\u2019re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence \u2014 a technological achievement that may come withas many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.\nBut in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets \u2014Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.\nApple\u2019s iPhone is the world\u2019s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United Statesare not iPhones.\nAmazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon\u2019s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, hasa single-digit share of American retailand is still aminor satellite compared with Walmart\u2019s sun.\nThen there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201d\nThe complicated nature of the Five\u2019s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, publishedan article in The Yale Law Journalarguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.\nBecause Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon\u2019s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets hasoffered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.\nYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.\nThat, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.\nPut all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.\n\u201cWe are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,\u201d said Gary Reback, aSilicon Valley antitrust lawyerwho took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.\nMr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.\nA similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\n\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201d"

I thought the new system was supposed to save photos in that new H.E.I.F. format to save space, but when I send pictures as mail attachments, they show up as JPG files. What gives?\nA.Apple\u2019s recentiOS 11 updatedoes support the newHigh Efficiency Image File Formatfor photos; the company uses the file suffix .HEIC for images using the new standard. Additionally, the iOS 11 system uses the newerHigh Efficiency Video Codec(H.E.V.C.) for videos captured with compatible iPhones and other iOS devices. To be able to use the new formats, you need to be running iOS 11 on an iPhone 7 or later, or on one of the latest iPad Pro models. Macs running the new macOS High Sierra operating system are also compatible.\nAmongother advantages, the new formats store higher-quality images in less space. An H.E.I.F. photo can be about half the file size of a picture saved in the JPG format, and this allows you to store more photos on your phone. Because not every hardware and software maker out there immediately supports new formats, Apple has added tools to help iOS 11 users share and edit their photos and videos without hassle.\nFor example, when you send a photo you have just snapped on your phone by email, the iOS 11 software quietly converts the file to a JPG so your recipient will not have any trouble opening the attachment and viewing the picture. Pictures posted to social media sites are similarly converted.\nYou can see files in the new formats if you import them into a Mac running macOS High Sierra, and the space those photos occupy on the drive will be smaller. Some file-sharing services likeDropboxalready support the new standards, and others are likely to come along in time.\nIf you care more about compatibility than drive space and do not want to take any chances, you can change the default format for your pictures. On the iPhone\u2019s home screen, tap the Settings icon, then Camera and select Formats. In the Camera Capture area, choose High Efficiency to use the H.E.I.F. and H.E.V.C. formats for your photos and videos \u2014 or go with Most Compatible to use the older JPG photo and H.264 video formats. Apple notes that if you opt for Most Compatible, you will not be able to record video at the 4K 60 frames per second setting, or at the 1080p 240 f.p.s. setting."

        "title": "Google\u2019s Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance",
        "fulltext": "The last smartphone I reviewed was the original Apple iPhone, which ushered in the mobile revolution back in 2007. At the time, I didn\u2019t exactly give the device a rave. Two weeks after waiting in line for hours outside the San Francisco Apple Store and paying $540 for the iPhone, I even returned it and got my money back.\nIt was obvious to me that the iPhone was a powerful thing and everyone \u2014 from Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, right down to the people I passed on the street \u2014 kept telling me how great it was. But it was also an extravagance. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t really justify its $500-plus cost for another year.\nTen years on, I\u2019m now reviewing the Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday. And my take is pretty much the same: People who want the latest and greatest phones won\u2019t be disappointed by thePixel. But for most of us, this device, with a starting price of $649, is an extravagance.\nGoogle has found tremendous success convincing the world that it should prefer smartphones that run Android, its mobile operating system, which dominates global market share over Apple. But Google has had much less success designing and selling its own phones.\nIt is not for a lack of trying. Last fall, the company\u2019s campaign reached a new peak with the arrival ofthe original Pixel. According to reviewers who werehipper, more experienced and less cynicalthan I, the Pixel was superior to the iPhone \u2014 a stance that amounts to sacrilege in certain circles.\nNow comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone \u2014 though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I\u2019m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I\u2019m silly for not buying an iPhone.\nCompared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.\nI liked that the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s fingerprint reader, which instantly unlocks the phone, sat on the back of the device, not far from where my finger typically sits. I liked that the phone arrived with only a small number of essential apps, rather than the sea of flotsam that typically ships with Samsung phones. And I liked that, as my 13-year-old Snapchat-astic daughter said, \u201cthe camera isdefinitelybetter.\u201d\n(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)\nThe Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous \u2014 though not so huge that I couldn\u2019t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.\nYet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.\nIn pitching the new Pixel, the company focused on the Google Assistant \u2014 Android\u2019s answer to Siri \u2014 and other services that lean onwhat is commonly called artificial intelligence. This included Google Lens, a service that instantly identifies landmarks, books, movies and other stuff you capture in photos, as well as a service that, in similar fashion, automatically identifies songs playing on a nearby radio or television.\nThese were certainly the most impressive parts of the new phone. And they showed howrecent advances in machine learningare producing consumer devices, cars and robots that can read, analyze and respond to their environment in ways that were not possible just a few years ago. Drawing on work by DeepMind, an A.I. lab in Britain that Google acquired in 2014, for instance, the Google Assistantnow speaks with a voice that\u2019s closer to your own.\n\u201cIt sounds more normal,\u201d my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.\nThat sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.\nGoogle Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it\u2019s not something she \u2014 or I \u2014 would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York\u2019s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)\nThe service that identifies songs was even more fun and more useful. But it will never be anything more than a tiny part of our daily lives. And it mistakenly identified the musical score at the end of \u201cThe Spy Who Came In From the Cold\u201d as the song \u201cChained\u201d by the pop group the xx.\nThe Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)\nBut like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.\nIn most cases, it can recognize what you say. But it cannot necessarilyunderstandwhat you say and respond in a completely satisfying way. That is still to come.\nGoogle boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks \u2014 like sending a text or setting an alarm \u2014 without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.\nStill, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from \u201cThe Warrior\u201d to \u201cDer Kommissar.\u201d\nEven so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone."

        "fulltext": "Q.I just upgraded my iPad to iOS 11, and while I liked dragging my favorites into the little bar of apps across the bottom of the screen, the bar itself doesn\u2019t stay there consistently. Why?\nA.The new \u201cdock\u201d in Apple\u2019s latest version of its mobile software is similar tothe tool bar that has been a part of its Mac operating systemfor years. Like the desktop version, the iOS 11 dock is designed to hide when you do not need it. The auto-hide behavior in macOS is optional and can be changed in the System Preferences, but the iOS 11 dock is designed to disappear to minimize screen clutter when you open an app on the iPad.\nHowever, if you want the dock back because you want toopen (or switch to) another appwithout having to press the iPad\u2019s home button to go back to the Home screen, just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to make the dock reappear. You can then tap an app in the dock to open that program.\nTo switch between other running apps, drag your finger up from the bottom of the screen when the dock is showing. You then see small preview windows of open apps and theiOS 11 Control Center, a panel of icons that serve as shortcuts to common system settings. Swipe the screen to the left or the right to see all the open app windows. (You can also double-click the home button to see this \u201capp-switcher\u201d screen.)\nYou can switch to another app by tapping its preview window. And, if an app is frozen or misbehaving, you can force it to close by dragging its preview window off the top of the screen."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At the start of this decade, the Arab Spring blossomed with the help of social media. That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind.\nMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, proclaimed that this was exactly why his social network existed. Ina 2012 manifestofor investors, he said Facebook was a tool to create \u201ca more honest and transparent dialogue around government.\u201d The result, he said, would be \u201cbetter solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.\u201d\nNow tech companies are under fire for creating problems instead of solving them. At the top of the list isRussian interference in last year\u2019s presidential election. Social media might have originally promised liberation, but it proved an even more useful tool for stoking anger. The manipulation was so efficient andso lacking in transparencythat the companies themselves barely noticed it was happening.\nThe election is far from the only area of concern. Tech companies have accrueda tremendous amount of power and influence. Amazon determines how people shop, Google how they acquire knowledge, Facebook how they communicate. All of them are making decisions about who gets a digital megaphone and who should be unplugged from the web.\nTheir amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force.\n\u201cFor 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cNow sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.\u201d\nNews is dripping out of Facebook, Twitter andnow Googleabout how their ad and publishing systems were harnessed by the Russians. On Nov. 1, the Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on the matter. It is unlikely to enhance the companies\u2019 reputations.\nUnder growing pressure, the companies are mounting a public relations blitz. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer,was in Washington this week, meeting with lawmakers and making public mea culpas about how things happened during the election \u201cthat should not have happened.\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, was in Pittsburgh on Thursday talking about the \u201clarge gaps in opportunity across the U.S.\u201d andannouncing a $1 billion grant programto promote jobs.\nUnderlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies\u2019 first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.\nRoss Baird, president of the venture capital firm Village Capital, noted that when ProPublica tried last monthto buy targeted ads for \u201cJew haters\u201don Facebook, the platform did not question whether this was a bad idea \u2014 it asked the buyers how they would like to pay.\n\u201cFor all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,\u201d Mr. Baird said.\nCriticism of tech is nothing new, of course. In a Newsweek jeremiad in 1995 titled\u201cWhy the Web Won\u2019t Be Nirvana,\u201dthe astronomer Clifford Stoll pointed out that \u201cevery voice can be heard cheaply and instantly\u201d on the Usenet bulletin boards, that era\u2019s Twitter and Facebook.\n\u201cThe result?\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.\u201d\nSuch complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.\nWhat is different today are the warnings from the technologists themselves. \u201cThe monetization and manipulation of information is swiftly tearing us apart,\u201d Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay,wrote this week.\nJustin Rosenstein, a former Facebook engineer, was portrayed ina recent Guardian storyas an apostate: Noting that sometimes inventors have regrets, he said he had programmed his new phone to not let him use the social network.\nMr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.\n\u201cI realized that I spend a lot of time mindlessly interacting with my phone in ways that aren\u2019t serving me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is a very powerful tool that I continue to use every day, just with more mindfulness.\u201d\nIf social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot \u2014 a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.\n\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018Move fast and break things,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. \u201cThe idea is that if you never break anything, you\u2019re probably not moving fast enough.\u201d\nFacebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, \u201cThe Four,\u201d analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.\n\u201cZuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.\u201d\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.\n\u201cFacebook is an important part of many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous responsibility \u2014 and one that we take incredibly seriously.\u201d\nSome social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,\u201d Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.\nHe maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: \u201cFor every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that sometimes \u201cit gets a little messy.\u201d\nDespite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.\nIn Europe, however, the ground is already shifting. Google\u2019s share of the search engine market there is 92 percent, according to StatCounter. But that did not stop the European Union fromfining it $2.7 billionin June for putting its products above those of its rivals.\nA new German law that fines social networks huge sums for not taking down hate speech went into effect this month. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britainsaid the government was looking\u201ccarefully at the roles, responsibility and legal status\u201d of Google and Facebook, with an eye to regulating them as news publishers rather than platforms.\n\u201cThis war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.\nFor some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.\n\u201cIncreasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,\u201d said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive.\nThe picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.\nAnother possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech \u2014 and eventually all dissent \u2014 is filtered out.\n\u201cPeople are realizing that technology isn\u2019t neutral,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cI used to travel to Europe to hear these fears. Now I just have to go to Sacramento.\u201d"
