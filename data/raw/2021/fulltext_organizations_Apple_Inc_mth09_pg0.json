        "fulltext": "Apple said on Friday that it would delay its rollout of child safety measures, which would have allowed it to scan users\u2019 iPhones to detect images of child sexual abuse, aftercriticism from privacy groups.\nThe company announced in early August thatiPhones would begin using complex technology to spot images of child sexual abuse, commonly known as child pornography, that users uploaded to its iCloud storage service. Apple also said it would let parents turn on a feature that could flag them when their children sent or received nude photos in text messages.\nThe measures faced strong resistance from computer scientists, privacy groups and civil-liberty lawyers because the features represented the first technology that would allow a company to look at a person\u2019s private data and report it to law enforcement authorities.\n\u201cBased on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,\u201dApple saidin statement posted to its website.\nThe feature would have allowed Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri, to direct people who asked about child sexual abuse to appropriate resources, as well as enable parents to turn on technology that scans images in their children\u2019s text messages for nudity.\nThe tool that generated the most backlash, however, was a software program that would have scanned users\u2019 iPhone photos and compared them with a database of known child sexual abuse images.\nThe tech giant announced the changes afterreports in The New York Timesshowed the proliferation of child sexual abuse images online.\nMatthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, said that once the ability to sift through users\u2019 private photos was out there, it would have been ripe for misuse. Governments, for example, could potentially lean on Apple\u2019s technology to help track down dissidents.\nApple argued that it was \u201cgoing to resist pressure from all governments in the world, including China,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t seem like a very safe system.\u201d\nApple did not appear to anticipate such a backlash. When the company announced the changes, it sent reporters technical explainers and statements from child-safety groups and computer scientists applauding the effort.\nBut Mr. Green said the company\u2019s move did not seem to take into account the views of the privacy and child safety communities. \u201cIf I could have designed a rollout that was intended to fail, it would have looked like this one,\u201d he said.\nWhat matters, experts said, is what Apple will do now that it has hit pause. Will it cancel the initiative entirely, simply roll out nearly identical features after a delay or find a middle ground?\n\u201cWe look forward to hearing more about how Apple intends to change or improve its planned capabilities to tackle these problems without undermining end-to-end encryption, privacy and free expression,\u201d Samir Jain, the policy director for the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group, said in a statement.\nJoe Mullin, a policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said the foundation had a petition with more than 25,000 signatures asking Apple not to introduce the feature. He said that it was \u201cgreat that they\u2019re taking a moment to think things over,\u201d but that he and other privacy coalitions would continue to plead with Apple to abandon its plan altogether."

        "title": "What the Privacy Battle Upending the Internet Means for You",
        "fulltext": "The internet is changing, including how much we pay for content and the ads and brands we see.\nThat\u2019s because Apple and Google, two hugely influential tech companies, are rolling out privacy protections that hinder marketers from gaining access to our data when they show us ads. The changes have major repercussions for online advertising, which are a business foundation for the free apps and websites that many of us use, like Facebook, TikTok and the Weather Channel. Those sites and apps now have to come up with new ways to show ads or make money.\nHere\u2019s what that means for you.\nFor decades, advertisers relied on \u201ccookies,\u201d pieces of code planted in web browsers that can follow our personal web browsing to track us online and show us relevant ads. When smartphones came along, marketers also used trackers inside mobile apps to follow people across apps and websites.\nThese advertising technologies became incredibly potent and effective \u2014 if you shopped for shoes, shoe ads would follow you around the internet \u2014 but with major downsides. It enabled marketers to build hyper-realistic profiles of us that were hardly anonymous. It also opened doors for bad actors to steal people\u2019s data and spread misinformation.\nWidespread concern overonline privacyin recent years started an industrywide discussion about what to do about this tracking. Apple and Google have stepped in with different solutions.\nIn 2017, Apple debuted a version of its Safari web browser that prevented the technology used by marketing companies to follow people from site to site. This year, Apple also releasedApp Tracking Transparency, a pop-up window in iPhone apps that gives people the choice to not be tracked across apps and websites.\nIn 2019, Google announced the Privacy Sandbox, a set of ideas for developing a more private web. The company has plans for its Chrome web browser to block tracking cookies in 2023 in favor of a new system for advertisers to target us with ads.\nThat system might be one called Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLOC. It involves grouping people together based on their interests. If you visit websites related to tennis and dogs, you may be placed into a cohort of people who share those interests. As soon as a website loads, it scans the browser for an identification code to see what group you belong to. The website then can decide what types of ads to show your group.\nIn theory, this would be less invasive than today\u2019s tracking methods because advertisers wouldn\u2019t have access to a cookie that contains your personal browsing history.\nBecause of the sheer reach of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s products \u2014 Google\u2019s Chrome browser is No. 1 in the world, and Apple\u2019s iPhone is the best-selling phone \u2014 advertisers have no choice but to adapt. They now have to figure out new ways to show us ads, using less of our data. Some companies that relied on digital ads to appeal to people, such as small online publications, may not survive.\nIn the near term, digital ads are going to look different.\nLonger term, the internet you see using Apple products may end up looking dissimilar from the one you see using Google products.\nLet\u2019s start with Apple. In the past, if you opened a free iPhone weather app, it may have used tracking technology to look at what you did in other apps and websites. The app would then present an ad for something specific to you, like a restaurant that you previously ordered takeout from.\nBut since that tracking can now be blocked, the weather app must rely on other data to serve an ad. That might be contextual information, such as the time of day. The upshot is that the ads you see might be less relevant and more random.\nWith Google, if the company adopts the FLOC system, that will also change the nature of the ads you see.\nToday, when you use the Chrome browser to click on a pair of Nike sneakers, you are likely to see an ad for that specific shoe follow you from site to site and app to app. In the future, a website would lack the knowledge that you looked at those sneakers, but it would know that you were in a group that expressed interest in shoes. That means you might see ads for other athletic shoes, even if not for that specific sneaker.\nApple\u2019s and Google\u2019s changing approaches may lead web publishers to choose sides, said Brendan Eich, a founder of Brave, a private web browser. If publishers are happier with Google\u2019s ad solution, they may design their websites to work well on Google\u2019s browser and not so well on Apple\u2019s.\nThat could result in a \u201cfragmentation\u201d of the web, where people see different versions of the internet depending on the browsers they use, Mr. Eich said.\nThe good news is that you will have more privacy online because of Apple\u2019s changes.\nBut there\u2019s a trade-off. Ultimately, many online products and services may cost more.\nToday, small brands can spend a modest amount to target specific customers with ads across different websites and apps. But since this type of tracking can now be blocked on Apple devices, small companies may have to choose big brands like Facebook, Google and Etsy and advertise within each of those platforms.\nIn other words, businesses may be forced to spend more to advertise their products across multiple properties. Those higher costs would then be passed on to you, leading to price increases.\nThis is already happening. Chantal Ebanks, the owner of an online beauty supply shop, Bella Chauni, said that after Apple\u2019s new ad blocking went into effect, her digital promotions on Facebook\u2019s ad network no longer reached as many customers. As a result, her sales shriveled from thousands of dollars a month to hundreds. To compensate, Ms. Ebanks raised the price for a popular hair care product to $13.98 from $9.99 and is testing ads on other platforms like Pinterest.\nEric Seufert, a marketing strategist, predicted that more iPhone apps would move away from trying to make money off ads. He said they would start charging people for subscriptions or extras inside apps.\nThe shift to subscriptions has happened for a while, but it\u2019s expected to accelerate. Between 2017 and 2020, the portion of top video games offering subscriptions in Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store grewto 18 percentfrom 11 percent, according to a study by SensorTower, a mobile app research firm.\nAs Google tries to reinvent ad targeting rather than killing it completely, its users will continue to see targeted ads. The company\u2019s proposed advertising methods could also create new issues, security experts said.\nAdvertisers couldcombine people\u2019s FLOC IDs with other information to continue pinpointing them, said Eric Rescorla, the chief technology officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser.\nThe system could also place vulnerable people into groups where they are disproportionately targeted by exploitative ads, said Bennett Cyphers, a technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. Those who earn a lower income, for instance, could end up in a group that receives ads for payday loans and cryptocurrency scams, he said.\nGoogle said FLOC was one of many proposals it was testing. Ben Galbraith, director of product management for Google\u2019s Chrome browser, said simply blocking cookies would lead to worse privacy outcomes because advertisers would find more invasive ways to track people.\nThe company also said that it had mechanisms to prevent people from being grouped into sensitive cohorts and that FLOC IDs would change every seven days to prevent them from being tracked."

        "title": "In a setback for Apple, the European Union seeks a common charger for all phones.",
        "fulltext": "The European Union unveiled plans on Thursday to make USB-C connectors the standard charging port for all smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices sold across the bloc, an initiative that it says will reduce environmental waste but that is likely to hit Apple the hardest.\nThe move would represent a long-awaited yet aggressive step into product-making decisions by the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm. Apple, whose iPhones are equipped with a different port, has long opposed the plan, arguing that it would stifle innovation and lead to more electronic waste as all current chargers that are not USB-C would become obsolete.\nThenew legislationis likely to come into effect in 2024 because it first needs to be approved by the European Parliament and then adopted by manufacturers. Besides phones, it would apply to cameras, headphones, portable speakers and video game consoles.\nWireless chargers would not be affected, but the main change would come for iPhones, which currently have a proprietary Lightning charging port.\n\u201cWhat are we offering? More freedom, fewer costs\u201d and less electronic waste, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for trade, said in a news conference on Thursday.\nMany European Parliament lawmakers welcomed the announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s completely absurd to ask Europeans to pay for a new charger every time, while our drawers are full of them,\u201d said Saskia Bricmont, a Green lawmaker.\nIt also received swift criticism from some tech observers. \u201cThis is a profoundly stupid way to approach product design and standardization,\u201d a tech analyst, Benedict Evans, said onTwitter. \u201cWhat happens in 5 years when someone wants to use a better connector?\u201d\nStill, if the legislation is enacted as proposed by the European Commission, it will become illegal to sell an electronic device without a USB-C charging port. Apple would have to switch to USB-C for its products sold across the bloc, a commission official said, noting that it already sells new iPads with such charging ports.\nThe legislative proposal is the latest setback in Europe for Apple, which European Union regulators have accused ofmaintaining unfair fees on rival music-streaming serviceslike Spotify that depend on the App Store to reach customers. It is also facing an inquiry into its Apple Pay service, which is the only payment service available on Apple products and which E.U. officials have said could violate the bloc\u2019s competition rules.\nDaniel Ives, the managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, called the E.U. proposal a \u201cgut punch to Apple\u201d that would force the company to adapt its design and supply chain, and cost up to $1 billion.\n\u201cIt kicks the battle between Apple and the European Union to the next level,\u201d Mr. Ives said. \u201cIt\u2019s like forcing Netflix to provide VCR screening alongside streaming.\u201d\nEuropean Union officials and lawmakers at the European Parliament have beenadvocating a common chargersince 2009, when there were more than 30 charging options on the market, now down to three. They have argued that fewer wires would be more convenient for users and better for the environment, as mobile phone chargers are responsible for 11,000 tons of electronic waste per year across the bloc, according to estimates by the European Commission.\nBut Apple has also argued that if the European Union had imposed a common charger in 2009, it would have restricted innovation that led to USB-C and Lightning connectors. In a statement, Apple said that although it welcomed the European Commission\u2019s commitment to protecting the environment, it favored a solution that left the device side of the charging interface open for innovation.\nMr. Breton said on Thursday that he was familiar with Apple\u2019s concerns. \u201cEvery time we try to put a proposal, such companies start to say, \u2018It will be against innovation,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all against innovation. It\u2019s not against anyone,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s for European consumers.\u201d\nMr. Breton said manufacturers, including Apple, could choose to offer two charging ports on their devices if they wanted to keep a non-USB-C connector. But that is highly unlikely, as one of Apple\u2019s main arguments in favor of its Lightning connector has been its small size on iPhones.\n\u201cThe time it\u2019s taken to move forward with this project says a lot about Apple\u2019s power, which until now has managed to delay the process while all the other manufacturers accepted to use USB micro-B, and now USB-C, connectors,\u201d said Ms. Bricmont, the European lawmaker.\nBut critics have also charged that the European Union\u2019s action is coming too late, because of the decline in the types of connectors in recent years. Half the charging cables sold with mobile phones in 2018 had a USB micro-B connector, while 29 percent had a USB-C and 21 percent a Lightning connector, according tostudypublished by the European Commission in 2019. The share of USB-C charging ports is most likely to have since increased as most Android phones are now sold with it.\nThe European Commission said it would also require manufacturers to sell devices without chargers: If a bundled option remains available, an unbundled option of the same product would have to be offered, it said.\nAdam Satarianocontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple and Facebook Are Coming for Your Face Next",
        "fulltext": "It is difficult to avoid sounding vulgar, somehow, when discussing the future of facial computing. Thereissomething inescapably crude, isn\u2019t there, about the prospect of everyone walking around with computers on our faces?\nAnd yet I suspect the world may adopt face computers anyway, and not long from now, perhaps even within the coming decade. People in tech have long been wondering what might succeed smartphones as the next dominant computing platform. For a long time I\u2019ve thought that nothing would \u2014 that phones would remain our primary computers for the foreseeable future. In the past few months, though, I\u2019ve begun to face the fact that our faces are \u2026 in trouble.\nThe face computer is coming \u2014 brace yourself for an onslaught of \u201csmart\u201d glasses, virtual-reality headsets and other devices that connect your eyes to the digital world.\nSo far there have been only a few such machines, most famously Google\u2019s failed digital specs, Google Glass.Facebook and Ray-Ban recently unveiledcamera-enabled sunglasses; Snap, which makes Snapchat, also hassuch a device. The sunglasses let you photograph life in the moment, from your eyes\u2019 point of view; when you\u2019re building sand castles at the beach with your kids, you can tap your specs to capture the memory while you\u2019re living it rather than reaching for your phone with sandy fingers.\nFacebook and Microsoft are making virtual-reality headsets, too. These function as powerful personal computers mounted to your eyes, creating an enveloping digital experience \u2014 video games and movies surround you, the real world replaced by the machine.\nThough none of these devices has been a huge success, the tech that powers face-mounted computers is getting quite good quite fast. It is probably only a few years until a face computer hits big \u2014 perhaps when Apple releases the one ithas been reported to be working on.\nThere are enormous social, cultural and legal reasons to worry about face computers becoming ubiquitous. Such devices could turn your eyes into constantly recording dashcams, superimpose Instagrammy toxicity over your real-life conversations and add a layer of reality-bending computer graphics to everything you see. It doesn\u2019t help that they are being developed by some of the most intrusive,least trustworthycorporations in the world.\nBut if creepiness posed a fatal impediment to success in the tech industry, we wouldn\u2019t have smartphones or Facebook. Here\u2019s the thing about face computers: With the right design, when their components inevitably become small and powerful enough, these machines could make computing much more visceral and accessible, which most likely means more irresistible, too. I worry about the sudden inevitability of face computers \u2014 that, as happened with smartphones, they could become ubiquitous before society begins to appreciate the way they might be altering everything.\nI say this having used a lot of pretty bad face computers over the past few years. Even the worst of them suggested a compelling goal. Face computers promise to improve the two things we most often do on our phones: watch stuff and take pictures of stuff. A computer you can always see paired with a camera always watching whatever you are \u2014 isn\u2019t it obvious how such a device might fit in during the age of YouTube and TikTok?\nFace computers also mitigate two of the touch-screen phone\u2019s biggest shortcomings \u2014 the touch and the screen. My phone claims to help me, and yet it demands constant attention from my fingersandmy eyes. In this economy?\nThis is the best pitch for the face computer: It lets you get digital information more flexibly than you can on any other device.\nOn the one hand, these machines can conjure experiences that are much more intense than on any other device. With a face computer, you\u2019re not just watching videos online \u2014 you\u2019re inhabiting them in a way that feels embodied.\nRecently I\u2019ve been hooked on Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest 2, the light, portable virtual-reality headset released late last year. What I like about it is its depth of experience: I\u2019m not usually a gamer, but the Quest 2 has a large library of immersive titles that I found entrancing, among them a rock-climbing game whose perilous realism made my hands clammy.\nVirtual reality will conquer gaming because it is unmatched at affecting your entire physical experience \u2014 when you ride a virtual-reality roller coaster, your stomach drops just like on the real thing. Even ordinary videos gain from the V.R. experience \u2014 I found that scrolling through high-resolution nature videos on YouTube\u2019s virtual-reality app is a wonderful way to remember what it was like when we were allowed to leave our houses.\nMainly we\u2019ll use these things for fun. But there\u2019s a chance V.R. catches on for other uses, too. Nutty as it sounds, I have been meditating in V.R. \u2014 picking some peaceful virtual spot and sitting there silently, just \u201cfeeling\u201d the world around me. Yes, it\u2019s super dorky; it\u2019s also terrifically relaxing.\nComputers conquered our lives during the pandemic, but it\u2019s the rare Zoom meeting that doesn\u2019t feel lo-fi, awkward and distant. Talking to people over V.R. is natural by comparison; because the headset lets the digital world fully engulf your senses, it has the ironic effect of liberating you from the ever-present sensation that all of your interactions are being mediated by machines.\nI still don\u2019t think V.R. is for everyone \u2014 the experience is so immersive that it often feels impractical. V.R. shuts out the offline world entirely, demanding all your attention. Who has time to drop everything to climb a virtual mountain?\nAnd so tech companies have been experimenting with less immersive machines for your face, what some call augmented reality. This is the world that Google imagined when it started selling its Glass spectacles in 2014.\nAs a matter of technology, Glass was a marvel \u2014 Google had stuffed a display, speakers and a camera into a machine built only slightly obtrusively into eyeglass frames. One knock on Glass was that it didn\u2019t do a whole lot to justify its price; it could snap short videos and display digital tidbits, like the weather, in the corner of your visual frame, for $1,500.\nYet function is rarely an obvious impediment in wearable tech. Wristwatches only tell time, and sunglasses only tell the world you\u2019re awesome. In some ways not doing too much was the point of Glass. The specs promised to offer you digital information more discreetly than your phone could. It imagined a visual field one day enriched by information \u2014 the latest headlines and your incoming texts superimposed over your walk home, a cable-news chyron on the lower third of your life: SPOUSE SAYS MILK GONE. BLAME BIDEN?\nThe big problem with Google Glass was not technical but social. Despite the company\u2019s best efforts to make Glass cool, the people who first got the device tended to be of a certain type \u2014 overconfident, entitled, rich tech guys. Soon they earned aderisive nickname\u2014 \u201cglassholes\u201d \u2014 and at that point the device was done for.\nA lot has changed since Glass\u2019s release. Cameras and mobile processors are smaller and more powerful; now Glass-like tech can be built into spectacles without much sacrifice in style. There is also far less social opprobrium attached to wearable tech; earbuds and smart watches are not just for rich nerds. And for a lot of people, especially young people, there is little separation anymore between the online world and the offline world \u2014 suggesting potentially huge demand for glasses that fix the internet to your eyeballs.\nI also wonder if the pandemic might have eased people\u2019s inhibitions about wearing something on their faces. Yes, a lot of people have recoiled at face masks, but a lot more are now quite comfortable both wearing them and seeing others wear them.\nTo me the stage feels set in a way that recalls the period before the iPhone\u2019s release in 2007. Technology and consumer preferences are aligning. We\u2019re on the cusp of something big. I only hope that, unlike with smartphones, this time we go slow. Smartphones became an inescapable fact of modern life long before we understood all the ways they would alter society, for better and for worse. Now, as the machines march for our faces, let\u2019s at least keep our eyes wide open.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "On Sustainability: The Watch Industry\u2019s Scorecard",
        "fulltext": "Like their counterparts in industries such asfashion,constructionandautomaking, Swiss watchmakers are facing increased pressure to prove their commitment to sustainability. But what that means in practice differs, depending on whom you ask.\nSome brands, likeOrisand Mondaine, have made achieving carbon neutrality a cornerstone of their manufacturing strategies. Other brands, such asBreitlingand Panerai, are using recycled materials in an effort to attract environmentally conscious buyers. Still others view sustainability through a financial lens \u2014 and wonder what thecurrent consumer mania for a quartet of brandsimplies about the health of the watch industry as a whole.\nWe asked three people well-versed in the high-end watch trade \u2014 a collector, a conservationist and an equities analyst \u2014 to assess the industry\u2019s scorecard on sustainability. Their answers\u00a0have been edited for clarity and condensed.\nA collector with about 25 watches, based in Farmington, Conn., and a member of the New York chapter ofRedBar, a global community of watch collectors\nHow do you approach sustainability as a consumer?\nI am vegan. That plays a part in all aspects of my life: in what I choose to buy and what I choose to wear. I try to source most of my food from a C.S.A., community-supported agriculture, at a local farm. I\u2019m trying to do things that keep my environmental impact as small as I can. It\u2019s looking at where things come from and how they get to where they\u2019re going because that takes a big toll on sustainability.\nHow do your environmental concerns play out when you\u2019re buying a watch?\nWatch straps. A lot of brands do leather straps and for me that\u2019s a nonstarter, so I talk to brands when I buy watches to get a bracelet. Also, a lot of companies are now switching to alternative leathers, whether they\u2019re vegan leathers or synthetic products. That definitely checks the box when I\u2019m looking at watches.\nBut I\u2019m also looking at how the company is run \u2014 things like, are they climate neutral or are they making steps toward that? How are they investing their profits? Are they putting them back in the company or are they putting them back in the world when dealing with climate change? A lot of brands have moved into that space, so I\u2019m not just focusing on the watches, but on how they\u2019re making them.\nYou mentioned Oris, which announced in late August thatit has become climate neutral. Are there other brands you think are doing a good job on the sustainability front?\nOris has been on my radar for quite a while partially because their price point is generally affordable \u2014 the amount of watch you get for the dollar is pretty good \u2014 and they\u2019veconstantly done watches that raise awarenessof climate change or other issues. They recently released a watch where the face is made from P.E.T. plastic that\u2019s been recycled. They\u2019ve made watches for coral reef projects. Their climate neutral announcement was a big thing for me.\nIWC is another brand working toward that. They use renewable energy in one of their manufacturing facilities. I know Chopard only uses ethical gold in their watches and have invested in small mines in South America. I try to keep brands on my radar that are doing the right thing.\nA lot of watchmakers are criticized for their lack of transparency about the sources of their raw materials. Does that kind of information matter to you?\nI try to be an informed consumer as best I can. How they\u2019re affecting the world, how they treat their employees, where they invest their money \u2014 that all plays a part. Some companies, like Rolex, are super secretive, and you have to use your best judgment. But being an informed consumer, you want to know where your dollars are going and how they\u2019re going to be used.\nWhat are some things you\u2019d like to see watchmakers do to become more sustainable?\nPackaging is a big one. I would like to see watch manufacturers reduce packaging on watches. But also the transparency you mentioned: Where are they sourcing their materials from? Are they trying to invest in local communities?\nDo you get the sense you\u2019re an anomaly among your collector friends for caring about these issues?\nIf you have a watch that\u2019s $250,000, sustainability may not be your first concern \u2014 then again, it may very well be. A lot more people are thinking about it now.\nEven the ancillary manufacturers \u2014 companies that make accessories and things like that \u2014 are starting to get into this. Wolf, which does watch winders and watch boxes, did a watch box for RedBar with vegan leather, and that made me very happy.\nHead of markets atWWF Switzerland, a division of the international wildlife conservation organization\nIn November, WWF Switzerland is planning to release a follow-up to its2018 reporton the jewelry and watch industries. What\u2019s changed?\nSome of the luxury groups stepped up their commitment to the climate, and to theScience-Based Targetsinitiative. Richemont and Kering have sent their target commitments. And there have been some tentative first attempts to bring transparency to their supply chains.\nBut overall, not much has happened. I\u2019ve been working in this area for quite a while. I remember the retail sector was challenged \u2014 you asked them where their resources came from and they\u2019d say, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Now they have huge sustainability sectors while the watch industry still appears to be stuck in the \u201970s or \u201980s.\nWhen I spoke to WWF Switzerland last year aboutwhere watch companies obtain gold, I was told the Swiss watch industry was\u00a0not addressing the biggest issue of all: the raw materials that go into their products. Is that still the case?\nYes, unfortunately this is still a huge problem. Responsible sourcing of raw materials is indeed the most urgent topic that needs to be addressed by the watch and jewelry sector. Especially because raw materials such as metals, diamonds or colored gemstones are often mined under difficult conditions that turn biodiversity-rich rain forests into moonscapes. And they are often associated with\u00a0human rights violations.\nThere are some initiatives that are trying to tackle some of the social or environmental problems \u2014Swiss Better Gold Association,Fairmined,Fairtrade,Responsible Jewelry Council,Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance\u2014 but often traceability itself is the problem. Plus, these initiatives only account for a small share of globally mined gold.\nHave any watch brands made advances?\nTo mention one interesting example: Inspired by the WWF report in 2018, a start-up calledID Genevewas founded, and it has a completely circular and responsible sourcing approach. However, to our knowledge, most companies still have too little understanding of their value chains.\nAre you optimistic about the industry\u2019s chances of improving its sustainability track record?\nI\u2019m always very optimistic. I wouldn\u2019t last long in this job if I wasn\u2019t. I strongly believe that companies have the ability to improve \u2014 they just need the right incentives. A very good incentive is pressure from investors.\nThe issue with this industry is that many companies are privately owned. In that case, we\u2019re hoping consumer pressure can rise. We\u2019re hoping for a tipping point that leads to leapfrog development.\nLuxury goods analyst atVontobel, a private banking and investment management group based in Zurich\nFour independently owned brands \u2014 Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Richard Mille \u2014 are seeing soaring demand for their limited production. But what\u2019s happening to the rest of the industry?\nThere\u2019s a polarization. The brands you named \u2014 as well as a few smaller producers like\u00a0De Bethune and\u00a0F.P. Journe, with production that goes up to about 2,000 units per year and with a very high average price \u2014 they are doing very well. In between, it\u2019s a mixed picture.\nIn the low-end segments, we have seen a recovery from 2020, but there is huge pressure from smartwatches, meaning Apple, which is now selling more watches than the entire Swiss industry. And then you have some watch brands like Breitling, which was taken over by private equity a few years ago and is now performing very well.\nIf we want to make a sharp picture, the independents are very strong and the brands owned by the big groups \u2014 Swatch, Richemont, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering \u2014 are suffering.\nHow do you explain the surge in demand for the Big Four and the smaller independents following in their footsteps?\nI have a very simple answer: C.P.O., or certified pre-owned \u2014 the secondhand market and the pricing transparency it enables. Consumers want to have some value when they are buying a watch. And the C.P.O. market has been a fantastic booster. I bought a\u00a0Blancpain in 2017 and the value went down 30 to 40 percent, whereas Rolex continues to go up. Audemars and Patek \u2014 you\u2019ve seen the prices; they\u2019re unbelievable.\nThere are many different companies very active in the secondhand market: WatchBox, Chrono24 andBucherer, which just bought Tourneau. It\u2019s a very dynamic market, already at 20 billion Swiss francs (about $21.7 billion).\nLook at, say, the\u00a0Rolex Daytona, which is sold for 12,800 Swiss francs and when you go to one of these sites, they\u2019re selling it secondhand for 40,000. The calculation is easy.\nWhat does a polarized market mean for buyers?\nIn the high end, we are set for a couple years with those brands on top. But don\u2019t forget you still have some brands in the midsegment. I mentioned Breitling and some newcomers, including one with a good concept: Norqain. They have started to make some noise, have fabulous management and an interesting concept. And another brand: Maurice Lacroix owned by DKSH here in Switzerland. They were in the midsegment and tried to go high, but they stopped and are now producing some very easy, accessible watches priced from 2,000 to 4,000 Swiss francs \u2014 and they\u2019re not doing too bad.\nFor years the volume of Swiss exports has declined, even as values increase. What does this suggest about the sustainability of Switzerland as an industrial base\u00a0for the watch industry?\nThere will be a consolidation of the market in the coming years. The low end is set to die a slow and painful death. And for the Swiss-made label to remain competitive, Swiss-made watches will continue to go in the direction of the high end."

        "title": "Google and Apple, Under Pressure From Russia, Remove Voting App",
        "fulltext": "MOSCOW \u2014 Apple and Google removed an app meant to coordinate protest voting in this weekend\u2019sRussianelections from the country on Friday, a blow to the opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin and a display of Silicon Valley\u2019s limits when it comes to resisting crackdowns on dissent around the world.\nThe decisions came after Russian authorities, who claim the app is illegal, threatened to prosecute local employees ofAppleand Google \u2014 a sharp escalation in the Kremlin\u2019s campaign to rein in the country\u2019s largely uncensored internet. A person familiar with Google\u2019s decision said the authorities had named specific individuals who would face prosecution, prompting it to remove the app.\nThe person declined to be identified for fear of angering theRussiangovernment. Google has more than 100 employees in the country.\nAppledid not respond to phone calls, emails or text messages seeking comment.\nThe app was created and promoted by allies of the opposition leader Aleksei A.Navalny, who were hoping to use it to consolidate the protest vote in each of Russia\u2019s 225 electoral districts. It disappeared from the two technology platforms just as voting got underway inthe three-day parliamentary election, in which Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia party \u2014in a carefully stage-managed system\u2014 holds a commanding advantage.\nMr. Navalny\u2019s team reacted with outrage to the decision, suggesting the companies had made a damaging concession to the Russians.\n\u201cRemoving the Navalny app from stores is a shameful act of political censorship,\u201d an aide to Mr. Navalny, Ivan Zhdanov,said on Twitter. \u201cRussia\u2019s authoritarian government and propaganda will be thrilled.\u201d\nThe decisions also drew criticism from free-speech activists in the West.\n\u201cThe companies are in a really difficult position but they have put themselves there,\u201dDavid Kaye, a former United Nations official responsible for investigating freedom of expression issues, said in an interview. \u201cThey are de facto carrying out an element of Russian repression. Whether it\u2019s justifiable or not, it\u2019s complicity and the companies need to explain it.\u201d\nThe extraordinary pressure on Google and Apple is an indication of the threatthe Kremlin sees in Mr. Navalny\u2019s \u201csmart voting\u201d effort and the growing role technology plays as an instrument of political power. United Russia\u2019s approval ratings in state-run polls have slumped to around 30 percent, compared with 40 percent ahead of the last parliamentary election, in 2016. A consolidation of the opposition vote could defeat United Russia candidates in competitive districts, since only a simple majority is required to win.\nMr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, argued that the app was illegal in Russia when asked about it on Friday on his regular call with journalists; Mr. Navalny\u2019s movementwas outlawed as extremist this summer. \u201cBoth platforms have been notified and in accordance with the law they made these decisions, as it seems,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Navalny team on Friday sought to get the names of their \u201csmart-voting\u201d picks out by other methods, such as automated responses in the messaging app Telegram.\nBut late in the evening, Telegram \u2014 a Russian-founded service popular withopposition-minded usersin authoritarian countries around the world \u2014 announced it was taking down the account providing those picks. It was not immediately clear if Telegram had come under government pressure, as well.\nMaintaining open, uncensored access to their services, especially in authoritarian countries, is becoming one of the most vexing challenges for American tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter. In countries such as India, Myanmar and Turkey, the authorities are increasingly pressuring the companies to censor certain political speech, or ordering internet outages to block access to the web.\nCivil society groups have warned thatforcing the companies to conformto a patchwork of laws and regulations risks creating a more fractured internet, where access to information and products will depend on where people are. The companies must weigh the value of having their services available in a country like Russia, where they are seen as more independent than local technology platforms, against the costs of leaving altogether, as Google has done in China.\nThe pressure on Silicon Valley to block certain content on their platforms is not just coming from more authoritarian governments. In the United States and Europe, policymakers want the companies to do more to address hate speech, misinformation and other toxic content. Republicans in the United States argue that they are being censored online.\nIn Russia, the national internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, has repeatedly demanded that the companies remove certain content, on pain of fines or restrictions on access to their products. The government says that American internet companies are meddling in Russia\u2019s domestic affairs by allowing anti-Kremlin activists to use their platforms freely.\nThe Russian government had been increasingly blunt in recent days about its willingness to use threats of arrest to prevent the use of the app.\n\u201cWith the participation of Apple and Google, specific crimes are being committed, the scale of which may only increase in the coming days,\u201d Vladimir Dzhabarov, a member of Russia\u2019s upper house of Parliament, said on Thursday. \u201cIndividuals contributing to their parent companies\u2019 evasion of responsibility on the territory of the Russian Federation will be punished.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen whether Friday\u2019s concession by Apple and Google turns into a watershed moment in how forcefully American tech giants are willing to resist Kremlin pressure. Amid Russia\u2019s crackdown on dissent this year, the most popular Silicon Valley platforms have remained freely accessible, allowing journalists and activists to continue to get their message out. On YouTube, for instance, the Navalny team\u2019s investigations of corruption in the Russian elite regularly get millions of views.\nBut Friday\u2019s move could embolden the Kremlin as well as governments elsewhere in the world to use the threat of prosecuting employees to gain leverage against the companies. It presents a test of Silicon Valley ideals around free expression and an open internet, balanced not only against profit but against the safety of their workers.\nRemovals of Facebook and Twitter posts, YouTube videos and other internet content occur fairly regularly as companies seek to comply with local laws around the world. In China, Apple has removed apps that run afoul of government censors, including software that would give Chinese users access to the open global internet. A 2016 court decision in Russia ledApple and Google to remove LinkedInfrom their app stores after LinkedIn did not comply with a law requiring data about Russian users be stored within the country\u2019s borders.\nBut the removals on Friday by Google and Apple have little precedent given the electoral stakes and Mr. Navalny\u2019s high-profile campaign against the Kremlin, said Natalia Krapiva, legal counsel for Access Now, a civil society group tracking internet censorship. \u201cThis is really a new phenomenon to go after the app stores,\u201d Ms. Krapiva said.\nWhile the companies would prefer to be seen as impartial platforms, Ms. Krapiva said industry leaders should speak out more forcefully in defense of free speech and an open internet, especially if company employees were being threatened with criminal prosecution.\nOtherwise, \u201cit looks like they are standing with the government,\u201d said Ms. Krapiva.\nGovernments have used the prospect of prosecution in the past, though the incidents rarely become public. In 2016, a Facebook executive was arrested in Brazil after the company refused to turn over WhatsApp data related to a drug-trafficking investigation. The authorities in India andThailandare among those that have alsothreatened imprisonmentto pressure social media companies.\nRussian authorities have been pressuring Apple and Google for weeks to remove the Navalny team\u2019s voting app. With Mr. Navalny\u2019s websites blocked inside Russia, the app became a loophole allowing exiled allies of the imprisoned politician to continue to reach a wide audience. Nearly every smartphone runs Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android operating system, making their app stores the key artery for getting any product to the public.\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the American ambassador to Moscow, John J. Sullivan, last week and announced that \u201cAmerican \u2018digital giants\u2019\u201d had broken Russian law \u201cin the context of the preparation and conduct of the elections.\u201d\nBailiffs visited Google\u2019s offices earlier this week seeking to enforce court-ordered measures against the protest voting campaign, state media reported.\nThe Navalny app has continued to work on Apple and Android phones for those who had already downloaded the software.\nThe app is central to the protest strategy that the opposition leader calls \u201csmart voting.\u201d The goal is to defeat as many candidates representing the governing United Russia party as possible by having all opposition-minded voters in each district pick the same challenger \u2014 whether or not they agree with their views.\nThe \u201cNavalny\u201d app coordinates the process, requesting a user\u2019s address and responding with the name of the candidate they should vote for.\n\u201cThis shameful day will long remain in history,\u201d Leonid Volkov, Mr. Navalny\u2019s longtime chief of staff, wrote on his Telegram account.\nAnton Troianovskireported from Moscow, andAdam Satarianofrom London.Oleg MatsnevandIvan Nechepurenkocontributed reporting from Moscow.\n"

        "fulltext": "Apple on Tuesday unveiled an array of new hardware offerings \u2014 including an update to its flagshipiPhone\u2014 improving on previous models. But one metric remained mostly the same: the price.\nThe new iPhone 13 will cost $800, the same aslast year\u2019s iPhone 12, while the iPhone 13 Mini will cost $700, identical to last year. The more expensive models of the new phones, the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, will cost you $1,000 and $1,100, respectively, the same as last year\u2019s premium versions.\nApple has raised its phone prices over the years, with the increases sometimes spooking consumers. Sales ofthe more expensive iPhone Xmodels that began at $1,000 in 2018 were slower than expected, for instance, causing Apple to mark down revenue estimates and cut prices in China.\nThe company responded in 2019with a cheaper offering: $700 for the iPhone 11, down from $750 for the comparable iPhone XR the prior year. And last spring, itunveiled a new budget iPhone SEfor $400. Some analysts thought the strategy might be shrewd during the pandemic, as people tried to save money.\nRecently,iPhone sales have been through the roof, in part because the pandemic has furthered people\u2019s reliance on technology.\nThe new Apple Watch announced on Tuesday, the Series 7, will cost $400, the same price as its last few models. Apple also introduced a cheaper watch last year, the SE, for $280.\nApple also unveiled a new iPad, which will cost $330, the same as last fall\u2019s version. The only price jump announced at the event was for the new iPad mini, for $500, up from the company\u2019s most recent $400 mini that came out in 2019."

        "title": "Will Lawmakers Finally Act Against Big Tech?",
        "fulltext": "Kids and whistle-blowers. This is the heart of the recent Wall Street Journalseries of investigationsabout how Facebook runs its business. And it\u2019s why the articles landed with such force.\nJeff Horwitz, one of the Journal reporters who penned the devastating \u201cFacebook Files\u201d series, and Cecilia Kang, who with fellow Times reporter Sheera Frenkel wrote the recent book \u201cAn Ugly Truth\u201d about Facebook, joined me this week for a social audio discussion on Twitter Spaces.\nWe talked about The Journal\u2019s reporting on the toxicity of Instagram on the psyche of teenage girls, supported in the stories by internal Facebook documents. Kids and whistle-blowers have now given politicians and regulators a very clear target, one that resonates with the public.\nFinally, slow-moving regulators may have some much-needed fuel.\nThis story will continue to unfold in the coming days. Facebook will be sending its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, to Senate hearings about kids\u2019 safety sometime next week, which should be made livelier by the revelation that a whistle-blower who gave documents to The Journal has also turned over a pile to lawmakers and will go public at some point soon, according toSenator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. This person is reportedly seeking federal whistle-blower protection.\nI often cringe at Blackburn\u2019s ignorant claims of anti-conservative bias at social media companies \u2014on social media, of course \u2014 which, so far, have no basis in fact. But it appears she has now set her sights on a problem that is actually supported by evidence: the dangers for children online. She and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, havejoined togetherin this endeavor, as they did this summer on proposed legislation around app stores that seeks to throttle back the power of Apple and Google.\nI would not have imagined such a pair cooperating so much. And the combo of bipartisan, the-kids-are-in-danger and we-have-your-possibly-incriminating-documents-right-here must have Facebook nervous. Hopefully, the tired trope that government is incapable of legislating and regulating tech is over.\nBut it\u2019s critical that the Senate committee widen its gaze \u2014 and subpoenas \u2014 to include other tech giants, like Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, a point Facebook also makes. All of Big Tech needs to be pressed on safety by regulators or it just becomes a pile-on on Facebook. It\u2019s easy to paint Facebook as the only villain, but that is just not fair.\nAnd as you can see from Apple\u2019s recent missteps around monitoring its devices for child pornography \u2014 which is about balancing privacy and the need to thwart criminals \u2014 tech companies should be attentive to lawmakers\u2019 concerns, since they won\u2019t slip out of scrutiny so easily this time, as they have so often in the past over different issues.\nOne thing is certain: Whistle-blowers will continue to play a key role in this story, especially if regulators want to get some traction. There are scads of people inside tech companies who are worried about the massive power amassed by Big Tech, and increasing numbers of tech insiders want to make sure that their creations do not have a deleterious impact on society.\nDespite the common belief in Silicon Valley that leaking is a bad thing, in some cases it is the only thing.Horwitz, the Wall Street Journal reporter behind the series, and Kang both told me that they get tips and documents only when insiders lose hope that they can make change happen internally. And, in my experience, those who leak are not typically disgruntled but frustrated that their best work is being sullied by careless or even malfeasant leaders.\nMany years ago, a top Yahoo executive who was exasperated by all the internal information I was able to access at her company called me to ask why people leaked to me.\nMy answer: Because she wasn\u2019t listening to them \u2014 but she sure as heck listened to me.\nAnd they\u2019d all better listen when lawmakers start talking next week.\nAs I wrote recently, China iscracking down on tech, and today it made another big move by hitting hard at the fast-growing (yet still nascent) cryptocurrency sector. The People\u2019s Bank of China put a Q&A on its website that essentially declared the use of digital currency illegal.\nYou read that right: illegal.\n\u201cFinancial institutions and nonbank payment institutions cannot offer services to activities and operations related to virtual currencies,\u201d the central bank said. China already moved earlier this year to crack down on cryptomining.\nIt\u2019s a big blow to the freewheeling sector and a sign that the Chinese government will not tolerate any other entity grabbing a critical means of social control. No surprise, the value of Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and even Dogecoin dropped. Companies that service the crypto sector, including Coinbase, were also down.\nIt makes noises from the U.S. government seem minuscule in comparison. This week, in a Washington Postvirtual forum, Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s long-term viability for five or six thousand private forms of money. So in the meantime, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to have an investor-protection regime placed around this.\u201d\nGensler has taught a class in cryptocurrency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but he\u2019s proving to be not much of a fan. He has also taken to comparing the crypto market to the Wild West, sounding like a sheriff who is about to take some of the bad guys down at the saloon.\nBut it\u2019s all hat and no cattle so far, especially compared with the Chinese. We\u2019ll see what Gensler has to say atmy event next week, where we\u2019ll ask him about that and more.\nHave feedback? Send a note toswisher-newsletter@nytimes.com."

        "title": "The Maps That Steer Us Wrong",
        "fulltext": "Too many of our digital maps are sellouts.\nJust like theprojection maps we\u2019re all familiar withthat inaccurately depict Greenland dwarfing South America, the digital maps that orient our lives on smartphones and laptops are the result of a series of compromises or half-truths and don\u2019t always accurately represent the world as it is.\nAs a result, we too often misunderstand the true contours of the world and then make poor decisions based on misinformation. As our reliance on digital maps increases \u2014 for instance, with the proliferation of driverless cars \u2014 the gap between the world as it is and the world as our maps represent it risks growing ever wider.\nMaps have always been driven by other forces, likeeconomic or political interests, and they represent the world asthe mapmakers would like people to see it. But they can also be misused to push a certain agenda.\nExamples abound.Electoral mapsin the United States often conflate land area with the number of voters, overstating the popularity of Republican candidates. Last year, a scary map depicting thevolume of global air travelwent viral when it was mistaken for a map of coronavirus infection spread. Maps purporting to show theextent of wildfiresin Australia were similarly inscrutable. And Zillow and Redfin\u2019s home pricing estimates, factoring in geographic features like school districts and walkability scores, baffle home sellers and buyers alike by being bothtoo lowandtoo high.\nThose are just recent examples. In 1988, a Soviet cartographer admitted that all publicly available maps of the country had been falsifiedfor five decades\u2014 with rivers and towns mislabeled or removed entirely \u2014 on orders from the secret police.\nToday, digital cartography is a booming business, thanks to the proliferation of in-map advertising. By 2023, Google, the maker of the most popular digital map, could take in$11 billion annuallyfrom ad sales on maps primarily; directions from home to work often include references to Subway sandwich shops or Chase Bank locations.\nRather than being drawn up by a group of drafters, maps today are produced by diplomats, policymakers, marketers and tech executives, who decide what data goes into maps covering everything from border disputes to wireless and broadband availability. Marketing is why those pretty pink maps showing T-Mobile\u2019s 5G service availability around the country are largely a fantasy.\nMaps are most vital for the things we cannot see \u2014 from the location of undersea reefs to the strength of cell signals to traffic jams across town.\nAnenduring imageof the pandemic is that of schoolchildren huddled outside libraries and McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks locations, desperate to find an internet signal. The lack of reliable and speedy internet service in broad areas of the nation, exposed by remote school and work, is the result of decades of underinvestment in broadband infrastructure.\nBut maps are another culprit. Maps that tell the federal government who has access to broadband service and at what speeds are completely unreliable. The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s official broadband map is almostwholly relianton disclosures from broadband service companies that have an incentive to make their coverage areas appear more widespread. And they get to claim coverage of an entire census block with broadband if they reach just one residence within the area, which can cover hundreds of homes or, in some cases,thousands of square miles.\n\u201cOur broadband maps are terrible,\u201dsaid Jessica Rosenworcel, the agency\u2019s acting chair.\nLawmakers have allocated some $65 billion to address internet connectivity issues in the infrastructure bill wending its way toward the White House. The F.C.C. has a$20 billion fundto disburse over the next 10 years to help companies reach rural areas. But the federal government still doesn\u2019t know precisely where the problem areas are, in large part because of the F.C.C.\u2019s flawed mapping.\nThe faulty maps flummoxed Dustin Ogilvie, a cybersecurity expert, who said he spent the better part of two years searching for a house to buy in suburban Chicago that could offer broadband availability and speeds as promised by the F.C.C. online. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s availability, and then you ask the companies, and they say there isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThis system is just not designed for regular people. I don\u2019t see how anyone can be expected to use it.\u201d\nSome houses in a neighborhood had broadband internet, while adjacent homes didn\u2019t. One company offered to extend a line some 500 feet to a house he was considering in Union, Ill., but it would cost him $87,000.\nWireless coverage maps can be even harder to decipher than those for broadband. T-Mobile and AT&T usedifferent shades of pinkor blue to differentiate their 5G service from slower wireless service offerings. Splotches on Verizon\u2019s red color-coded U.S. maps combine its supposed nationwide 5G service with its more sluggish LTE service.\nMaps produced by big telecom companies purport to show the extent of their 4G, 5G and other wireless services.\nAT&T\nT-Mobile\nVerizon\nAT&T\nT-Mobile\nVerizon\nSources: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon\nBy The New York Times\nThe F.C.C. discovered that a 2020 wireless map that was to help guide $9 billion in subsidies was soriddled with errorsfrom overstatements by the companies that it had to delay the project \u2014 marking the second year in a row that a subsidy was delayed to fix the map.\nBy far the most commonly used maps are those on smartphones, with apps like Google Maps and Apple Maps now essential for daily navigation. They are licensed to other companies, like Yelp and Uber, meaning their particular view of the world is spread even wider. \u201cIt is very easy to change digital maps and to do it without anyone really noticing,\u201d said Mark Monmonier, a former Syracuse University geography professor and the author of 20 cartographic books. \u201cThat means, in little ways or even larger ones, our view of the world can change overnight.\u201d\nWith well over a billion map users, Google has become the chief arbiter of place names around the world. That gives it unique power to rebrand neighborhoods, street names and landmarks with little outside oversight. The New York Times reported that Google had dubbed a section of downtown San Francisco \u201cthe East Cut,\u201d irking some residents, but three years later, the name has stuck. The nonexistent town ofArgletonsprang up on Google\u2019s map of Britain before the Silicon Valley company eventually expunged it.\nTo satisfy local leaders, Google alsochanges international borders. People in Ukraine see a dotted border indicating that the Crimean Peninsula is a disputed territory, while Russians are presented with a hard border that suggests the area is definitively under the nation\u2019s rule. The Sea of Japan is listed as the East Sea to South Korean Google users. With no room on digital maps for annotations or explanation, the names and borders appear as fact.\nGoogle\u2019s maps can be easily manipulated because the company relies on outsourcing to thousands of people who can append place names or noteworthy landmarks to the maps with little oversight. Google Maps includes listings formillions of fake businesses. As an experiment some years ago, I incorrectly placed the location of a former employer in downtown San Francisco on Google Maps \u2014 where it remains.\nGood maps articulate not just what we know but also the limits of our knowledge \u2014 where the known world ends and where the unknown begins.
