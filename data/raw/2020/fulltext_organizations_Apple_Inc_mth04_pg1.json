        "title": "Apple, in a Virtual Unveiling, Introduces a $399 iPhone",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In some ways, there couldn\u2019t be a worse time thana pandemicto introduce a new gadget. But Apple unveiled its latestiPhoneon Wednesday anyway, seizing on a time when many of us are sheltering indoors andglued to our devices.\nThe newiPhone SEarrives with a lowerprice: At $399, itcostsabout 40 percent less than the regular $699 iPhone. The device has the design of an older generation of iPhones, with the same computing power as newer ones. That means the SE looks like an iPhone from 2014, with a smaller screen and a home button instead of a face scanner, but is as fast as the fancier iPhone 11from2019.\nApple typically holds splashy events to introduce new products. But because of the pandemic, the company instead live-streamed a product executive showing a slide show of images of the new iPhone to make its announcement.\nApple, which relies on factories in China to produce its smartphones, warned in February that production would be hampered because thefactories were only slowly reopeningafter business was largely shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak there. The tech giant said its sales would also be hurt by slowing consumer demand and closures of its retail stores.\nAt the same time, iPhones and other computing devices \u2014 such as iPads and Mac laptops \u2014 have become essential tools to many people who are working or learning from their homes under shelter-in-place orders. That may stoke interest in a new and less-expensive iPhone.\nApple has generally priced its iPhones high and marketed them as objects of desire, but it has taken the budget approach before. Four years ago, the company released thefirst iPhone SE, which also featured an older design with sped-up internals, for $399. The device was popular among those who preferred smaller phone screens for a lower price.\nApple was the world\u2019s No. 1 phone maker in the fourth quarter of 2019 by shipments, according to theresearch firm IDC. Its iPhones sold particularly well in developed regions like the United States. A lower-priced smartphone gives the company an opportunity to compete in developing markets like India, where people have gravitated toward cheaper phones.\nPhil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing, said in a statement that the iPhone SE was an improvement from itspredecessor.\nThe SE lacks some other frills seen in more expensive iPhones. Notably, the SE\u2019s main camera has a single lens capable of producing so-called portrait photos, which involve sharpening subjects in the foreground while gently blurring the background. In contrast, the $699 iPhone 11 and $999 iPhone 11 Pro have dual- and triple-lens camera systems capable of shooting better photos in low light and taking shots with a wider field of view.\nThe new iPhone will become available on April 24, Apple said.\nCarolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies, said the timing of the SE\u2019s release was unfortunate because many Apple retail stores, where shoppers can try new iPhones before buying them, were closed. But people who are struggling financially because of the pandemic may appreciate being able to buy a cheaper iPhone, she said.\n\u201cThe rest of this year and next year might be the best time to have something priced like that in the portfolio,\u201d she said.\nApple has said it plans to use its iPhones to help halt the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, it announced that it hadteamed up with Googleto build software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with the illness, a move that eases a method of tracking the virus known as contact tracing."

        "title": "The Bad News Won\u2019t Stop, but Markets Keep Rising",
        "fulltext": "The government said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy had suffered itsworst contraction since the last recession. The head of theFederal Reservelater said he didn\u2019t know how bad this downturn would be, or how long it would last.\nYet by the end of the day, theS&P 500 stock indexhad risen 2.7 percent.\nThat\u2019s been the pattern lately. The drumbeat of grim news \u2014 one million known coronavirus cases in the United States, businesses are collapsing, the unemployment rate could reach 16 percent \u2014 has done little to deter stocks\u2019 upward march.\nSince March 23, when the Federal Reserve announced plans to make unlimited purchases of financial assets to prop up Wall Street, the S&P 500 has soared by more than 31 percent. The unlikely rally created more than $5 trillion ofstock marketwealth, allowing investors to reclaim more than half of their losses from a steep sell-off earlier this year, in the early days of the pandemic.\nWhy are stocks climbing when news about the economy isn\u2019t getting much better, and the severity of the public health crisis has barely abated? There are two main reasons: First, trillions of dollars of stimulus money from the Fed and Congress come with an implicit guarantee that the government will limit investors\u2019 risk no matter how bad it gets. Second, the periodic glimmer of positive news fuels investors\u2019 optimism that things can only get better.\nWednesday delivered on both fronts, after officials said that an antiviral drug made by Gilead Sciences showed promise in treating Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Also, the Federal Reserve said it would hold interest rates near zero and continue to do everything it could to stabilize the economy.\n\u201cWhat the market is rallying on is the expectation that whatever the world looks like nine or 12 months down the road, it\u2019s going to look better than it does now,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\u201cOn any given day the market might latch onto a particular piece of good information,\u201d Mr. Clemons added. \u201cToday it\u2019s the Gilead press release and the market focused on that. But tomorrow\u2019s another day.\u201d\nThe direction of the stock market is always determined by a complicated mix of hard data and investor psychology. The price of a stock is based on how much money investors think a company can make in the future. So investors care less about the actual facts reflected in today\u2019s headlines, and more about what kind of picture those facts paint about the coming year.\nTo investors, it\u2019s abundantly clear that the American economy is already in a deep recession. More than 20 million jobs have been wiped out in little more than a month. Corporate profits are widely expected to collapse.\nSo when fresh economic reports emerge, such as Wednesday\u2019s announcement from the Commerce Department that first-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 4.8 percent annual rate, they provide little new information to investors.\n\u201cThe market has mostly written off 2020,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWhat they\u2019re looking for is for the recovery to start.\u201d\nOver the last month investors have latched on to a series of indications that the worst-case scenarios for the economy could be mitigated.\nThe federal government has acted quickly, with the passage of a roughly $2 trillion stimulus bill, the largest ever economic rescue legislation, in late March. Markets have also been given a lift by the Fed, which has pumped more than $2 trillion into financial markets.\n\u201cStimulus has been the engine that has stabilized and driven asset prices higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG.\nAnother slug of positive news that investors are factoring in comes from the health data. The pace of new infections has slowed sharply as lockdowns continue around the country. Some states, such as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina, are beginning to open up and others, including New York and California, are laying out their criteria for doing so.\nOther updates, such as Wednesday\u2019s hopeful statements on the potential of Gilead\u2019s remdesivir drug, have reinforced the narrative that things are improving. Shares of Gilead rose 5.7 percent after the company said it was \u201caware of positive data\u201d from a federal trial of its experimental coronavirus drug. Already, speculative bits of news about the drug\u2019s potential had twice lifted the market in recent weeks.\nLater in the day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseasesissued a statementsaying its study of the drug showed that it sped up recovery in hospitalized patients with advanced Covid-19.\n\u201cThe evidence is continuing to mount that remdesivir is having a true treatment effect,\u201d said Dr. Brian Abrahams, co-head of biotechnology equity research at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Dr. Abrahams stressed, however, that it remained unclear what the magnitude of that benefit would be to patients.\nIt was clear on Wednesday that investors extrapolated this shred of good news into a brighter outlook for the economy. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks soared nearly 5 percent. Such smaller stocks tend to be less globally diversified than larger companies, meaning they\u2019re more reliant on the U.S. domestic economy.\nSome of the biggest jumps were in parts of the market that have been hardest hit by the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings rose more than 20 percent. Royal Caribbean and Carnival also rose more than 15 percent each. The energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron \u2014 hard hit by the 70 percent collapse in crude prices this year \u2014 were both up more than 5 percent.\nTechnology giants also climbed after Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, reported better-than-expected sales results after the close of trading on Tuesday. Since Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet are among the most highly valued companies in the United States, their heft gives them outsize sway in market-cap-weighted stock market indexes such as the S&P 500.\n\u201cA lot of it really is about hope,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment company. \u201cYou\u2019re getting little hints of hope.\u201d"

        "title": "A Scramble for Virus Apps That Do No Harm",
        "fulltext": "Faced with a growing coronavirus threat, the governor of North Dakota last month posed a question to a friend from his private-sector days. The friend, a software engineer, had once created a location-tracking app for football fans at North Dakota State University who liked to meet up when traveling to big games.\n\u201cCan you track people for Covid?\u201d asked the governor, Douglas Burgum. Within days, the engineer, Tim Brookins, had reworked the football app to do just that, he recalled in an interview.The appis now being used in North and South Dakota as part of statewide efforts to ramp upcontact tracingfor people infected with the coronavirus.\nThe new app is part of a worldwide scramble to deploy smartphone tools to rein in the pandemic. If the virus\u2019s path can betracked, even predicted, the hope is that more people will be able to resume at least part of their normal routines \u2014 and fewer will need to confine themselves at home.\nAt their core, the apps are intended to gather information about the movements of people who have tested positive for the virus, alert others who might have crossed their paths, and in some cases make sure infected people stay quarantined. They use smartphone technologies, such as GPS and Bluetooth, to collect and share the data, which make them agile and easy to use but also provide an enticing target for hackers or government surveillance.\nSeveraldozencountries, states, universities andcompaniesare racing to develop and begin using the digital tools, which public health experts said could improve person-to-personcontact tracingbut are not a panacea. The mad dash has left some places with a confusing mishmash of options, and has some computer security researchers worried about vulnerabilities in hastily written software.\nThere is no evidence that the apps will be effective without widespread testing for the virus and without enormous numbers of voluntary participants, which could be hampered by years ofprivacy scandalsinvolving both governments and companies.\nAware of the problems, Apple andGoogleannounced this monththey were creating software that public health authorities could use to make apps.The toolwill allow different apps to work together and has the support ofmany privacy experts. But several technology law scholars expressed concern that even well-intentioned digital surveillance tools could become problematic and are difficult to withdraw.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already learned what moving fast and breaking things can do to society,\u201d said Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, referring to the negative consequences of a tech mind-set that values speed and disruption above all else.\nOnly 25,000 people in North Dakota, about 3 percent of the population, have downloadedthe state\u2019s app, which before last week was available only for iPhones. Last month, Singapore introduced a voluntarycontact-tracing app, but only about 1.1 million people \u2014 20 percent of the population \u2014 have downloaded it.Norway\u2019s apphas caught on more quickly, with nearly 30 percent of residents signing up for it since it was released about a week and a half ago.\nStill,a recent studyby epidemiologists at Oxford University estimated that 60 percent of the population in a given area would need to use an automated app that traces contacts and notifies users of exposure, combined with other tactics such as broader testing and the quarantining of the most vulnerable people, for the app to contain the virus.\nWhile some compliance is better than none, the researchers found, low rates of adoption in many areas suggest voluntary programs may not provide a breakthrough.\n\u201cWith 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent uptake of the app, you get a progressive reduction in the size of the epidemic,\u201d said Christophe Fraser, an expert in infectious disease dynamics and control at the Big Data Institute at Oxford, who has advised Britain\u2019s National Health Service onan app it is developing.\nDespite the uncertainty, some health experts say the virus spreads so quickly and stealthily that there is an urgent need for new mechanisms to combat it. Even with partial participation, for example, the apps can allow traditional contact tracing to focus on people without phones, who are often poorer, older and more vulnerable. Only abouthalf of Americansage 65 or over have a smartphone.\n\u201cAutomated contact tracing is a big idea, an ambitious idea,\u201d said Dr. Louise Ivers, the executive director of the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has been working witha team at M.I.T.to develop contact-tracing technology. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to be ambitious right now.\u201d\nThe proliferation of coronavirus apps has trailed the spread of the pandemic around the globe. Often, the differences among apps are technical ones but can create vast differences in their security, privacy and effectiveness.\nIn February, China began requiring residents in more than 200 cities to download ahealth code appthat automatically dictates whether people must quarantine. Location data is sent to the government from the phones, but it is unclear how the quarantine decisions are made.\nBy contrast, Singapore\u2019s app uses Bluetooth rather than location data to identify nearby phones, and the information is stored on the phones unless a person tests positive for the virus and agrees to share the data with contact tracers, who can then notify others who may have been exposed.\nIn Norway, the app sends data from the phone\u2019s GPS and Bluetooth to central servers that can be accessed by government health authorities. A new law mandates that the information be used only for the pandemic, and that it be deleted every 30 days.\nTora Sanden Doskeland, a graduate student in Norway, said she had downloaded the app despite her concerns about governments and corporations that collect data on people.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert in this disease or technology or law, but I trust people who are, and I believe the government is relying on them when it tells us to make this choice,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are pros and cons, but we need to do something together.\u201d\nNorth Dakota\u2019s app, Care19, uses Wi-Fi, cell towers and GPS to gauge people\u2019s locations, usually within about 175 feet, making it much less accurate than Bluetooth-based apps. This means it is now useful only to help patients tell contact tracers where they were while they were contagious.\nAn analysis by The New York Times confirmed that the app sends people\u2019s location data to a private server hosted on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. Mr. Brookins, the developer, said only he and one other person have access to the server, and health officials can get the data only of people who test positive for the coronavirus and then agree to share it.\nIndia, which, like the United States, is relying on a combination of state and federal efforts to tackle the pandemic, is a case study in therush for new technologies.\nA quarantine appin the Indian state of Maharashtra, which includes the country\u2019s most populous city, Mumbai, uses GPS data collected from people\u2019s smartphones tocreate a virtual perimeteraround their homes. If users move beyond their permitted radius, the appnotifies local authorities.\nAnother app, called Quarantine Watch, in the state of Karnataka, also records the locations of certainpeople under quarantineand requires them to take selfies to prove they are staying home.\nIn an effort to coordinate public health surveillance, the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced its own contact-tracing app in early April. The app, calledAarogya Setu\u2014 or health care bridge \u2014 uses smartphone location data and Bluetooth to log people\u2019s travel routes and the other phones they encounter. With urging from Mr. Modi, more than 77 million people, about 5.6 percent of the population, have downloaded it so far. Local authorities are now promoting the Modi government\u2019s app along with their own.\nAn expert advising the Modi government on its app said it had already helped public health monitors pinpoint hot spots for the virus and speed their door-to-door visits to certain neighborhoods to alert residents, many of whom did not own smartphones.\nBut civil liberties groups have warned that the rush to adopt virus-tracking technologiesmay entrench new forms of government surveillanceand social control even if the apps do not prove effective in fighting the coronavirus.\n\u201cThey just pilot it out, see how it works and, as the debate is taking place, they scale the project \u2014 and once it\u2019s scaled, then it becomes a lot harder to roll back,\u201d said Sidharth Deb, the policy and parliamentary counsel for theInternet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group in New Delhi.\nAn analysis by The Times found that the Quarantine Watch app, which is available on Google Android, lacked common security measures, and that the Android version of the Aarogya Setu app leaked a user\u2019s latitude and longitude to a YouTube server.\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, said that the Aarogya Setu app appeared to have sent the location data inadvertently and that YouTube would delete it. The app developers said on Sunday they had fixed the problem. An official in Karnataka said that the app used essential security measures and that the issues identified by The Times had been resolved.\nThe wide range of efforts, and their varying quality, have led to calls for industry standards related to privacy and other matters.\nWhether to send data to central health authorities is the biggest sticking point.\nTechnologists who focus on privacy say the best way to prevent governments from using data to surveil people is to never let them have it in the first place.\n\u201cYou can look at what happened after 9/11,\u201d said James Larus, the dean of the School of Computer and Communications Science at EPFL, a science-focused university in Switzerland. \u201cThere were all these consequences for privacy made possible by a crisis.\u201d\nBut centralized collection of the data may be essential for effective contact tracing, others argue.\n\u201cHaving location history helps you better identify where infections might be, helps you identify the hot spots,\u201d saidLalitesh Katragadda, the founder ofIndihood, a group developing technologies for underserved populations, and an adviser on the Indian government\u2019s app.\nSome officials in Europe have said they also want information about nearby phones to be shared with public health officers, so they can then contact those people personally.\nThe Apple and Google program, which draws on ideas from Singapore andfrom academics, aims to answer the question in favor of privacy experts. The app software will keep track of nearby phones using secret codes, but the data will stay on users\u2019 phones. When people test positive for the coronavirus, they can allow their own codes to be put on a list. The phones of all other users will regularly check that list and provide an alert if there is a risk of infection.\nSo far, the companies have refused to change their system to allow governments to collect data about people\u2019s contacts, and it is unclear whether the gathering of more general location data will be possible. On Friday, the companies changed the name of their system \u2014 to \u201cexposure notification\u201d from \u201ccontact tracing\u201d \u2014 to underline its focus on directly alerting people.\nAnother point of contention surrounds how virus symptoms are reported. Should people voluntarily self-report, or should health workers do so after confirming a diagnosis?\nAnd some significant technological questions need to be worked out, including making sure that the Bluetooth detection accounts for when people are separated by walls and that the apps do not drain batteries or interfere with headphones. Engineers working onprograms at M.I.T. and Stanfordsaid they thought the problems were surmountable.\nA key to making the apps successful, proponents said, is persuading people that the apps will help keep them safe and allow them to emerge from lockdowns.\n\u201cWhen you hear people saying there will never be takeup of the app,\u201d said Dr. Fraser, the Oxford epidemiologist, \u201cthey are talking like we are not in the world we are currently in.\u201d"
