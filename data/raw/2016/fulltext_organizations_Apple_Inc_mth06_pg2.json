        "fulltext": "Software is the strangest invention in economic history: a great wealth creator and an industry destroyer. But software is also insubstantial; no one can bring you a bucket of software. Code is a series of propositions about arranging transistors in a computer.\nApple became one of the world\u2019s biggest companies thanks to this paradoxical invention, and now it may also be threatened by where software is headed.\nAs Brian X. Chenreports, this week Apple held its big meeting for outside software developers, the people who make Apple products essential for many by creating new things that Apple\u2019s phones, tablets, computers and watch can do. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a week to imagine what will spring from this Apple-developers pairing a few months from now.\nBut this session was more about catching up to rivals. Apple offered a new way to send sketches and handwriting, new ways of photo-organizing, and a limited incorporation of Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, with third-party software. The watch loads apps faster, and has some more social functions.\nBut other companies, from Google to independent messaging services, have for the most part been there already. As Farhad Manjoowrites, Apple appears to be taking a cautious, step-by-step approach, focusing more on devices than on this kind of software.\nGoogle Maps, more popular than the Apple version, works well by pooling the experiences of millions of users, often in real time, to deliver accurate information on things like traffic jams. Echo, Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant masquerading as a new wave pepper mill, does a great job of playing your songs, buying stuff for you or reading you recipes, because it trawls in lots of people\u2019s data.\nThese are just two examples of a big trend in software, the application of real-time artificial intelligence in ordinary products.\nA.I., which is fundamentally the recognition and leveraging of all sorts of behavioral patterns, works well by using very large and diverse sets of data. Often, the more personal the better. To make software with A.I. features, you have to be able to access lots of information, obtained by various means.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has positioned his company as one that values customer privacy as a key feature, something exemplified in hisbattlewith the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone after the San Bernardino shootings. That\u2019s perhaps great from a brand perspective, but it may conflict with the way a lot of software is going to be written.\nApple fans, who could see their products have relatively less magical software functionality, may end up experiencing something else: getting their privacy at the expense of the the consumer delight offered by Apple\u2019s competitors."

        "title": "Apple iPhone Is Targeted in Beijing Patent Case",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 In China, cheap smartphones made by relatively obscure companies aping branded designs are ubiquitous.\nUsually it is the major brands that go after the smaller companies for patent infringement. But one of China\u2019s low-cost phone makers recently filed a patent complaint against Apple in the city of Beijing \u2014 and for now, it has won.\nWith an appeals process ahead, the ruling is unlikely to have a major impact on Apple. Still, the action spotlights the growing number of cases of municipal patent offices in China backing local companies against larger, international brands.\nAccording to a statement from the Beijing Intellectual Property Office, Apple infringed on a design patent used in a phone called the 100C, made by theChinese phone maker Baili. The statement ordered Apple to stop selling certain older versions of the iPhone within Beijing, though an appeal of such a ruling to the courts in China usually forestalls any sales injunctions.\nApple said it had appealed, and a sales clerk at the Apple Store in the Sanlitun area of Beijing said on Friday evening that the store had received no instructions to stop selling the iPhone models and that \u201cit is business as usual.\u201d At the store, a handful of iPhone 6 models stood mostly unused as shoppers tapped on the newer 6s models at a nearby table.\n\u201cIPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE models, are all available for sale today in China,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month, and as a result the order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing I.P. Court.\u201d\nThe new headache for Apple comes after increased regulatory pressure and problems in China. Recently, a Chinese company won the right tosell leather goods under the iPhone trademarkafter years of legal back and forth. And Apple\u2019smovie and book services were shut downin the country shortly after they were introduced, a sign of more serious scrutiny from China\u2019s media regulator.\nThe Baili patent case pales in comparison to those troubles, though it underscores the day-to-day annoyances that can come with running a tech business in China.\nThe country has had its fair share of cases in which low-level manufacturers take on global brands. In perhaps the most famous, Applepaid $60 million to use the iPad trademark.\nPatent issues like the one Apple has with Baili are common enough thata recent paperin the Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law examined the topic. While the paper found that China\u2019s patent system was not structured to benefit Chinese companies, it said there had been a number of recent \u201chigh-profile patent suits filed by relatively unknown Chinese firms against high-profile foreign tech companies like Apple, Samsung and Dell.\u201d\nOnce a local intellectual property office in China finds an issue of infringement, companies can decide whether to appeal the matter. At that point, the issue typically is litigated or resolved via a settlement of some kind."

        "title": "Third-Party Keyboards Give Mobile Users More Options",
        "fulltext": "BEFORE the iPhone arrived in 2007, no one really thought typing on touch-screen keyboards was a good idea. Since then we have become expert at tapping on the glass of our phones and tablets.\nWhile the built-in keyboards from Apple, Google and other device makers are much better than they used to be, they are not the only options available.\nOne of the most surprising third-party keyboard apps for Apple devices comes from Apple\u2019s archrival Google. The newGboardapp works just as any sort of touch-screen keyboard does. It has a clean and simple design that doesn\u2019t distract you as you tap away. It also offers all the usual punctuation and emoji via obvious controls. It even looks good, appearing superficially similar to Apple\u2019s own keyboard.\nGboard, though, has some very nice extras. The space bar doubles as a track pad that lets you scroll the cursor around in text you have already typed.\nAlso, Google has incorporated search features directly into the keyboard.\nHit the Google button as you type a message and you are typing in a search box. All of Google\u2019s search results are then accessible, ready to be copied and pasted into the text \u2014 useful in looking up a word definition, checking a street address, or finding a GIF or a YouTube video. You can even search for emoji, which saves you the trouble of hunting manually.\nGboard also offers the option to glide-type \u2014 swiping between consecutive letters instead of tapping on the screen \u2014 and many of the app\u2019s features are customizable through settings.\nIf you are worried that Google will log what you type, Google says it will not record your messages, be they love letters or musings on the latest news or gossip.Gboard is free.\nWhile Gboard has much to like, my favorite third-party keyboard app isSwiftKey. It deals with one of the biggest problems with typing on a touch screen: mistakes. SwiftKey autocorrects them.\nBut that\u2019s just the start. As any smartphone user knows, autocorrect can mangle what you are trying to type even further. SwiftKey uses artificial intelligence to learn about your writing style over time, building up an understanding of the words you like to use. So when you are typing a long message, the app can usually do a good job of correcting typos you make because it can guess the word you intended to use.\nSwiftKey also suggests the words you may want to type next so they can be entered with a single keystroke. SwiftKey can even learn your slang and emoji habits.\nThe app does a good job of detecting which language you are using, automatically switching its correction of typos even if you switch languages midmessage (a common weak point of other keyboards\u2019 autocorrect systems, as bilingual typists like me know well).\nThe app supports glide typing, and it is quite customizable, so that its layout can be changed to a split keyboard, for example, or the background color can be changed. SwiftKey is free for bothiOSandAndroid, but some of the colorful themes cost $1 to $2.\nIf SwiftKey doesn\u2019t polish your typing skills,Fleksyis a similar third-party keyboard app, free for bothiOSandAndroid, that has many of the same features. Fleksy\u2019s keyboard layout is customizable in color and size, and the app is good at autocorrecting typos.\nAs with Gboard, the space bar doubles as a track pad, and Fleksy has a one-handed typing mode, which is handy if you are carrying something in your other hand.\nThe app\u2019s main feature is that it has customizable keyboard rows, so that particular words or keys can always be available.\nThen there is the old but still good standbySwype. Swype helped popularize the gesture-based, glide-to-type text entry system.\nSwype is still a very good app. It offers many of the same features as its rivals, like predicting the next words to be typed, and lets gestures perform tricks like scrolling back through text that has already been entered. It also has different themes, so its look and feel can be changed. But Swype has not advanced as quickly as its peers in adapting to new trends and offering new features.\nIt\u2019s also $1 oniOSandAndroid, and some of its colorful themes cost upward of $1.\nFinally, for another surprising keyboard app, check out Microsoft\u2019sWord Flow, which is free on iOS.\nAll the standard keyboard tricks are there \u2014 predictive text, smart autocorrection and glide typing. But Word Flow is one of the best-looking keyboard apps, and its customization options let you place an image behind the keyboard instead of simply colorful themes.\nThere is also a one-handed typing mode that rearranges the keys into an arc around one corner of the screen, so you just have to swivel your thumb to hit the right key. This curved keyboard is very clever and could be very useful, though it does take a bit of getting used to. Word Flow is free, but for now, sadly, it isiOS-only.\nNASA\u2019s mobile appshave always been popular for people interested in space technology and astronomy because of the vast amount of information, archive images, video and live news they offer.\nNow theNASAapp for Apple TV has arrived, and safe to say the latest Mars panoramas look much more impressive on your living room\u2019s big screen than on your phone. There is also the option to view live, high-resolution video from the International Space Station, making your TV a window into space. The app is free through the Apple TV App Store."

But Apple\u2019s flagship product, the iPhone,is now slowing down, putting pressure on the company to pull something new out of a hat.\nE3 is grappling with its own shifts,writes Laura Parker. The show was designed to gather retailers, video game publishers and media under one roof to give a peek at the big titles coming out for PC and console games. But now people have many more forms of gaming to be entertained by \u2014 free mobile games that can be digitally downloaded and constantly refreshed, for instance.\nWhich has raised questions on the relevance of E3: This year, several of the industry\u2019s biggest publishers are not participating.

        "title": "What You Need to Know About Apple\u2019s Software Upgrades",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple customers have a lot to digest this summer.\nThe iPhone maker kicked off itsannual conference for software developerson Monday with major upgrades for the operating systems powering its computers, mobile devices, smartwatch and TV box.\nTechnology enthusiasts and gear heads are usually excited about big upgrades, but for average consumers, the changes can be overwhelming. Will devices get better or worse? Will the software change so much that it will disrupt the tools we use for work?\nThankfully, Apple\u2019s four upgraded operating systems \u2014 iOS, tvOS, MacOS and WatchOS \u2014 are due out in the fall, so there is plenty of time to research and prepare.\n\u201cAt Apple, we believe that technology should lift humanity and should enrich people\u2019s lives in all the ways they want to experience it \u2014 whether it\u2019s on their wrist, in the living room, on the desk, in the palm of their hand,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during Monday\u2019s keynote presentation.\nHere is a guide to how your devices will change if you install the software upgrades in a few months.\nApple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system, called iOS 10, will have an impact on how you communicate and potentially reduce the amount of time you spend fiddling with the phone.\nAmong them, the Messages app that iPhone and iPad users primarily rely on for sending text messages will get a major overhaul. In the app, you will soon be able to draw sketches and hand-write notes to others, as well as attach animations, like confetti or fireworks. Apple is also letting third-party software developers offer modifications to the Messages app, meaning you might be able to add special messages, like stickers, special emoji or animated GIFs.\nApple is also making major changes to its photo app included on iPhones and iPads. Similar toGoogle Photos, Apple\u2019s Photos app will automatically scan your photo album and organize the photos based on when and where the photos were taken. In some cases, it may automatically combine images from an occasion, like a trip to Japan, into video montages called Memories.\nAnother significant change is the evolution of Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. Third-party app developers can take advantage of voice commands, so you should be able to use voice commands to summon an Uber car, send a message through WhatsApp or map a jog with a fitness app, among other tricks.\nOther changes will not require a significant reset. With iOS 10, the iPhone screen will wake up when you raise it up \u2014 no need to press a button anymore. Apple also redesigned its music app with new colors and navigation features. Its default maps app will let outside developers integrate their services into the mapping app, so you might be able to book a restaurant table by tapping on a restaurant inside the map, for example. Apple is also adding the ability to search for nearby points of interest, like gas stations and coffee shops, similar to Google\u2019s Waze app.\nApple\u2019s Macs will soon work more seamlessly with other Apple devices. Among other changes, the Mac operating system, calledMacOS Sierra, will gain access to Siri. So most of what you can do with Siri on your iPhone should also be doable on Mac computers.\nSierra will also have tighter integration with other Apple devices. If you are wearing an Apple Watch, you can log into a Mac computer without typing in a password. When shopping on the web, you can use an iPhone to pay with Apple Pay, the company\u2019s mobile wallet service, by taking out the iPhone and registering your fingerprint to complete the purchase.\nAny owner of anApple Watchis familiar with this situation: Try to open a third-party app like Instagram or Twitter on the watch, and it takes at least five seconds to load. At that point, you might as well just take out your iPhone and open the app there instead.\nApple is now trying to address this problem with WatchOS, the next version of the operating system for Apple Watch. The company says third-party apps will open instantly with the new update.\nAnother important change is coming to the fitness portion of Apple Watch. With the update, you will be able to see the fitness activity of other friends wearing Apple Watch, like the number of hours they have stood up and calories they have burned. Apple also added some new watch faces, letting you tailor the look to your liking.\nThe next version of tvOS, the Apple TV\u2019s software system, caters largely to sports fans. A new feature called Live Tune In will let you immediately access a live broadcast. Speaking a command like \u201cWatch ESPN2\u201d can load a live sports game.\nOther than that, Apple made several improvements to areas that were the most frustrating aboutApple TV. For one, it will support a feature called Single Sign-On. If you have multiple apps that offer programming from the same pay-TV provider, you can log in just once and all of those apps will be authenticated. That will spare you the headache of entering the same user name and password repeatedly for each of those apps.\nApple also expanded its Apple TV remote-control app that it offers for iPhones. Basically, the remote app will gain the same capabilities as the physical remote for the Apple TV, which includes a button for accessing Siri. So in the event that your remote control vanishes between your couch cushions, you can launch the remote app on your iPhone and use Siri to find something to watch, or swipe around on the phone screen to select an app.\nWhen the upgrades are released this fall, consumers would benefit from a somewhat cautious approach. Often with big software upgrades, bugs creep into earlier versions, so it\u2019s wise to wait at least a few weeks to assess whether the coast is clear before jumping in."

        "title": "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance.\nWhen Apple\u2019s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\n\u201cIs Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cTheir app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.\u201d\nFor a long time, Apple didn\u2019t have to care. But now it facesflat sales of its flagship iPhones, a lack of excitement about newer products like its smart watch and Apple TV, growing competition from Google\u2019s Android platform and the rise of new challengers like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, which responds to a user\u2019s voice commands at home with the kind of magic that used to be an Apple hallmark.\nAs the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.\nApple\u2019s charm offensive began in earnest in December, after it putPhilip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in charge of the App Store. Under Mr. Schiller, the company accelerated the app approval process, cutting typical review times from two weeks to a day or two.\nOn Wednesday, Apple announced that it would soonbegin allowing app makers to buy adsthat would appear at the top of search results in the App Store, like the ads already on Google\u2019s Play Store and website.\nApple also said that it wouldcut its usual 30 percent commission on all subscriptionsto 15 percent after an app subscriber had been active for at least a year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right thing to do for developers,\u201d said Bob Bowman, president of business and media at Major League Baseball, which makes one of the most popular subscription apps,MLB.com At Bat, for live-streaming baseball games.\nBig outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services.\nSmaller developers tend to have less satisfying experiences. Loni Schuman, a 23-year-old entrepreneur in Israel, was frustrated by the process of getting her app,Fanify, approved.\nFanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them \u2014 \u201clike a street artist, but in an app,\u201d as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review.\nApple\u2019s initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify\u2019s method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple\u2019s requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut.\nMs. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place.\n\u201cIt ruined our whole launch,\u201d she said.\nApple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created.\nGetting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple\u2019s system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque.\n\u201cIt used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,\u201d said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. \u201cNow it feels more like a lottery ticket.\u201d\nWhen an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous.\nCraig Tashman, the founder ofLiquidText, a document annotation app for the iPad and iPad Pro, managed to get on Apple\u2019s radar early, when a company employee in his network made an introduction in 2012.\nApple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. \u201cWe got a banner right on top of the App Store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 100,000 downloads in two weeks.\u201d When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple.\nThe new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple\u2019s editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer.\nBryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. \u201cSearch will be table stakes,\u201d he said.\nWhile overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry.\nThe company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists.\nApple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. \u201cIt signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cA lot of developers were asking and hoping for this.\u201d\nDevelopers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,\u201d Mr. Ryu said."

        "fulltext": "Here\u2019s a look at the week ahead:\nTECHNOLOGY\nApple will hold its annualconference for software developerson Monday, previewing new features that will be in the next version of the operating systems powering its devices. Sales of Apple\u2019s biggest product, the iPhone,are slowing, and there has been little in recent months to excite consumers. The company is likely to show off a new version of Apple Music, its streaming music subscription service, and new photo-editing features.\nApple is also trying to improve its sometimes testy relationship with developers. One big announcement geared to that crowd:Developers will be able to use Siri, the company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant, within their apps. Developers are also expecting the company to finally offer Apple Pay to online retailers as a checkout method for their websites. The digital payment service is currently restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response. But the ability to pay on the web with a thumbprint would be more convenient, which could drive wider use.Vindu Goel\nBANKING INDUSTRY\nThe Libyan Investment Authority, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, is expected to square off against Goldman Sachs in a London court beginning on Monday in a dispute over $1.2 billion in derivative transactions it purchased in 2008. In its lawsuit, the Libyan fund claims that the transactions were rendered worthless during the financial crisis, but Goldman still earned $350 million in profit on the transactions.Chad Bray\nTECHNOLOGY\nTheElectronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, video game convention in Los Angeles is usually the most cacophonous of trade shows, where lots of earsplitting new games debut. But the event that begins on Tuesday will be a little less deafening than normal. Major game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts havedecided not to exhibiton the show floor this year; instead, Electronic Arts held its own expo nearby on Sunday. Nintendo has already told fans not to expect to see its next-generation game console, code-named NX, at E3. Still, Sony and Microsoft are likely to get gamers buzzing on Monday when they hold events showcasing the games coming to their consoles. Analysts are also expecting the companies to announce updated versions of their existing consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.Nick Wingfield\nRETAIL INDUSTRY\nRetail sales data for the United States, due on Tuesday, is expected to show a rise in consumer spending for May. Still, it probably will not be as robust as that in April, whenspending roseto the highest levels in more than a year.Rachel Abrams\nMARKETS\nFinancial policy makers in China will be hoping their languid stock markets get a vote of confidence on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in New York), when a decision on whether to include domestic Chinese shares in a major global stock index is to be announced. The MSCI emerging markets index, a benchmark tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars in investment funds around the world, is set to announce the results of an annual review on whether to include stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the first time. Even though it is the world\u2019s second-biggest by market value, China\u2019s domestic share market remains only partly open to foreign investors, and values have remained depressed since thegovernment bungledastock bailout attemptlast summer.Neil Gough\nECONOMY\nFederal Reserve officials drained much of the drama from their scheduled meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday by making clear in recent days they wereonce again postponingany increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate. But there still will be substance: In addition to the post-meeting policy statement, the Fed will release a fresh batch of economic projections, and the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. The looming question is whether the Fed will raise rates this summer. The Fed\u2019s next scheduled meetings are in July and September. Fed officials are likely to debate whether the recentslowdown in job growthindicates that their mission of restoring the health of the labor market is largely accomplished, or a more worrisome sign of fresh economic weakness.Binyamin Appelbaum\nOn Wednesday, at 9:15 a.m., the Federal Reserve will report data for industrial production in May. After industrial productionrose 0.7 percentin April, economists are expecting to see a slight decline for last month, with the sector facing headwinds from depressed mining and drilling, lagging overseas demand for manufactured goods and adverse weather in some parts of the United States.Nelson D. Schwartz\nOn Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on consumer prices in May. Economists are expecting to see a 0.3 percent increase in overall consumer prices, with a 0.2 percent rise in the less volatile core Consumer Price Index.Inflation remains tame, with a likely increase in May driven, in part, byhigher gasoline prices.Nelson D.

        "title": "Can Apple Think Outside the Device?",
        "fulltext": "More than any other company in tech, Apple prizes physical objects \u2014 expensive, perfectly designed, self-contained nuggets of aluminum and glass that you buy today, use for a couple years and replace.\nUntil recently, that view worked quite well. Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apple\u2019s device-centric aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world \u2014 and raked in eye-popping profits while doing so.\nYet Apple\u2019s view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech.\nMany of its competitors have been moving beyond devices toward experiences that transcend them. These new technologies exist not on distinct pieces of hardware, but above and within them. They are things like Alexa, Amazon\u2019s ambient assistant, which lives on the internet and is ready to help you onthe Amazon Echobut also on any other device that a programmer adds it to. In an era offlat iPhone sales, Apple, too, has been talking up the importance of online services, which it sees as a crucial part of its future growth.\nSo the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices?\nThe answer: Yes, but slowly \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough.\nWhat was obvious in thehurricane of new featuresunveiled by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and his lieutenants was that they understood the importance of cloud-based services. Many ofApple\u2019s announcementsfeatured some role for the internet to integrate people\u2019s experiences on disparate Apple devices, often with the help of artificial intelligence.\nBut a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as add-ons to its devices \u2014 not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apple\u2019s best chance to create the kind of transcendent, cross-device experience that its competitors are now pushing.\nAnalysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV; Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apple\u2019s devices, left unclear what Apple\u2019s ultimate aims were for the voice assistant.\nThe new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone \u2014 you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine.\nThese shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.\nBefore we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice \u2014 in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.\nSiri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.\nThese are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps, ride-sharing apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri won\u2019t let you control music apps, for example \u2014 you can\u2019t ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apple\u2019s own music subscription service.\nThis limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort \u2014 one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.\nAnother problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t.\nFor now, this isn\u2019t a big problem \u2014 you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?\nThe device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend \u2014 and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201d\nGoogle, in its demo for Home,a forthcoming voice assistant devicemeant to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo, seemed to be able to handle such questions. Two start-ups \u2014 Viv, which was founded by members of the team that created the original Siri app that Apple bought in 2010, and SoundHound have also unveiled systems that can tackle such complex queries.\nTo handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.\nAnd that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload \u2014 there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?\nVoice interfaces could usher in anew paradigm in computing, one that would break free of the tyranny of apps on devices. They could get a lot done for us without much tapping and switching. Google, Amazon and several start-ups seem to be rushing headlong to build such a system.\nBut based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is. It\u2019s taking a more moderate app-based, device-centric path. Many of its voice features will be fine \u2014 useful, even. But it sure isn\u2019t pushing for a revolution."

        "fulltext": "MANY soccer aficionados \u2014 which means pretty much half the world \u2014 are focused right now on theUEFA Euro 2016 championship, a big event that has brought together two dozen teams from countries across Europe. That makes it an opportune time to look at some apps that can help fans keep up with news of the sport, understand the championships and get a flavor of what it is like to play soccer.\nFor straight-from-the-horse\u2019s-mouth news about the Euro 2016 championship, theofficial UEFA appis the first place to look. It aggregates news and is a social media portal and source for official championship information. The app provides information about coming games, scores in earlier matches, and data on individual players and their history.\nThe app is easy to navigate. But if you are new to soccer, there is little to explain what is going on and not much in the way of emotionally charged content to pique your interest. The app is free at least, and available on bothiOSandAndroid.\nFor a more entertaining look at Euro 2016\u2019s news and other soccer data, check out theOnefootballapp. This is an image-heavy program that pulls together soccer news stories into a scrollable list. Tapping on a link takes you to the full story, and the app has a live section that updates with news about matches as they are being played and offers real-time analysis.\nThe app sometimes lacks polish, and if you are using it on a bigger device like an iPad, the menus can look small and the images sometimes seem low quality. But for a news source that is up-to-date and dynamic and includes video, this app \u2014 which isfree on iOSandAndroid\u2014 is the one. The iOS version of the app also has an Apple Watch app so you can see the latest news on your wrist.\nLikeForza Football, another soccer app that isfree on iOSandAndroidand that is well known as a news source for the sport, Onefootball is likely to be useful after the Euro 2016 games end, continuing to bring news from football leagues around the world.\nIf you want to play a soccer game on your mobile device, one excellent option is theDream League Soccer 2016app, which isfree on iOSandAndroidwith in-app purchases for additional content.\nThis is a third-person-style football simulator. You observe a soccer match from the same point of view as a television camera, and move your players around using an onscreen joystick and three simple buttons to control how they kick or pass the ball or intercept opposing players. The game automatically swaps players for you so you control only the one nearest the ball, which keeps things easy to manage.\nThe app makes soccer feel surprisingly real, and it captures the flow of play. The players are shown as 3-D graphics and are well animated, and when you score a goal there is an option to see a replay from many different angles. There are even convincing crowd noises and commentators, who mention details of the action, including players\u2019 names.\nThere are plenty of options to control the layout of your chosen team, to improve players\u2019 skills, add custom logos and even change stadium designs. You can choose to progress through layers of a championship or just play a quick game. In short, this app is sophisticated enough to keep your attention for hours or to satisfy urges to get in a little soccer action if you have just a few minutes.\nOne thing Dream League does not have is any sort of female representation in the game. Though women\u2019s soccer has become increasingly popular, the game sticks to just men\u2019s.\nFor a less serious, but nonetheless fun and weirdly realistic game of simulated football, check out theStickman Soccer 2016app ($1 on iOSand free with in-app purchasesfor Android). This game plays much like Dream League, albeit with slightly simpler controls and less in the way of team management options.\nIt has a 3-D cartoon look and a faster pace of play; games last only a few minutes. It still manages to pack in some convincing soccer tricks like slides, diving saves, goal-scoring celebrations and some neat tackling moves, plus the option to replay some recent games.\nThe one quirk is the game\u2019s look, which as its title suggests, places you in control of stick figures \u2014 3-D, animated versions of the line-drawn human shapes we all know. That takes a little getting used to.\nFood52 has been a popular crowdsourced recipe website and it is now officially packaged in an app. Called(Not)Recipes, the app pulls together its ever-growing list of user-submitted menus into one place. You can search for ideas by ingredient, upload your own recipes and even see how popular they are among other people. The app isfree on iOS."
