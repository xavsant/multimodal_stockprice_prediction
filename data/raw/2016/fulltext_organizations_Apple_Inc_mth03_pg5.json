        "fulltext": "VALEANT LOSSES DRAG ACKMAN HEDGE FUND DOWN|Pershing Square Holdings, the publicly listed entity of William A. Ackman\u2019s\n                                                    firm, reported ayear-to-date loss of 25.2 percentas of March 22,Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.\nMost of the losses stem from Mr. Ackman\u2019s bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose stock has fallen 67 percent so far this year. Mr. Ackman\u2019s commitment to Valeant has not wavered and he even\n                                                    sold part of his stake in Mondelez, partly to free up cash.\nMr. Ackman is not the only investor taking heat for a bullish call on Valeant. The hedge fund managerJohn A. Paulson held a conference call last week to deal with investor concernsabout his 13.2\n                                                    million-share position in Valeant. Mr. Paulson said that he had no plans to sell his holdings or buy more stock.\nValeant\u2019s biggest shareholder, Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, has announced that its chief executive, Robert Goldfarb, would retire after the steep losses from Valeant.\u201cWhile we have\n                                                    beaten the market over the past decade, through the end of 2015, our investment in Valeant has diminished a record that we have built over two generations and in which we take great pride,\u201d the\n                                                    firm told investors.\nValeant itself is in a difficult situation because its former chief financial officer, Howard B. Schiller, refuses to leave quietly,Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor.\nThe company accused Mr. Schiller of \u201cimproper conduct,\u201d but he might be sticking around for an uncomfortably long time.A Valeant director can be removed only by shareholders either acting at the annual meeting or by special resolution.Still, Mr. Schiller will be busy as both he and the departing chief executive may face pay clawback actions.\nValeant has been incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, since an inversion in 2010. The law there means that litigation over Valeant is unlikely to focus on whether the board breached its fiduciary duties.Instead, there would be regular stock-drop securities lawsuits.The irony is that the hedge funds that now have seats on Valeant\u2019s board would be some of the biggest possible beneficiaries\n                                                    of the litigation.\n\nJUDGE SLAMS F.T.C. FOR TESTIMONY IN OFFICE DEPOT|A federal judge criticized the Federal Trade Commission fortrying to elicit false information from an Amazon executive during a trialin which it was trying to block Staples\u2019 takeover of its rival Office Depot,Bloomberg News reports.\nJudge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District Court for the District of Columbia said during the trial that it was \u201cvery disturbing\u201d when the United States tried to persuade a witness \u201cto\n                                                    say something for the benefit of the United States of America that is not true.\u201d\nPrentis Wilson, a vice president of a new Amazon unit that sells office supplies to companies, had declined to comment under oath about a written statement.His testimony was central to the claim that Amazon would be a formidable competitor to an enlarged Staples.The F.T.C. argued that Staples and Office Depot would dominate the market and the merger would lead to higher prices for corporate customers.\nTara Reinhart, a lawyer for the commission, said that the agency never asked Mr. Wilson to say something that was not true.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The Commerce Department will publish data ondurable goods ordersfor February at 8:30 a.m.James Bullard,\n                                                    the president of the St. Louis Fed, will speak at the New York Association for Business Economics at 8:15 a.m.\n\nCREDIT SUISSE CHIEF SAYS RISKY BETS WERE A \u2018SURPRISE\u2019|According to Tidjane Thiam, the chief, a thirst for revenue\n                                                    \u201cat all costs\u201d drove traders at Credit Suisse to take large, risky positions, catching top executives off guard andforcing them to accelerate cost-cutting,Chad Bray and Liz Moyer report in DealBook.\nTrading conditions have been unfavorable and Credit Suisse has suffered from its \u201coutsized\u201d positions in risky, hard-to-sell securities.\nCredit Suisse also plans to shrink its investment bank further.The bank said it planned to eliminate 2,000 jobs in the trading arm of its investment bank as part of 6,000 job cuts across the company.\n                                                    It also said it would exit some businesses.\nMr. Thiam said the size of positions on the bank\u2019s trading book\u201cwas a surprise for a number of people and was not a widely known fact.\u201dTop executives, including himself, became\n                                                    aware of them only in January \u2014 months after they first outlined a plan to refocus the company on less volatile businesses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. And I think it\u2019s also indicative of an attitude to risk that has to change,\u201d he said. He added later thatthe traders had not acted improperly, but that\n                                                    the limits on the positions kept being raised over time.\nInvestors now have a light at the end of the tunnel,George Hay writes in Breakingviews.\n                                                    But it has taken too long for Mr. Thiam to reach this point.\nCredit Suisse said that it would add $821 million to what it expected to take off its cost base by 2018. This could have been done five months ago and without the embarrassing episodes that have arisen along\n                                                    the way.The bank is heading in the right direction, but from the back foot, Mr. Hay writes.\n\n|The DealBook newsletter will take a break on Friday and return on Monday.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nYum Said to Hold Talks With K.K.R. on Sale of China Business|Yum Brands has started discussions with financial firms, including\n                                                    K.K.R. and Baring Private Equity Asia, about selling as much as 20 percent of the business in China, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the situation.the wall street journal\n\nLawmakers Raise Concerns About ChemChina\u2019s Purchase of Syngenta|Senator Charles E.

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has also said that\n                                                    he intended to tighten the rules.\nBig money is at stake.Using Pfizer\u2019s latest filings, Mr. Sommer calculated that the company had more than $160 billion parked overseas, which enabled it to avoid or defer billions in tax payments\n                                                    to the United States.\nThe billions of tax dollars up for grabs have turned this deal into apolitical flash pointand made it risky. The government might intervene. If it can\u2019t stop the merger, it might make it\n                                                    economically unappealing.\nWhether Pfizer would have more flexibility in using its overseas cash after the merger is an important question for the markets, but the answer is still unclear.\nTreasury, which is expected to issue new rules in the next few weeks, says that legislation would be required to stop inversions entirely, although the passage of several pending bills is unlikely this year.\n                                                    Corporate tax rules might be overhauled, but it is uncertain when that might occur.\nAt the same time, the deal is being scrutinized by regulators and the stock market, wherethe shares of both companies have been
