        "fulltext": "Good Tuesday. (Want this by email?Sign up here.)\nIn the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled an audacious plan yesterday todominate the digital services that run on its devices\u2014 a new monthly subscription service for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card. But it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer.\n\u2022Apple TV Pluswill offer new original content, as well as programs from channels like HBO and Showtime. Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston took the stage to make the announcement, but details \u2014 even about fundamentals like pricing \u2014 were glaringly absent.\n\u2022Apple News Plusgives access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker and National Geographic, as well as newspapers like the LAT and the WSJ for $9.99 a month. But it\u2019s unclear whether you\u2019ll get all the content \u2014 business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full WSJ subscribers, who pay $39 a month, for example \u2014 so it\u2019s not quite as robust an offering as it first seems.\n\u2022Apple Arcadeis a video game subscription service that will launch later this year. Surprise: No details were given about how much it would cost, or which games would be included.\n\u2022Apple Cardis the company\u2019s new credit card, which has been developed with Goldman Sachs. It\u2019s meant to work mainly on the iPhone, with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through Apple Pay. Some important questions you might have \u2014 such as credit limit and interest rate \u2014weren\u2019t answered.\nThe company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer \u2014 and we still have little idea about either.\nLobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees,Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes:\n\u2022 In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a \u201cdigital network\u201d to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.\n\u2022 That\u2019s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.\n\u2022 This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.\n\u2022 Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.\n\u2022 Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.\n\u2022 \u201cWorker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,\u201d Mr. Scheiber writes.\nLast year, Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her fight against President Trump. Yesterday, he was arrested for what prosecutors said wasan attempted shakedown of Nike.\nMr. Avenatti threatened the sports giant,saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits \u2014 unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least $22.5 million, prosecutors said.\n\u201cThe company will die\u2014 not die, but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public,\u201d Mr. Avenatti told Nike lawyers in a meeting that was recorded.\nThe federal charges were announced around the timethatMr. Avenatti tweetedthat he planned to hold a news conference to accuse Nike of \u201ca major high school/college basketball scandal.\u201d\n\u201cWhen lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys,\u201d Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday.\nBritain\u2019s lawmakers grabbed control of the nation\u2019s departure from the E.U. yesterday, in a move that highlights the struggles of Prime Minister Theresa May,Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.\nParliament gave itself power to vote on alternative Brexit plans.\u201cIts attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs. May prepared for a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan, which has already been rejected twice by huge margins,\u201d Mr. Castle writes.\nIt will hold a series of votes tomorrowon alternatives to Mrs. May\u2019s plan. \u201cThese could include a so-called \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures; a second referendum, revoking Brexit completely; or leaving without any deal,\u201d Mr. Castle explains.\n\u201cMrs. May said she could not commit to honoringthe outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes, particularly if they contradicted the pro-Brexit stance in the Conservative Party\u2019s manifesto for the 2017 general election.\u201d\nBut the situation challenges Britain\u2019s political traditions, where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament, and \u201ccould create a constitutional showdown,\u201d according to Mr. Castle.\nThe ride-hailing giant said this morning that it will acquire Careem, its main competitor in the region, for $3.1 billion,Kate Conger of the NYT reports.\nThe deal comes ahead of Uber\u2019s I.P.O., and could give a boost to the company\u2019s financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival. It also gives Uber immediate access to several markets where it doesn\u2019t currently operate, including Iraq, Morocco and Palestine.\nThe deal represents a change in strategy, since Uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like Didi Chuxing of China and Yandex of Russia.\nBut it could raise privacy concerns, Ms. Conger writes. Careem will keep operating under its own name, but will eventually share some features with Uber. Though Uber has declined to share user data with the Egyptian government, Careem was more open to doing so.\nAt the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is Rick Singer, a higher-education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools. The WSJ traced one way he operated:partnering with financial advisory firms.\n\u2022 He was a regular on the financial speaking circuit, the WSJ reports, \u201cwhich allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment.\u201d His services often spread through word of mouth.\n\u2022 \u201cMr. Singer listed work with other financial-services firms, including Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley, on his website and social media.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cEmployees at bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co., based in Newport Beach, Calif., twice invited Mr. Singer to speak about the college-admission process, and the company said some there used his legitimate services.\u201d (Douglas Hodge, the former C.E.O. of Pimco, as the company is known, has been charged in the bribery scheme.)\n\u2022 \u201cIn November 2017, for instance, an employee at a Los Angeles-based financial adviser emailed Mr. Singer, introducing him to a parent who wished to make a \u2018donation\u2019 to \u2018one of those top schools\u2019 for his daughter, according to federal filings, which don\u2019t name the firm.\u201d\nDE Shaw may be best known as the hedge fund where Jeff Bezos began his career. But as Robin Wigglesworth of the FT writes, it was also an early leader in computer-driven investing \u2014 and is nowbetting on A.I.-enabled stock picking.\n\u2022 \u201cMany in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realize the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cPeople have gone insane about this, but in a good way,\u201d Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive chairman who owns 20 percent of DE Shaw, told the FT. \u201cWe are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well.\u201d\n\u2022 DE Shaw keeps its operations shrouded in secrecy. \u201cThey\u2019re really smart, but I\u2019ve never quite understood them,\u201d one quant hedge fund manager told the FT.\n\u2022 But there\u2019s reason to be skeptical of its current approach, Mr. Wigglesworth writes. \u201cWall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain skeptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSome rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma \u2014 a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives \u2014 has eschewed their former colleagues\u2019 hybrid methods.\u201d\nSeth DuCharme, the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York, will join the staff of Attorney General William Barr.Jacquelyn Kasulis, who led the prosecution of Martin Shkreli, will become the acting chief of the division.\nThe investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners has hiredNancy Boehmfrom the CIT Group as a managing director and its chief technology officer.\nDeals\n\u2022 Qatari investors, who own about 6 percent of Deutsche Bank, are reportedly resisting a merger with Commerzbank.

        "title": "Facebook\u2019s Data Deals Are Under Criminal Investigation",
        "fulltext": "Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into data deals Facebook struck with some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, intensifying scrutiny of the social media giant\u2019s business practices as it seeks to rebound from a year of scandal and setbacks.\nA grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent makers of smartphones and other devices, according to two people who were familiar with the requests and who insisted on anonymity to discuss confidential legal matters. Both companies had entered into partnerships with Facebook, gaining broad access to thepersonal information of hundreds of millions of its users.\nThe companies were among more than 150, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Sony, that had cut sharing deals with the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. The agreements,previously reported in The New York Times, let the companies see users\u2019 friends, contact information and other data, sometimes without consent.Facebookhas phased out most of the partnerships over the past two years.\n\u201cWe are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.\u201d\n[Read Brian Chen\u2019s story on what he found when hedownloaded his Facebook data.]\nIt is not clear when the grand jury inquiry, overseen by prosecutors with the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York, began or exactly what it is focusing on. Facebook was already facing scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. And the Justice Department\u2019s securities fraud unit began investigating it after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, hadimproperly obtained the Facebook dataof 87 million people and used it to build tools that helped President Trump\u2019s election campaign.\nThe Justice Department and the Eastern District declined to comment for this article.\nThe Cambridge investigation, still active,is being run by prosecutors from the Northern District of California. One former Cambridge employee said investigators questioned him as recently as late February. He and three other witnesses in the case, speaking on the condition of anonymity so they would not anger prosecutors, said a significant line of inquiry involved Facebook\u2019s claims that it was misled by Cambridge.\n[Read more on the 5 waysFacebook shared your data.]\nIn public statements, Facebook executives had said that Cambridge told the company it was gathering data only for academic purposes. But the fine print accompanying a quiz app that collected the information said it could also be used commercially. Selling user data would have violated Facebook\u2019s rules at the time, yet the social network does not appear to have regularly checked that apps were complying. Facebook deleted the quiz app in December 2015.\nThe disclosures about Cambridge last year thrust Facebook into the worst crisis of its history. Then came news reports last June and December that Facebook had given business partners \u2014 including makers of smartphones, tablets and other devices \u2014 deep access to users\u2019 personal information, letting some companies effectively override users\u2019 privacy settings.\nThe sharing deals empowered Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to map out the friends of virtually all Facebook users without their explicit consent, and allowed Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends. Apple was able to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were even asking for data.\nPrivacy advocates said the partnerships seemed to violate a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the F.T.C., stemming from allegations that the company had shared data in ways that deceived consumers. The deals also appeared to contradict statements by Mark Zuckerberg and other executives that Facebook had clamped down several years ago on sharing the data of users\u2019 friends with outside developers.\nF.T.C. officials, who spent the past yearinvestigating whether Facebook violated the 2011 agreement, are now weighing the sharing deals as theynegotiate a possible multibillion-dollar fine. That would be the largest such penalty ever imposed by the trade regulator.\nFacebook has aggressively defended the partnerships, saying they were permitted under a provision in the F.T.C. agreement that covered service providers \u2014 companies that acted as extensions of the social network.\nThe company has taken steps in the past year to tackle data misuse and misinformation. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg unveiled a plan that would begin to pivot Facebook away from being a platform for public sharing and put more emphasis on private communications."

        "title": "Elizabeth Warren Proposes Breaking Up Tech Giants Like Amazon and Facebook",
        "fulltext": "Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is bidding to be thepolicy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, championed another expansive idea on Friday evening in front of a crowd of thousands in Queens: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America\u2019s largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.\n[Update:Zuckerberg hates Warren\u2019s plans to break up Facebook. She doesnt\u2019 care.]\nAt a rally in Long Island City, the neighborhood that was to be home toa major new Amazon campus, Ms. Warren laid out her proposal calling for regulators who would undo some tech mergers, as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace.\n\u201cWe have these giants corporations \u2014 do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? \u2014 that think they can roll over everyone,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd, drawing applause. She compared Amazon to the dystopian novel \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d in which those with power force their wishes on the less fortunate.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of freeloading billionaires,\u201d she said.\nMs. Warren\u2019s policy announcement sent reverberations from New York to Silicon Valley, as she further cemented herself as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes to the country\u2019s structure in the name of equality.\nAmong the crowded field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, Ms. Warren has done the most to add detail to those early proposals, including a plan for universal child care, a tax on the country\u2019s wealthiest families, and, as of Friday, breaking up big technological giants.\nMs. Warren\u2019s regulatory plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, the campaign said, including Facebook\u2019s deals forWhatsAppandInstagram,Amazon\u2019s addition of Whole Foods, and Google\u2019s purchase of Waze. Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users\u2019 data with third parties. Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics, would be split apart.\n[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]\nPressure for elected officials to place additional oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months, particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may haveviolated customer privacy agreements. Ms. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates.\nIn the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Ms. Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon \u2014 though Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Senator Kamala Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedlypressed executives on consumer privacybut has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has beenmore willing to embrace the controversial corporations, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties.\n\u201cOur technology industry is the envy of the world and we need policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice \u2014 but we also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,\u201d said Ro Khanna, the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said that blanket statements against big tech companies weren\u2019t helpful, but that each company needed to be \u201cevaluated on a case-by-case basis and afforded due process.\u201d\n[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to \u201cstructurally separate\u201d their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.\nMs. Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have been a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act \u2014 in thewordsof Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 \u201cmore like a government than a traditional company.\u201d\nDuring a brief interview later in New York, Ms. Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was right to have offeredhefty tax incentivesto Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, from Ms. Warren\u2019s home state, also offered similar incentives.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, \u2018What will you offer me if I came?\u2019\u201d\nThis is a refrain she has hit for years, including in a 2016 speech titled \u201cReigniting Competition in the American Economy.\u201d Last year, she introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which seeks to curb shareholder power by forcing corporations to increase worker representation on their governing boards, while also reducing incentives for big companies to pay out shareholders rather than reinvest in businesses.\nMatt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget Committee, said Ms. Warren\u2019s plan was \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d He compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America\u2019s past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C. that these companies are progressive,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cTheir employees give to Democrats, they\u2019re friendly to social liberalism, there\u2019s an idealism to how they talk about the world. That\u2019s been the traditional sense.\u201d\n\u201cBut these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t care.\u201d\nCarl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade association called NetChoice, said he felt Ms. Warren\u2019s plan was unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their enemies.\n\u201cPoliticizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,\u201d said Mr. Szabo, who is a professor of privacy law at George Mason University\u2019s law school. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how politics can inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don\u2019t think our legislators should be encouraging this precedent.\u201d\nThough tech giants have experienced several controversies in recent years, it is unclear how popular Ms. Warren\u2019s antitrust proposal would be with voters. Rob Atkinson, president of Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry-sponsored group, defended the power of big companies in the technology sector for what he described as benefits to consumers.\n\u201cThe Warren campaign\u2019s call to break up big tech companies reflects a \u2018big is bad, small is beautiful\u2019 ideology run amok,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. \u201cThe proposal ignores the fact that many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money.\u201d\nMatt McIlwain, a partner at the Seattle venture capital firm Madrona Venture Group, which was an early Amazon investor, said in an email, \u201cSenator Warren and others with a similar mind-set are misguided on the need to break up larger tech companies.\u201d\n\u201cCompanies in the innovation economy have a strong track record of creating quality products and services that are often free or at dramatically lower costs than previous services,\u201d Mr. McIlwain said.\nFor those closely watching the Democratic presidential nomination contest, the announcement was another example of Ms. Warren\u2019s political strategy, which is to appeal to voters based on policy ideas and retail politics, not soaring oration or feel-good messages of unity.\nAmong the crowd in Queens, which included more young people than many Warren rallies across the country, several said they appreciated her policy focus.\n\u201cThe fact that she focuses on concrete policy, this early in the race, is really aspirational,\u201d said Milo Vassallo, who is involved in several Brooklyn leftist groups. Mr. Vassallo said he particularly liked Ms. Warren\u2019s new proposal on technology.\n\u201cHer goal is not to undermine big tech, but just make it more competitive,\u201d he said.\nKevin Murray, a 28-year-old law student who lives in Queens and who has not decided on a candidate to support, praised Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals as \u201ctangible.\u201d Mr. Murray also wanted to come to the rally because Ms. Warren is the author of one of his law school textbooks.\n\u201cI would\u2019ve brought it for her to sign,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was a rental.\u201d"

        "title": "A Better Way to Break Up Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation \u2014 besides theswarmsof drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters \u2014 was Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.\nIn her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warrenarguedthat these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways.\nThe first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other \u2014 sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace \u2014 but not both.\n\u201cYou can be an umpire or you can own teams,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game.\u201d\nMs. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.\nRegulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy thanmostelected officials.\nBut many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I\u2019d offer a few edits.\nApply specific fixes to specific problems.One shortcoming in Ms. Warren\u2019s plan \u2014 and it\u2019s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules \u2014 is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.\nLawmakers don\u2019t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That\u2019s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.\nInstead, Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces \u2014 a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)\nThe problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analystBen Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.\nThe possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.\nRather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.\nSplit off cloud businesses.Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google\u2019s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.\nRight now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companiesmake a killingby renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.\nThe cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn\u2019t giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?\nYes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies \u2014 each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own \u2014 gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse.\nFor example, let\u2019s imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, whichruns on Amazon Web Services, Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company\u2019s streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix\u2019s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon\u2019s streaming-video team should copy.\nTo be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon\u2019s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address.\nAn effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.\nGet rid of the \u201capp tax.\u201dAnother easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.\nAt the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the \u201cApple tax\u201d: a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google\u2019s mobile app store charges similar fees.)\nThese fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix waspayingApple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms\u2019 strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotifyfiled a complaintwith the European Commission over Apple\u2019s App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.\nApple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.\nDon\u2019t get lured into a censorship debate.Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren\u2019s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode,sayingit was proof of Facebook\u2019s ability to \u201cshut down a debate\u201d over its power.\nThe ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebookmade it clearthat the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook\u2019s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be \u201cFacebook\u2019s official quiz game\u201d or whatever.\nBut the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.\n\u201cShe\u2019s right \u2014 Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\u201d Mr. Cruzwrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter.\nOne problem with the debate over the tech companies\u2019 power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook\u2019sshutting offdata access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz\u2019s unsupportedclaimsthat social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for \u201cneutral platforms.\u201d\nThe best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.\nThe worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies\u2019 power, while leaving their fortresses intact."

        "title": "Why a Big Tech Breakup Looks Better to Washington",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A decade ago, when the greed and carelessness of the financial industry came close to destroying the American economy, the overwhelming response by politicians and the public was: Meh. Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.\nNow the tech industry \u2014 which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world\u2019s knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button \u2014 has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that\u2019s just the beginning of the list.\nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,released proposals this monththat would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \u201cWe have a major monopoly problem.\u201d\nAt a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Ms. Warren\u2019s and Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s ideas was surprisingly receptive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to break these guys apart,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.\n\u201cA billionaire, right?\u201d Ms. Warren noted.\nFor decades, a politician who mentioned \u201cantitrust\u201d was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \u201cAntitrust\u201d was relegated to the shelf with \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cwealth inequality\u201d and \u201chigher taxes for higher incomes.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t help that what could be called \u201cmaximum antitrust\u201d \u2014 when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up \u2014 has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled itscase against Microsoftin 2001. Only AT&T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government\u2019s point of view.\nThe political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what\u2019s best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.\n\u201cSomething has definitely changed,\u201d said Geoffrey A. Manne, the founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \u201cMost voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there\u2019s also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\u201d\nMr. Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&T, eviscerated Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal with his colleague Alec Stappin a recent blog post. They wrote that the senator\u2019s plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \u201cplatform utilities\u201d would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.\nAnd yet, Mr. Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.\n\u201cThere is a long history in America \u2014 just not a recent one \u2014 of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may be at that moment again.\u201d\nThe financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers directly suffer by paying higher prices.\nNothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced bya new SurveyMonkey polldone for the news site Axios.\nTheheadline findingwas that \u201ca growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.\u201d But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right.\nUsers, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet.\nDaniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \u201cThe median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies\u2019 worries. \u201cA likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\u201d he said. \u201cEven just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forward.\u201d\nThat is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.\nAmazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago, but it continued in the United States. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, asked for regulators to investigate in December. Last week, Amazon confirmed that it had dropped the requirement.\nAntitrust talk emboldens competitors as well. Google controls much of the market for online ads in Australia, just as it does elsewhere. That presents a big problem for News Corporation, which owns eight of the 10 largest papers in the country.\nThe Rupert Murdoch-controlled media conglomerate asked Australian regulators last week to take the \u201cvery serious step\u201d of breaking up Google in the country because of the \u201cunparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.\u201d\nIn this new environment, winning can soon look a lot like losing.\nAmazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless, and succeeded in getting it cut in half. Then the retailer decided it just couldn\u2019t live with the measure at all. A repeal effort began. The City Councilkilled the taxjust as it was going into effect.\nAt the time, that looked like another triumph for Amazon. But in the months since, even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolving.\n\u201cMy feelings about Amazon have changed, and not in a good way,\u201d said Julie Shapiro, a Seattle University professor of family law. \u201cI think they want the ability to be a bully and, once they have it, they\u2019re quite willing to use it.\u201d\nThat is the crux of the issue: Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully? It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quarter-century \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 had a terrible reputation in the tech community. Voters love innovation, convenience and entrepreneurs. They don\u2019t love bullies.\nAmazon failed to avoid bullying behavior in its now-abandoned bid to build a headquarters in New York, and Facebook likewise failed last week when it took down Ms. Warren\u2019s posts about Facebook having too much power. The company, which said the posts had violated the use of its logo, quickly restored them, but the public relations damage had been done.\n\u201cCurious why I think FB has too much power?\u201dMs. Warren tweeted. \u201cLet\u2019s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Unveils Video Service With Celebrity Parade but Few Details",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple unveiled a new video streaming service on Monday with a parade of celebrities rarely seen on a stage outside of Hollywood\u2019s awards season, with heavyweight directors like Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams and stars like Octavia Spencer and Jennifer Aniston.\nOprah Winfrey even served as the closer for the nearly two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple\u2019s campus. \u201cThey\u2019re in a billion pockets, y\u2019all,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said of Apple\u2019s global reach. \u201cA billion pockets.\u201d\nAs enthusiastic as the entertainment industry appears to be to work with Apple, it is increasingly clear that Apple needs Hollywood. After years of record profits, the company is slowing down. Phone sales are cooling, and despite the relative popularity of products like the Apple Watch, the next big thing has eluded the Silicon Valley giant.\nNow, short of another game-changing gadget and facing tough competition from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, Apple is trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years. The company unveiled an expansive strategy to push consumers to do more than just buy its hardware products. It has plans for new monthly subscription services for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card.\nThenew services represent an evolutionof Apple\u2019s business. For years, Apple focused mainly on selling devices, counting on consumers to upgrade phones and tablets every few years. Now the company is keying on selling content and services for its roughly 1.4 billion active devices, which include Apple TV boxes, Apple Watches, Mac computers and iPads.\nThe streaming service is called Apple TV Plus. After years of speculation about what an Apple alternative to Netflix might look like, the company offered few details about the new offering \u2014 but plenty of razzle dazzle. Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Kumail Nanjiani, Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard \u2014 even Big Bird from Sesame Street \u2014 also joined Apple executives on the stage.\nAt the heart of Apple TV Pluswill be new original programs. It will not carry advertising and will begin this fall in more than 100 countries. It will also include programs from other television networks like HBO, Showtime, Starz and CBS.\nBut some of the biggest questions going into the Apple event were not answered, starting with price. The stars talked about their new programs, but the broad story lines of the shows were already known.\nMr. Spielberg was the first Hollywood celebrity to take the stage, and he received the morning\u2019s first standing ovation. \u201cThis is my first time at Apple,\u201d he said.\nMr. Spielberg was also speaking for many in the entertainment industry who were making their first trip to Apple\u2019s campus 300 miles north from Los Angeles. Since October 2017, Apple has spent well over $1 billion on original programming. Five shows have completed filming, and another half-dozen will be finished in the coming months. Apple has ordered about two dozen series altogether.\nBut Apple is coming late to the game. Netflix has been making original programming for seven years and will spend at least $10 billion on content this year. Amazon and Hulu have also made tremendous inroads with the industry.\nApple\u2019s entertainment foraycould also lead to a culture clash. Silicon Valley and Hollywood operate in distinctly different ways: Apple prides itself on secrecy, while Hollywood runs on a wealth of information. Perhaps aware of this sensitivity, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, began describing his company last week as an entertainment company instead of a tech company.\nApple\u2019s streaming music service has 56 million subscribers. It offers additional cloud storage for a monthly fee, and it takes a cut of the money spent on apps running on its devices, as well as a sliver of digital payments made by iPhones. Apple generated $10.9 billion from services in the last quarter of 2018, compared to $73.4 billion from hardware sales.\nThe video service is the linchpin of Apple\u2019s broader services push. In addition to customers paying $1,000 every two or three years for a new iPhone, Apple hopes they will also pay $10, $20, $30 or $40 a month a one-stop shop for content for all their devices.\n\u201cIn essence Apple is seeking to become a Netflix of everything in services; music, news and magazines, video and games,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, a technology, media and telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.\nApple said its Apple News Plus subscription will include access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker, National Geographic and InStyle. It will also feature newspapers like The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. The subscription will cost $9.99 a month and is available beginning today in the United States and Canada.\nThe subscription service builds on a free news app that the company released in late 2015 and comes installed on the company\u2019s iOS software. Apple said about five billion articles are read monthly on Apple News.\nThe price to be part of Apple\u2019s paid news offering is steep. Apple is taking a 50 percent cut of the subscriptions, with the publications splitting what\u2019s left over based on readership. Apple\u2019s cut for news is larger than the 30 percent it takes for subscriptions bought in the App Store. Publishers expressed concern that Apple would maintain access to important consumer data such as credit cards and email addresses as part of the deal.\nThe Wall Street Journal said its business stories and analysis would remain exclusive to its paying subscribers, but it sees an opportunity to reach a new category of readers for general interest news. The newspaper said it would add to its newsroom to support Apple News Plus. The New York Times and The Washington Post decided to not join the service.\nFor video games, the company said it would start a subscription service called Apple Arcade this fall. It did not offer any pricing details for the service, but the company said this will allow people to try out new games. Apple said it will help foot some of the development costs for game developers.\nApple also unveiled a credit card called Apple Card. Working in tandem with Goldman Sachs, the company said the new credit card is meant to work mainly on the iPhone \u2014 users can apply for the card on the phone and be instantly approved. It will reap bigger rewards if the consumer uses the card on Apple Pay, the company\u2019s digital payment system.\nThe credit card offers 2 percent cash back for spending on Apple Pay. Apple touted how it simplified credit card rewards with \u201cdaily cash\u201d deposited back into the digital wallet on the iPhone shortly after purchasing an item.\nAfter its barrage of announcements, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced Ms. Winfrey. Apple signed to a deal with her in June 2018. Ms. Winfrey said she was making two documentaries for Apple\u2019s new video service and bringing her book club to the company and turn it into the \u201cbiggest, most vibrant, most stimulating\u201d book club on the planet."

        "title": "Is Apple Saying Goodbye to Fashion?",
        "fulltext": "A sudden, striking influx of glamorous non-techies at a tech hub in California. Grumbles about NDAs. Excited, surreptitious glances. Gossip about disruption. A drumroll for a hitherto hush-hush, industry-upsetting announcement.\nSound familiar?\nThis is not a description of what ishappeningtodayat the Apple event in Cupertino, as the company unveils its new video service and television shows (among other things). It is a description of what happened on Sept. 9, 2014, at the Apple event in Cupertino, where theApple watchwas unveiled. For those of us who remember that day, the run-up to this week has provided an eerie sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nNot to mention a question: What\u2019s the deal with wearables and fashion? Five years on from the watch\u2019s much-ballyhooed introduction, is the relationship over? Has technology found a new object for its affections?\nFor a brief, shining moment, there was such an intense attraction. The trend wheel turns so fast these days that it is easy to forget, but take a moment, please, to remember when. Because it is possible that there is a lesson for us all buried in the end of the affair(apologies to Graham Greene).\n\u201cThere is this endless hunger in fashion for newness and what\u2019s the next thing, and Apple and Silicon Valley really promises that,\u201d said Mimma Viglezio, the editor of the digital platform ShowStudio. \u201cSo they\u201d \u2014 we! \u2014 \u201cjust embraced it.\u201d\nIn advance of the watch\u2019s introduction, Apple \u2014 which, after all, had been built on some of the principles dear to luxury, including the allure of tactile design, and planned obsolescence \u2014 began seducing glossy executives right and left to come work for the company.\nMost notably there was Paul Deneve, the chief executive of Yves Saint Laurent; Patrick Pruniaux, of Tag Heuer; andAngela Ahrendts, the chief executive credited with using technology to transform Burberry, who arrived at Apple to run its retail and e-tail operations with a gilded halo still fresh on her head.\nFront-row denizens like Alexandra Shulman, the editor of British Vogue, and Lauren Indvik, the editor of Fashionista, flew out to Cupertino in the middle of New York Fashion Week, suggesting that when it came to shows, the one in California was the one that mattered.\nDuring Paris Fashion Week, Apple had an unveiling at the super-boutique Colette and Karl Lagerfeld came. Later there was adinner at Azzedine Ala\u00efa\u2019s, so designers like Olivier Rousteing (of Balmain) and models like Cara Delevingne could ogle the accessory.\nThe watch made its magazine debut on the cover of China Vogue. Apple took out a12-page adin American Vogue. One year after the first unveil, also during fashion week, Apple announced apartnership with Herm\u00e8s, and the following May the company underwrote the Met Gala for the \u201cManus x Machina\u201d show, itself an ode to the coziness of fashion and technology (which wasthe unofficial dress codeof the party).\nTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, showed up; Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, was a co-host, along with Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast and editor of Vogue. As symbolism went, the picture said it all.\n(Or seemed to, anyway; whether the cosiness was part of an overall fashion strategy or just a series of coincidental niceties between a company that makes glossy inanimate things and an industry that makes animate things glossy, we\u2019ll likely never know, given how tight-lipped Apple is.)\nIn any case, Apple was only a part of it.\nSamsung\u2019s Gear S also made its fashion week debut in September 2014, courtesy of Diesel Black Gold. Intel teamed up with Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony to create theMICA smartbangle.Will.i.amintroduced the\u201cpuls\u201d cuff, inspired in part by Chanel\u2019s signature Maltese cross cuffs.\nNot long afterward, Ralph Lauren introducedthe connected Ricky bagwith a light and a charging port (which followed its connectedtennis shirtthat monitored heart rate). \u201cIt\u2019s a game changer for us in luxury,\u201d David Lauren, the company\u2019s executive vice president for advertising, marketing and corporate communications, said at the time.\nTag Heuer, Intel and Googleteamed upto make their own connected version of the Carrera watch. Louis Vuitton made a connected Tambour Horizon and described a futureinternet of Louis Vuitton things. It was like a smart-accessory orgy.\nThat moment in 2012 when Google Glassstrutted down the runwayat a Diane von Furstenberg show and everyone cringed \u2014 even DVF could not rescue that gadget from its own nerdiness \u2014 was treated as simply an awkward early harbinger of better things to come. This was the future!\nThe cool of California was going to rub off on the hidebound fashion world, and the glamour of fashion was going to fill consumers with desire for products. Instead of competing for the same wallet share, they would both benefit.\nBut then Mr. Deneve left Apple. So did Mr. Pruniaux. And next month,Ms. Ahrendts departs. Intel \u201cexited the end-product wearables area in 2017,\u201d according to a company spokeswoman, and has pivoted to data analysis used to inform retailers and brands, among others.\nWill.i.amrefocused on \u201cartificial intelligence and voice-controlled computing, for B2B and B2C hardware\u201d his representative said. Ralph Lauren no longer sells a connected bag.\nAll the talk about wearables and fashion has gone very, very quiet.\n\u201cThe Venn overlap is not as great as anyone thought,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business and the founder of the digital think tank L2. \u201cTechnology is essentially about creating utility and spreading it over billions of people. Fashion is about creating a moment, a trend, a romance and spreading it across a small amount of influential people.\u201d\nThis does not mean that wearables themselves are over (although it would be good if someone could think of a different word for the category, since theoretically it could apply to anything you put on your body).\nBy all accounts, the smartwatch industry, which accounts for 44 percent of the \u201cwearable devices\u201d market, according to the research groupInternational Data Corporation, is doing just fine. I.D.C. predicts that watches will be among the main drivers of a 15.3 percent growth in the market this year. (A new report from the NPD group said that in 2018 sales of smartwatches in the United States increased 54 percent.)\nInApple\u2019s Q1 2019 earnings callin January, Mr. Cook said that its wearables category was up 50 percent (that primarily means watches and AirPods). A spokesman for Herm\u00e8s said its Apple watch was one of its most popular models. Louis Vuitton\u2019s smartwatch accounts for half of its watch business.\nBut while once upon a time there were rumors about other designers joining the gang, and third parties like Coach and Kate Spade have made bands for the Apple watch, the talk these days is all about the watch being aplatform for health and fitness\u2014 which is also why the fitness brands (Nike especially)are still gung-ho.\nThat does not mean fashion itself is not interested in technology. There is a lot of excitement among executives I speak to about augmented reality as a shopping tool. As far as material science and production, technology is hugely promising, especially as the industry looks more and more to sustainability.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is it has spread into the back end of production nanotechnology and fabric,\u201d said Amanda Parkes, the chief innovation officer of Future Tech Lab. \u201cBut that takes time to develop, like biotech.\u201d\nIn the meantime, a few brands are dallying with cool stuff on the side. Jimmy Choo recently unveiled a heated lace-up urban hiking boot. It warms up via a battery in the heel, and then connects to a phone app so you can control and monitor the temperature. Ralph Lauren has designed heated versions of its Polo 11 and Olympic puffer jackets (they are also controlled via an app).\nVuitton introduced wireless earphones made with Master & Dynamic technology and is testing a connected suitcase. And Levi\u2019s has been selling its Commuter x Jacquard by Google connected jean jacket since fall 2017.\nBut the fact that all of those developments, which five years ago would have been trumpeted with drumrolls and bells and whistles, slipped in practically under the radar is reflective of the new state of \u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t call it estrangement, but rather a cooling off of the once heated relationship.\n\u201cThe connected boot is playful and was just one of those things we kind of add on when it makes sense,\u201d said Sandra Choi, the creative director of Jimmy Choo, who added that the boot has been well received. It was not included, though, in the company\u2019s presentation during the most recent Milan Fashion Week because it was not considered core to the Jimmy Choo identity, or even indicative of future direction.\nPaul Dillinger, the head of global product innovation at Levi\u2019s, said much the same, noting that the connected jacket is positioned in Levi\u2019s Commuter Collection, \u201cwhich is a fairly niche area of the business.\u201d When it came time for the next season\u2019s release, instead of offering a new style or a new product, the company chose to offer the same product \u2014 with new applications.\n\u201cWe put the creative energy of fashion design into the jacket\u2019s digital collateral rather than physical collateral,\u201d Mr. Dillinger said.\nMr. Galloway of N.Y.U. said the conclusion was simple: \u201cThere was only one wearable that was really a fashion statement, and that was your phone.\u201d Which may have been the root of the problem. We thought that wherever that led, everything else would follow. Apparently not.\nAll of which suggests we are over the fashion-tech PDAs. We\u2019re kind of platonic acquaintances now. Every once in while it\u2019s nice to meet up again and air kiss.\nSo what have we learned from the last five years?\nMaybe that the real future of fashion and technology has nothing to do with screens.\nMaybe that the concept of a \u201chero product\u201d that is so associated with the world of technology doesn\u2019t really work in the context of an industry that already has its own hero products (Hollywood might take note of that one). Indeed, Mr. Dillinger said he was initially quite skeptical about the idea of the Jacquard. \u201cI really value the objects of fashion for being what they are,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s possible we don\u2019t actually want our clothes, or our accessories, to do much more than they already do, which is make us feel good and be tools of self-expression, symbols of membership in a group, clues to aspirations.\nThat\u2019s what the phone did. And, though no one necessarily saw it coming, what AirPods and Vuitton earphones \u2014 which cost almost $1,000, but which, since their introduction in January, have sold three times more than the second-generation LV smartwatch released at the same time, and currently have wait lists \u2014 are doing: acting as visible semaphores of identity.\nAccording to I.D.C., by 2023 \u201cear worn devices\u201d will be the second-largest category of wearables, accounting for 31 percent of the market. (By contrast, it predicts that smartclothes will account for only around 3 percent).\nIn other words, that drumroll in your head? It\u2019s actually hearables. Though personally I like \u201cearwear\u201d better."

        "title": "Why Netflix Won\u2019t Be Part of Apple TV",
        "fulltext": "Apple and Netflix, for better and for worse, have changed how we spend our leisure hours. In the process, the two companies have upended old media habits and created new ones.\nApple\u2019s iPhones have alreadyportedover big portions of people\u2019s brains, and Netflix exploded TV time slots, creating the binge and the endless content screen. Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like \u201cTerrace House\u201d and a Brechtian, mind-bending drama like \u201cRussian Doll\u201d in one place?\nWhile setting the standard in their chosen areas, Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past, for the most part. But that period of peace between the two tech giants is about to change.\nOn Monday, Apple will unveil its most ambitious media project yet \u2014 a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, originalshows and films. And when a tech giant like Apple jumps into entertainment, it\u2019s going to create waves.\nFamous for its teasing product demonstrations, Apple will play host to Hollywood at its Cupertino, Calif., campus so that it can show off what Reese Witherspoon, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg (he of the recentNetflix-films-should-not-get-Oscarsargument) have done with the more than $1 billion the company has laid out for its new ambitions.\nThe amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the $10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than a billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix.\nThe cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple\u2019s iTunes store.\nApple had been charging Netflix 15 percent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store. Now, new subscribers can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device, but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment details. (In the wonky world of internet transactions, where you make the purchase determines how, or if, Apple gets a cut.)\nIn a second sign of frayed relations between the two companies, Netflix has decided to opt out of the Apple bundle, which will upsell subscriptions to HBO and CBS in addition to its original programming. Netflix\u2019s absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed.\nMr. Hastings explained it at a Netflix event earlier this week: \u201cApple\u2019s a great company. We want to have people watch our service \u2014 or our content on our service. And so we\u2019ve chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.\u201d\nThe key word here is \u201cservice.\u201d\nPut it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company\u2019s identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up \u201cStranger Things\u201d or \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d may not be aware that they\u2019re watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data.\nApple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video \u2014 what television is fast becoming \u2014 and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers.\nThe focus on Apple\u2019s programming makes for a tantalizing narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, likethe program set at a morning showstarring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetizer. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple\u2019s shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller.\nBut Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many \u201coriginals,\u201d it doesn\u2019t actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d to cite two examples, are licensed.\nNetflix\u2019s programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn\u2019t a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that\u2019s by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn\u2019t about any particular aesthetic, like HBO\u2019s. It\u2019s a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller \u201cYou\u201d to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show \u201c1983.\u201d\nThe same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels \u2014 like HBO or CBS \u2014 within their platforms.\nNot coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast\u2019s broadband service can spend an extra $5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It\u2019s meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing.\nA nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast \u2014 a competing distributor \u2014 and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorized to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of.\nNetflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation\u2019s largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has97 million, but not all are watching its videos.\nTheir reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than1.4 billiondevices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly.\nIt also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple\u2019s service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet.\nStill, HBO\u2019s inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service \u2014 which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d \u2014 by the end of the year.\nFrom HBO\u2019s perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple\u2019s streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It\u2019s just another sales outlet. Even HBO\u2019s own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to five million. (HBO currently has more than seven million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.)\nBut that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T\u2019s own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros.) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle?\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple is hyping its new service at a time when sales of its most lucrative product, the iPhone, have started to lag. It stopped reporting how many devices it sold as of September. Now, it wants investors to look at another line item \u2014 its foray into the media business, which is stable and steadily growing. Apple hopes it will grow even faster with the help of Hollywood.\nInterestingly, that line item (listed as \u201cServices\u201d on the Apple income statement) was once little more than a balance-sheet curiosity. Now, it\u2019s a $40 billion business. The forthcoming bundle could add more than $12 billion to that, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs.\nFor comparison, the entirety of the Walt Disney Company generated $59 billion in sales last year. CBS, $14 billion. Netflix, $16 billion.\nWithout explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus.\nSo what does mean for everyone else?\nMr. Hastingssaidit best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: \u201cThe game is on.\u201d"

        "title": "New Paid Apple News Service Said to Feature Wall Street Journal",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Wall Street Journal plans to join a new paid subscription news service run by Apple, according to two people familiar with the plans, as other publishers chafe at the terms that the Silicon Valley company is demanding of its partners.\nOther major publishers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have opted out of joining the subscription service, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.\nApple and The Wall Street Journal plan to announce the deal Monday at a media event at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The event is intended to draw attention to the company\u2019s bet on news and entertainment, including a streaming service that willput Apple in direct competitionwith Netflix, Amazon and HBO.\nThe service, described by some as a \u201cNetflix for news,\u201d will offer access to a new paid tier of theApple Newsapp. Through that tier, readers will be able to consume articles from hundreds of participating magazines and news outlets. The app\u2019s free tier will still let people read a smattering of select articles from a wide variety of publishers.\nTo persuade publishers to join the paid service, Apple executives have said the scale of Apple News, which is installed on every iPhone sold to consumers, could introduce millions of new customers to their content.\nBut the most recent terms that Apple is offering to publishers ask for a cut of roughly half of the subscription revenue involved in the service, the people said. Apple has also asked publishers to give unlimited access to all their content, which has caused concern among potential partners, they said. A subscription is expected to cost $10 a month.\nThe deal\u2019s terms have caused some publishers to recoil, as a 50 percent cut is higher than the 30 percent that Apple usually takes from apps and subscriptions sold through its App Store. Publishers are also concerned that they won\u2019t have access to important data about the consumers \u2014 credit cards, email addresses and other subscriber information \u2014 as part of the deal.\nRepresentatives from Apple, The Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post declined to comment. Some deal terms were previously reported byRecodeandThe Wall Street Journal.\nAs sales of Apple\u2019s marquee product, the iPhone, start to slow, the company is expanding into different software-based businesses, which typically have higher profit margins and do not rely on supply chains and manufacturing.\nPublishers have also been seeking to expand beyond their core subscriber bases, finding new audiences across nontraditional platforms and striking deals with tech companies. Apple has teamed up with news organizations on its Apple News product for years, offering select content to consumers for free.\nBut publishers have grown wary of some partnerships in recent years, as past relationships with companies like Facebook, Medium and others have soured. In the past, Facebook has inked deals with publishers to fund or support new initiatives, only to quickly change plans and yank support from one year to the next."

(Any day now!) Enjoy the rest of your weekend.\nMARCH 24-30\nEight members of the Sackler family, owners of the pharmaceutical company that makes the potent (and highly addictive) opioid OxyContin,have been suedfor fraud by New York State. They are accused of hiding profits and siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from their company, Purdue Pharma, into personal offshore accounts while the business was under investigation for its role in stoking the opioid epidemic. Since OxyContin came on the market in 1996,more than 200,000people in the United States have died from overdoses involving prescription opioids, and the Sacklers have become one of the country\u2019s wealthiest families.\nIf you take a Lyft this week, pay attention \u2014 does itfeelany different to use the world\u2019s first publicly traded ride-hailing platform? Perhaps not, but at least you\u2019re both going places. The company made its market debut on Friday,hitting the Nasdaqwith much fanfare at $72 a share. It finished its first day of trading at $78.29 (putting its value at more than $26.4 billion), and its Silicon Valley brethren will be closely watching its progress. A wave of other big tech start-ups \u2014 known as \u201cunicorns\u201d once they cross the threshold of a $1 billion dollar valuation, although these are now technically \u201cdecacorns\u201d \u2014plan to follow in Lyft\u2019s footstepslater this year, including Uber (Lyft\u2019s bigger competitor), Slack, Pinterest and Postmates.\nApple isturning over a new leaf\u2014 or several. The tech company plans this fall to start streaming original programming and shows from partnering networks on an app called Apple TV Plus, intended to rival Netflix and HBO. It\u2019s also rolling out a news service that charges users $10 a month to access over 300 different publications, some of which charge subscription fees otherwise. Plus, it\u2019s introducing more games. And \u2014 why not? \u2014 a credit card with Goldman Sachs. It\u2019s all part of a larger plan to diversify beyond hardware products like iPhones, whichhaven\u2019t been bringing in as much revenue lately.\nMARCH 31-APRIL 6\nWhat\u2019s to become of Brexit? As its original deadline of March 29 came and went, Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union isa bigger mess than ever. TheBritish Parliament rejectedPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s last-ditch effort to pass her plan on Friday, even when she played her final bargaining chip \u2014 her own seat, which she offered to give up if opposing lawmakers would agree to the deal. That wasn\u2019t enough. Now, Britain is lurching toward a potential \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit on April 12. That could have catastrophic consequences for its economy and send shock waves through Europe and beyond.\nLook out for more definitive news about what may have caused the two deadly Boeing 737 Max plane crashes, and what Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority plan to do about it. Investigatorsreached a preliminary conclusionon Thursday that a glitchy system kicked in right before the Ethiopian Airlines flight went down earlier this month. Boeinghas proposedupdating the software and making other changes to the planes, which have been grounded for more than two weeks. The fixes would give pilots more control over the flight system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data. Boeing didn\u2019t provide a timeline for carrying out the fixes, since it needs the F.A.A. \u2014 also under intense scrutiny over its certification of the jet \u2014 to give its blessing first.\nIf you\u2019re sick of the trade war between the United States and China, imagine how the negotiators on both sides feel at this point. Chinese officials willfly back to Washingtonthis week to continue talks, just days after American representatives visited Beijing. But the needle is moving on one major sticking point: intellectual property. American companies have complained of pressure to share their proprietary technology as a condition of working with Chinese business partners, only to see that technology adopted by Chinese competitors. As part of a trade deal, the United States wants to put a lid on this practice, and officials say thatprogress is finally being made.\nFacebook has been accused ofcausing housing discriminationby allowing advertisers to target ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. Separately, the platform announced aban on all white nationalist contentafter a New Zealand gunman used social media to post live video of his attacks on two mosques. In other news, Wow Air, an Icelandic budget airline,ceased operations with no warning on Thursday, leaving passengers stranded.
